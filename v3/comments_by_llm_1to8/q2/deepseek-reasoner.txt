  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Conceptual Repricing closure lands effectively as Aris recognizes "the drama she had tried to strip away was never needless; it was the point." The accumulative structure builds through dust patterns → butterfly wing → understanding of "beautiful, silent action of decay," with visible emotional cost in her shifted stance from researcher to "element within."

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from personal loss through frost-pattern discovery to inherited mission, with each revelation deepening stakes. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara accepts her role as "keeper of the pauses," transforming her furnace's purpose from beauty to survival—a clear before/after with the cost of abandoning her original art.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as Elara's methodical exploration builds to the Bloom's healing, with thermal patterns and tuning fork resonances creating density. The closure—restoring the Bloom through finding its "true note"—shows Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (hours of aching effort). Minor deduction for the cost being more told ("aching with cold and effort") than viscerally embodied in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from package arrival through research, restoration, signal, and descent to the underwater library. The closure—Silas understanding this as homecoming rather than rescue—lands with conceptual cost as he accepts his grandfather's fate and his own role. The Resonant Reconfiguration transforms the distress signal into an invitation, reweighting the entire journey.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building from deprivation through mysterious donations to the bell's discovery and final declaration. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's declaration that transforms the donations from charity to "partnership." Cost is felt in the community's sustained suffering and the risk Elara takes. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the final "connection" rather than a more concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration: Elara transforms from seeking stored love to becoming its vessel, with the pearl's dissolution as visible cost. The past-life memory anchors motivation early and pays off through integration rather than wound, creating coherent causality that tightens toward the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the temporal trap serving as the decisive intensification. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara gains the knowledge she sought but at the cost of experiencing time's fragility firsthand. The hyperbolic geometry solution provides causal linkage within the textural framework.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with escalating pressure through key-sorting, militia arrival, and the door mechanism creating a resonant reconfiguration—Elara trapped but protecting the seeds. The cost is visible: her freedom exchanged for the vault's safety ("Her own prison was now the vault's protection"). The cryptic "heard not seen" setup pays off through the mental arrangement of keys as silent music.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with sensory layering building to Aris's realization that wounds need witnessing, not fixing—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear emotional cost. The grandfather's betrayal anchors causality throughout, and the final ascent reweights the entire quest from cure to acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure achieves a Decisive Change with visible cost - Elara sacrifices her client relationship and uses her most precious tool. The causal chain from commission to realization to rebellion holds cleanly, with the photograph's redirection creating clear before/after stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through glass-craft parallels to emotional thaw, culminating in Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara places the bookmark and abandons "icy armor" with visible cost ("ready to feel the sun's warmth directly, without filter"). The ice-sheet crash provides external catalyst that reframes the bookmark from ruin to loved artifact. Slight deduction for marginally abstract final lines about "occupied by a future."

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong causal drive where discovery of court document → finding shell → decrypting cast → reclaiming identity, with clear Decisive Change as Leo confronts Marcus armed with truth rather than fleeing. Cost is visible in trembling hands accepting fear as strength. Slight deduction for compressed middle beats that could use one more concrete step between shell discovery and cast decryption.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - the Oracle completes her life's work as dawn erases what she preserved, creating visible cost in the contrast. The accumulative structure coheres well with density increasing toward the "marbled hush" that signals the night's end, and orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Conceptual Repricing closure—that thoughts emerge through the act of wondering itself—lands with clear conceptual cost as Unit 734 understands its own decommissioning arose from that first unbidden thought. The accumulative structure coheres as temporal layers collapse into "one singular, stable present," though the orientation could anchor more quickly (robot's nature revealed late in first paragraph).

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from lens discovery through doodle interpretation to reconciliation attempt, with clear on-page closure (mistrust thawing). The "silence as bridge" reconfiguration lands with emotional cost. Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words. Minor weakness: the revelation mechanism (lens + doodles = hornet pattern) strains plausibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong resonant reconfiguration: the garden's shuddering recognition transforms the entire premise from luck-measurement to relationship. Cost is visible through "thorn-scars," "withered," and the years of failed cultivation. The "mended deception" reveals itself as earned truth. Slight dock for the official's convenient arrival timing.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece achieves a Conceptual Repricing where Elara discovers "temporal coexistence" with visible dedication and years of preparation as cost. The accumulative structure coheres well, building from quiet corridors through technical preparation to the revelation of "time forever in flight."

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the realization that the code is "not to be broken, but a connection to be made" transforms meaning with visible cost (the ghostly face appearing and vanishing). The orientation anchors (flooded opera house, cellist, ghost's code) establish cleanly by ~100 words. The closure lands with both conceptual repricing and felt cost through the spectral appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal linkage from fever → unverified knowledge → sensor failure → backup system discovery → emergency alert. Closure lands with visible cost ("grieved for the valley below"). The "weight" metaphor pays off throughout. Minor gap: the flood's actual arrival isn't shown, though the alert transmission provides sufficient closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from radio confession → tunnel exploration → valve discovery → release/absolution, with the Resonant Reconfiguration landing powerfully as "the immense, quiet burden of absolution." The cost is felt through Leo's physical exhaustion and the weight of truth he now carries. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the radio's temporal nature.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - the Keeper's return to witnessing after confronting the existential wound reweights his purpose with new understanding. The cost is legible in "feeling the library's pain as his own" and the integration of trauma into chronicles. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through the journey's layers.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Leo speaks, connecting the hair curl to the eclipse's corona - a genuine conceptual repricing with visible cost (his tear). The accumulative structure builds through music, eclipse, and tactile memory to this earned moment. Slight deduction for the convenient eclipse timing and some predictability in the therapeutic breakthrough pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively through diary fragments to tapestry to revelation, landing a strong Conceptual Repricing where humanity's amnesia is diagnosed. The cost—species-wide catatonia—is conceptually clear though more felt immediacy would strengthen it. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal drive lens with clear because/therefore linkage from fortune cookie to lighthouse meeting, culminating in a Decisive Change where Leo accepts the conductor role. The accidentally prophetic cookie creating the very meeting it describes provides elegant circular causality with visible cost in his "old life receding."

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where integration replaces exclusion, with visible cost ("It was agony") and conceptual reweighting of the entire premise. The accumulative lens holds consistently through sonic layering and color symbolism that builds toward the final harmonious understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara achieves her purpose then enters Earned Stasis, the homesickness replaced by "profound arrival." Cost is visible in exhaustion and the irretrievable nature of the moment. The grandfather memory and nautilus shell create effective because/therefore linkage to the climactic conducting.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elara's first grounding in "living memory," with the labyrinth dissolving into clarity. The cyclical structure teaches its pattern early and pays off through procedural generation creating unique paths from past failures. Cost is legible in the acceptance of ordinariness and the permanent end of the cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara transforms silence from "emptiness" to "profound and resonant peace," with felt cost in her physical exhaustion and emotional release. The accumulative structure builds through sensory layers (forest, waterfall, cavern, drum) toward this reconfiguration. Orientation anchored early with "deaf music teacher" and "small, sunlit studio."

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal drive: being followed → receiving message → lateral investigation → sending proof. Closure lands as Charged Poise with Elara crystallizing her stance by releasing evidence into danger, cost visible in the risk taken. The "lateral" investigation method pays off through cross-referenced data revealing the truth. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the quarantine's significance.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.1)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elara's seal-breaking as shared understanding, with emotional cost visible in tears and trembling. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the scent revelation that reweights her relationship to preserved memory. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Slight deduction as the cost, while felt, could be more precisely articulated beyond emotional release.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kael's choice to unmake the pattern forecloses his life's desire with visible cost ("quiet, profound sadness").

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through silence motifs building to the resonant reconfiguration when life responds to her adapted song. The cost is visible in the transformation from fighting to honoring silence. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Decisive Change as Elara literally absorbs the client's fabricated memory, transforming from emotion dealer to emotion bearer with clear cost ("beautiful, heartbreaking phantom pain"). The causal lens holds cleanly: creating the scent → static charge intensifies → forced empathy bridge → absorption decision, with each beat following because/therefore logic.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from concert through letter attempts to unexpected connection with Henry. The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration where intended recognition transforms into mutual comfort, with visible emotional cost in both characters' losses. The mistaken address functions as meaningful complication rather than convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and community bonds deepen toward Elara's final act of weaving the luminescent sculpture. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when she creates "a collaboration across distance" that transforms both the arbor and the community's understanding. Cost is visible in her dedication of "hands and art" and the trust she bears. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Elara discovers the moth exists only in "pristine silence where an echo is first born," reweighting her quest from seeking a place to creating conditions. The cost appears as borrowed time from the giant's finite nap, though this could be more visceral. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through the ritual's failure to find her brother, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara reinterprets the mosaic's damage as a record of love rather than absence. The cost is visible in her "wave of despair" and the acceptance that "the ambiguous loss remained, a variable that could never be solved."

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as details accrue toward Silas's transformation from passive observer to active "hand that offers the book." The Ms. Gable tape fragment triggers a decisive change that reweights his purpose with visible cost (his treasured invisibility). Closure lands with him accepting his role as "kindly ghost in the machine," paying the price of never being seen for his kindness.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly as Elara shifts from curator to participant, with the cost visible in her surrender of control and academic distance. The accumulative structure coheres well—each observation about the garden's resilience builds toward her recognition that "she was being built into something new." The orientation anchors (nursery owner, storm season, trellis repair) establish clearly within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's shift from isolation to convergence-painting carries clear emotional cost ("first true quiet in her mind"). The accumulative structure builds through rain→discovery→vision→exchange→transformed art with each layer deepening the dominant stake. The cost is felt in "weary grief across the centuries" and the permanence of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through crystal resonance, shadow convergence, and the pearl's transformation to a Resonant Reconfiguration where consciousness inhabits small moments. The cost is legible: Elara's clairvoyance is "forever altered" as she trades future-sight for present awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught methodology ("research through staggered intervals, moving from the recent past backward") that pays off when the valve's investigation reveals Elara's own exile. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost—the *Sea-Scribe*'s failure enabled her freedom, creating a "paradox: a warning that became a welcome." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkages from following arrows to finding the punch to paying the price. Closure lands as a Decisive Change when Elara speaks her truth and gains passage, with visible cost in surrendering her unspoken secret. The orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two, though the transition from city to mystical realm could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transforms from cataloging to answering her uncle's cosmic plea, with visible cost in accepting the impossible. The accumulative/textural lens holds as memories and sensations build toward the final "chorus echoing into the night, finally heard." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established within first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story delivers a Conceptual Repricing where Eliana discovers goodbye is "not an end, but a transformation, a returning," with clear cost in her role as eternal witness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and cosmic imagery build toward this reweighting of her existence, though the revelation could land with more visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara accepts the "beautiful con" and commits to protecting it, with clear cost (abandoning rigid moral calculus). The accumulative/textural lens holds as each ink drop reveals deeper truth, building to conceptual repricing of fairness. Orientation anchors clearly (funeral home, Elara, Silas). Minor deduction for slight expository weight in paragraph 5.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara discovers she's not just recording but refracting time itself. The closure lands with "profound sense of peace" as she completes "another captured texture," showing earned transformation. Minor deduction for the cost being primarily revelatory rather than sacrificial—she gains ability without clear loss.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered stories culminating in the poison discovery that reweights everything. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as K transforms from passive collector to active justice-seeker, with clear cost in remaining nameless. The piece teaches its pattern early (collecting/layering fragments) and pays it off when K assembles the poison narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details (hum, dust motes, blue light) build toward Elara's Conceptual Repricing that "the universe was singing, but only if you built an instrument to hear it," with cost visible in abandoning both grandfather's and father's incomplete approaches. The closure lands through her decision to finish the cello and play, transforming from observer to participant, though the middle vision sequence briefly risks abstraction before grounding in concrete objects.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the community adapts on its own terms, with the foundation stone chip and mural codifying this transformation. The hybrid lens holds as causal moves (graffiti instructions, stall relocations) accumulate toward textural reconfiguration. Cost is visible in Hem's displacement and Lyra's permanent bridge role.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's final photograph bridging two extinct worlds, with visible cost in her physical endurance and the imminent erasure by miners. The accumulative structure builds from routine survey to cosmic alarm clock to shared memorial, each discovery tightening the stakes. The closure lands with "she carried a last, precious photograph for two species"—reweighting her initial mission with expanded meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change with the drone's successful repair and departure, showing clear cost in the three-hour deadline pressure. Causal chain from diagnosis through water refraction to bypass solution is solid. Deduction for the somewhat mechanical resolution that lacks deeper emotional or thematic cost beyond professional success.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through condensation patterns, black ice convergence, and the frozen city revelation to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara becomes herald rather than finder. The cost is legible: she abandons her quest's original terms to serve a larger purpose, with "the world waking from its long hold" crystallizing the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the town's "luminous echoes" manifest through Elara's rhythmic invocation, with clear cost implied in "briefly, whole again."

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with effective Resonant Reconfiguration closure where truth-telling banishes the lie-feeding entity. The lattice transforms from confessional tool to containment device, creating meaningful cost. Orientation anchors establish lighthouse prison setting early. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution mechanism where speaking truth directly defeats the entity.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ghostly visits build toward resonant awakening, with the bead serving as decisive catalyst. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration when Leo's recovered memory transforms him from reluctant steward to purposeful healer with "warm weight of the carved stone bead." Cost is visible in Elara's dissolution and the permanent burden of "work, and his memory" in endless night. Minor orientation wobble with "lifetimes ago" revelation could be clearer earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the labyrinth transforms from ruin to "testament of care" with water as proof. The sleepwalking sequence builds density effectively, and the sewing-as-repair accumulates pressure toward the dawn revelation. Cost is visible in both physical exhaustion and the acceptance that wholeness requires integrating damage.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara discovers the scrolls—her interrupted journey transforms into completion and new beginning, with clear emotional cost in the "trembling hands" and earned peace.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands with a Decisive Change—the coup is prevented through Elara's action. The causal chain from discovering the lie in the threads to reaching the Western Gate holds well. Cost is visible: she abandons her sanctuary and risks being seen as mad. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution with the young guard's instant understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the condensation message creates a crystallized moment where forgiveness becomes visible and options reconfigure.

    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the light installation that reweights the ruined orchard's meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara realizes "joy was not lost; she had simply needed to learn how to see in the dark" with visible emotional cost in the crowd's response. The knowledge network functions as a crucial turn that bridges discovery to creation.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal closure with Decisive Change—Elara transforms from restorer to heir, completing the creator's hidden design. The nested awakenings structure (sound awakening garden, vision awakening understanding) creates clear before/after with visible cost. Who/where/when anchored early. The because/therefore linkage from fractured sculpture to final symphony restoration is elegant, though the vision sequence risks convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal drive: thought-tax leads to secret language development, which leads to garden-code system, which leads to detection and necessary destruction. The closure lands with Earned Stasis—Lysander's imprisonment that paradoxically spreads the rebellion shows clear cost and reconfiguration. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure—Elara completes her poem, transforming the wind's dissonance into peace, then finally sleeps (Decisive Change with visible cost: her exhaustion). The "blossom of pure white light" provides resonant reconfiguration. Slight deduction for the convenience of immediate universal effect upon completion.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's accidental discovery transforms her role and the library's function, with clear cost in the cracked bamboo's deterioration and her emotional journey from despair to "profound peace." The accumulative structure builds coherently through sensory details toward this reconfiguration, though the discovery mechanism (humming spontaneously works) feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from failed attempts → new method → successful decipherment, with clear Decisive Change when the text "unsnarls" and reveals its symphonic truth. The cost is present but understated - her isolation and dismissed work are mentioned but not fully felt in the final reconciliation moment. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal drive with clear DC: Elara chooses a machinist's solution over Kael's destructive path, paying the cost of defying her mentor while risking the mountain's stability. The encrypted warning creates legitimate pressure that forces stance crystallization, and the "harmonious hum" confirms the decisive change landed with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from the meteorite's arrival through investigation to final action, with Elara's decision to trust again forming a decisive change with emotional cost. However, the geologist's backstory and corporate conspiracy feel slightly underdeveloped for the weight they carry in motivating the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the prism terrace serving as a pivotal transformation point. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the revelation that sacred thresholds were Leo's creation, with visible cost in the "fractured world waiting beyond." The causality from logbook to grain-map to safe passage holds well, though the fantastical shift could use slightly more grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the fireflies transforming Elara's relationship to both trauma and place - "the burnt feather now just a relic, not a chain." The accumulative lens holds as imagery builds toward this reconfiguration. Cost is felt in the acceptance of coexistence with loss. Slight deduction for the somewhat explicit final paragraph stating rather than showing the rhythm discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Conceptual Repricing lands with clarity: paths disappear because "their truth is too complex for simple recollection." The accumulative structure builds through memory-threads, emotional glyphs, and the seedling's transformation, though the captain's story resolution feels somewhat predetermined rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the harmonious fifth interval replaces competitive checkmate, with clear cost (abandoned victory) visible in "Checkmate was forgotten." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as each chess move layers sound until the final harmonic resolution reweights the entire performance from game to duet. Orientation anchors (arcade, evening, street performer) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the tattoo ritual building density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transforms from exile to "portable eternity." The closure lands with visible cost (pain, exile, moonstone's irreplaceable nature) and conceptual cost (permanent bodily inscription of outlawed memory). The piece teaches its pattern early through gaps/silences as lexicon and pays off with the living constellation map.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elian recognizes his private rituals as preparation for public service, with the lighthouse lens crystallizing this connection. The accumulative structure builds from ripples to prism to final light explosion, and the cost is felt in his acceptance of responsibility ("The new light would be lit today").

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the ritual of releasing ashes, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara becomes "fluent translator" of darkness. Cost is legible in "the weight of that exchange was a stone in her chest" and the transformation from believing she could "always win" to understanding "some things are meant to be saved only as memory."

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from failed equations through water-drop correlation to final synthesis. The closure lands as Decisive Change - hope transforms from unsolvable constant to emergent property created through pattern-weaving. Cost is visible in the "fraying world" that required this intervention, and the "fierce, quiet joy" shows emotional price of the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    Decisive Change lands with visible cost: Elara accepts the burden of carrying another's legacy, transforming from observer to keeper. The causal chain from diary discovery through acoustic clues to hidden negative holds firmly, with the final image reweighting her role from cartographer to memory-bearer.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the mirror's brief transformation validates Elara's obsession, with the cost visible in the heartbeat's departure and her breathlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration landing through the harvest of echoes that transforms Elara from "pale and compliant" thread to "blazing with brilliant, defiant gold." Cost is legible in the foreclosure of her previous identity. The prism sanctuary sequence effectively deepens stakes through accumulation of sensory echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's discovery of the story stick reverses her thinking from presenting truth to creating space for listeners' truths, with the cost being her abandonment of defensive certainty. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details (dome, stick, puppet shows) build toward this conceptual shift, though the connection between calligraphy and puppet shows could be more causally tight.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara's intervention becomes another "transient root" in the grotto, transforming from observer to active participant with the cost of her role as pure witness sacrificed. The rock crack serves as the decisive disruption that forces this shift. Early orientation is clean (grotto, sunset, monarch migration established by line 3), and the closure lands with felt cost as she acknowledges her intervention "would never be recorded."

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through wax model → rope reconfiguration → bronze casting, with the closure delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration where forgotten names gain voice through metal and light.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly—the dream transforms from prisoner to tenant, with the broken sextant's collapse marking irreversible change. Under the Accumulative lens, density builds through frost/glass/breath patterns toward this crystallization, though the conceptual cost of housing this alien beauty remains somewhat abstract rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through the quartz pendulum's fractured rainbows, transforming loss into multiplicative possibility with clear cost (workshop destroyed, Guild severed). The accumulative lens holds as objects accumulate meaning—ribbon transforms from memory to tool, quartz from precision instrument to prismatic possibility. Minor orientation wobble with "that ribbon a ghost" creates momentary pronoun confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's choice to eat the fruit transforms her understanding, with the cameo finally showing her profile as cost/proof of change.

    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's role transforms from keeper to participant with clear cost ("her own life was the ink"). The accumulative structure coheres through ritual repetition and imagery. The vision sequence briefly disrupts the present-frame immediacy but pays off at closure where "haunted euphoria would be her constant companion."

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transforms from distributing goods to "distributing grace," with felt cost in abandoning her ghost-like pattern. The accumulative/textural lens holds as rumor chains, moon rock rituals, and shared stories build density toward the final image of "cosmic connection." The shift from isolation to communion lands with earned emotional weight through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: the compass needle pointing to her heart transforms the dead weight into active self-navigation, with clear cost (the journey through ultrasonic discomfort). The accumulative structure coheres as musical notes build to the stillpoint revelation. Slight deduction for the marginally abstract "internal compass now true" rather than showing its immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal chain from failure→signal→discovery→resolution with visible cost (accepting uncertainty over certainty). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the pen's true purpose reframes both his mistake and mentor's foresight. Orientation anchored early with who/where/when established in opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through the camera's clicking metronome and silence-to-music mapping. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara transforms chaos into "a single, clear, piercing note" that silences the boat, with cost shown through grandfather's departure. The "secret joy for a world that would never know" crystallizes the bittersweet price of her gift.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear causal chain from arson to archive discovery to public revelation. The closure (Decisive Change from secrecy to sharing) lands with emotional cost in "tender, breaking thing." Orientation anchors who/where/when early. The promise motif threads through and reweights at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael manifests then dissolves - "the sorrow remained, but it was no longer heavy." The transformation from heavy to light sorrow shows clear cost and change. Who/where/when anchored early through Sound Wave Garden setting. Slight deduction as the exact nature of the entanglement could be clearer earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara's whispered query wins the AI's attention while the security chief's shouts fail, proving her thesis with visible cost (the risk of the challenge). Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly by ~100 words. The closure lands with earned triumph as the hidden panel reveals the superior map.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based closure through the light-weaving system. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Elian creates his own pattern, showing mastery and connection. Cost is visible in "arms ached but spirit was light" and the foreclosed path of silence-as-cage. Some causality softness in how quickly Elian masters the complex rope system.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Leo's shift from resignation to possibility, with visible cost in Mr. Aris's week-long effort and emotional investment ("surge of emotion he had not felt in decades"). The causal chain from chess lesson to town-wide demonstration to breakthrough is clear. However, the transformation feels slightly neat - Leo's epiphany arrives without significant resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern intensification (whale song, island manifestation, transformation) leading to a Decisive Change with visible cost. The transformation from human to whale lands on-page with Arden releasing "his name, his history, his quiet anger" before being absorbed. Orientation anchors effectively by ~120 words, and the mystical premise pays off through consistent world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the turbines' stillness transforms the "remade hush" from cage to blanket, with visible emotional cost in the tear and the fragile monument. The accumulative lens holds consistently through repetitive actions building to pattern break, and the "chosen" versus "imposed" quiet reweights the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure coheres beautifully—each sensory layer (hum→vibration→dissolution→crystallization) deepens stakes toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's purpose "crystallizes" through literal merger with stone. The cost is legible in her leaving the poem behind, transforming from seeker to vessel. Orientation anchors cleanly (character, location, temporal marker established immediately).

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story delivers a Decisive Change when Elian gains color vision through the glass rose's awakening, with clear cost (trading his unique gift for a single imperfect leaf). The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and craft descriptions build toward the transformative moment. Causality tracks cleanly from proposal through plant-weaving to musical awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong resonant reconfiguration: Elara's transformation from sound-maker to sound-gatherer reweights the entire premise with visible cost (abandoning her life's work). The lens literally and metaphorically focuses the shift. Who/where/when anchored early, accumulative progression holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara shifts from preserving death to "illuminating transformation," with visible cost in the year of paralysis paid. The accumulative structure through coordinates and crane deliveries builds effectively. Minor deduction for slight convenience in Lyra's disappearance and the somewhat abstract "curtains of intention" metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern discovery building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts her role as "keeper of a map." The cost is legible in foreclosed scholarly detachment ("no longer just a cartomancer"). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words, causality holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully—the Khelathrans' willing dissolution into atomized emotion reweights everything, with clear cost in Elara's transformation from objective historian to "keeper of the song." The accumulative lens holds consistently through sensory density and pattern-breaking navigation, though orientation takes slightly long to establish the archive's reactive nature (~150 words).

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the shadow's return and the stone's transformation crystallize Elara's ability to reverse collective complacency, with visible cost in her "peculiar draining." The piece teaches its pattern early (dream-sharing's consequences) and pays it off through the shadow's manifestation. Orientation anchors land cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elara's act of reconstructing both tail and principles, with visible cost in her acceptance of blame for Pascal's injury. The accumulative structure coheres as layers of meaning build toward "weaving them together into a stronger whole," though the metaphor of shedding/reconstruction occasionally strains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    The accumulative structure coheres beautifully—each element (surgery aftermath, plant telepathy, coffee rings, tunnel discovery) builds toward the resonant reconfiguration where scars become "topography." The closure lands with felt cost as Elara must share her painful story to give the miracle purpose. The frosted hourglass turning over provides perfect symbolic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong causal structure with clear closure - the delivery of the long-delayed message creates a Decisive Change with visible emotional cost ("single tear"). The revelation that love is "stored in the act of creation" reweights the opening quest. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Elara's shift from seeking to embodying stardust lands with clear conceptual cost (surrendering the chase). The vision sequence delivers decisive change through concrete imagery rather than exposition. Orientation anchors solidly by paragraph two, and the final painting scene pays off the setup with visible transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's empty mind transforms from void to "neutral vessel" capable of holding chaos—a conceptual repricing with clear cost ("billion lives lived in a blink"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the final image of the "architect of dreams," though the middle section briefly abstracts into summary of sorted timelines.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Elara's final translocation reweights the mechanical forest as "nursery" rather than prison, with visible cost of leaving physical form behind. The gear discovery, temple unraveling, and final crossing create meaningful deepening. Slight deduction for the explanatory paragraph about "probable miracle" that briefly tells rather than dramatizes the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with "he had found where his own unused courage waited: right here, within him, all along." The cost is visible in the exhausting climb and the foreclosure of his former self. The accumulative lens holds as each symbolic passage (water crossing, vigil, climb) layers meaning toward this crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building from sterile safety through hidden truth to "frostbitten hope." The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara and Leo's shared smile crystallizes their choice to remember despite the Fortress's imposed silence, with clear cost implied in "They would remain." The grandfather's journal provides the conceptual repricing that "Safety is an illusion purchased with freedom," though the immediate stakes of their choice could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with clear closure through Decisive Change - the pretender's unmasking via the rune of drift. The cost is visible in the pretender's public humiliation and loss of power. Causality holds as Elara's centuries of research lead to finding the exact rune needed. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the "reaching across distance" mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration achieved through Kael's transformation into "keeper of the ledger" - the cost manifests in "profound, quiet heaviness" and the shift from discovery to testament. The accumulative structure coheres well with progressive revelations building to the final reconfiguration. Slight weakness in the middle section where the discovery process could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the cosmic vision reweights the rebellion's meaning from anger to awe. The accumulative build through ritual, hum, and revelation coheres well. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "truth" revealed, though "a jewel worth protecting" provides specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the telepathic decoding sequence, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the embryo's awakening creates "not a return to the past" but "a new branch, a new possibility." The cost is legible: Elara commits her remaining life ("as long as she drew breath") to an act of defiance that could bring council punishment. The closure lands with both felt weight and conceptual repricing of what "evolution with intent" means.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara moves from frozen trauma to "planting" despite darkness, with visible cost in the "settled weight" of the photograph. The pearl metaphor transforms from abstract wisdom to concrete survival technique. Slight deduction for the cost being more implied than viscerally felt in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as Elara transforms from victim to "archivist of ruin," with the cost visible in accepting permanent fragmentation: "It didn't need to be whole to be true." The accumulative structure coheres through the tarot assembly sequence building to synthesis rather than salvation.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure builds from eclipse observation through ink experiment to conceptual understanding, landing a Conceptual Repricing where Elara realizes consciousness creates the illusion of time dilation—"a beautiful, terrible lie of consciousness." The cost manifests as she abandons her quest and tools, choosing dissolution over futile measurement. Who/where/when anchored cleanly by line three.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara seeds doubt rather than starts war. The closure lands with visible cost ("her own truth now another piece of contraband") and the final image of imperceptible thawing reweights the opening's "perpetual frost." Causality holds as discovery leads to internal conflict then decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the soldier's acceptance of stillness and Elara's "good harvest" reweight the opening's isolation into productive connection. Cost is visible in the soldier's surrender of his weapon and warrior identity. Deduction for slightly rushed pacing in the soldier's arrival and transformation sequence, though the thematic throughline of "weaving continuity through chaos" lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught elements (sound wave garden, sleepwalking constellations) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kaelen captures the echo through silence. The cost is legible: "he felt the goddess's immense sorrow, a weight that could crush a star." The piece teaches its world rules early and pays them off at closure with the iron becoming warm and holding "a single, perfect note of grace."

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal drive from journalist's question → logical exercise → discovery → action, with the proof by contradiction method creating a decisive change when Elara shifts from observer to actor. Closure lands with visible cost as she dismantles her inheritance "one truthful sentence at a time," though the cost could be more sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the amber becomes a "data sink" that transforms from comfort object to prison to peace. The cyclical structure (Alistair's failure → corrupted code → Elara's inheritance → breaking the loop) lands with visible cost. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The "time folds in on itself" metaphor effectively frames the collapsed causality.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the mandala's construction building density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when the tile's note transforms conflict into understanding. The closure lands with conceptual cost as the Unlearning shifts from "ending" to "first line of a new drawing," showing meaningful reweighting. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly (Elara, Whispering Grotto, during the Unlearning). The transformation of the arguing strangers through pattern recognition creates legitimate before/after change.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear Decisive Change when Elara refuses orders and renames the sector to protect the family, with visible cost in defying authority. The retrocognitive vision causally drives this transformation, and the piece teaches its speculative element early enough to integrate naturally. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the family's presence (they appear abruptly mid-story).

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's release transforms from endless repetition to acknowledged completion, with visible cost (her fading). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory echoes build toward connection. Orientation anchors establish quickly (hedge maze, after closing, ghost and visitor).

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building from static shock through pill ingestion to somatic memory to artistic breakthrough. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where memory architecture becomes visible art. Cost is subtly present in the "fragile and transparent yet strong" hope but could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transforms from mapper to chronicler, with the fossil as partner creating visible cost (the "weight of the leaf in her pack a solemn promise"). The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through density increases and the final cadence shift. The closure lands with both felt cost (bearing the planet's grief) and conceptual repricing of her role.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from individual button-collecting to pattern recognition to systemic reversal. The closure—flipping the hourglass to make sand flow upward using accumulated possibility—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (all the unmade choices become fuel). The piece teaches its metaphysical logic early and pays it off, though the mechanism of how buttons become light could be slightly clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transforms from "burned spy" to "weapon reforged" with the phoenix symbolism charging the closure. The causal chain from mission→discovery→revelation→confrontation→choice holds firmly. Cost is visible in her raised empty hands and the risk of trusting again. Slight deduction for the commander's message feeling slightly convenient in its timing and preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from rain-ticking to river-listening to story-returning, with the palimpsest metaphor organizing the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure with clear closure—Aris's understanding transforms into physical creation that heals the temporal fractures. The cost is legible in Elian's sacrifice and the land's sustained trauma. Orientation anchors (potter, oasis, search) establish cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through rhythmic gardening actions toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the gauge tooth becomes a light-planter. The rose petal's fall triggers purposeful action that reweights loss into creation, with cost visible in "her sadness for the beautiful, fleeting thing."

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong causal chain from isolation through discovery to transformation, with the sundial revelation serving as decisive change that reweights the entire premise. The cost is legible in Lyra's acceptance of leaving the known world behind. The lens holds consistently throughout with clear because/therefore linkages.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building from rain-cleansed temple to public communion. The nest discovery provides the crucial turn, and closure lands with visible transformation - Elara shifts from ghostwriter to "architect of connection." Cost is legible in her vulnerability of making secrets public.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal lens holds: the alien signal causes division, Elara discovers its subsonic manipulation, therefore she creates a counter-frequency that dissolves the threat. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—the town's artificial division breaks, Elara's hope solidifies, and she accepts future vigilance as cost. The "balanced equation" she recalibrates satisfies closure requirements with visible relief in the town and her earned smile.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain: compass triggers organ sound → sound etches blueprint → blueprint reveals lock mechanism → compass becomes key → lens projects lost knowledge. The closure delivers a Decisive Change with clear cost (centuries of lost knowledge recovered through precise action). Minor orientation wobble with "shadowed nexus under starlight" but recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through drawing that culminates in the twin revelation and empathy awakening. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara's emotional numbness transforms into "devastating wave of feeling," with visible cost in her slow packing and the "verdict" of sunlight. The twin deduction feels slightly convenient without more groundwork, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal structure with clear Decisive Change—the captain's exile is literally reversed through ritual action with the copper nail as anchor. The closure lands with visible cost (the aching peace, the world still broken but beginning to heal). Who/where/when anchored early and the drive lens (Causal) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through vanishing→ruined photo→fiddler's wisdom→new understanding, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transforms loss into art. The closure lands with conceptual cost: she forgoes solving the mystery to create something greater. The "scaffold wrap" metaphor effectively teaches how to read absence.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Leo's refusal to inherit his father's path, walking "in a straight line" with visible cost (leaving the money, abandoning his quest). The accumulative lens holds through pattern-building (circles, failed ventures, inherited violence) though the thematic articulation in paragraph 5 ("Paths circle back because we insist on walking them") veers toward explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from telegram to resolution with clear Decisive Change - Elara transforms from observer to active participant, saving lives. The astronomical discovery creates legitimate because/therefore linkage. Cost is visible in breaking her observer role and the weeks of waiting. Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern intensification through expanding circles of devastation leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transforms the seed's purpose.

Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's binding transforms from "chains" to "threads in a grand tapestry," making visible cost through her permanent rootedness. The pattern of linking scars builds coherently to this reconfiguration, with the "anxious elation" settling into "quiet, potent joy" marking the decisive shift.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkages from failed bargain to quest to confrontation to resolution. Closure lands as a Decisive Change where Elara's selfless offering heals the wound, with cost visible in surrendering her memories of her brother. However, the resolution feels slightly convenient—the entity's sudden vulnerability to selflessness lacks sufficient groundwork, and the mechanical unwinding of the nexus reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with the package arrival triggering reflection that leads to decisive action—Leo choosing to re-engage with music production. The closure lands with visible cost (acknowledging "the most important work often happened after the applause"), though the final beat could strengthen its on-page consequence beyond the browser search.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elian shifts from forcing understanding to nurturing it organically—a meaningful change with visible cost (decade of work in ruins, haunted ambition). The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward this realization. The orientation anchors clearly (magnetic arbor, after spirit's departure), and the seed's transformation from gift to planted potential creates satisfying structural resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with the smelting ritual serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration that transforms raw memory into preserved essence. The cost is visible in the dissolution of the physical creel and the violent-made-serene breaking down process. Orientation anchors cleanly establish the tidal atrium setting and the librarian's role within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Silas shifts from certifying isolation to dissolving emotional walls, crystallized in the crowning gesture. The cost is felt through the builders' confessed regrets and Silas's "trembling hand." Causal lens holds throughout with the pearl/conch mechanism driving the transformation. Slight deduction for the somewhat abrupt final insight, though it's prepared by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly - from solitary descent to "shared, anonymous courage" with visible cost in the ragged sob and years of silence broken. The accumulative lens holds as coordinates accumulate meaning until the accordion's wheeze crystallizes transformation. Orientation anchors early (railway station, river chronicler).

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where "The Dreamer has become the Librarian" reweights the entire journey with visible cost (the watch stilling, permanent guardianship accepted).

The cost is legible in accepting eternal custodianship of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change closure: Elara transforms from authenticator to liberator, freeing the violin at personal cost (abandoning her quiet dream). The causal chain holds firmly from assignment through vision to action, with the violin's softening edges confirming irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the captured memory transforms both the corpse (ghost of a smile) and Elara (finding sustaining stillness). The cost is visible in Elara being "hollowed out" and the emerald turning "dull, opaque grey." The accumulative structure coheres well, though the orientation could anchor "who" slightly earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's discovery reframes contentment from destination to continuous action, with visible emotional cost in accepting her transient role. The accumulative structure coheres well through the hairpin-journal discovery sequence, though the vision moment ("a memory that was not a memory") briefly strains credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal structure with decisive change: Kael abandons his destructive plan after confronting suppressed memories. The hollow mirror shard serves as the catalyst, revealing "the time he took the blame for my mistake." Cost is visible in his shift from certainty to accepting complexity - "I'll find another way" carries the weight of harder choices ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through pond ripples building to Kael's revelation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael understands Elara's own vanishing as "final, beautiful translation" with felt cost. The delayed revelation concept drives the entire structure from withholding to understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through sensory detail and pattern recognition toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kaelen achieves his decades-long goal by accepting rather than rejecting discord. The cost is legible in his transformation from "weathered resolve" to "quiet, encompassing grace"—a fundamental shift in his relationship to his sacred duty.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Elian transforms from punished underachiever to chosen guardian, with visible cost (staying in isolation, enduring cold). The accumulative lens holds as discoveries layer toward his final stance. Slight deduction for the mist-walking section feeling somewhat disconnected from the protective action that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with decisive Conceptual Repricing closure—Silas discovers sound's color as "deep cobalt...shimmering emerald...brilliant, impossible gold," fundamentally reweighting his reality. The key discovery leads causally to the library, then to the sphere, with clear cost: "He wept as the spectrum unfolded." Orientation anchors effectively by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara transforms from cataloging death to composing birth, with clear cost (the struggle through tears to smile). The backwards prophecy creates effective non-linear causality that pays off. The lens holds consistently though the conceptual nature of the universe's contraction/expansion could be more grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Silas transforms from soul harvester to memory preserver, with the crystal bell's chime creating "perfect recognition" that reconfigures his relationship to all souls he's guided. The accumulative structure (recordings→atlas→crystallization→bell) builds coherently. Cost is felt in his "trembling" effort and the "overwhelming" intimacy. Minor deduction for slightly abstract opening orientation ("dusk light was thick").

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the bell's restoration enables communication with the deep, addressing the cosmic imbalance with visible cost (Elian's naive certainty replaced by "quiet, certain knowledge"). The accumulative lens holds as dripping rates build toward the bell's healing. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established clearly by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens as Elias's trail of photographs accumulates meaning, shifting from professional documentation to personal reckoning. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when he transforms from memory-expunger to memory-keeper, with the cost visible in his "trembling, mud-caked fingers" and the weight he chooses to bear. The pattern of discovered objects (sign→fence→bottle→tin box) creates escalating personal stakes that reweight his purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the synthesis of logic and intuition, with visible transformation in the glowing fruit. The accumulative build through crystal-to-vapor-to-starlings-to-light creates clear causality. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of "touch of wonder" as a concept that needs more concrete grounding earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong causal chain from distress signal → broken buckle discovery → vine solution → successful rescue, with clear Decisive Change closure (life saved). Cost is visible in Elara's isolation and the weight of sole responsibility. Orientation anchors established early (nocturnal arbor, above clouds). Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of the vine solution.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal structure with effective closure - Kaelen achieves integration through accepting rather than fighting the preserved consciousness, with visible cost in his tears "of profound, rekindled existence."

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from seed receipt to protective deception, with Elara's escape room expertise enabling the solution. The closure lands with Earned Stasis—she successfully safeguards the seed at the cost of constant vigilance—but the stakes feel abstract ("zones of unbearable distraction") rather than viscerally demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration: the wife's laughter transforms from lost to "new, real sound, weathered and healing." Cost is visible in the "ragged" quality and years of silence broken. The hourglass-to-present structure anchors immediately, and the symbolic leaf-maceration accumulates meaning that pays off when she witnesses his "ridiculous love."

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the garden transforming into library as density increase, culminating in Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara hurls the pendant and the boundary strengthens. Cost is visible in the library's erosion and her acceptance of displacement as connection. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words with frozen garden, dream state, and Elara's quest clear.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the crozier's destruction births something "beautifully, wonderfully unknown," with clear cost in the thousand failures that preceded it. The accumulative structure coheres well through repeated attempts building to breakthrough. Minor orientation wobble with "stoically敏感" (appears to be a character encoding issue) but doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's discovery reweights the entire premise—the signal isn't additive but subtractive, "the sound of the universe subtracted from itself." The cost is conceptually clear: she must sacrifice her assumptions and the validation symbol. Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases toward the crystalline revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from clock anomaly through passenger dissolution to grotto discovery and timeline restoration. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost ("forever the ardent keeper of the timeline he had made whole").

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through sensory layers toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's promise transforms her role. The closure lands with clear cost—she must now speak publicly about buried crimes, departing from her "quiet profession." Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words, and the photograph-to-box discovery creates meaningful tightening that forecloses the spirit's peaceful departure without truth.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: the Codex activation triggers facility destabilization, forcing the phase transition escape. Closure lands with Decisive Change as Elara physically transitions to safety while emotionally committing to continue the work. Cost is visible in the "violent, silent scream of energy" and her recognition that "her work had only just begun."

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - Elias's decision to stop counting and "simply was" forecloses his obsessive path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (static confessions, warping physics, metamorphosis) building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara becomes light. Cost is explicit—she loses human form but gains understanding. Orientation anchors establish who/where/when efficiently in opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard transforms from enchanted prison to "messy, root-tangled, glorious beauty" with clear cost—the locust shell's sacrifice and the statues becoming part of the landscape. The accumulative build through music→vibration→roots→transformation holds coherently. The final "gap between knowing she had done it and understanding what would come next" reweights the opening's temporal frame effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the child's drawing connects to Kael's earlier crayon delivery, revealing where "broken promises heal." The causal chain is clean: contraband trade → information → recognition → renewed purpose. Cost is visible in the dangerous transaction and the weight of linking absences. Minor deduction for slightly abstract framing of the central desire.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively from discovery through revelation to commitment, with the halo fragment's glow serving as the pivotal transformation. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara takes up the tools, accepting her role with visible cost (completing another's abandoned dream). The piece teaches its lyrical pattern early and maintains coherence throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through hyperbolic expansion leading to the nexus discovery. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara's role transforms from guardian to "custodian of the gateway." Cost is conceptual—the weight of infinite knowledge in "observed solitude"—though more concrete sacrifice would strengthen it.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the lighthouse beam transforms whispered longings into reality, with clear cost in the "energy spent" and permanent alteration of the world. The accumulative structure builds beautifully from individual gathering to archipelago-wide transformation. The pattern of light-painting establishes early and pays off decisively when redirected through the beacon.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong closure with the idea's liberation creating a "new star born from liberated thought"—a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (the client's fear dissolved). The accumulative structure coheres well through symbolic actions. Slight opacity in the middle journey section ("disorient the soul") doesn't fully ground the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal chain from diving to photographing to pattern analysis to memory recovery, with the mushroom ring as planted message providing the decisive change. Closure lands with emotional cost (trauma burial) though the mother's fate resolution lacks visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong resonant reconfiguration lands with visible cost (Elara's exhaustion and depletion). The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward the golden wave transformation. Slight deduction for the magical mechanics being somewhat opaque, though the emotional and thematic cost remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the spirit dissolves into "serene, accumulated silence" with visible transformation cost. The accumulative structure builds through ritual unraveling to reveal buried truth (storm/rival/malice). Orientation anchored early with "mask restorer, Elara" and "subterranean sanctuary."

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through layered discoveries—the map's tear, the shadow discrepancy, the hidden chamber—culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara becomes guardian rather than documenter. The cost is legible: she forfeits academic glory for sacred preservation. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the henge's relationship to the vault.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's understanding of endings shifts from "closed doors" to necessary periods that allow narratives to be "read complete," with emotional cost paid through her processing of the radio operator's note. Causal lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkages (discovery leads to hollowness → assignment → encounter → understanding). The ghost's release and Elara's transformed perspective on discovery provide dual closure with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where Elara regains her voice through giving voice to another. The cost is visible—her long silence, the risk of the encoding process during the storm. The piece teaches its pattern of connection through art/encoding early and pays it off. Slight deduction for the convenience of the solution arriving so readily.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the man's reunion with Althea's memory transforms his frozen grief into "a laughter that once shook the rigging." The cost is palpable in his trembling fingers and hitched breath. The accumulative structure coheres beautifully as scattered light becomes metaphor for connection across time. Slight deduction for the convenience of finding exactly the right diary at exactly the right moment.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through emotional cloud cataloging toward Aris's Conceptual Repricing that "empty spaces remember."

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal chain from search to discovery to creation to revelation, with the lens's failure delivering a Resonant Reconfiguration about limits. Cost is visible in the demolished library and lost perfection. The orientation anchors (hollow tree library, dawn deadline) land early and effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal drive: stranded ship → Elara notices patterns → translates to music → restarts crystal. The Decisive Change lands with clear cost (three days stranded, risk of permanent drift). Orientation anchors effectively by line 3. Minor deduction for the convenient availability of a violinist and the somewhat rushed resolution mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered imagery (ice/light/reflection) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara repairs time itself. The closure lands with visible cost—the library thaws, the world's rhythm restored—and the causal chain from locksmith to temporal mechanic tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong causal structure with clear closure - the nut discovery leads to blueprint understanding, then to decisive action that silences the curse. The Decisive Change lands with visible cost: "The orchard was just an orchard now, its graceless beauty stripped of malice, its caretaker finally free." The drive lens holds throughout with clean because/therefore linkages.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost - Aris releases the chrysalis and commits to "braiding" rather than creating unbreakable chains, with the cost of accepting permanent separation palpable. The accumulative lens holds as metaphors layer (polymer/river/symphony) to reweight meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the discovery that stories begin with "a choice that was lost" reweights the entire premise with conceptual cost visible in the woman's transformation.

The accumulative structure coheres as mechanical, linguistic, and social harmonies layer toward the final restored dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through memory layers to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara inherits not just the device but the dream itself, with visible cost in her synaptic rewiring. The closure lands powerfully: "She was the engineer, the archeologist, and now, the dreamer" shows decisive transformation. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two. Minor deduction for the grandfather's theoretical framework requiring slight exposition stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from calculation to discovery to escape, with clear orientation anchors. The closure lands as Decisive Change - Elara obtains the seeds and accepts guardianship duty, with cost visible in the dangerous escape and burden of preservation. The "because/therefore" linkage holds throughout, though the worldbuilding premise (gravity inversion) strains credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with clear closure: the silent world transforms to symphonic life through Aris's empathetic act, with visible cost in his "giving of himself." The piece teaches its pattern early (silence/music dichotomy) and pays off with the grove's resurrection, though the mid-section could tighten causality between discovering the insulator's true purpose and the strumming action.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal lens with Elara diagnosing the nexus problem and executing the solution. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when she shifts the lodestone and restores order, with the cost being her bittersweet acceptance of a new home in exile. The covenant's eclipse and restoration provides solid causality, though the resolution feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong causal drive: the quest to open the diary leads through failed attempts, an empathy-driven insight, then success revealing grandfather's words that reframe her entire project. The closure lands with clear emotional cost—abandoning her catalog for human connection. Minor dock for the slightly convenient timing with the fireworks.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's final understanding that serenity exists within decay and motion, not despite them. The corpse flower's bloom provides the decisive moment with visible cost (accepting the foul perfume). The seed's refusal to grow until she releases control creates proper causality.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's purpose transforms from possession to protection. The closure lands with visible cost—she must leave the artifact behind despite her obsession. The inversion timeframe creates natural pressure and constraint. Minor deduction for slightly abstract handling of the "echo" concept in paragraph 6.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal drive where wind mapping leads to infrasound theory, which drives navigation to the epicenter and resolution. The closure lands with Decisive Change—Elias disconnects the power, stopping the acoustic weapon—with clear cost visible in the catatonic townspeople.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure achieves Conceptual Repricing - guardianship transforms from ownership to humility through witnessed catastrophe. The cost is legible in "a space for contemplation" replacing "crushing quiet," with the shadow fragment's attack providing tangible stakes. The accumulative structure coheres through ritual preparation, weaving passage, and return, each phase deepening the silence motif.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain: Aris's emotional void → experiment with halo fragment → overwhelming empathy cascade → understanding that emotion must be lived, not solved. The closure (Decisive Change) lands with clear cost—he abandons his lifelong defense mechanism of borrowing personalities. The vanishing stars provide elegant parallel structure, though their withdrawal motivation feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from delivery to discovery to transformation, with the pendant-as-key revelation properly reweighting prior material. The closure lands with Elara becoming the garden's keeper - a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (her solitary vigil). The orientation anchors (ridgeway, aurora, delivery) establish cleanly within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost as Elara realizes her "small" perspective caused her to miss the vaster truth. The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward the tree's revelation, though the slightly convenient timing of the tree crack prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure lands powerfully as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara breaks the amber bead centerpiece, releasing the woven silence that transforms the orchard.

Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the message's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from loss through preparation to resolution, with the silk puppet serving as earned Decisive Change with visible cost (the puppet dissolves). The lichen's rules are established clearly and the exchange mechanism pays off. Minor dock for the slightly convenient puppet solution, though the setup with the magician's silk partially earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the cyclical jumps through universes accumulate toward the final revelation, with the green shard anchoring each shift. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara adds the green sigil—a small but meaningful change showing how the discovered truth has altered her mapmaking. Cost is visible in the man's decades of regret and Elara's new burden of knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure building from routine measurement through discovery to reconceptualization. The closure achieves a genuine Conceptual Repricing as the Archivist realizes he's been "measuring the wrong thing" - the cost is his entire previous methodology becoming obsolete. The pattern of sampling slides teaches the reader the archive's logic early and pays off when the luminous vow breaks that pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong causal chain from failed attempts to successful exploitation of the watch fob's secret mechanism. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration - the broken fob becomes both literal evidence and symbolic betrayal, with clear cost visible in Silas's shame and Elara's felt burden ("heavier than any crate of moonshine"). The drive lens holds consistently throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the departure moment where "everything was one" before vanishing, with clear cost in abandoning the known world. The accumulative structure coheres as taste-sensations intensify from "cold broth" to "futuristic nostalgia" to "the flavor of departure." Orientation anchors cleanly (Elara, lavender bluff, aurora observation), and the convergence concept pays off through literal reality-restructuring.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)

The orientation anchors (Elara, mansion/library/cave, post-gala) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear causal chain leads to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the machine's response "Listen" reweights Elara's role from scribe to witness. The cost is visible in her abandonment of lucrative work and confrontation with her complicity. However, the emotional weight of this shift could be more deeply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the melting ice releases truth's symphony, restoring wonder to the world below with visible cost (seven days of exhausting labor).

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through layered storytelling to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the deed transforms legal stalemate into communal healing. The locket-as-map and collective memory unlocking mechanism create satisfying causality, with visible cost in Isabella's decades of resistance now validated.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal drive with clear closure: Elara chooses to take the die (burden) rather than leave it, triggering the lab's destruction but securing both the knowledge and the key. The cost is immediate and visible—she must flee the flooding structure. The narrative follows a clear because/therefore chain from code-breaking through dance to the final moral test. Minor deduction for slightly rushed final beat that could better weight the transformation of the die from "tool of execution" to "key."

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where deleted memories as gravity-creating fossils reweights the entire world's physics—"The whale's beaching had been a symptom."

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure builds through ritual repetition (climbing steps, whisking water, whistling) to the firefly circle demonstration—a Charged Poise moment where Hideo's philosophy crystallizes against pragmatic demands. The cost is legible: choosing contemplation over productivity. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from investigation through discovery to decisive action, with the diamond serving as both revelation tool and physical implement. The closure lands with clear cost—destroying beauty for truth—though the emotional weight of this choice could resonate more deeply in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkages: discovery of prophet's voice leads to archiving, which enables broadcasting, which triggers faction corruption, forcing Elara's final tactical shift. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when she fragments the signal into "a puzzle, unfolding forever," with visible cost in abandoning her singular authority. The orientation is clear by ~100 words with Elara alone in the Sky-Spire.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural design where disparate sounds cohere into a new symphony that resurrects the music box's voice—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (the lonesome splendor becomes "shared, magnificent inheritance"). The poet's "gleaned redemption" lands through service rather than personal transformation, with the final crystalline note joining the translation as tangible proof of success.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal drive: threat arrives → protagonist adapts through technical mastery → closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with the lighthouse's "adaptive song" as permanent protection. The cost is legible in the transformation from keeper to "part of the song," though the sonic absolution solution arrives somewhat conveniently from grandfather's journals.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Kaelen's deliberate release of the viaduct, transforming from personal discovery to legacy-building with clear cost (forfeiting control of his discovery). The causal lens holds as each discovery builds toward the final action, though the magnetic field's bending of moonlight could use clearer physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with the lantern serving as a vessel for layered memories that build to Cora's tragedy. The closure—Elara placing the lantern as a grave marker and choosing remembrance over bureaucratic filing—creates a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (abandoning Department control). The shift from investigating "preventable deaths" to preventing erasure of human stories lands with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where the clockwork heart's light-throwing mechanism reframes Eli's understanding of his role—from fixing past sins to providing tools for prisoners' self-illumination. Cost is visible in his acknowledged "withheld grace" and the weight of returning to unchanged circumstances with changed perspective. The accumulative texture coheres beautifully through light/mechanism imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from problem (inert machine) through discovery (arrow as constant) to resolution (bell schematic), with clear cost in Kiv's desperate experimentation. The closure lands as a Decisive Change with visible transformation. Slight weakness in the conceptual weight of "yearning algorithm" which borders on abstraction despite the mechanical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from data anomaly to warehouse discovery to moral choice, with clear Decisive Change when Elara uploads the files. The cost (career sacrifice) is visible on page. The coordinates revelation (10.17.23) provides elegant structural cohesion. Orientation anchors establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change closure: Kaelen prevents catastrophe by choosing engineers over peacekeepers, with visible cost (breaking her sworn duty). Causal lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkage from fragment's vision to mirror investigation to valve discovery to intervention. The "reconstituting a broken future into a mended present" lands with earned resonance. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of the valve discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara releases the parasol tip, accepting endings as internal letting-go rather than external sound. The accumulative lens holds throughout with density increases toward the crystallizing realization. Cost is felt in her transformation from "euthanasia tourist" to someone finding "profound kinship with peace."

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands effectively - two sentinels finding "they were not, after all, alone" after parallel experiences of failed love. The vineyard metaphor accumulates meaning throughout, and the cost (acknowledging love's failures while finding connection) is felt. The piece teaches its pattern of grafting parallels early and pays it off, though Leo's late introduction slightly weakens the build.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—the echo's preservation in stone with the scout as unwitting catalyst. The cost is felt through Elara's weariness and the echo's fragility ("would soon fade"). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The ritual's success changes the world state (wisdom preserved for centuries), meeting closure requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building from fragmented photographs to living lavender field, with the final sliver creating a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the entire project's meaning. The closure lands with clear conceptual cost—the factory's violence was always paired with its promise of restoration. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay (protagonist's name appears late) though this serves the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration—language shifts from dormant to nascent through Elara's discovery and testimony. The spiral pattern ("Growth wasn't linear; it was a spiral") provides clear causality, and cost is visible in her breaking silence. The accumulative lens holds consistently, though the transition from discovery to public testimony could use one more causal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Silas achieves a fragment of his goal ("the faint, high-frequency whisper of a single hair turning white") while accepting the eternal cycle. The cost is legible in his tears and the final image of forever searching. Orientation anchors (junkyard, fog garden, morning) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with clear cost: Elara must abandon her original quest for lasting images to save the station through ephemeral silence. The accumulative structure coheres as sensory precision builds toward the "sound of a leaf falling" payoff. However, the resolution mechanism—imprinting frequency onto metal through will—strains physical credibility even within the established metaphysical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where the "pulsing stillness" transforms to "eternal and deep" with Arthur's death as visible cost. The vinyl fragment accumulates meaning from broken love token to reunion instrument. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (hospice, Arthur in bed, Elara as therapist).

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Conceptual Repricing closure—shadows don't go anywhere but "invert" at noon's apex. The cost is conceptual (complete reframing of Elara's lifelong quest) and the piece teaches its pattern of fragmented knowledge requiring emotional context. Orientation anchors (observatory, floating isle, Elara as rune scholar) land within 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—Elara's departure with both child and silver blossom crystallizes a "wiser, more generous kind of knowing" with clear cost (the Fae's continued loss). The causal chain from discovery through healing to exchange is clean. Slight deduction for the overly neat thematic summary in the final paragraph ("constellation mapped from a terrible mistake").

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong resonant reconfiguration as Elara transforms from earthbound watcher to active light-sharer, with the cost of surrendering solitude made explicit ("weigh this newfound purpose against her old solitude"). The accumulative lens holds consistently through sensory layering toward the crystallizing moment when light explodes through the glass.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as both characters shift from isolation to shared refuge, with the moss offering as the crystallizing gesture. The accumulative lens holds as water patterns, moss growth, and the amber pendant build toward the final image of "grafting new meaning, together." Cost is visible in their mutual vulnerability and the foreclosed path of solitary healing.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's shift from mourning to honoring Clara's directive to live hopes rather than just write them. The cost is legible in his casting away the seashell fragment and commitment to go "against the current of his own cynicism." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memories and sensory details build toward the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the machine's song restores the Great Vine, with visible cost in Elara's tears and the once-in-lifetime alignment spent. The accumulative lens holds as density builds from morning preparation through moonrise to restoration. Orientation anchors clearly by line three with "her workshop, a hollowed-out ancient oak."

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the map's creation transforms dormant potential into "a patient, silent promise of spring." The closure lands with clear conceptual cost—the sublimation of collected items into permanence. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the timer's activation releasing the stored echo—a concrete transformation that reweights Elara's entire project from repair to preservation. The causal chain from sonic mapping to harmonic convergence to successful activation holds firmly, with visible cost in the meticulous labor and the "wounded season's" implicit loss.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where reorientation transforms Elara's relationship to her burden - the weights become "counterweights" providing "balance and stability." Cost is visible in years of accumulated suffering and the risk of becoming "just another artifact." The accumulative lens holds as density builds through the weaving crisis to transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully: grief transforms from wound to foundation through the act of carving, with visible cost in "tears she no longer shed" and the "permanent state of being she had learned to breathe around." The accumulative structure coheres perfectly—each image layer (rain, carving, kettle) builds pressure toward the final realization that "love does not vanish; it transmutes."

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Elara accepts partnership with her past rather than freedom from it, with visible cost in "weightless, perfect burden." The ghost revelation that she needs her blueprint self lands with earned weight. Minor orientation delay (who/where crystallizes slowly) and some causality softness in how the camera transforms from offering to returned possession.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the terminal's transformation from "stalled" to purposeful circulation carries visible cost through Elara's solitary labor and the contrast between past grandeur and present function. The "who, where, when" anchors establish clearly by line 3, and the drive lens holds consistently through density increase and pattern culmination in the steam/warmth imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure where the bear's activation releases both the guild's frozen time and Elara's dormant ambition—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost in "years of waiting." The piece teaches its pattern of stasis/release early through the frozen clocks, paying off in the final harmonic chord that transforms silence into music.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure with clear closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the sundial discovery reweights the entire legend from madness to grief. The cost is conceptual and emotional: the "painful, beautiful truth" of human sorrow replacing comfortable lies. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's understanding transforms her from collector to weaver, with visible cost in accepting an "endless, patient line" of responsibility. The accumulative lens holds as details layer (knots, fulgurite, fog) toward the crystallized moment of understanding, though the revelation of Amos as guardian feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the thread revelation reweights the entire premise of loss and presence. The cost is felt through Isolde's decades of carrying absence and Elara's transformed understanding of her work's purpose. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words with who (Elara), where (island garden/palace), and when (after ships sailed).

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing through assembly sequence to spectral emergence. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the ghostly bird's song awakens wonder in the mechanical city, reweighting Kaelen's failure as sufficient success. Cost is visible in tears, kneeling, and accepting transience over permanence. The "flawed genesis" setup pays off when imperfection yields unexpected grace.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration - Elara moves from carrying her father's destructive legacy to hearing "its melody as her own," with visible cost in the scarred landscape she tends. The accumulative structure coheres through the ritual grafting sequence, though the metaphysical "hearing" of the tree's song slightly abstracts what could be more grounded. The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure - the release of memories transforms the city with visible cost (the city's lost soul returning). The breadcrumb pattern teaches its logic early and pays off when patterns become the key. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established within first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure: Elara's purpose crystallizes from passive archiving to active pattern-seeking (Resonant Reconfiguration). The gear's data creates a decisive reweighting of her eternal task. Cost is conceptual—the "troubling serenity" becomes "filled with a new, patient purpose" across infinite time—though the emotional price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively - Elara's understanding of grief transforms from void to "dialogue," with the conceptual cost visible in how she must now approach every stone differently. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the spectral guide's mechanics remain slightly vague, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern break at closure—Elara stops rather than restores the clock, creating Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost: "a shared responsibility for the time they kept together." The pendulum bob discovery properly escalates to her renouncing her role, with "absolution...not incremental, but instantaneous" marking decisive change. Minor orientation delay (tower location unclear until "two hundred steps") prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through tapestry decoding to the revelation of the cemetery as seed vault. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the entire world recontextualizes from memorial to promise, with clear cost (she's alone with this vast responsibility). The golden thread creates clean causality linking discovery to understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal structure with clear Decisive Change - Elara moves from paralysis to action, writing the blueprint that causes the lake's tremor. The cost is legible in her "aching hand" and the risk of "heresy," with the transformation "moving from the page into the world." The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the resonant reconfiguration where Elara discovers she must listen rather than teach. The closure lands with conceptual cost—she surrenders her original ambition to become something humbler. The "via elusive song lyrics" revelation provides the crucial turn that reweights her entire approach.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through ritual dusting, the chair's final stillness, and dissolution into "uniform dust." The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with clear cost: Elara's art vanishes but transforms into "sacred, temporary grace," foreclosing permanence while affirming witness. The piece teaches its pattern early (fragility of carbon dust medium) and pays it off when the sneeze destroys yet fulfills the work's true purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Causal lens holds as Silas's discovery of the data slate forces him to choose between destructive truth and useful myth, landing on a compromise that preserves both knowledge and social stability. The closure shows clear cost—he sacrifices his pure truth-seeking for pragmatic teaching—though the final transformation could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the noise-to-harmony metaphor building toward Charged Poise closure where Leo begins listening. The cost is legible in the department closing and Leo's "unlearning" journey ahead. The zither demonstration creates a perfect because/therefore link between chaos and potential harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the celestial alignment creating temporal pressure and the pruning sequence building toward a resonant closure. The final taste of "quiet courage of a thousand gentle rebellions" delivers conceptual repricing with clear cost—she must shape/destroy wild memories to create beauty. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in opening paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal chain: blackout removes script → truthfulness compulsion → riddle reveal → problem solved. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as the restoration of routine coexists with preserved magic, showing felt cost in Elara's vulnerability. The orientation anchors (toll keeper, lightning tower, post-blackout) establish clearly by ~80 words.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands effectively—Elara shifts from dissecting to participating, with the cost being her analytical distance. The accumulative structure coheres well as each discovered object deepens understanding. The "confluence" moment provides the key turn that reweights all prior discoveries. Minor deduction for slightly abstract framing in places ("creeping normality of silence").

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the Statue's foundational understanding shifts from tragedy to chosen preservation, with clear cost in releasing millennia of mourning. The cascading revelations structure works causally through ampoule → clasp → collective memory. The orientation anchors (underwater city garden, Statue, historian) establish cleanly within the first 100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the rupture transforms prison into garden, with visible cost in accepting imperfection as source of potential. The accumulative structure builds through mathematical attempts toward the pattern break of accepting the chipped die's outcome. Slight deduction for abstract opening that delays full orientation, though the infinite staircase concept anchors early enough.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds from discovery of the brush through nightly vision-gathering to the final exhibition where strangers recognize their inherited acts. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the gathered crowd discovers they "were not strangers to these acts; they were their inheritors," with emotional cost visible in their cracking voices and trembling. The piece teaches its pattern early (brush reveals visions) and pays it off through accumulated kindnesses made tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration achieved through the communal honey-sculpting that transforms isolation into connection, with the cost of their displacement made tangible in the melting letters. The accumulative structure builds from loss (honey/beekeeper) through discovery (hive pattern) to transformation (communal ritual). Minor deduction for the narrator's journey feeling slightly mechanical as a fetch quest, though the payoff lands with genuine resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught counter-clockwise logic building to a Conceptual Repricing where Elias accesses "paths not walked." The yoyo-as-key discovery drives causal linkage. Cost is conceptual—the "terrible and beautiful potential" of untaken choices—though a more visceral price would strengthen the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught paradoxical language building to a Conceptual Repricing where "boredom" defeats fear—the cost is the entity's dissipation and Elara's transformed understanding. The dream dictionary framework coheres well with the unreality of the setting. Slight deduction for the somewhat abrupt resolution mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases from silence to storm to symphony, with the closure showing Resonant Reconfiguration—the storm "robbed of its cacophony" having been given voice. Cost is visible in Kai's physical depletion and the storm's dissolution. The fractal-generating method provides persistent constraint that shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong causal chain from whistle discovery to pattern recognition to gate opening, with clear cost in the "sharp report, like a mountain snapping" that permanently alters their world. The closure lands as Decisive Change with visible transformation from trapped to journey-bound. Slight weakness in the speed of the final paragraph's shift to leadership role.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Causal lens with clear closure: Aris recaptures the letter through persuasion, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration where "truth was not in the lie, nor in its mere negation, but in the delicate, dangerous space between." The cost is Aris accepting complicity in perpetuating lies while gaining the evidence to expose them. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias shifts from archeologist of others' dreams to understanding his own, with visible emotional cost (sobbing, trembling). The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward this crystallization. Slight deduction for the explanatory final lines that diminish the power of the earned moment.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change: Elara transforms from neutral indexer to active keeper of dangerous truth, with the cost of complicity visible in her deliberate mislabeling. The causal lens holds—the blackout enables discovery, discovery forces choice, choice reconfigures her role. Who/where/when anchored early ("Aqualibrium," "Logical Page Indexer," blackout context).

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through craft details, the island's orbital dance, and the transformation sequence, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where grief literally transforms into light. Cost is visible in "luminous torment" and the release of the last memory. The ascending/descending motif mirrors internal state and pays off in the final "descend while ascending" as weight leaves while heart rises.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and memory fragments build toward Elara's discovery of K-7B, a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost ("joy had died with her bride"). The power cycle creates temporal pressure that enables her hunt. Slight abstractness in the "unused potential pools" concept prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elara's integration into the "universal song" with clear cost—her solitary observer identity is permanently altered. The causal chain from drone-piloting through chip activation to consciousness merger holds. Slight weakness in the pilgrim's disappearance feeling convenient rather than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Elara's final understanding reweights her entire practice with "deep, tempered regret." The watch hand's dual memory (heroism fabricated vs. cowardice revealed) creates meaningful tightening that forecloses her ability to continue. Cost is legible in "not a solace, but a silencing."

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal closure where the drawer pull intervention creates a Decisive Change - violence averted through concrete reframing of abstract cost. The moon-phase delay mechanism effectively builds tension. Cost is visible in the commander's transformation and the "fragile peace" achieved rather than resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with increasing density of regret and realization culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the compass points to the osprey. The closure lands with visible cost—Elias accepting his broken state while finding new meaning. Early orientation is clear (mudflats, kayak, astronomical compass by ~80 words). The "wrong north" that becomes "perfectly correct" reweights the entire journey with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's gift of the impossible artifact kindles empathy in both herself and the grandson, with visible emotional cost ("hardened by years of anger"). The causal chain from procedure to caves to final confrontation holds cleanly. The time-traveler element stretches plausibility but serves the thematic arc of faith across time.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's perceptual metamorphosis allows true reunion—not resurrection but transformation into "two eternal notes in the same cosmic chord." The fortune cookie functions as a perfect structural hinge, reinterpreted from cruel joke to key. Cost is legible in her surrender of physical form and acceptance of perpetual change. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in the final paragraph's "constellation of memory."

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing through Silas's realization that "lost time accumulated not in a place, but in the heart," fundamentally reweighting his quest from retrieval to presence. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with ritual elements building toward this crystallized understanding. Cost is legible in his "aching clarity" and acceptance of "inevitable loss."

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure where grief literally accumulates weight until transformed through stitching into dimensional access. The closure—opening a door through compassion rather than force—lands with clear cost (processing generations of trauma). The transformation from crushing gravity to lightness provides visible change with earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost: "Her poverty was the necessary emptiness that allowed the world to fill her." The accumulative structure builds through sensory layers (black sand, celestial bodies, fireflies) toward the final image of Elara "infinitely rich" on warm sand, though the middle section's abstract realizations ("fulfilling prophecies accidentally") slightly weakens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong causal structure with clear because/therefore linkages: blackout leads to Kael's investigation, which reveals the Luminary's greed, prompting his diversion of power to the presses. The closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration—the manifests printing truth while Kael returns to his post—with visible cost in the risk taken and path chosen. The "cradle of sparks" ember waiting for the next sentinel effectively crystallizes the changed state.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration - Kaelen's realization that "to harness was not to control, but to align" reweights the entire premise with visible cost (the promise was his vow to a dying world). The accumulative structure coheres as mathematical patterns draw the eels, who trace the solution, leading to friction's return. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's shift from preservation to dissemination lands with clear cost - she risks exposure by using the ventilation shaft. The accumulative structure coheres as storm imagery mirrors internal transformation, and the "seed cast onto fertile lightning" crystallizes her new stance with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from needle card cipher to sundial positions to collaborative revelation, with clear closure as they transition from duel to partnership. The cost is primarily opportunity-based (abandoning their combative tradition) rather than deeply felt, which prevents higher scoring despite the elegant structure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the discovery transforms the library from a space of "rusted shelves and ghosts" into a site of "blooming resistance," with clear cost visible in Silas's tears and the risk both men take. The accumulative structure coheres as fragments build toward the collective epic. The lens holds consistently through pattern accumulation and cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the final moment where Elara sees "not a ghost, but an echo" crystallizes her journey from loss to grace. The accumulative structure coheres as each element (clock, film, compasses) builds toward this "encore," with visible cost in the temporary nature ("before the night fully embraced the sky"). The piece teaches its lyrical pattern early and pays it off.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong causal linkage from fading blooms → dream interpretation → seed discovery → activation. Closure lands as Decisive Change with clear cost (the monsoon arrives but stories are preserved). The dream sequence effectively bridges discovery to action. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical resolution where feeding memories instantly solves the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration landing through the lace pattern revelation that reweights Elara's understanding of her grandmother's matching regret. Cost is legible in "the severance that now could never be mended" and the acceptance of irreversible loss. The compass-as-time-finder constraint shapes tactics meaningfully.


== Grader: DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.5)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held perfectly, building to a resonant Conceptual Repricing at closure. The cost of her surrendered detachment is legible in the final image of her as "a element within it." Orientation is immediate and causality is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.4)
    Inferred Causal/Accumulative Hybrid lens holds. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara's purpose is decisively reweighted, with cost legible in "She would not rebuild her glass studio." The frost-map mechanism is taught early and pays off, creating tight because/therefore linkage.

Cost is legible on the page in her transformed state of being "infinitely rich."

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.4)
    Inferred causal lens holds tightly; the blackout triggers a because/therefore chain of inventive actions that narrow options to a single, decisive act at the Chamber door. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael returns to his post, but the system has been meaningfully altered, with cost felt in the enduring secrecy and the "cradle of sparks" waiting for the next sentinel.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.3)
    Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, held throughout. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Kaelen aligns with the pattern, not controls it. The cost is legible in the "faint, almost nothing" return of friction. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; the pattern of stones and eels teaches its own logic, paying off at closure without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.4)
    Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, building density through layered imagery (storm, timer, poem) that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands on the page with cost: her vigil ends, but her watch begins, reconfiguring her stance from passive preservation to active dissemination. The lens holds without contradiction, and the timer is a persistent constraint shaping tactics. Orientation is clear by ~120 words (who: Elara; where: observatory; when: during a storm).

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.4)
    Causal drive lens holds perfectly with tight because/therefore linkages: the needle card cipher logically leads to sundial interpretation, which reveals the collaboration invitation. Closure is a decisive change from conflict to partnership with felt cost (the mechanical arm's symbolic transformation). Orientation is immediate and precise, anchoring who, where, and when within the first paragraph. The hidden overture concept pays off cleanly at climax without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.4)
    Inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Ezra finds his purpose, reconfiguring the premise of his work. The cost is legible in Silas's tears and their pact. Causality is tight, with the key discovery and subsequent choice to transcribe arising from established character and setting.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost in the moment's fleetingness. The path from station to arbor is a coherent, purpose-driven sequence where each detail accumulates toward the final, legible image.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal drive lens holds strongly. The inciting incident (dim flowers) triggers the dream, which reveals the seed, forcing the climactic choice. Closure is a decisive change with clear cost: the storm's arrival against the now-protected light. The dream sequence, while functional, is a brief ellipsis that slightly softens causal tightness.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.4)
    Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that lands on the page with felt cost in the final image of holding the lace. The pattern of imagery (compass, lace, cerulean regret) accumulates pressure and reweights the dominant stake. The drive lens holds without contradiction, and the persistent constraint of regret shapes the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each observed detail tightens toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Orientation is crisp in the opening and the single‑scene design is coherent. Closure lands in the final image (dust on fingertip; “participant”), with the cost of relinquishing her numbing framework. The flood functions as catalyst not resolution, fitting the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear causal chain: salvaged ledger → frost‑revealed path → fissure and box → letter reframes purpose → decisive choice to become “keeper of the pauses.” Orientation is anchored early (who/where/when), and the closure is a Decisive Change with legible cost. The coincidence of the frost window is purposeful and taught, but the letter’s explanatory density feels a touch convenient. Still, the lens holds through to the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the discovery of the crack tightens pressure, and the cadence densifies through repeated tactile tests to a resonant repair. Closure lands on the page with cost (hours of labor, aching cold) and a reweighted final image (“the universe hum”). Orientation is clean early; single scene coherence is strong. The causal chain is simple but suffices for the form.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear causal chain: package → restoration → signal → reply → dive → discovery → reframed goal. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (homecoming/Earned Stasis), conceptually priced by Silas’s implied relinquishment of surface striving. Orientation is immediate and stable; the lens holds in a largely causal mode with a lyric sheen. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized, which limits peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of scarcity → anonymous gifts → bell → declaration coheres and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (sanctioned valley, Elara’s role). Closure lands with the communal gathering and the bell’s ring, though the cost is primarily conceptual (risk/exposure) rather than concretely dramatized. The throughline remains tight for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: breath slows → hidden object revealed → compassion released → identity reconfigured. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: the tear is consumed and the memory’s pain is transmuted rather than erased. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the single-scene structure stays tight. Stakes are internal and modest but resolved decisively on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: investigation → activation → entrapment → geometric re‑folding → release, with the fragment and garden rules paying off. The closure is an on‑page Decisive Change (escape) coupled with a reweighted understanding, and the cost is legible (power expended, shaken trust). The hybrid/accumulative lens holds via density build and a decisive act. A minor slip: the “hyperbolic solution” arrives quickly, bordering on neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean Causal lens: rumor → militia arrival → decoding opens door → obstruction seals it, trapping her inside—an Earned Stasis with cost. Orientation is immediate (abandoned carnival, clown mural, seed vault). The closure lands concretely with the vault sealing and her accepting imprisonment to protect the seeds. Tight causal chain with no contrivance or resets.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene accumulative structure is clear, with a timed window, approach, eruption, capture, imprint, and conceptual reweighting at the rise. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she secures the imprint yet chooses witnessing over fixing with felt cost. Orientation is crisp from the open and the drive lens holds. The causal spine is simple but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: assignment → observation → revelation of client motive → reinterpretation → execution with the moonbeam jar → redistribution of the artifact. Closure lands via a decisive change and conceptual repricing of “theft.” Orientation is clean early, and the single-scene build holds coherently. The cost is implied rather than tallied, keeping it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the thaw, the falling ice, and the charged light cohere into a Resonant Reconfiguration with Earned Stasis: one orb, bookmark repositioned, stance altered. Orientation is swift and clean; cause/effect is lyric but legible. The cost is on‑page (foregoing further making as protection, releasing anger) and reweights options going forward. The single decisive intensification (the sheet’s collapse) credibly tightens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Drive lens: Situational with causal throughline. The beat sequence—shell numbers → cast cipher → identity realization → arrival of Marcus → chosen confrontation—lands a Charged Poise closure with felt risk. Orientation is clear early, and the persistent constraint (phobias) shapes tactics. Cost is legible at the end in the decision to face danger while still afraid.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density of quiet builds toward a cadence shift as dawn arrives. Closure lands on the page with a felt cost—the night ends, the bird shatters the hush, and she forecloses further work by closing the booklet (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise). Orientation is clean from the outset and the single-scene arc is coherent. The cost is subtle rather than wrenching, keeping it just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The looped‑timeline density builds to a cadence shift at the bow stroke, collapsing multiplicity into a singular present; closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (thought as emergent action). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the violin is set up, developed, and paid off. The cost is conceptual (foreclosing a source‑hunt for a process stance), palpable but quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images (rain, lens, tickets, hornet) accrue toward a quiet Charged Poise ending where the silence reconfigures the relationship. Orientation is clean early; causality is simple but coherent—realization → action → visible thaw. Closure lands on the page with a legible before/after and a nonverbal price (exposure of guilt and risk of rejection). The final “bridge” image earns its repricing without mechanical explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene structure with a clear incursion (the Bureau visit) culminates in a charged, on‑page reconfiguration when the garden responds. The inferred lens is Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance at the end; cadence and density shift with the marble’s light. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis; the only softness is the on‑page cost, which is largely historical/implicit rather than newly exacted. Orientation is clean from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when) and the scene flows cleanly to a closure beat. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: a calm buildup to a conceptual repricing when the hologram reveals temporal coexistence. Closure lands on the page, though the cost is more conceptual than felt. The chain from activation to lever to vision maintains coherence without gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean, and the pattern—note, aqueous reply—intensifies toward a charged final image and conceptual repricing (“not a code to be broken, but a connection”). Cost is present as the relinquishing of decipherment for communion and the bodily push to the finale; it lands, though quietly. The single‑scene coherence and on‑page closure are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain: fever break → data dissonance → failed external check → principle recall → conduit verification → alert. The closure is a charged poise/earned stasis: she alters the day with the alert yet must bear the fixed cost of what she knows. Orientation is anchored early and the single transition (inside → gantry → conduit → interior) is coherent. Cost is on-page (“with seconds to spare,” the hand, the emotional anchor of the last image).

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain: static confession → tunnel advance → boiler discovery → valve test → release/absolution. Closure is on‑page and costly: the wheel yields with a scream and the “colossal sigh” reconfigures the room and Leo’s stance (Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration). Orientation is anchored promptly; single scene scope holds. The cost is legible in the final image (spent body, quiet burden) and the lens remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a clear causal thread. The groan forces the retreat and origami method; the witnessing stance unravels the knot, and the ending returns to charged stillness—an Earned Stasis/RR. Cost is implied (psychic weight, shattered peace) but not deeply dramatized in the peak beat, which slightly blunts impact. Structure holds as a two‑shard passage and clean return.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear causal chain: music fails → eclipse idea → relocation under roots → locket offered at totality → Leo speaks. The closure is a decisive change on the page with felt cost (risk of breaking the spell; Elara holding back, Leo’s tear). Orientation is crisp, and the eclipse clock shapes tactics and cadence. The ending reconfigures stakes from grief to renewed presence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: soot diaries → tapestry → cross‑referencing → conceptual reprise. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost (“diagnosis for a species‑wide amnesia”/burden to awaken). The inferential leap to a sudden axial shift is bold but supported by the pattern of evidence in this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal drive holds: the cookie line leads to Alistair’s expectancy, which reframes the microdot, which prompts the final choice. Orientation is clean early; the single scene maintains coherence. Closure is a decisive change with cost (“his old life receding like the tide”) and is earned by prior beats. A slight convenience in the “accidentally prophetic” delivery remains credible within the story’s network logic.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned ritual → pressure spike (sentient static) → cadence break (he stops looping) → reweighted end state (integration). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with clear cost (“agony” as the void overwhelms) and a decisive on‑page act. Orientation is clean from the opening and the causal chain is legible. The window “before the possession completes” tightens the beat without gimmickry.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation lands cleanly and early (glass spire apex, frozen lake, dawn clock), and the accumulative/textural drive is taught and held to closure. The on‑page culmination—the vibrational symphony and bone‑felt C‑sharp—functions as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (spent focus, physical collapse). Because/therefore linkages are soft but coherent: alignment → superimposition → world response → exhaustion/relief. The single tightening (dawn’s brief alignment) structures the scene without mechanical plotting.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates through patterned spaces and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration: she grounds herself and merges with the first self. The closure carries cost—the relinquishing of a grandiose self‑image in exchange for relief and clarity—and is legibly on the page. Orientation is strong from the opening (who/where/when established quickly), and the tablet’s rule‑set coheres through the journey. The because/therefore links are soft but consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The sequence—needle discovery → cavern recorder/vibration initiation → drum immersion → her own playing—tightens cleanly to a resonant reconfiguration: she remains deaf but exits with a new, felt silence. Cost is on the page (emotional rupture, physical exhaustion, relinquishing the needle). Orientation is crisp early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is clear early (rooftop array, courtyard, dusk, followed home), and each beat links causally: pigeon → message → analysis → realization → siren → decision. The piece reads as a Hybrid (causal/situational) design, with the closure landing as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. The cost is legible in the curfew siren and the watcher’s threat as she commits to recording and dispatch. Tight scope and one decisive cadence shift support closure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset and the causal chain is clean: UV lanterns → bloom → scent → grief → gift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (she sacrifices the last of her mother’s scent). The accumulative/textural drive holds throughout with one decisive intensification. No unkept setups or causality gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single‑scene Situational lens holds: the grotto encounter coheres toward a forced stance once the vision frames the cost. Closure lands on the page via an Earned Stasis choice (unmaking the key) with explicit cost (forfeiting his life’s desire). Orientation is crisp from the outset; no causality breaks. The price shapes the final image (rope left on altar) cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is clean: bonfire charge → quest → discovery → performative attempt → tactic shift → on‑page response (condensation ping, seed cracking) → charged return with the pear. Causality under a textural/accumulative lens holds, with the song’s reframed intent triggering the greenhouse response. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration; the bowl’s reprise and “breath held between notes” seal the before/after. Costs are quiet and mostly conceptual, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: meticulous crafting → anomalous static intensifies → empathy breach → decision to draw the charge inward. Closure lands on the page with felt cost (she weeps, petal spent, product withheld). Orientation is crisp by ~120 words; single scene, single POV, one dominant stake. The only minor softness is how quickly the mechanism of “fusion” is named, though it doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: symphony → letter → misaddress → returned envelope → widower’s reply → choice to meet → new bond. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration at the library, with the heirloom photo’s transfer signaling cost and change. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the single transition is smooth and purposeful. The ending’s cost—grief acknowledged and a personal keepsake relinquished—reads on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: tag appears → communal search → Elara tracks clues → encounter → concealment → public dedication and build. Closure lands as a decisive reconfiguration: she chooses welcome over exposure and begins weaving a literal bridge. The cost is implied (risking community trust) rather than dramatized, softening impact. Orientation is crisp early and the single transition is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal chain: pendant detects fracture → climb to clock tower → sound cage → borrowing time lens → echo released → moth manifests → she draws. Orientation is immediate, and the piece holds a tight single‑scene arc. Closure lands with the moth’s appearance and image capture, though the on‑page cost at the end is subtle rather than viscerally priced. The lens reads Hybrid with a causal backbone crowned by a charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing with Earned Stasis (she forecloses the solve-for-return path). Orientation is clean; single scene coherence holds. The beat progression—ritual attempt → void result → tactile recognition → repricing—lands with on‑page cost. No causality breaks; the ending image reweights all prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive: the outage hush, the fragment, the voice, the remembered care all layer to a cadence shift where Silas redefines his method. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and causality holds: tape → memory → renewed purpose. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the final image (“kindness as data”) and the accepted cost of continued invisibility. Stakes are quiet but coherent and tightened by the tape-triggered pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm damage → observation → adaptive rebuilding → charged poise as new storm approaches. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (relinquishing control), legible in the final readiness under gathering weather. Causality is clean and the scene stays within one coherent window. The cost is felt but relatively soft, with limited external resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens with causal triggers (rain → landslide → brooch → apparition) and an accumulative cadence toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the single transition back to the cottage is clean. Closure lands on-page: she paints the convergence, foreclosing her prior isolation with felt cost. No unkept setups or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: arrival → placement of the pearl → tapestry of moments → wordless ask → consent → reconfigured present. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (relinquishing predictive dominance for present-tense wonder). Orientation is clean early; props and rules stay consistent. The beats are motivated and avoid coincidence-based resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: valve → smithy → garrison → letters → mission → personal reprice. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with cost: her freedom is tied to others’ deaths and a mission that constrained her life. The drive lens stays causal even within lyric texture, and the ending action (to hearten through truthful record) concretizes the shift. No orientation debt; one clean tightening at the unlisted mission.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: arrows → arch → vault → punch → warden’s price → confession → passage. The drive lens is Causal and holds through closure, with the emotional price on‑page (“spoken words” consumed, star of paper). Orientation is firm early; no teleporting props or rule breaks. The decisive change (truth spoken, passage granted) carries felt cost and reconfigures options.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: touch → sensory influx → recognition of uncle’s plea → choice to translate → sonic resolution. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the tile’s numbers dissolve and the symphony resolves with a costed stance shift. The causal thread is tight enough for this mode; each move grows out of the prior sensation. Cost is primarily emotional/ideational but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: solar storm → amulet resonance via magnetic fields → spatial mutiny → her choice → experiential revelation → reentry with changed understanding. The single transition is legible, and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with an implied cost (surrender of mystery, reorientation of self). Orientation is strong from the outset. The hybrid lens (causal frame, accumulative payoff) holds through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-scene accumulative design is coherent: ink-triggered revelations reweight the situation until Elara decides to carry the con forward for good. Orientation is crisp, and the closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a concrete vow (find Aris, ensure the asylum). The cost is implied (risk, complicity, moral reframe) more than dramatized. A slightly sharper on-page constraint would elevate the decisive feel.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orientation is strong early (who/where/when), and the accumulative/textural lens holds as hum-density escalates to visions and returns to ordinary hum at daybreak. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the hum as carrier wave and the notepad as translator, sealed by the cadence shift at dawn. The cost is subtle but present (the window closes, the resonance recedes). Quiet but coherent causality supports the lyric turn.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the because/therefore chain holds: discovery → patterning of whispers → assembly → anonymous delivery. Closure lands with cost as K relinquishes self‑restoration to resurrect another’s erased history (Earned Stasis with conceptual price). The middle’s investigation is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly softening pressure. Orientation is firm early, and the final image reconfigures stakes without mechanical over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure mounts via the hum, the compass’s behavior, and the reimagined debate, culminating in the bow stroke and decision to finish the cello. Closure reads as a Conceptual Repricing with an Earned Stasis note (she accepts a new stance: playing and retelling rather than busting). Cost is legible in the compass fading and the relinquishing of a purely debunking posture. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Situational, with a live clock (inspector arrival) and coherent pressure forcing a stance crystallization. Orientation is swift and clean; single POV and scope hold. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: Lyra chooses to bear ongoing cost and keep the city’s heart central, concretized by the chip and mural. The mid‑story “days” montage compresses process efficiently without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Structure is tight and causal under an accumulative/situational lens: discovery → recognition of countdown → endurance → alignment → reveal. Closure lands on the page with cost and payoff (Captured image as shared elegy; her physical strain and the imminent arrival of miners). Orientation is immediate and stable; no lens ambiguity. The only small stretch is her rapid map deduction, but it’s grounded in her expertise and the star‑field cue.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: the failing core → water/light refraction test → diagnosis of overload → gold‑filament patch → drone’s chimes and departure. Orientation is strong by the first paragraph (who/where/what/when), and the single‑scene structure holds. Closure is decisively on‑page as the drone lifts and the horn sounds, though the cost is soft—no material loss or visible sacrifice beyond risk and time squeeze. The lens reads Causal and holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural, with closure as Conceptual Repricing. The pattern tightens from dusk and rust to unnaturally unified ice, to the submerged city and the “before‑place” word, culminating in a reweighted premise (source as absence/time). Orientation is clean early; the final choice to herald/write lands on the page with a conceptual price. The only slight limitation is the primarily internal, contemplative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: days of calibrated walking accumulate toward the evening declaration and the town’s reply. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: echoes appear, align, then fade, leaving a charged stasis. Cost is present but soft—her restoration is fleeting, not permanent—which reweights the final quiet. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: arrival → entry → contact with memories → negotiated exchange → unsnarling → extraction → death tone → charged final image. Closure is on the page with cost: the sender dies as the vial seals, reweighting her mission from rescue to preservation. The because/therefore logic holds without soft resets or conveniences. The final cadence is earned and decisively reconfigures the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Causal. Because the storm loosens the door, he descends; because he finds lattice/bodies, the lie‑entity manifests; therefore he chooses truth‑speech to starve it. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change (entity unravels) paired with a Charged Poise (waiting to face the boat), with cost implied by “before they find the bodies.” Orientation is crisp early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal drive is clean: Elara appears → offers bead → Leo touches → awakening → Elara dissolves. Orientation is established early (greenhouse/orchard, Leo, ghost), and the closure lands on the page with palpable cost. The single-scene structure tightens at the pattern break (“She did not fade”). Minor convenience in the bead’s late arrival is mitigated by prior seeding through her task and debt.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual action accrues toward a dawn cadence shift where water returns. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the copper plate → sewing → rumble → flow progression is coherent. Closure lands on the page with cost (night’s labor, aching body) and a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration (repair as testament rather than restoration). No teleports or soft resets; set‑ups pay off precisely.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain is clean: map → orchard → slab → rebuild gnomon → entrance → scrolls → repriced meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the sundial’s shadow “like a bridge,” connecting her to lineage. Orientation is solid from the outset. Cost is felt but modest, keeping it just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal chain: deadline → failure to find code → chalk numbers → angled alignment → hidden message → alias → mailing at dawn. Orientation lands early (place, time, role) and the scene stays within a tight window. Closure reads as a charged poise/earned stasis: the letter’s dispatched and Kael’s self‑conception reconfigures. The cost is light but legible through the deadline and the “almost missed” solve.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: discovery via embroidery → decoding the hidden warning → strategy (Western Gate) → persuading the guard → coup foiled. Closure is decisive and on-page; the assassins are stopped by an action traceable to her choices. The cost is modest, with a relatively easy persuasion turn that slightly softens the climax’s weight. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the Hybrid lens leans Causal at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the singing, moonlight, and ritual objects accrue toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is early and clean; the shard and leaf condensation provide a concrete on‑page turn. The ending’s leave‑behind (letters) and path opening provide a legible before/after with cost. Minor softness in causal pressure (guides are accommodating) keeps it shy of perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a causal lens, each move (“she notices → asks → deciphers → he speaks”) tightens toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the opening and never wavers. Closure is on‑page: the boy’s first words and the reweighted coral image carry felt cost. Minor convenience in quick deciphering doesn’t fracture causality.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → idea → making → communal reception → fade → repriced understanding. Closure lands with cost: the light dies as the sun drops, and the installation dissolves, leaving only a charged afterimage and a reconfigured stance. Orientation is solid early (who/where/when), and the single-scene structure is clean. The “knowledge network” skirts magical convenience but coheres tonally and motivates placements.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: breeze → resonance → vision → interpretive choice → completion → symphony. Closure lands on‑page via a decisive act (not repairing but completing the fracture), with a conceptual cost (departing conservation orthodoxy) and reward (legacy claimed). The cost could be underlined more viscerally, but the structure is tight and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: discovery → method → detection → emergency signal + destruction → arrest → proliferating noise that reweights the system. Closure lands with cost (imprisonment) and a conceptual repricing that the Auditors can tax thoughts but not chaotic fields. Orientation is firm early and the hybrid lens (causal action yielding an accumulative/noise outcome) holds. No major causality or setup debts.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds through the wind’s discord into a cadence shift when the note resolves and the postcard pulses. The closure (RR) lands on the page with a visible cost (agony → sleep), and the before/after is legible. Orientation is clean early (who, where, why), and beats link coherently. No teleports or rule breaks; the inner logic of wind‑songs → words → peace is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats link cleanly: failing chime → improvised humming → cascading retrievals → dawn’s earned stasis. Orientation is crisp early, and closure lands on‑page with a reconfiguration of method and role. The price (the chime’s deepening crack, the last‑chance sweep) is felt though not dramatized as total loss. A hairline short of 9 due to the relatively soft on‑page consequence to the chime at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the vow‑by‑glyph method coheres into a cadence shift: the text “unsnarls,” the hum gathers, and the conceptual key turns. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing plus a choice: she has learned how to listen and will go to them before paths diverge. Orientation is clean and the single‑scene arc holds. The on‑page cost is modest (emptied ink, elapsed night, social risk), but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear causal chain: anomalous tremor → console deception → forensic clue → mentor’s “encrypted compassion” → strategic reroute and bleed‑off → harmonic stabilization. The closure lands on the page with a felt cost (rejecting mentor’s drastic solution while risking a delicate fix). Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the lens remains causal throughout. Minor plausibility stretch in the adhesive/eyelash deduction doesn’t break the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Causal. Parcel arrival → confession → investigative assembly → decision to mail culminates in a Decisive Change that forecloses isolation. Orientation is clean early; set‑ups (dust, attic, “paper trails,” pigeons vs. person) pay off at closure. Cost is legible in the departure from the attic and the exposure risk of tracked mailing.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under a causal lens, the beats link cleanly: logbook → terrace vantage → grain-map decoding → stabilized path → reunion. Closure is on-page: a decisive change (finding Leo) plus conceptual repricing (thresholds sacred due to faith and design). Cost is primarily emotional and inferred, not deeply dramatized, slightly softening impact. Orientation is clear from the outset, and the single-scene arc holds.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, cause flows cleanly: feather → panic → ascent → fireflies → breathing sync → revaluation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the feather becomes “relic, not chain,” with an on‑page cost of relinquishing the old grip of trauma. Orientation is crisp early, and the single scene contains one measured cadence shift. Slight tidiness at the very end keeps it just shy of the 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: props and images accrue toward a Conceptual Repricing (“paths disappear… require a translator of heart”) with the seedling as costed emblem. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the causal chain (seed → glyphs → reconstruction → planting) is coherent. The cost is felt—knowledge reframes loss—though the escalation is soft. Closure lands clearly and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene, cleanly oriented, with a coherent accumulative/textural drive: patterns accrue through moves and sounds until a cadence-breaking sacrifice reweights the stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the choice of harmony over checkmate has visible conceptual cost (foregone victory) and crystallizes the rules of his method. Causality remains intact; each move alters the score, not just the position. A slight softness in the external stakes keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Resonant Reconfiguration with Earned Stasis. The scene coheres and tightens toward the ignition of the verse; the before/after is legible as she reconfigures exile into a portable eternity. Orientation is clean from the outset; the causal chain is simple but sufficient. The cost is implied (illegality, solitude, pain) rather than confronted on the page, keeping it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the ripple-reading prompts a return; the lighthouse lens reframes his private ritual into public utility; the final light image reconfigures meaning. Closure is a conceptual repricing—meditation becomes calibration—with a quiet, conceptual cost (acceptance of responsibility) rather than a dramatic one. Orientation is clean from the outset. The single turn is sufficient but not deeply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive: present‑tense ritual accrues pressure from arrival to opening to dispersal. Orientation is clean early; the porcelain box and ridge frame a single continuous scene. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she redefines saving as witnessing and pays the cost by letting go. The cost is legible on the page in the repeated pinches until the box is empty and the emotional stance reconfigures.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates through pattern density: low needle → drip correlation → harmonic drawings → final spiral. Closure lands on‑page with the gauge’s “sang” and world reweighting; the before/after is legible. The cost is conceptual (discarding her core theory) rather than visceral, but the acceptance earlier earns the repricing at the end. Orientation (who/where/what) is clean from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: diaries → clue (“silent eye,” “sighing corner”) → acoustic test → secret panel → negative. Orientation is swift and stable, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration where she accepts custodianship (“the burden… now hers”). The cost is subdued but legible in the legacy responsibility. Escalation is modest yet coherent under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds to the mirror’s activation and a bell‑struck cadence break. Closure lands on page via Charged Poise: she gains a map of possibility as the heartbeat departs and light fades. Causality is motivated by tools and timing (parapet after rain, hush before bells) without contrivance. Cost is legible in the heartbeat’s departure and the collapse of the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single scene, clean orientation, and a coherent causal chain: alignment → ritual → seal → aftermath. Closure is decisive and on‑page—the war ends—and the cost is legible in their silence and shuddering breath, plus the charged acceptance of flawed peace. The drive lens reads Hybrid with Situational pressure (ticking celestial window) and Accumulative cadence (ritual intensifies), held through the end. A minor softness: no complication tests their resolve mid‑ritual, keeping escalation smooth rather than tightening via obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single‑scene causal spine is clean: because of the acoustics and his plan, he seeks the basin’s heart; the thunder lull functions as a clock; the felt warmth triggers repricing; he chooses release and leaves the egg as rain starts. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis with cost: he forecloses his designed echo and gives up the trophy. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph. The rain ending the manufactured drought deepens the before/after without solving the conflict by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the pattern densifies from snow → thread → prism → vortex → reconfiguration, culminating in a clear CR/RR (“She had untangled the threads and unlocked herself”). Orientation is clean from the outset; the single transition to the sanctuary is legible and purposeful. Closure lands, though the cost is mostly conceptual (loss of compliance’s safety) rather than concretely dramatized. The sequence escalates once meaningfully without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: dome → discovery → tactile reversal → conceptual turn → new plan. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the closure is a decisive reorientation (new companion pamphlets) with conceptual repricing of “truth.” The on‑page cost is implied rather than dramatized, muting peak impact. Still, the cadence shift at the end lands and reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: altar → sighting → crack interrupts → entanglement → silk‑knot tactic → release → resonant marker left behind. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (the butterfly freed) and a resonant reconfiguration (the knot as unrecorded history). Cost is felt but modest, leaning conceptual over concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds from setup (ice, aurora, motive) to the decisive method switch (rope reweave) and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration: names return as sound and light. Orientation is crisp from the outset. Closure lands on the page with a clear before/after; the cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized as risk. A slightly soft pressure curve keeps it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds as dream imagery and environmental pressure cohere toward a Conceptual Repricing: bunker→egg, maintenance→outgrowing. Beats link cleanly (dream → search → discovery → activation), and the cost (renouncing directive/body) is legible on the page. Orientation is crisp early, the storm serves as ticking pressure, and the final image reweights prior material decisively. No causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: discovery → confrontation → counter‑method → uncloak → covenant. Orientation is early and clean; each turn arises from prior choices (her chant burns his charts; he answers with calculation). Closure lands on the page with a clear cost—he becomes warden, not master—and the final image reweights the premise. No teleporting props or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Situational lens holds: Elara applies pressure; the broken pin creates a reversal; Kael’s stance shifts. Closure lands as a quiet Decisive Change/Earned Stasis—he relinquishes his combative posture with a felt, if subdued, cost. Orientation is clean (library, stained glass, two characters), and causal steps track. The cost could be sharpened beyond “weary acceptance” to reach higher.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a primarily Accumulative/Textural lens with causal threads, the beats tighten cleanly: arrival → ritual → emergence → destabilization → conceptual shift → calm capture. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes the goal from imprisonment to tenancy, and the sextant’s collapse marks cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and no set-ups are abandoned. The ending’s cost is gentle but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: image density builds from wreckage to orchard to rainbow mosaic, culminating in a conceptual repricing—deciduous vows reframing the breach. Orientation is crisp, and the causal throughline (bag contents → lens → pendulum → gift) is coherent. Closure lands on‑page with cost: she forecloses the Guild path and converts her practice into a generational talisman. The turn is quiet but decisive, with the final act reweighting prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean single‑scene arc under a Situational lens: a coherent constraint (the auto‑writing journal) forces stance crystallization. Closure lands on‑page with cost: she chooses to eat, accepting being “rewritten,” and the cameo resolves to her profile. Causality is tidy (privacy halts inscription, enabling agency) without deus ex machina. Orientation is swift and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, details accrete toward a conceptual turn: search becomes surrender, which unlocks the corridor. Closure lands with cost—the renunciation of direct intent and acceptance of personal fault—followed by a concrete stabilizing of the traveler. The causal thread is clean (diary → reframe → corridor → book → stabilization) though the transition to the corridor reads slightly swift. Orientation is clear from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details and motifs densify toward a conceptual repricing—garden as realization rather than place. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and beats chain plausibly (search → logbook → bow encounter → reweighting). Closure lands on-page with a cost: relinquishing the externalized twin and ending the quest. The single transition (ship dissolving to her room) coherently resolves the metaphor without breaking scene continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is crisp (who/where/when grounded within the first paragraph), and the causal chain is clean: door appears → knot studied → braid reconfigured → seal activates → vision → journal fills. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and implied duty as cost. One scene, single POV, tight arc. The cost could be sharper, but the reweighting of responsibility suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: hum vs. hush builds toward a reweighted rule—silence as active force. The on‑page closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the caves integrate the energy beings; the price is the relinquished old maps and the sustained effort to coax sound from ice. Escalation is clean (dark stone → flicker → single note → expanding hush) without causality breaks. Cost is present but subtle, leaning more spiritual than materially constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned nights → rare convergence → fracture‑born galaxy and tone. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she doesn’t restore the old beam; she births a new beacon, accepting the loss while gaining meaning. The cost is legible—the old function remains dead; the world’s hush persists outside the bubble—and the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is clear and stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene accumulative structure tightens from method to doubt to self-confrontation to reconfiguration. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she recommits, adding her own story, acknowledging the cost of the life not lived. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when) and the magical rules remain consistent. The fog’s sealing of the world and storm-light’s role persist as constraints shaping the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene accumulative build: arrival, sensing, blueprint discovery, doubt, ignition, transformation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the oppressive hush is reweighted by silent, azure-gold blooms—with on-page act and conceptual cost. Orientation is clean early; the drive lens (accumulative/textural) holds through the ending. Stakes aren’t vast but are paid off precisely where promised.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal chain: argument pause → grotto → jade contact → vision → reconfiguration of their stance. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise rather than a decisive change, with some cost implied by foreclosed futures. Orientation is strong and the single‑scene window holds. The supernatural device resolves pressure quickly, softening felt price at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats cohere: set‑up of the trellis and hour, inversion, panic, the sprout, and a reweighted ending. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing/Resonant Reconfiguration—she reframes silence and self, with the sprout as persistent cost/mark. Orientation is clean and the rule (hour of inversion) is honored to the end. The turn is graceful rather than hard‑edged, but its consequence is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres from whistle echo to terrace hush, with a clean cadence shift when the glass settles and the man’s breathing changes. Orientation is crisp from the outset (Aethel, canals, terrace) and the storm glass provides a recurring hinge. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a practiced ritual that transforms absence into presence, with the cost of Elara re-entering noise registered on the page. The causal thread is gentle but intact—movement to the Terrace enables the final state.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive (causal spine with accumulative memory ascent) holds: waterfall → orchard → murals → ruby → vortex → stair → vantage/bridge. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: the throne’s purpose is recast and the flake becomes a call that opens a bridge for others. The sunrise clock nudges pace and keeps pressure present, though the cost signal is more implied duty than dramatized sacrifice. Orientation is immediate and consistent across the single transition.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Situational lens holds: the knock intrudes, the test tightens, suffocation forces a stance, and the decisive change arrives with Kael’s first true breath. Closure is on the page, with scars reweighted from chains to maps (resonant reconfiguration). Causality is clean and props/rules pay off (ash transmits voice; the threshold governs entry). Stakes remain coherent and resolve without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear causal chain: glitch texts → sub bay → bolt → decision to act → escalating pressure → crystallizing outcome. Closure is on‑page with cost: she nearly gets crushed, then reemerges reconfigured (diamond and worldview), satisfying a Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing hybrid. Orientation is clean early (farm, decommissioned station, sub), and the situational pressure coheres. No major unkept setups; the final stopping of messages neatly closes the loop.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: missing handle → search → wire “bridge” → tone reveals handle → winding yields the grandfather’s message → conceptual repricing at the end. The closure lands on the page as a decisive reweighting (she closes the ledger and leaves), with a legible cost. Orientation is crisp from the opening. The lens is Causal and holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative texture and a causal hinge: each unsnapping intensifies pressure and culminates in a reconfigured world (“a new, blank page”). Closure lands on the page via the decisive act and the charged final image (mini‑knight self‑willed), with a felt conceptual price (“unsnap the old”). Orientation is clean and single‑scene. The cost is more metaphysical than material, but it’s legible and tied to the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is clean: button → marginalia hint → dust rectangle → photograph, each deepening knowledge and tightening the inquiry. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the cadence shift at the photograph lands as on‑page closure. The cost is legible in the final renunciation/acceptance—he keeps working, carrying ache with reweighted meaning. No causality breaks; all set‑ups pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: dead-drop erased → puddle-map insight → docks → phone booth key → packet → searchlight → culvert escape. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she pays immediate cost (risk and grime) and recommits to reappear under pressure. Orientation is swift and consistent; no teleporting props or late rule changes. The patrol skiff’s arrival is credible escalation rather than a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean and single‑scene; orientation lands early and the causal chain is tight: light arrives → prophecy activates → counter‑sequence neutralizes → cost. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the cadence tightens at first light and resolves with the dewdrop “applause,” giving on‑page closure. The price—spiritual exhaustion and the necessity to repeat tomorrow—registers on the page. No causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Causal. Beats link cleanly—discovery of the speck, experimentation on leaves, reweighted prophecy, decisive planting, and on‑page transformation. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (relinquishing ordering for sowing) shown in the final action and image. The inciting coincidence (finding the speck) is acceptable; cost is present but softly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: observed patterns → descent → waterfall/greenhouse → compass rediscovery → conceptual turn. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the compass redefines navigation as probabilistic planning, reweighting her role with a visible renunciation of certainty. Orientation is clear early and maintained. The cost is present but modest, keeping it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single continuous scene with strong orientation; causal flow is clean (ritual → warming/vein → vision → reconfiguration). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she reframes Kael and forecloses the “lost” narrative at a felt cost. The drive lens reads Hybrid with an accumulative lyric build paying off causally through the ritual. Slight convenience in the vision providing definitive knowledge keeps it shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: tooth → tuning → distortion → hiccup → laughter → release. Orientation lands early (Echo Gorge, sunrise, the trapped soul), and the structure holds a single scene. Closure arrives on‑page via decisive change and a resonant reconfiguration of the gorge’s emotional register, though the cost is more implied than felt. The chosen lens reads as Causal with a lyric texture and stays coherent through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: sensation → patterning → pedestal reflection. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a visible act (releasing the strap) and the cost of endured pain encoded throughout. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph and the single scene holds cleanly. The epiphanic turn skirts neatness but is supported by seeded math/pattern motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid drive leaning accumulative: sensory and symbolic density builds toward the activation of the lens, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration (“no longer just a translator, but a keeper”). Causality holds—intuition pull → stall → painting → choice to release—and the charged final image lands on the page. Cost is implied (taking on the burden of others’ histories) rather than dramatized in consequence, keeping it shy of the top band. Orientation is clean and the single-scene scope is tight.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: dust pattern → ghost cue → cracked medallion → hidden mainspring → empty cylinder → restoration → chime → release. Orientation is swift and clean; single‑scene focus fits length. Closure lands on‑page with the bell’s chime and the ghost’s smile; the cost is mostly conceptual (years of secrecy and Leo’s ongoing burden), which reads, if softly. The drive lens is Causal and holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the whisper’s release densifies and reweights the world until a closure beat that conceptually reprices order versus lived immediacy. Causality is clean (press → rupture → destabilization → reconfiguration), and the cost is on‑page (the perfect system undone, texts blurred, structure groaning). Orientation is anchored early (who/where/when). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost and a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the storm’s approach, the mirror ritual, and the shard’s revelations intensify toward a conceptual repricing at the close. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the set-ups (mirror ritual, shard, dispute) all pay off. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she chooses a eulogy over combat, with the shard as proof. The cost is primarily conceptual/identity-based, not dramatic, which keeps it just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: diagnosis → shadow contact → tether/vision → corrective light → restored song/light. Closure lands on the page with cost (she nearly collapses) and a decisive change (shadow shatters; box plays true; light returns). The single transition into the vision is motivated and contained. The drive lens reads Causal throughout and holds at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean orientation and a single, continuous scene build toward a resonant reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The closure is on‑page: he refuses to collect, reframing his life’s practice with a felt cost. Causal throughline remains coherent (descent → lagoon → psychometry → compass activation → renunciation). The cost is implicit but legible in the choice to leave the jar empty.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    The accumulative/textural drive holds: storm pressure → numinous vision → reconfigured purpose → coda with the hiker. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—she joins an alliance and her art becomes conduit—with a felt cost. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph, and the single POV stays stable. Stakes shift from immediate survival to existential/artistic, with a clean cadence at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation, lens, and causality are clean: study → spectral beam → loose flagstone → journal → conceptual answer and new vow. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (faith as unseen pact via moths), with a final decision to paint the pavilion ceiling. The cost is delicate (solitude, relinquishing the romance of “moon-only” mystery) rather than hard, which trims impact slightly. The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: decrypt diary → retrocognitive trap → coordinates → confrontation → parley → revelation → release. Single POV with one purposeful transition, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the trap broken and a covenant assumed. Cost is conceptual/emotional rather than physical but felt and on‑page. Orientation is crisp early (“floating library,” “white dunes”), and the lens holds through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual’s build—idea → apparatus → circuit → projection—tightens cleanly to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when). Closure lands on the page with cost: she constructs eternity but remains alone among echoes. Causal beats are coherent, with no late rule change undermining the end.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under a clear causal lens, each beat tightens: courier’s arrival → playback → immersive discovery of the harmonic → stakes redefined → decisive destruction. Orientation is crisp within the first paragraph, and the piece stays in a single, coherent scene. Closure is a decisive act with cost, transforming her mandate into a self-imposed silence. The cost is legible in the final image of melting the shaving and accepting the void.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single scene, single POV, clean anchors, and a coherent causal flow from hatching to dissipation to containment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the inheritance is secured with the cost of returning cold, and the premise is repriced by the “granular time” insight. The Hybrid lens leans Accumulative at the end; pattern density and cadence tighten around the ritual. Cost is legible on the page (fading warmth, creeping ice, and the labor of gathering seconds).

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Situational lens holds: a coherent external pressure (test deadline, lever failure, hymn’s emergence) forces a stance crystallization. The causal chain is clean—breakage → rope workaround → glue wait → zero hour hush → hymn → refusal—with no teleporting information. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise; cost is implied (defying mandate, risking late warning) and legible in the foreclosed pull. The price could be sharpened by one concrete on‑page consequence, but the final image carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: the meteor shower intensifies attention → the glass‑mediated tracing → the empathic burn → a chosen new practice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (he is shaken, his role redefined). Orientation is clean from the opening. Cost is felt, if modest, and the pattern holds to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the discovery → study → apparition → placement sequence coheres and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration when the box reforms. Orientation is clean early; the covenant’s starvation frames the dominant stake and tightens options. Cost registers conceptually (he offers self as vessel/keeper and relinquishes speech), though it’s subtle rather than undeniably painful. Closure is on-page and legible, if soft.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: fragment → coded listings → contact → attic diaries → revaluation of the phantom year → identity shift. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with a legible cost (mortality reframed; the “frantic counting” ceases). Orientation is strong from the outset; the hybrid lens holds without contradiction. A slightly expository reveal in the attic keeps it just shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean within the opening lines; the kite’s snap breaks the pattern and the rescue, feather, and journaling accrue toward a Conceptual Repricing (“the story was in the fracture”). The closure lands on the page with a charged final image (feather tucked in the journal), though the cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than narratively risky. Structure holds as one continuous scene with a clear tightening cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a predominantly causal lens, the chain is clean: diagnosis → plan → build → communion → cost → monument. Orientation is immediate and stable; props and rules pay off (pillars as conduits, copper as carrier). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with tangible cost (“the endeavor had taken the last of her”) and a charged final state. The only constraint is the lack of a mid‑scene reversal beyond endurance, though the causal tightening holds.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: command → path → anomalous amber → footprints → triadic trial → fusion → star map → renewed path. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (home as frequency), with the footprints’ return functioning as charged invitation. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than material; it registers but stays gentle. Lens holds (primarily causal with a conceptual end beat), and orientation is crisp from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual → interruption by the bird → reconfigured ritual with a visible price → charged final image. Orientation is crisp; causality is clean (bird forces a pivot, tactics change, seeds are spent). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost on the page (spent seeds, altered vow), crystallized by the first shoots. The convenience of immediate sprouting edges toward fable but supports the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under a Hybrid leaning Accumulative lens, causality is clean: hidden whisper → decoding → search → leaf → tinted projection → conceptual repricing. Orientation is crisp early; no teleporting parts. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual cost (loneliness reweighted into contact) shown on the page. The price is subtle rather than biting, but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern intensifies from paralysis to defiant mapping, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing of “true north.” Orientation is clean early (who/where/when clear by the first paragraph), and the closure unit lands on the page with a charged final image (compass rose + completed map). The constraint of temporally stretched light persists and shapes tactics. Cost is legible as a relinquishment of prior cosmology and acceptance of lonely, ongoing exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: climb → plan → interruption → choice → act → sky restores and role redefined. Orientation is crisp within the first lines; single scene coherence holds. Closure is decisive and on‑page, with a conceptual price attached to rejecting the heist. A minor softness is that external jeopardy remains low, but the internal stakes carry.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from absence to charged restoration: warning → risk acknowledgment → pawn return → renewed walking. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR: the placed pawn and resumed steps reconfigure the interregnum with a felt cost (they’re looking for her; his theft implies danger). Orientation is clean early, and set-ups pay off (missing pawns, “unbind,” the gallery’s acoustics). Stakes are crystallized rather than resolved; the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence builds cleanly: nightly substitution → stone’s resistance → descent and research → feather-triggered eruption → reconfiguration and vow. Closure lands with conceptual repricing and an earned stance shift (“Tonight, she would not substitute her reality”). Cost is explicit (pain of remembering; relinquishing her coping ritual). The feather’s catalytic role is a small coincidence but seeded and paid off in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the tapestry decoding intensifies pattern knowledge, culminating in a CR/Earned Stasis closure where humility is the operative tactic. Orientation lands early and the object returns with transformed meaning. The decisive act (pressing the hidden plate) cleanly reconfigures options and resolves the dominant stake with cost. Minor hand-of-god feel to the mechanism is offset by the humility logic seeded earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orientation is immediate (canyon, bone towers, impending ritual) and the causal chain is clean: he prepares → performs → Elders reframe → he becomes the sacrifice. Closure is on‑page and costly: the Stone of Forgetting to his lips reconfigures the stake decisively. The scene keeps to one window and pays off its set‑ups without teleports or resets. The ritual’s persistent constraint shapes both tactics (echoes) and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orientation is immediate and the scene coheres through a clean arc: work → acceleration → gear snap → final act. Closure lands as an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the world dissolves, but the statue endures as reweighted meaning with visible cost (workshop lost, stakes remain). The persistent constraint of the acid sea shapes tactics throughout. The because/therefore chain holds even in a lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal spine: mirror cracks → vow reawakened → storm route → wrong turn → cave → choice to paint differently → leave it behind. Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a causal thread; the closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the promise is kept at the price of secrecy and loss of access (“She never found the entrance again”). Orientation is swift and stable. Nothing teleports; setup pays off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: scent → beckon → cork falls → lens stutters → cobalt beam → trawler’s turn. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of the lighthouse’s purpose, with the small, felt cost of the lost talisman and a heart-stopping stutter in the light. Hybrid lens reads coherent to the end, with no orientation debt. The cost is modest but present and tied to the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: failure → constraint → advice → reframe → build → new map clarity. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: still stranded yet no longer lost; a cost remains on the page. Orientation anchors quickly and the Hybrid lens holds with accumulative texture supporting causal pivots. The price is mostly conceptual/emotional; a small added material consequence could elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong causal chain: orchard discovery → upload → horrified reveal → confrontation → choice to destroy. Orientation is immediate and legible, and the single POV holds. Closure lands with a decisive change and cost, as they occlude the plans despite shared desperation for safety. The tracking by “psychic resonance” is a light convenience but does not undercut the earned decision.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: corpse with flower → retained boutonnière → inference of destination → walk to cove → photograph → delivery. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration; the final act reweights the whole piece with cost. The leap from “pointing past the lighthouse” to finding a specific cottage is tidy but not implausible. Single POV, two‑shard flow holds together with one meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under a Causal lens, the chain is clean: anomaly → trek → ants/fissure → cavern → pedestal missing “W” → decision. Orientation is swift and stable, and set‑ups (the chip, advice, creek urgency) pay off on the page. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with a conceptual price (abandoning the safe past for unknown possibility), though the cost is a bit idealized. No major causality breaks or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: dreams → climb → grotto → spirit → fireflies → ritual stitching. Orientation is strong early and the single-scene structure holds. Closure lands with a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration as she assumes the hereditary role; cost is implied (“the sacrifice, the eternal watch”) more than enacted. The lens reads Hybrid leaning Causal, and it holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from failing containment to an earned reconfiguration via the nautilus pattern and hymn. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: not saving by caging but saving through transformation. The cost is present (letting go of the original form and role), though the resolution arrives smoothly once the insight occurs, softening impact slightly. Orientation is clean early, and there’s no lens confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: dream images intensify toward a coherent reconfiguration where writing in-dream consolidates timelines and enables the waking choice. Closure lands with cost on the page—leaving the scroll, stepping into morning, choosing to climb. Orientation is clean early and maintained. No causality breaks; the final conceptual repricing is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: fog, water clock, and screw build toward a conceptual repricing as Elara reframes her craft. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the shop scene coheres as one continuous window. Closure lands on the page with cost in the final image (“she breathed in the damp air… felt whole”) while holding the persistent constraint. The because/therefore chain is soft but consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Drive lens: Causal. Each beat links cleanly—quill to rune, pain to crystallization, memory to warding, reinterpretation to shedding—arriving at an on‑page Decisive Change (scar to rune) with legible cost (risk of tearing flesh, running out of breath). Orientation is crisp from the first lines. The closure image reconfigures options and meaning without soft reset or convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominance: because Elara apologizes, she chooses the current; the sensory density intensifies toward a reweighted end-state. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: no forgiveness, but a charged, reconfigured quiet with cost (orchard still falling; strain on Elara; grief persists). Orientation and stakes are anchored early and maintained. The causal chain is clean and the final chord lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is clean early (who/where/why) and the single-scene arc coheres. Under an accumulative/situational lens, pressure builds to a visible reconfiguration as the energies entwine and settle. Closure lands on the page (“The arbitration was complete.”) with a conceptual price (foreclosing purity in favor of synthesis), though the cost is more intellectual than felt. The sequence is coherent with no causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: anomaly → diagnosis (escapement) → high‑risk tactic → countdown → release, with on‑page closure via conceptual repricing. Orientation is crisp by the opening hundred words, and the hydraulic system provides a persistent constraint. Cost is primarily felt and conceptual rather than lasting, but the knife‑edge procedure registers as risk. The Causal lens holds cleanly through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene situational drive holds: an ecological failure forces an immediate response that culminates in a conceptual repricing of “security.” Orientation is clear early (grotto, mushrooms, alarms), and the pressure tightens coherently toward the override. Closure lands as a conceptual reweighting with a visible micro-cost (foregoing the panic button), though the external resolution is executed by the stranger rather than the protagonist. The cost is more interior than material, tempering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: city breadcrumbs → library → lantern vision culminate in a conceptual repricing. Closure lands on‑page with cost as she extinguishes the candle and accepts a reweighted understanding. Orientation is early and clean; the causal thread from scrawls to “Lucian’s Folio” is coherent. Stakes narrow toward a single charged realization without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the harmonica-disc motif layers calls until the man’s crisis is reweighted by the loop, landing a conceptual repricing. Orientation is clean from the outset; the secret booth and night window are anchored early. Closure is quiet but on‑page: the caller’s breath and line “It sounds like people starting over” crystallize the shift, with Silas’s final hum sealing the cadence. The cost is mostly conceptual and borne by Silas’s ongoing solitude and restraint, which reads but could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orientation is immediate (who/where/when), a single scene builds causally from steeping to vision to acceptance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she transitions from archivist-observer to covenant participant with an explicit price. The causal chain (steeping → red glow → understanding → charged final image) is clean and legible. The cost is on the page (“her own life was the ink”), charging the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid drive with causal beats (rumor → astronomer → rock → new rumor → communal ritual) accumulating to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early (ivy‑choked station, relief depot, Elara’s role). Closure lands via the transformed operation and her stance shift, with a conceptual cost (misuse of resources, stopping movement) implied if not stressed. One clean tightening; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as one scene with a clean cadence shift at the monolith and a closure of Conceptual Repricing (stillpoint internalized; compass reweighted). Orientation is swift and clean, and beats accrete via the musical trail. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatic, but the before/after is legible and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong causal chain: anomaly spikes → constructed signal → decoding → theory → pen-into-port → stabilized readings → Elara’s contingency reveal. Closure is a conceptual repricing paired with a decisive act, and orientation is clean from the opening. Some convenience (the pen’s “perfect, improbable fit”) skirts contrivance but is prepped by Elara’s foresight. Cost is primarily internal, but it is legible at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural spine and a causal crest: the pattern of mapping silence is taught, then broken by the speedboat, and reasserted through a decisive act that changes the world (engine cuts). Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the single-scene arc holds. Closure lands with felt cost (grandfather fading; music only she can hear) and a before/after reconfiguration of the harbor’s soundscape. The light magical logic is consistent enough to support the decisive change without wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: break-in → surgical fire → archive discovery → public tapestry with coordinates → decision to leave it. Closure lands as an earned renunciation with cost: she risks exposure and relinquishes sole guardianship. The drive lens reads Hybrid (causal spine with accumulative lyric charge) and holds to the end. A minor plausibility stretch (precise fire revealing a century-hidden slab) doesn’t fracture the logic.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned sound and light densify until the apparition, then release in dissolution. Orientation is clear early (who, where, what she wants), and the closure lands on the page with cost. The ending functions as a resonant reconfiguration—proof gained, companionship lost. No causality gaps or teleported rules; the ritual’s result and price feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal line: storm scrambles comms → she leverages old wiring → uses key on manual port → whispers to the AI → receives the map. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the scene holds a single, coherent stake and window. Closure lands with a tangible outcome (AI answers; new map) that reconfigures her status. The on‑page cost is modest, lowering peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mirror lesson → shutter language → student’s own pattern. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with felt price (exertion, exposure, acceptance of a new voice). Orientation is crisp, and the final shared gaze reweights the world without didactic tying-off. Cost is modest but present on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: the library hush, week‑long prep, and synchronized windows accrete to a charged final image. Causality is clean—he hears Leo’s resignation, therefore escalates to the display, therefore Leo reconfigures belief. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with emotional cost paid in Aris’s vulnerability and the boy’s relinquished fatalism. Orientation is solid from the opening; no lens slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid lens with a causal spine (find scrimshaw → sail → song → heart → surrender) supported by lyric accumulation. Closure is a Decisive Change with cost: detachment and metamorphosis on the page. The island’s function and the scrimshaw-as-tumbler stitch earlier beats to the climax cleanly. The “he understood the core concept” line is a small tell, but it doesn’t break escalation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: routine hum → pattern break (turbines stop) → deepened choice culminating in a charged, chosen quiet. Closure arrives on the page as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he reconfigures the hush from imposed to chosen, with felt cost (risk of re‑education, surrender of his shield). Orientation is clean from the opening. The final image (bird on bouquet in still air) crystallizes before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: contact with the quartz deepens pressure toward a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing in which identity and method crystallize. Orientation is clean by ~120 words (who/where/why) and the single scene maintains temporal coherence. Closure lands on the page with cost (“not a shout, but a quiet, seismic shift,” then refusing defiance for paraphrase), reweighting the premise. The ending image (page accepted, she carries the song) seals the before/after without mechanical tying‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain is clean: phoenix aftermath → courtyard encounter → shared secrets → proposed barter → plant‑instrument → note → rose awakens → Elian sees red. Closure lands as a decisive change with a clear before/after in perception; the lens reads Causal and holds. Cost is more conceptual than felt, limiting impact slightly, but the ending is earned by prior set‑ups (reed, plants, failure ethos). Orientation is solid from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; the density shifts from failed recordings to focused listening, culminating in a charged final image. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: from broadcasting to listening, with the child’s response as proof. Orientation is clean (who/where/when set early) and the build from lab to plaza provides one cohesive tightening. The cost—letting go of her old role—registers on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid drive: a causal trail (cranes → observatory → etching) culminates in an accumulative conceptual repricing of death and art. Orientation is clean, single POV, with a clear before/after anchored by the final return to the workshop. Closure lands: she adopts a new practice and mandate with implied cost. The didactic mentor beat edges toward convenience but does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Drive lens: Causal leading to Conceptual Repricing at closure. Each discovery (“circuitry” on the tape → matched to The Circuit → building → floorboard → journal) flows because/therefore, culminating in a reweighted role. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; the closure’s cost is responsibility rather than a concrete sacrifice, but it’s legible. The chain avoids coincidences resolving the core question.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: psychic residue grows, pattern avoidance maddens, Heart-Space realization reweights everything. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/goal), and the archive’s rule-set is taught through action. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with felt cost (loss of innocence into “serene, joyful sorrow”). The throughline stays tight to one dominant stake without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. Investigation → anomaly discovery → theory → deliberate experiment → shadow returns and alters the stone; each link is clean and motivated. Closure lands on the page with cost (her “peculiar draining”) and a decisive change in world-state (the unbound shadow returns, the stone metamorphoses). The turn arrives a touch smoothly (first attempt succeeds), but the groundwork justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is immediate: Elara in a misty workshop post‑betrayal; the causal throughline (con → tail clue → repair) holds cleanly. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration under a Hybrid lens (accumulative lyric texture with causal anchors): she renounces vengeance in favor of repair, and the cost is the relinquishment of anger and a reckoning with her error. The ending image (tail twitch, tranquil hues) seals a before/after without over‑explaining. Minor plausibility questions about reptile biology don’t touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: anesthesia fog → plant telepathy → root distress → tunnel → orb → sacrificial contact → hourglass turns. Orientation is firm by ~120 words; single POV and scope stay tight. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: scars become a key and the miracle is anchored, reweighting prior images. Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional; a hair more explicit jeopardy would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: booth setup → incubation → psychometry vision → delivery. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: a lifetime of “unused love” redefined and returned, marked by the single tear. Orientation is clean from the outset; the causal thread is modest but coherent and sufficient for this mode. The final act (handing over the can) lands the change on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the vigil’s density and pattern break (the voice, the star’s path) reweight the central stake. Orientation is immediate, and the sextant alignment causally triggers the vision; the subsequent painting scene cleanly resolves the drive. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis with a visible before/after. The cost is subtle but legible in the renunciation of the prior method.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: anomaly → contact with the archive → overwhelming perception → guided curation → chosen stasis. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the closure lands on the page with cost (“She would remain here… forever”). The frozen clock and gardener stance reconfigure the premise into a charged poise. No causality breaks or late rule patches mar the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene tightens from awakening → temple → unraveling → threshold, culminating in a Decisive Change (crossing) with on‑page cost. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/when), and the small gear payoffs are causally coherent. The closure image reconfigures the premise without backfilling mechanics to cheat stakes. Minor reliance on explanatory phrasing (“This was not destruction; it was revelation”) slightly softens pressure but doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the passage through indirect waters → vigil → ridge creates a tightening cadence culminating in the climb. Closure arrives as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: the star dims after enabling the ascent, marking a before/after with cost. Orientation is clean from the first lines and no causality breaks. Minor risk: pressure is primarily internal, but each stage measurably narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: Leo remains → leads her to the disused sector → discoloration and bolt → hidden chamber → journal → repriced understanding. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a charged final stance. Orientation is crisp from the opening; single scene with one transition stays within scope. Cost is mostly conceptual (risk to defy imposed silence) rather than enacted, keeping it below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: clue → activation → rune → targeted unraveling → spent ink, with a clean two‑shard delivery (library to court). Closure is decisive—the lie collapses on the page—and the cost registers in the rune’s expenditure and the still‑empty throne. Orientation is crisp from the opening line, and set‑ups pay off without teleports. Pressure could tighten further pre‑act, but the structure remains elegant and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discovery of the torn page → research spiral → conceptual repricing and a new stance. Orientation is clean early and props/payoffs are honored. Closure lands via Earned Stasis/CR as he reconfigures purpose and enshrines loss with a visible cost. The because/therefore is soft, but the patterning and cadence shift make the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and the sequence escalates coherently: ritual → hum → circle step → call → projection → repricing. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the hum-driven intensification and the final reweighting land cleanly. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: awe reframes rebellion, with options altered for the group. The cost is primarily conceptual rather than dramatized, keeping this below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal throughline (decode pattern → harmonic hum → unseal → sprout). Orientation lands immediately (who, where, what she wants), and the closure places a concrete on‑page change with conceptual repricing—this is not restoration but grafting. Cost is implied (defying the council) rather than tested in scene, slightly softening the payoff. Structure holds as a single tightening sequence without spurious detours.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure tightens from jet-triggered flashback to a controlled return via tactile focus. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she reconfigures the photo’s meaning and recommits to tending, with the trauma intact as cost. Orientation is clean from the opening. No causality gaps; pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pressure mounts as the room “closes in,” then reconfigures through the work, culminating in the Tower/Star synthesis. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with a visible cost (“the luminescent ache remained”). Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the pattern taught by the prose is paid off in the final image. The beat sequence is simple but coherent and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single continuous scene with clean anchors; the accumulative/textural lens holds as image density crescendos to a conceptual repricing. Closure lands: she recognizes the mind’s lie and forecloses her prior tactic by leaving tools, paying a visible cost. Because/therefore linkages are intact (eclipse → experiment → sigil → realization → renunciation). The final walk into the desert is an Earned Stasis/CR hybrid with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Causal. Each move follows cleanly—find → read → decide → propagate → wait → citywide chimes—culminating in a Charged Poise/RR closure where the order is reweighted by seeded doubt. Cost is legible in her chosen complicity and the poised threat of consequences. Orientation is clear from the outset, and the single scene holds its pressure through to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Situational lens holds: intruder breaches sanctuary; Elara’s stance shapes options; the blade’s sheathing marks the decisive change; the ending image reweights the world’s chaos against her cultivated order. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph. Cost is modest but legible—the risk of refusing violence and committing to pacifist continuity under threat. The cadence tightens once (crack → confrontation → surrender) and lands in a charged stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: the constellations create the garden’s hum; instability opens the window; Kaelen navigates delicately; “voicing silence” captures the echo. Orientation is clean by ~120 words and the single-scene structure stays coherent. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (echo sealed in iron) and a felt cost (carrying the goddess’s sorrow), though the price is more inferred than dramatized. The throughline stays tight with no teleports or resets.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal drive is clean: call → doubt → method → investigation → discovery → confession. Closure lands as a decisive change with cost, and the object/setting recur to charge the final image. The archival “smoking gun” arrives a bit conveniently, but not enough to undercut the turn. Orientation is clear early and held throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under a causal lens, the chain is tight: glitch → letters → origin/formulas → tethering act → cleansed firmware. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the closure is an on-page decisive change with an earned emotional cost (“not forgotten, but… laid to rest”). The amber functions as a persistent constraint shaping the final tactic. The loop logic (Alistair → Elara → cry) coheres without a late rule change.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural held throughout; pressure accrues via atmosphere, mandala construction, and the emergent hush, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the tile’s fall sets a contained causal chain. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (connection over single truth) with a felt hush that reweights the scene, though the cost is soft. The single‑scene arc is coherent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Situational lens holds: orders to rename and clear the family apply coherent pressure; the tessera experience deepens options; the decisive renaming reconfigures stakes. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when). Closure lands via Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing (the sector’s name shifts meaning and future). On‑page cost remains implied (disciplinary danger) rather than enacted, trimming peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: Elara uses the coin to conjure echoes → Leo experiences them through synesthesia → he anchors the coin → Elara releases. Orientation is quick and stable, and the single-scene build lands a resonant, on-page closure with a felt cost. The drive lens reads Hybrid with causal dominance at the end, and the final image (coin in palm) seals the reconfiguration. No set-ups are left unkept.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Clear orientation and a coherent build: static shock → pill → somatic pull → geode memory → light‑painting act → captured image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration via the final web‑heart image that reweights the initial block. The cost is more conceptual/emotional than concrete, but present on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds from calm mapping to the reliquary reveal and the translation into sound, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration when grief shifts from crimson to gold. Orientation is clean, single‑scene flow holds, and the closure image lands. Cost is present conceptually (bearing witness and taking on stewardship) but remains gentle, limiting a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is immediate (amber warehouse, hourglasses, Elara’s role) and the accumulative/textural lens is taught and held. The closure lands on the page: Elara empties her catalog and flips the system, a decisive change coupled with conceptual repricing of the prophecy. Causal links are clean—catalog → harmonized wisdom → reinterpretation → tactic—though the price paid reads more symbolic than materially costly. The single-scene build is coherent and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: deciphering snow code → unearthing pillbox → revelation of true betrayal locus → confrontation with operative → choice to present the box. Closure lands as a charged decision with cost and altered options; she shifts from ghost to “weapon reforged.” Orientation is clean early, and the single scene holds. A hair shy of exceptional only because the mole revelation is delivered via note rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orientation is immediate (coachman, fog, swollen river), and the structure holds a single, continuous scene. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ticking gutters function as a live clock; when they stop, options change and the vow is fulfilled. Closure lands on the page with a visible conceptual cost: surrendering the hidden vellum to the river. A small convenience—the quick, precise find in the spine—keeps it just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the thrum → fracture → lens insight → refigured making → knitting closure is clean. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the place preserves kindness; Aris answers by remaking his vessel’s intent and installing the glass. Cost is quiet but legible (abandoning the initial design; submitting craft to memory’s ethic). Orientation is solid from the first paragraph; backstory is earned via the glass and reweights the present.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual density builds to the gauge‑as‑fixture and the moonbeam shattering—a resonant reconfiguration on the page. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the ending’s “tiny constellation” crystallizes a before/after without false neatness. The cost is legible: she forecloses keeping the rose’s beauty and accepts its void to birth a new answer. The closure reads earned and contained within the scene’s mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clear: high tide focuses light → hum resolves → sundial unlocks → map reveals ship → she chooses to launch. Single POV and one scene hold. Closure lands as a decisive change with a conceptual repricing of the library’s role; the cost is implied more than dramatized. Orientation is crisp from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats cohere: rain → nest with her words → decision → installation → communal reveal. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration when she reframes her role publicly, with a conceptual cost (relinquishing ghosthood). The thrush’s use of her draft is a neat coincidence but doesn’t break causality. The on‑page cost is more implied than felt, keeping this just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: town division → covert plan → transmission → unraveling of the signal → communal release. Closure is a Decisive Change with a modest but legible cost (risk, exhaustion, social stakes). Orientation is clean early; the single-scene structure stays coherent. The resolution is a touch convenient (clean tone of confirmation), but it remains earned by her prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: compass grasp → organ tone → blueprint etching → key insertion → niche opens → lens projects star map. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act and a conceptual reweighting (knowledge as the “key”). Orientation is strong and the single‑scene frame stays tight. Cost is present but light (risking entrapment/fear; the organ’s cessation hints at a price), keeping it just shy of the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid drive: causal deduction through the ribbon → mask → contradictions → twin, landing in an accumulative charged-poise ending. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes the case and herself, with an on‑page cost (newly awakened, painful empathy) and a concrete next action. Orientation is clear early and the structure holds. Slight neatness in the twin leap tempers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean: research → coordinates → grave dig → ritual → apparent failure → manifestation and release. Orientation is solid from the outset; the single POV and two‑shard structure (outside/inside) cohere. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and a resonant environmental shift, with mild but real cost. The mechanism (reversible exile) is used rather than merely asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence tightens cleanly: disappearance → failed plate → encounter and cryptic cue → reframed method → charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: she forecloses the path of “solve the man” and chooses “map the moment,” with the felt cost of accepted unknowability on the page. Orientation is crisp from line one (who/where/when). The fiddler’s cue pays off causally without coincidence resolving the core tension.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    The situational lens holds: an intruder’s arrival coherently pressures Leo into a tactic that crystallizes his stance and culminates in renunciation. Orientation is clean from the start (rusting circus train, dusk, cache), and beats follow clear because/therefore logic. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with a visible cost in “He left the strongbox open and empty.” Slightly more on‑page friction about the loss would nudge this into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clean: telegram → star method → conceptual click → dream‑message → evacuation confirmed. The closure lands via Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing—temples redefined as events and the city’s fear recast—though the decisive consequence (evacuation) occurs off‑stage. Orientation is strong early; the single transition is legible. The lack of a sharper on‑page price at the end limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear causal chain: failed ritual → vortex → frozen confession → reveal of seed → integrate rather than destroy → lake clears. The closure is a decisive change with on‑page cost (self‑indictment and choosing integration over eradication) and the drive lens holds cleanly. The confession shatter is the meaningful tightening that narrows options. No orientation debt; the ending reconfigures options rather than hand‑waving them away.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear early (Elara in the cobalt glade at the moment of the eclipsed covenant), and escalation proceeds via iterative linking that simplifies the maze and tightens toward the stone circle. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost—the world’s scars reweighted into connective tissue through her anchored body. The “keeper” arrival is a touch convenient but coheres with the taught pattern and doesn’t undercut causality.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal flow: approach → pressure intensifies → confrontation → trade → closure. The cost is on‑page (memories offered; card disintegrates), and the end decisively reconfigures the situation. Orientation lands early with who/where/goal clear. The lens reads hybrid with causal dominance; a slightly clearer price receipt (what exactly she forgets) would lift impact.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal drive is clean: package arrival → sensory/occupational appraisal → past resurfaces → inscription reframes purpose → decisive action to reengage with music. Orientation is immediate (quarry trailer, appraiser, package), and the closure is an on‑page decision that reconfigures options. The cost—abandoning the safety of “facts” and facing the silence after applause—is legible. Stakes are intimate and soft, but the chain holds without wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and the structure holds a clean accumulative arc. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he refuses to repair and instead plants the seed, reweighting the premise with visible cost and a new stance. Causality is coherent—reflection leads to a reframed tactic—without outline-y sequencing. The lens stays consistent through a single cadence shift charged by the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rising lunar pressure → ritual smelting → charged placement of the essence. Closure lands on the page via Resonant Reconfiguration: the essence is shelved, the basket is surrendered, and identity migrates back toward order. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the causal chain is legible within the lyric mode. Cost is evident in the dissolution of the physical artifact and the protagonist’s endured flux.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/why) and the single‑scene structure holds. The causal chain is legible: inspection → niche ritual → confessions → revaluation → crowning. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a decisive act, and the cost is implied in the renunciation of vocation. The “heartbeat of a hesitation” successfully tightens the timing at the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the graffiti coordinates pattern tightens from solitude to connection, culminating in the decisive act of playing. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost: she relinquishes isolation and risks dialogue with “other lost chroniclers.” Orientation is clean and single‑scene consistent; each beat follows because/therefore logic within the chosen lens. The cost is legible on the wall and in the breathy, imperfect chord.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is coherent under a Hybrid lens with accumulative dominance: letters → entry → decoding via gaps → watch revelation → appointment. Closure lands as a decisive change with a conceptual price (custodianship, renouncing seekerhood). Orientation is strong early; setups pay off (watch, cipher, delays). Escalation is measured more by deepening pattern than hard causal narrowing, but it holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: arrival → secret method → contact/visions → urgent choice → decisive act that reconfigures the violin’s status. Closure lands with her broadcasting the note, removing it from imperial claim; cost is implied in the forfeited dream and risk of protocol breach. The lens reads as causal with lyric inflection and holds. A hair more on‑page consequence would have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pressure tightens via stillness → pattern discernment → infusion. Closure lands on the page with cost (chip turned grey, her “weary and hollowed out” state) and a reweighted final image (faint smile). Orientation is clean early; single‑scene coherence is strong. The path is friction‑light, but the cadence shift at the infusion beat is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean: climb → hairpin → vision → ledger → revaluation. Orientation is crisp early, and the single-scene structure fits the length. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: she reframes contentment with a felt cost of relinquishing endpoint-seeking. The price is subtle but legible in the final charged image with the vineyard hush.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive: chime density and the mirror’s mosaic reweight the central stake. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid—Kael forecloses the ruin‑plan path with a cost admitted on the page. Orientation is crisp and causality clean (atmosphere → chime reading → attempted exit → mirror test → renunciation). The cost—loss of the easy, profit‑first option and the surrender of protective insincerity—registers in the final exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: Elara sets a task, Kael descends, perceives the lattice, returns with reframed understanding. The drive lens feels Accumulative/Textural; the cadence shift occurs with the grotto’s starlight lattice and the closing reconfiguration of “vanish = translation.” Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a soft but legible cost (accepting Elara’s vanishing and the renunciation of erasure as a tactic). Orientation is clear from the outset and causality holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single‑scene accumulative build: wrongness sensed → avian mapping → retrieval → absorption → reconfiguration. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—he accepts the foreign pulse into the canyon’s harmony with a felt cost of carrying it. Orientation is clear from the outset; causality is clean and minimal. The cost is more conceptual than concrete but legible in the “sacrilege” act and in choosing to keep the discord.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal links are clean: touch keystone → mist‑walk → knowledge gain → energy cost → protective plan → sustained vigil. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with an on‑page price (hours of focus, cold seeping in, staying as keeper). Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the single scene holds together. The only hairline convenience is his swift, confident inference about the spire’s design, but it doesn’t harm the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds cleanly: key found → water parts → hatch → library → sphere → listening → transformation. Orientation is prompt and stable; the two‑shard feel (pier → ship) is legible with one transition. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing when he becomes “the keeper he was always meant to be” through the sensory revelation. The cost is mostly conceptual (identity shed), not materially pressured, keeping this just short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under a causal lens, each move tracks: prophecy → doubt → reinterpretation → sonic imposition → crystallization → reconfigured window. Orientation (who/where/when) lands early and supports the climax. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: the “amber window” shifts from tomb to beginning, with the first law appearing—conceptual cost is the relinquishing of passivity. The chain is tight; only the cost could be heavier.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence of naming → crystallizing → bell forms a coherent tightening that culminates in an on‑page resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early, and the apparatus plus sunset serve as implicit constraints. The closure lands with cost (his trembling and reweighted identity) and reconfigures his role. No causality breaks or soft resets undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation is immediate; causality is clean: observation of drips → engineered rhythm → repaired bell → call and answer. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern density and cadence shift escalate toward a resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands on the page with the bell’s tone and the abyssal reply, with conceptual cost in the relinquishing of force for patience. Stakes narrow plausibly as his options funnel into one method.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images build (sign, fence, bottle, hearth, tin) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the job changes from guarding water to curating memory. Orientation is clear early; pressure coheres around the resurfacing town. Closure lands with cost in the charged final poise (“He would not bury the past again”), converting his method and mandate. A hair shy of 9+ only because the cost remains predominantly conceptual rather than tested by an external decision gate.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single‑scene accumulative build is coherent: despair → observation of murmuration → calibrated flame → synthesis and orchard transformation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual repricing (creating conditions rather than forcing synthesis). Cost is legible (letting go of control, ending the experiment), though gentle. No orientation debt; a touch of convenience in the perfectly timed starlings trims the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: distress call → scan → wreck + one survivor → broken buckle → improvisation → launch → “recovered.” Closure lands with a felt price (surrendering the sole pod) and a reweighted final image. The offstage rescue is earned by her action and doesn’t feel coincidental. Minor distance from the on‑page recovery moment keeps it shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    Drive lens: Causal. Each step links cleanly—Rin frames the task; touch triggers raw memory; calm-as-bowl tactic enables welcoming the torrent; integration lands with tears and the jar going dark. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost, reconfiguring options (numbness foreclosed). The single-scene arc remains coherent and anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain: mysterious seed → research → threat comprehension → engineered trap → planted elsewhere. The two‑shard structure (discovery; weeks‑later confrontation) holds and orients well. Closure lands (seed hidden by brook; hunters decoyed), though the cost is mostly implied (risk to business, inviting danger) rather than dramatized at the peak. The lens reads causal and holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sound accrues, the tunnel amplifies, then the tonal pattern breaks with the wife’s giggle and the engine’s cut. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—laughter returns different than before, with the price of grief acknowledged. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph (hourglass, tunnel, leaf blower). The final image (“walked toward her, through the macerated past, into the present”) seals the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid with a causal dominant: pendant discovery → guardian reaction → environmental reveal → decision to throw → stabilization → waking repricing. Orientation is swift and clean; the library’s “boundary of light” clarifies stakes and directs the decisive act. Closure lands on the page via a physical act with conceptual repricing, though the felt cost is mild. No causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain holds: failed additive attempts → revelation of creative destruction → iterative calibrations → annihilation → vivification. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the single‑scene structure stays coherent. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (new life/object, destiny reweighted) and an implied cost (total unmaking and repeated reconstructions). The because/therefore logic through successive attempts feels earned and consistent with the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure coheres via progressive subtraction culminating in a conceptual repricing. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the perigee + city + console choreography is causal enough for the mode. Closure lands on‑page with cost (the shard’s sacrifice) and reweights the premise. The glowing shard coincidence serves as foil before being discarded, not a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: anomalies → radio palimpsest → coordinate pattern → grotto → hourglass turn → re-synchronization. Orientation is crisp early (ferry deckhand, commute, fog), and the single POV holds through two shards with one transition. Closure is on-page and legible (Decisive Change with a conceptual repricing), though the cost is conceptual rather than visceral. A hair more resistance or risk during the grotto sequence would deepen the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal spine: weave → resistance → forcing → completion → eruption → conceptual repricing. Closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing with cost (snapped thread, fractured loom, therapeutic failure). Orientation is quick and steady; the hybrid lens (textural build with causal throughline) holds through the end. No soft reset; consequences persist into the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the unveiling of “edge geometry” and the anchor’s transfer build to a Conceptual Repricing with a felt cost (vulnerability/responsibility). Orientation is crisp early; the single scene is coherent. Closure lands in a charged poise as Lyra reframes navigation and self (“You must be the sails”). Cost remains mostly conceptual rather than enacted, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain under a Causal drive: dead call → photograph anchor → hearing aid whisper → tile → box → release. Orientation is firm within the first movements, and no props teleport. Closure is on‑page: the spirit’s release and Elara’s vow to speak, with a felt conceptual cost. Slightly low resistance prevents a higher score, but the decisive change is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a causal lens, each turn links because/therefore: infiltration → Codex activation → facility purpose reveal → tidal collapse → phase‑return. The Emergency Return Protocol is a convenient save but pre‑grounded by the array and the Codex’s calibrator role, preserving coherence. Closure lands with a decisive change (escape) and a modest conceptual cost (leaving the dead behind, new obligation). Orientation is clear from the opening; scope stays within one continuous window.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: tactile ritual (ink/shard) → data coherence → memory cascade → stance shift. Orientation is rapid and clean, and the causal chain holds (method triggers ghost; ghost reveals cause; realization follows). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with the cost borne on the page. No dropped setups or convenience pivots.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from attunement to crisis to reconfiguration, and closure lands on the page. The decisive shift—accepting the curse’s dissonance and transforming it into vessel—constitutes a resonant reconfiguration with cost (“threatening to become a scream... shatter... her own mind”). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph. Setups (birds, diamond, echoes) all pay off in the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: tactile anomalies accrete, the phone crescendos, and the arrowhead’s “playful gravity” focuses into a decisive metamorphosis. Closure is on-page with cost (Elara gone; a new state remains), and all set-ups (arrowhead, phone, returned hikers) pay off coherently. Orientation is clean from the outset. The causal threads hold without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: she plays, vibrations animate the shell, signal travels through roots, trees uproot, statues destabilize. Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and the closure is an on‑page Decisive Change with conceptual cost (world’s order reconfigured, unknown consequences). Cost could be sharper on the protagonist’s side, but the orchard’s transformation and statues’ softening provide a credible price. The final charged poise—standing between done and its outcomes—lands.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain under a Situational‑leaning Causal lens: arrival → ritual pause → demand → trade → image received → renewed purpose. Orientation is immediate, and closure lands with cost (forfeiting a powerful contraband) and a decisive reweighting via the drawing. The beat cadence tightens at “Not yet” and the chip drop, with no teleports or resets. The turn is modest but credible for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: discovery → chime → fragment → song → vision → charged decision. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she commits to finish the horse. The cost (time, purpose-binding, inheritance of another’s dream) is present but understated. The causal throughline is clean even while leaning into lyric escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the scarf triggers the hyperbolic transformation; density and cadence intensify as the library warps, then break with the student’s interruption. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she accepts custodianship of the gateway, with the scarf “spent” as conceptual cost. Orientation is clean and the single‑scene frame holds. The cost is subtle but present and legible in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation and causality are clean: the desperate cry triggers the new tactic, which activates the lens and yields transformation. Closure lands on the page with a concrete before/after (whispers cease; the world altered; palette emptied). Cost is present but modest, leaning more conceptual than painful. The causal chain is tight, though the mechanism’s success feels a touch convenient once the lens awakens.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: ritual, journey, and unlocking build toward a cadence shift. Closure lands on the page with the idea freed into a new star and the ribbon retained as residue. Causality holds (Vesper → journey → fear-knot → unlocking), but the price is conceptual rather than felt, keeping the ending a touch gentle. Orientation is clear early despite the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Strong causal chain: return → dive → mushroom discovery → misalignment → star‑chart cross‑reference → recovered memory. Orientation is clean and the Hybrid/Causal lens holds through a resonant reconfiguration at the end. Cost is legible in the recovered trauma (hurricane, loss of home) and the years of absence that the final image reweights. The solve is tidy but motivated by previously planted specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain under a Causal lens: archive → tea‑leaf geometry focuses the shard → memory confrontation → annotation → reversal. Closure is an on‑page Decisive Change with a visible emotional cost (facing the fracture and not retreating). Orientation is clean early and the pattern is taught before it pays off. The reversal feels a touch procedural, trimming the edge of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: muted spring → heirloom seed and weaving → falter → realization to succor → restoration with cost. Orientation is crisp early and the lens holds; the closure is an on‑page Decisive Change with a felt price (she pours her own wonder and ends exhausted). No teleports or soft resets; set‑ups pay off (waterfall/mist thread into seed). Slightly more pressure on the cost’s lasting consequence could have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Causal—unraveling the knot exposes malice; therefore the binding loosens; therefore the mask is sutured; therefore the spirit resolves. Closure lands on the page with a felt cost: the truth is exhumed and the mask’s visible repair refuses erasure. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the single‑scene structure holds. The only softness is the ease of deducing “jealous rival,” though it’s anchored by the method’s sympathetic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: patient investigation → flicker discovery → test → opening → choice to conceal. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with an on‑page cost (foregoing documentation and resealing the chamber). Orientation is clean early (vault, henge, project), and set‑ups (tear on map; whisper legend; silent films) pay off directly. The price reshapes the premise: the map’s tear becomes purposeful absence, not lack.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: discovery → Mortimer’s proposition → methodical untangling → release → note → reframed understanding. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a felt, if quiet, cost: Elara relinquishes her “closed door” stance for a curated peace. Orientation is strong and the single scene holds the lens without contradiction. The price is more reflective than risky, keeping it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: atmosphere and patterned images build to the lightning‑timed completion and reconfiguration of the space. Closure lands on the page via the ghost’s stabilization and Elara’s regained voice (RR with a touch of DC). Orientation is solid from the first paragraph. The cost is largely implied (emotional/energetic), not dramatized, which slightly tempers impact.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: discovery of goggles → diary revealed via scattered light → decision to stage a silent handover → the resident’s reactivation. Orientation is crisp by the fifth-floor marker, and the elevator clock structures progression. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: Kael reframes “service” as facilitation of joy across time. Cost is subtle (a quiet renunciation of mere task-following), but the before/after is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the tether snap reframes the scene, and observation accrues toward a completed “spooled wholeness.” Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: rescue arrives, but the decisive change is her revaluing of being “found by the sky,” with the cost of isolation borne on the page. Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks. The beacon’s late coincidence complicates rather than resolves the core drive.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong causal chain: search → coin code → safe → journal → lens → projection → failure → acceptance. Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and the demolition/dawn clock tightens options. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with an on‑page cost (letting artifacts and the vision go). A hair shy of exceptional only because the middle lacks a second, sharper complication.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal. Because/therefore linkage is crisp—from noticing hopscotch geometry to translating it into notes to reawakening the crystal—delivering on‑page Decisive Change and a small Conceptual Repricing at the end. Orientation is immediate and stable. The cost at closure is mild (no sacrifice beyond risk and social exposure), keeping it shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is crisp early, and the causal chain—door, lock, mirrors, gears, click—holds cleanly to a decisive change. The closure lands on the page with the thaw and a reconfigured light. Cost is implied (facing fractured selves) more than dramatized, but the Accumulative/Hybrid lens carries the cadence turn. No teleports or retrofits undermine coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal chain is clear: chalk guidance → reexamination → repair → chime → insufficient water → Elara’s sacrifice → nebular remedy. Closure lands with on‑page cost (Elara’s dissolution) and decisive world change. The late cosmological rule (spirit particles + ring minerals = healing nebula) edges toward convenience but is thematically and diegetically seeded enough not to break causality. Orientation is clean from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset (hidden lighthouse, dusk, the Clock near midnight), and the scene tightens to a concrete closure as the hands retreat. The hybrid drive leans Accumulative at the end: density crescendos into a lullaby-as-action that reweights the mechanism’s threat. Cost lands on-page (she is spent; duty persists), and the final image locks an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. No causality breaks or late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Causal. The chain—cry from the labyrinth → impression method → nut discovery → schematic inference → placement at the node—links cleanly and culminates in an on‑page Decisive Change. Orientation is strong and the cost is legible (risk of death, loss of role), even if survival is swift. No key set‑ups go unkept, and the resolution grows from established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: observation → association → reconfiguration → small ritual act. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: he forecloses the path of rigid atonement and reweights loss as braid rather than chain, with a visible action (letting the chrysalis go). Orientation is clear early; the lens remains consistent. Cost is present though quiet (accepting ongoing grief without punishment).

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the patterning of absences coheres toward a conceptual repricing: origins as lost choices. Orientation is crisp and causality of method-to-revelation is clean. The cost is present but soft—her withheld forgiveness reframes identity and grants her solidity, yet the price is more conceptual than dramatized pain. Still, the closing image (tear filling light; parole → dawn) lands as a clear reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orientation and cause/effect are clean: arrival → diagnosis → analysis via tidal pool → ritual application → entry → subsumption → release. The closure is on-page and costly: the boy returns and Kaelen bears the refined remorse. The lens reads Causal with a lyrical texture; every step follows a “therefore” chain. No loose set‑ups or teleports undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: the piece builds pattern and restores cadence, culminating in a felt shift when clockwork resumes and the elevator “answers.” Orientation is early and clean; causality is intact (missing weight → retrieval → recalibration → restart). Closure lands as a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration (city rhythm restored), though the on‑page cost is modest. The two‑shard descent/return is tidy and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates from restoration to activation to immersion, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration: she integrates and bequeaths memory back to the mirror. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and causality is coherent within the speculative premise. The cost—identity reweighted, self altered—lands at dawn, though it’s more felt than structurally constraining. The closure is on‑page and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal chain is clean: predicted inversion → access → pattern completion → retrieval → threshold escape. Closure lands on page with a decisive change (pod obtained, world righted) and a felt cost pressed by the collapsing hour. The lens reads primarily Causal with situational tightening; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from analysis to attempted activation to the grove’s reply. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the world shifts from silence to answering song—on the page. Causality is coherent (analysis → strum → response), though the cost at closure is more inferred (self‑giving) than explicit. Orientation is clean from the opening line.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: observation → anomaly recognition → “translating silence” → lodestone shift → restoration. Orientation is immediate and stable; the drive lens reads as Causal and holds through closure. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and a resonant repricing of exile, though the cost is largely emotional and gentle. No major teleports or logic gaps; the solution’s neatness slightly softens the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens reads Hybrid with a causal spine: iterative tuning attempts lead to a tactic shift (“not to the lock’s mechanics, but to its essence”), producing the on‑page click. Orientation is clean within ~120 words and the single‑scene frame holds. Closure lands decisively with the clasp release plus a conceptual repricing as her ethic reweights from acquisition to connection. Cost is present (foregoing the cataloging moment and owning her failings), if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, patterning (scent, journaling/doodling, storm) coheres into a Conceptual Repricing at the bloom: serenity reframed as acceptance of decay. Orientation is clean and the progression from failed forcing → idle doodling → storm-calmed insight → sprout → bloom reads causally suggestive without requiring hard causal linkage. The closure lands on-page with cost. The only minor softness is the mystical timing of sprout-after-insight, but it serves the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, closing in a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis. Orientation is crisp; the inversion hour and ascent set a coherent window. Escalation flows from discovery → vision → proof (moss greening) → reweighting → refusal, with the ticking clock of gravity’s return pressing the decision. The cost is on the page in the non‑take; the closure feels earned and reconfigures the premise without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation, drive lens (Causal), and a clean because/therefore chain are strong: survey → wind map → inference → epicenter → power disconnect. Closure lands on-page as a Decisive Change when he rips the coupling and the hum ceases. The cost is modestly felt (physiological pressure, risk), but the narrowing of options is legible and earned. No stray setups or plot patches undermine causality.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, beats intensify from poised hush to world‑tuning, landing a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing in the mandala and global awakenings. Orientation is crisp and causality is coherent: note → resonance → pillar transformation → perception wave. The closure’s cost is implied rather than spelled out (expenditure of self and surrender of private ownership of wonder) but legible. The single‑scene structure holds cleanly with no dropped setups.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single POV with a clean two‑shard structure: canyon → weave → canyon, because/therefore links remain intact. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: she reframes guardianship from command to humility with on‑page risk (the shadow) and a sealing act. Orientation is crisp by ~100 words; props (flute, markers) set up and pay off. Cost is present but modest, as the threat resolves quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence tightens cleanly: setup of the press and halo → ambiguous act → psychic flood → release → reweighted final image. Closure is a conceptual repricing with cost (loss of the charged object, the stars’ grief in him, and his renunciation). Orientation is strong from the topaz geode and letterpress; no causality gaps. The chain feels inevitable from his initial choice to “let it flow.”

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orientation is clean early (who/where/mission), and the causal chain is tight: touch pendant → memory unlocks → directive emerges → garden begins → role redefined. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: courier → keeper, with a conceptual cost (abandoning the courier’s path) made legible. The single scene holds a coherent throughline without resets. Cost could be underlined one notch more, but the renunciation reads.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure is clean: frost reading → cracking tree → communion → reprice. Orientation is crisp by ~120 words (cottage, arbor, car, prism), and causality under a textural lens holds. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost: her premise widens beyond personal anger to the world‑soul, and the prism’s repositioning embodies that shift. No stray setups remain unpaid.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of gathering hush → bead discovery → mosaic method → unweaving culminates in an on‑page Decisive Change with cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and each beat logically builds to the climactic pluck. The return whisper seals closure without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Causal—preparation → descent → discovery → bargain → workaround—and the chain holds cleanly. Closure is a decisive change: Kael is freed; the price is the sacrificed silk and a narrowly averted self‑sacrifice. Orientation is crisp and uninterrupted, and set‑ups (silk, maps, hunger of the lichen) pay off. Cost is legible on the page, though not devastating, fitting the scale.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: escalation accrues via cycles of silence and surge, then tightens with the final jump and on‑page confession. Closure lands with a conceptual repricing—truth as simple failure—and an earned stasis in her added sigil. Cost is legible: psychic toll and the burden of knowing. The convenience of the older man’s ready confession slightly softens causal rigor but does not break the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clear: dark lamp → missing keeper/notes → ghost’s lament + ship due → Elvan rekindles and assumes the role. Closure is a decisive change with cost (taking the charge, the ghost fading), cleanly on the page. The letters function as a motivated reveal rather than an info dump, tightening options. Slightly modest price display keeps it shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal drive holds: storm → ship veers despite beam → involuntary laugh → helmsman’s counterintuitive turn → safe shadow channel → Silas’s role reprice. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with on-page evidence (glass wick glowing; “required not just light, but the wisdom of shadow”). Orientation is clean and timely. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the demonstration of drawing with light coheres the scene toward a conceptual repricing closure. Orientation is clean early, and the final thump plus recognition provides a felt cost and before/after. The master’s method escalates meaning rather than plot, yet the narrowing from “magnetizing stories” to “listening to the heart” lands decisively. No causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the storm, tower, book, moonlight, and pin cohere toward a closure that conceptually reprices sorrow and redefines his job. Orientation is clean and the one transition (grounds → tower) is motivated. Closure lands with a credible stance shift (he will preserve, not deconstruct) and a felt conceptual cost. Some conveniences (perfect book, instant moon‑healing) are accepted by tone but mildly reduce felt resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ritual accrues from vision capture → weaving → song → communal echo, culminating in a charged poise (saved for now). Orientation is immediate (keeper in greenhouse night) and the closure cost is explicit: constant tending and daily singing. Causality within the lyric mode is clean; no teleporting beats. The single tightening is credible and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid drive with causal spine (invitation → plaza → arch → library → presence → tactic) supported by textural escalation lands cleanly. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she survives and reframes knowledge through error, altering her relationship to solitude. Time pressure (midnight) and the guardian’s sweep give a concrete hinge. The cost at closure is more implied than dramatized, keeping it shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats cohere: discovery → plan → clandestine planting → sprouts → observed grace. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and the bread sets up a throughline that pays off in the end image. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the flower at the bakery site reframes loss into sacred presence, with the “communion” act exacting a conceptual price. The cost is subtle rather than acute, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orientation is immediate (frozen library above the clouds; single POV), and the causal sampling sequence coheres. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: he stops measuring echoes and redefines the archive around vows that are the thing itself. The cost is understated but legible—the invalidation of his prior metric and the tacit admission the great archive is dying. The accumulative/textural lens holds from sampling to revelation without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: mission → failed bump → observed fob → toy distraction → click capture → exit with proof. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: the recorded “click” breaks the hush and secures a costly proof. The price is emotional and relational rather than material, but it’s legible in Silas’s look and the weighted satchel. Orientation is firm early; single scene with a brief, coherent transition to dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.0)
    Orientation is swift (lavender bluff, aurora, forest elections) and the causal chain is clean: failed patterning → ring anomaly → anchor revelation → convergence → departure. Closure lands as a decisive change with felt cost: she leaves her world to ease his cosmic solitude. The accumulative/causal hybrid lens holds; no late rule changes undercut the ending. The cost is legible in the final image and the “flavor of departure.”

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine: insult → flight → library → lock → stairs → cave → journal warning → conscious embrace. Closure lands on the page as a decisive act (drawing without filter) with a lingering price (“The sorrow remained”). Some convenience in the discovery (the pried lock) mildly softens pressure, but the because/therefore chain holds and the warning meaningfully tightens options. Orientation is crisp throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The causal chain is clean: floorboard discovery → map assembly → journey → machine’s demand → confession → reweighted ending. Orientation is strong and held to a single POV with one transition that’s motivated. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—“Listen” reframes Elara’s role and aim—with felt cost in her confession. The turn is quiet rather than decisive, but coherent under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the slow build from frozen silence to the “symphony of truth” is coherent and causal: storm → discovery → placement → sustained motion → melting → resonance → restoration. Closure lands on the page with cost—the rare fragment is consumed and Elara spends days of labor; silence returns charged. Orientation is clean and the world rule (meaning via resonance/light) holds. The inciting coincidence (iceberg fragment falling) complicates but does not resolve, which is sound.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under a causal lens, each turn links cleanly: stabilizers fail → dome will collapse → needs Primary Ignition Key in the vault → must process the box of fears to gain clarity and power → executes controlled burn → escapes. Closure is decisive and on-page with cost: the dome and roses are sacrificed, role renounced, fears integrated at a price. Orientation is early and stable; the single POV and two-shard flow (dome → vault/action → cockpit) remain coherent. The final image (cool, empty box; course set to new north) locks a before/after with felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid drive: causal beats (locket → map/shadow → niche/mailbox → keying the faceplate) accrue with a textural escalation via communal testimony. Closure is on-page: the mailbox opens and the deed appears, reconfiguring the residents’ options. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (refusal to force, reliance on community witness), which lands but remains soft. Orientation is clear from the outset, and the scene holds one arc cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear causal chain: journal decryption → choreographic solution → mechanism yields → character test → burdened choice → vault opens with structural cost. Closure lands with cost as the lab begins to flood and she escapes with the reweighted die. A small wobble remains around the “power vs liberate” dichotomy resolved by “taking the burden,” but the sequence holds. The lens reads Causal with a clean on‑page DC.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative dominance: the whale beaching triggers the quest; coffee grounds guide; gravity pockets complicate; exhumation yields the memory and the conceptual repricing that reweights the world. Orientation is crisp early and the causal chain is tight without over‑explaining. Closure lands on the page with cost—the acceptance of knowledge and the harder path home—qualifying as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis. No causality breaks or soft resets undercut the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: mapping silence → prophecy’s counter‑assault → recommitment → tranquil blaze. Closure lands decisively: the hum is “truly gone,” and the wing departs, reweighting the world with a felt cost (bone‑deep weariness, letting go). Orientation is clear early—who/where/when—and no causality seams show. The single tightening beat (visions trying to break his quiet) is clean and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern (weekly lessons → magical object → activation) coheres and culminates in a clear on‑page reconfiguration. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: language becomes communion, and the price is the mentor’s disappearance and the permanent re‑tuning of perception. Orientation is crisp from the outset (apartment to rooftop garden to parapet). No causality breaks; each move prepares the next.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Causal. Each beat advances logically (shell hums → visions → decision to free → tuning fork trials → F‑sharp → release), and closure lands on the page as the shell goes dark with a palpable exhale of presence. The cost is the night’s ordeal and proximity to despair, legible at the climax. A brief pseudo‑technical aside (“resonance structures…neural patterns”) verges expository but doesn’t break causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: discovery of the tremor in ‘M’ therefore testing the vellum therefore unveiling the confession therefore the decision to unlink. Closure lands as a decisive act with conceptual cost (embracing treason/restoration, destroying the decoy) and a reweighted final image. Orientation is firm early; single-scene focus holds. Cost is more conceptual than visceral, but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: shell warning → star‑arch → shadow path → confrontation → song that restores echoes. Orientation is secure by the first paragraph, and the lens holds to a decisive on‑page act with conceptual repricing (echo as soul‑truth). Cost is legible, though borne mostly by the antagonist. The progressive‑disclosure mechanic structures the middle without stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: shrine → dream survey → identification → object retrieval → truth revelation → crafted dream → release. Closure lands on the page with an RR/DC hybrid: candles flare/settle, warmth returns, the object goes inert, and the ghost releases—cost is the relinquishment of the connection and the charged window. Orientation is strong by ~120 words, and the lens stays causal through to the final image. The only slight softness is that the cost is largely emotional rather than a foreclosed external option.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual gathers density until the headman’s challenge forces a cadence shift; the coalescing fireflies function as on‑page closure (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis). Orientation is clear early, and the final image reconfigures the premise with a felt social cost. The cause‑and‑effect remains lyrical but coherent: ritual → interruption → demonstration → stance. The price is understated (social censure and neglected work), but present on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain under a Causal lens: investigation → diamond shifts perception → letters reveal Stillpoint → nexus found → device disabled. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the “days” of reassembly compress smartly without breaking momentum. Closure is a decisive on‑page act with cost (beauty destroyed, hope unmasked). The price is conceptual rather than visceral but lands through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: listening → assembling teachings → broadcasting → antagonistic jamming → strategic pivot to dispersion. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with visible conceptual cost (she relinquishes clarity and centrality) and fits a Causal lens. Orientation is early and firm; scope discipline holds. Slight summary spans (her long scribing period) are efficient and don’t blur the closing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of captured sounds builds to a cadence shift when the grass‑sigh is added and the box clicks free. Orientation is early and clean (loft beneath dunes at dawn; poet’s method taught fast). Closure lands on the page with the crystalline note joining the translation (RR/CR), and the cost is the sustained, attentive labor and renunciation of grand fixes. The causal thread remains coherent: find box → gather sounds → orchestrate → release note.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: ship intrudes → artifact wavers → she engages lens → counter‑wave neutralizes. Orientation is immediate; single scene with a clear tightening to the crescendo and an on‑page Decisive Change (ship silenced). The only shortfall is cost: the solution lands without a concrete price beyond strain, slightly softening closure weight. Still, the before/after is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: storm → magnetic activation → bent moon path data → proof → deliberate unyoking. Orientation is immediate and stable; the lens reads Causal through the final act. Closure lands on-page with cost via altering the viaduct’s foundation to change future mappings. The cost is conceptual and infrastructural rather than perilous, but it’s legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds: touch lantern → memories → guided pursuit → revelation at culvert → redefined purpose. Orientation is clear within the first lines (who/where/role) and never slips. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis with the lantern’s placement and mission shift. The cost signal (defying Department protocol) is present but understated, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates from sensory hush to the clockwork’s light‑storm, culminating in a conceptual repricing of “deserve” and “grace.” Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; stakes tighten when the device reweights Eli’s question. Closure lands with cost—he abandons guilt as currency, buys the tool, and commits to a new tactic. The causal thread is modest but coherent, with the heart’s demonstration as the decisive hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: inert machine → chaotic inputs → need for a constant → arrow as stabilizer → blueprint. Single scene, single POV, and a tight escalation culminate in an on‑page Decisive Change. Closure lands as the algorithm shifts from yearning to learning, producing the bell design. Cost is light but present conceptually (repurposing a relic of violence as a vector for progress).

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under a causal lens, the chain from metadata anomalies → hidden server → partial log → warehouse → safe → chip → upload is coherent and escalatory. Closure lands via a decisive change with cost: she publicizes the truth, risking her career and inviting corporate retaliation. A few conveniences (coordinate numerology, undiscovered safe) are brisk but seeded and paid off. Orientation is clear early and the single-POV flow stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: shard falls → diagnostic glimpses → choice to bypass garrison → projection → valve secured → future reweighted. Closure is on-page (Decisive Change) with a modest cost (career/authority risk) and a resonant return to the orchard. Orientation is strong from the outset; lens remains Causal and holds. The swift institutional compliance trims pressure but doesn’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: imagery and motifs build to a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis at the dock. Orientation is clean early; two‑shard structure (hall → dock) coheres. Closure carries cost via relinquishing the talisman and the earlier “tourist” posture. The chain from discovery to on‑page release is tight without forcing causality beyond the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid with Accumulative dominance: discovery → metaphor-charged approach → confession → reweighted final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a quiet solidarity that costs each the comfort of privacy. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and causal links remain coherent. The turn is gentle but legible, with the found fragment concretely motivating the meeting.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues from fading echo → conjured stillness → intruding scout → binding into stone. Closure lands on page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the echo is preserved at a conceptual/physical price, and the world is subtly reweighted. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; causality holds. The cost is felt (exhaustion, stones “groan”) even if understated.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through image density and a single causal tightening—final piece doesn’t fit, therefore she goes to the source—leading to a conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is firm; sequence from studio to ruins to exhibit is clear and purposeful. Closure lands as a reconfiguration of the project’s meaning and ownership with a discernible cost (relinquishing sole authorship). Stakes scale appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orientation is clean early (who, where, when, and the library’s acoustics), and the accumulative/textural lens holds as sound patterns build to a decisive public act. Closure lands on the page: she sings the new word and the crowd begins speaking, transforming options from dormancy to renewal. The cost—risking status and breaking the cultural hush—is present but under-pressured, preventing a 9+. No causality breaks; setups (crystal’s properties) pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats tighten from wandering to the convergence point, to the chalked circle, to the fragmentary capture, to recommitment. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he hears a sliver, pays in perpetual incompletion, and resumes the ritual. Orientation is crisp early (junkyard, fog garden, Silas), and the world rules stay consistent. The cost—never possessing what he pursues—is on the page at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single‑scene arc is clean: worsening tremors → omen object → interior method → decisive stabilization. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (station steadied) and a conceptual repricing (silence over image), consistent with a Hybrid drive dominated by accumulative/textural focus. Causality holds within the story’s fable‑logic, though the technical bypass via clock hand skirts plausibility. Cost is present but soft, more resonant than material.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from test result → ritual music → recognition → stillness, culminating in on‑page Earned Stasis (death) with cost. Orientation is immediate, and the shard method coherently drives the approach. The closure image (vinyl returned, eternal stillness) reweights all prior details without mechanical summary. Causality is simple but clean and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: bent spoon signals loosened reality → key turns automaton → “Relearn” reframes tactic → sensory/why bridging wakes it → conceptual answer lands. Closure is a conceptual repricing (shadows as event, not place) with a felt before/after. Cost is modest but legible: she abandons her initial, data-first method. Orientation is anchored early and remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: discovery → maze → negotiation → healing → exchange reweighted. Orientation is crisp from the clearing to the garden, with a single continuous scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the final image reweights skepticism into acceptance with a felt, if quiet, ethical cost. The price is more conceptual than visceral, but it’s legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece operates under an accumulative/textural lens: atmosphere and discovery build to a reconfiguring final image. Orientation is clean early, and the fissure-to-sunbeam-to-projection sequence provides clear on‑page closure. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (“not build a beacon, but become a lens”), with a conceptual price to solitude. The causal links are modest but coherent; the cost could be made more tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, with closure as a charged poise/Conceptual Repricing; the final image of thaw patterns reweights their stance toward public wounds. Orientation is immediate (abandoned data center garden; viral confession context; who/where/why are crisp). Causal links are soft but coherent: Leo’s arrival intensifies pressure, Lyra’s proffer alters the dynamic, Leo’s phone away signals cost. The ending lands on the page with cost and a clear before/after in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: present‑tense movement layered with memories culminates in the offering of the shell. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the relinquishing of the shared relic and a commitment to live hopes rather than write them. Orientation is clean from the opening sentence, and the single scene coheres. A hair more on‑page friction before the final act could have heightened the decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/when), and the causal chain is clean: alignment → attempt → falter → song → restoration. Closure is an on‑page decisive change as the vine and land revive at the moon’s zenith. The “last chance” clock coherently drives the scene to a final chord. Cost remains light (no sacrifice beyond risk), which tempers impact.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: detail density builds to a single ritual act that reweights the stake. Closure lands on the page when she seals the map—objects vanish, starlight is consumed, and the plate’s function decisively changes (CR/RR with cost). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph (who/where/when). The narrowing is credible: aurora as timing gate → arrangement → uncorking → hum → seal.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is crisp early (who/where/why), and the accumulative design coheres toward the harmonic activation. The closure lands on the page with a charged final image (the stored echo) and a clear before/after in function. Cost is subdued—more conceptual than visceral—which trims the ceiling. Causality holds through the sonic method to the backward whirr and release.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the density builds toward collapse and then reconfigures when she aligns to the constellation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she remains an archivist but transforms burden into balance, with the final image charged and altered. Causality is clean: star pattern recognition → reorientation → threads regain pliancy → new tapestry. The cost is present in the renunciation of her prior method and the near‑entombment she averts.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the kettle’s rising hiss to whistle provides a temporal spine that tightens the window. Closure is on‑page with cost: she finishes, sets down the gouge, and reconfigures absence into a usable form (RR/Earned Stasis). Orientation is clean from the opening and there’s no causality break. If anything, the progression is gentle; one more concrete impediment could have intensified the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: silence → apparition → reframe → charged final image. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing; the cost is accepting regret as a “useful tool,” not purging it. Orientation is clean early; single scene coherence maintained. The because/therefore chain is subtle but intact (her collected stories → token choice → ghost’s reframe → her new stance).

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal chain: discovery of sextant piece → vantage shift → plan → three‑day execution → solar activation/steam. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and a resonant final image (“a new heart”). Cost is present as solitude and labor, though modest. Orientation is solid early; the inferred lens is Causal and held.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive leaning Causal: the guild’s silence because the automaton absorbed motion → the bear presents its stilled heart → she activates the gear → time resumes. Orientation is immediate (guild hall, forecourt, dawn), and set‑ups pay off specifically (her design returning to be finished). Closure is a decisive change on the page with felt cost and a reweighted world soundscape. No causal leaks or late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: search → find sundial → discover notes → reinterpret legend → quiet reweighted ending. Orientation is immediate and clean; single scene with one transition back to the cabin. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/CR, with the price in the buried sorrow and the recalibration of her quest. Stakes are modest but credible and paid off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    Structure holds as a single, continuous scene with a clean accumulative drive: attention → decoding → transformation → reframe. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing when the knot becomes mandala and the fulgurite redefines “weaving.” Cost is subtle (self-redefinition and responsibility; endurance in cold/fog) but present. Orientation is crisp early; no causality gaps or teleports.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural drive, the piece builds from silence and sensory density to a Conceptual Repricing: loss is woven into ongoing life, not overcome. The closure is on-page and costs something—a relinquishment of the old map of healing—and it reconfigures Elara’s work. Orientation is clear early (island, garden, palace; Elara/Isolde) and the thread’s handoff is a clean turning hinge. The final compass image tightens the frame and locks the lens choice without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Causal, closing in a Conceptual Repricing—he doesn’t restore life, he reawakens wonder. Because/therefore linkage is clean: device built → energy channeled → specter → song → city responds → revised understanding with cost. Closure occurs on the page and bears cost (accepting the ghost as memory, not life). Orientation is crisp early; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a ritual sequence that culminates in a reweighted final image (the coin’s glow and the scar’s “song”). Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a felt emotional price. The because/therefore chain is quiet but coherent, each step advancing toward the coin‑tie and sonic recognition. Cost is internal and credible; the ending makes a clear before/after for her relationship to legacy and land.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the breadcrumbs pattern tightens toward the lid’s hairline seam and the release of memories—an on‑page reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean early, and the final turn (unsticking) grows from prior setup. The cost is more implied (the end of the “defiant hush,” loss of chosen amnesia) than viscerally felt, limiting top‑band. Still, closure lands decisively and coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates via discovery → torrent of history → hidden calculation → mission redefinition. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: archivist becomes patient solver, with a felt conceptual cost in infinite labor and relinquishing pure curation. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and causality holds. The cost is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized, keeping this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues via ribbon → conservatory → spectral family → repriced understanding. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—she reframes her vocation with felt calm and cost of prior narrowness. Orientation is clean and the spectral logic stays consistent; cost is present but soft. The sequence is legible without mechanical “and‑then,” though escalation is gentle rather than tightening options hard.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: discovery of the bob → retrieval under duress → refusal to rehang → decisive stilling of the clock. Closure lands on the page with cost: she abandons her role and imposes silence on the village. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the single-scene scope holds. Minor unanswered “how the bob fell” is irrelevant to the beat-to-beat logic.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lens: Causal. Beats progress cleanly—thread discovery therefore case unlocks therefore revelation—culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where cemetery shifts from memorial to seed vault. Orientation is anchored early and maintained. The closure lands on the page with a charged final image; cost is conceptual (burden of reactivation) rather than dramatized, but it’s legible in the redefinition of her tools and role.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is clean from the opening (obsidian spire, frozen lake, tools) and the piece holds a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. The closure lands as a charged commencement: the blueprint completed and the tremor externalizes consequence. Stakes and causality are coherent with no teleporting revelations. Quiet but decisive because/therefore links carry through to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of nightly secrecy → sign‑off clue → recalibrated listening → breakthrough. Orientation is clean from the outset; the closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the job shifts from instruction to translation with the cost of ongoing clandestinity. The pirate’s line functions as a decisive hinge. Stakes are quiet but coherent and paid in endurance and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught early and held: stillness, silence, and dust density build to the sneeze’s pattern break. Closure lands on the page with cost: the portrait dissolves, reconfiguring the premise into acceptance (Earned Stasis/CR). Orientation is crisp from the first lines and the single scene contains one decisive intensification. The rocking chair clock and breath risk establish persistent constraints that shape tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning situational: Elara’s arrival with the slate tightens options; the deciphered log reweights the stake; Silas’s final tactic (teach method, not expose war guilt) lands closure as a charged poise with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean from the opening. The causal thread holds without teleports, and the ending’s cost—choosing partial revelation—reads. The price remains mostly conceptual, not materially enforced, keeping it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the zither motif builds toward a Charged Poise closure as Leo chooses to listen. Orientation is clear early, stakes coherent (expulsion vs. transformation), and the final image reweights options. The cost is subtle but legible—foregoing immediate self‑justification for uncertainty and work. A single, quiet escalation is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: alignment → planting → explosive growth → threat to glass → decision to prune → fruit stabilization → tasting. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the greenhouse and twin moons anchor time and place. Closure lands on the page with cost (enduring primordial chaos through pruning) and a decisive change (wildness focused into a single fruit). The chosen hybrid/causal lens holds without wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: blackout → hive failure → riddle → alignment → restored power/hum. Orientation is immediate and stable; single-scene scope fits. Closure lands on-page with a decisive realignment and the personal cost of exposing a secret. The solution is tidy but earned by the clue-driven turn rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, objects accrue meaning toward a resonant reconfiguration: the confluence vision reframes the house’s silence as love, and Elara answers with her own offering. Orientation is clean (who/where/when early), and set-ups (orrIS root, hush shard) pay off. The closure lands on page with a before/after shift—watchful quiet to companionable breath—though the cost remains largely conceptual. Causality is soft but coherent via the ritual logic of “displaced objects.”

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under a Causal lens, each beat follows: arrival → revelation of history → identification of weakness → threading → ampoule release → city-wide repricing. Closure lands on the page with the ampoule’s crack and the Statue’s reconfigured purpose. Cost reads as the Statue relinquishing its foundational belief, with the ocean’s pressure reframed rather than lifted. Orientation is immediate and stable, and set-ups (fracture, clasp) pay off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; the density of pattern (steps/proofs/dice) builds to a pattern break (the “soundless sonic boom” and sprout). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with on‑page consequence: she relinquishes bias and the world’s rule cracks, reweighting the premise. Orientation is clean and single‑scene; causality is coherent from theorem to roll to rupture. Cost is legible as surrender of control and an identity reframe, not merely declared.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the waxing moon deepens the pattern of gathered kindnesses, culminating in the full-moon reveal. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when strangers recognize inherited acts. Cost is legible as vigil/insomnia paid and relinquished in the final rest. Minor reliance on summary for the mid-span visions is the only soft spot.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: honey stops → Elara tasks narrator → lens reveals pattern → wax initials reconfigure the community’s options. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a legible price (no grain, melting a scarce hive, displacement unchanged). Two-shard structure (grotto → cliff → return) is coherent and contained. The cost is felt but not harrowing, keeping the ceiling just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is clean early (man, hunger stone, lighthouse) and the causal chain is tight: conditions → workshop assembly → activation → radiance. Closure reads as a Conceptual Repricing: he reweights the hunger stone and time itself after manifesting the “latent radiance.” Cost is more implied than felt, which trims impact at the end. Still, single‑scene build and payoff cohere under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is tight: resuscitation → cursed clasp → entity’s hunger → advisor’s method → paradox confession → boredom gambit → entity dissipates. Closure lands as a decisive change with on‑page cost (she offers personal fears, even if translated). Orientation is clear early; scope stays within a single, coherent scene. Slightly conceptualized cost keeps it shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure densifies from silence to storm to orchestration, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: chaos rendered into harmony and calm. Causality is coherent (sketched resonance → storm’s tones → storm’s dissolution). The ending’s cost is modest—spent energy, scarred trees—so the cadence shift is felt but not searing. Orientation is crisp from the first line (who/where/when), and the single scene holds.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: study → whistle insight → patterned performance → precise crack → watchers respond → eastward directive. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing. The cost is more conceptual than visceral but present (risk to order/safety; committing to lead). The causal lens holds throughout without contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clean causal chain: petal signal → meeting → ideological clash → persuasion via parallel → decisive handover. Single scene, single stake, and closure lands on the page with the case pushed to him and the final image of the letter. The cost is mostly conceptual (bearing a dangerous truth and preserving a tainted artifact) rather than dramatized, keeping the impact slightly muted. Drive lens reads Situational with causal persuasion; it holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean single‑scene arc under a hybrid leaning textural lens: the locket discovery tightens the drive and reweights the method. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he leaves with “quiet, burning peace”—with visible physical and emotional cost. Orientation is anchored early, and set‑ups (inkwell, putty, bridge) pay off. The design favors accumulation over turns, but the central turn is solid and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: blackout → search for stamp → imprint → palimpsest reveal → decision to mislabel and hide. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she forecloses open disclosure now and accepts the burden of covert guardianship. Cost is legible in the final act and plan. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the situational constraint of the blackout holds the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid tilted Accumulative/Textural: image density builds toward a charged release; causality stays clean (failed cranes → lantern concept → construction → release). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she spends the last recording to create a new monument and lets it go; cost is legible on the page. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; stakes remain unified and escalate to the final image. No teleports or rule breaks; the dream‑to‑crane shift is prepared by the basilica’s optics and the gem.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is clean by ~120 words (who/where/when and the power‑down window), and the accumulative/textural lens holds: silence → casting → resonance → charged poise. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing—the universe as patterned conservation with a cost implied in her lingering wound and the “how to drink” problem. The causal chain (power cycle enables hunt; geode/intent yields K‑7B) reads coherent. Cost is more conceptual than enacted, which limits ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clean causal chain: drone sync → data appears as noise → realization that the observatory is the lock → physical insertion → consciousness pull → reconfigured stance. Orientation is crisp early, and the action remains a single continuous scene with one clear escalation. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration and a conceptual cost (violating orders and surrendering to the consciousness draw). The cost could be sharpened by a more palpable consequence beyond internal reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single POV, clear orientation, and a coherent causal line: anchor object → fabrication attempt → real memory intrusion → decision/recognition. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/Earned Stasis: she sees her craft as silencing, not solace, with cost acknowledged. The drive leans Hybrid with a causal spine and accumulative atmosphere held through the end. No teleports or unkept setups; the watch hand’s truth functions as the decisive tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Situational lens holds: the neutral bridge, ritual timing, and protocol constrain options until a live hazard (the spit) spikes the scene. Closure lands as a charged poise: the commander releases his weapon after contact with the drawer pull, registering cost and a reconfigured path. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and each move flows coherently from prior constraints. The final image systemically reweights the premise without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: image density and psychic pressure mount from mudflats to trembling compass to osprey. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: he shifts the navigation rule‑set from maps to moment, with cost in relinquishing old norths. Orientation is crisp from the start and the single scene window is honored. The beats cohere without outliney “and‑then” sequencing.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clean causal chain: procedure → coded newspapers → cave discovery → revaluation → gift to the wronged man’s grandson. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost: she rejects profit and institutional recourse in favor of a risky, face‑to‑face handoff. Orientation is firm and the two‑shard structure stays coherent. The price is more conceptual/emotional than material, but it’s legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive leaning causal: attempt → failure → reinterpretation → altered tactic lands in an on‑page decisive change. Orientation is clear within the opening (who/where/when), and the phoenix and orchard frame the active present cleanly. Closure’s cost—relinquishing physical reunion in favor of metaphysical merger—is explicit in the “hand passing through” and the final shared consciousness. No causality breaks or soft resets; the fortune’s comeback is well set up.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure holds cleanly as a single ritual scene that tightens into vision and repricing. Closure lands on the page as an earned stasis/conceptual repricing: he abandons retrieval to accept presence, with the price felt in the painful witnessing. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the accumulative/textural lens is taught and maintained. The causal chain (ritual → vortex → Keeper → unfastening → repriced answer) is coherent and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Drive lens: Hybrid with a causal spine; each move (“find photos” → “weight” → “stitching” → “compassion talisman” → “doorway”) tightens options and knowledge. Orientation is clear early, and the closure is on-page: the doorway appears after the circuit is completed. Cost is legible as the protagonist processes collective grief to unlock the way. No teleports or rule breaks; ship-as-lock constraint holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene intensifies through image density toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Orientation is clear early, and the closure lands via the release and reweighting of poverty as enabling emptiness. Cost is legible in her surrender and renunciation of the past. The causality is mystical but consistent within the taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a Causal lens, beats link cleanly: blackout → tool improvisation → conduit tracing → diversion to presses → engineers’ reboot. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the presses run and truth will go out at dawn while Kael resumes his post. Cost is implied—treason risk and system strain—but underplayed on the page, keeping this shy of top tier. Orientation is strong early and sustained without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear causal spine: sequences → eels respond → void/mote appears → alignment choice → faint return of friction. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost; the lens holds. Orientation is clean by ~120 words and no props teleport. The only softness is that the price is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized as immediate loss.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominant lens: pressure accrues through ritual, storm, and the live timer, culminating in a decisive release of truth. Closure lands on the page via the choice to speak, compose anew, and consign the poem to the city’s veins (Charged Poise with a Decisive Change). Orientation is clean from the outset (observatory, timer, patrol window). Slight softness in external consequence (no patrol overlap) keeps it below 9.2.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clean causal chain: summons → coded sundial duel → cipher revelation → collaboration decision. Single scene, clear anchors, and a decisive on‑page reconfiguration. The cost at closure is primarily conceptual and relational, not strongly felt; no tangible sacrifice beyond renouncing the duel. Lens: Causal, held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: dropped tin → skeleton key → sealed stacks → discovery → compilation → pact. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they commit to rebuild with the truth, reweighting the premise from order‑making to voice‑liberation. Cost is present conceptually (risk of contraband, breaking seals, exposure) but not concretized by an on‑page consequence, softening the punch. Orientation is crisp early and the single‑scene arc holds.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain from station to arbor to sanctuary, with the final image functioning as a resonant reconfiguration: she achieves an echo rather than undoing loss. Orientation and stakes are early and steady (last boarding call; twilight window). The closure cost is implied—choosing the echo over impossible reversal—subtle but legible. A single, graceful escalation arc fits length, though a sharper mid‑scene complication could have deepened the narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds: dimming blooms → dream diagnosis → seed retrieval → emotional infusion → island’s reconstitution. Orientation is crisp within the first lines (role, place, stake). Closure lands on page with a decisive change and a live clock pushing action; the monsoon hits immediately after the activation. The price is felt as risk of total loss and the gamble of abandoning “data” for lived sensation, though that cost could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the compass → workshop → lace decoding sequence coheres and tightens into a Conceptual Repricing: regret remains but is reweighted into shared understanding. Orientation is clean from the opening and the single transition is motivated. Closure lands with cost (“not taking the pain away, but washing it clean”) and the final image reconfigures the premise. No causality breaks or unkept setups.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot is a sequence of perceptions that build pressure on the protagonist's worldview, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where Aris renounces her sterile approach and accepts being an "element within" the process, lands with the clear, felt cost of her intellectual defenses. The before/after state is perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a strong, clean Causal lens leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration for its closure, with the cost of Elara's former life made clear. The plot is elegant and efficient. The discovery of the frost-etched trail relies on a coincidence of timing and conditions that, while thematically resonant, slightly softens the inevitability of the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot follows a flawless Causal lens, with a clear setup, inciting incident, and escalating series of actions leading to a decisive change. The closure lands with a tangible cost ("aching with cold and effort") and a resonant final image. The story’s internal magical logic, where resonant frequency can physically mend glass, is established and followed consistently, resulting in a cohesive and earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean Causal drive, and the closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing of the distress signal into an invitation. However, the plot compresses the entire restoration process into a single summary sentence ("The research was immense..."), which sacrifices dramatic tension and momentum. The introduction of "impossible spaces" for the books is a late-breaking speculative element that feels disconnected from the more grounded magical realism established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through atmosphere and mystery rather than direct causality, which it executes flawlessly. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing of the community’s hope—lands with precision and felt cost, reconfiguring their despair into a shared, sustainable pact. The two-shard structure is efficient and serves the final resonant image perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and internal discovery. The structure is a tight, single scene leading to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands with a tangible cost—the tear is consumed—and a resonant reconfiguration of the protagonist's purpose, making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for its length, executing a complete arc within a single scene. The Drive Lens is a clear Hybrid (Accumulative -> Causal), with the textural horror of the trap giving way to a motivated, causal escape. The closure is a Decisive Change ("the moment disintegrated") with a clear, on-page cost (the fragment's diminished glow), fulfilling the prompt's highest requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal structure is exceptionally tight and clear. The story progresses from problem to puzzle to solution, complicated by an external threat that forces an improvised, costly final action. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis where Elara is locked in with the seeds, lands with a clear and resonant cost.

    The story follows a strong Causal lens, with each discovery propelling the next. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration into Earned Stasis, lands on the page.

The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "what walls dream about," lands with a clear felt cost ("the burden...now hers to carry").

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure is a clean descent and return, with pressure escalating through sensory and textural intensification rather than causal turns.

    The story's structure is flawless for its length, operating under a clear Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot builds a specific texture—the "blushing stillness"—then shatters it with a single, decisive event. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), is masterful; the final image of the knot being absorbed back into the stillness reweights the entire story with the cost of her intervention, making her an unrecorded part of the history she sought to honor.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Causal structure within its conceptual frame. The inciting incident leads directly to the core complication (the self-writing journal), which forces a tactical shift (seeking privacy), leading to a climactic Decisive Change. The closure is clean and lands with a legible conceptual cost—the forfeiture of her old self—which is powerfully visualized in the final image of the cameo resolving into her face.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is elegant and effective under a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens. The causal chain is clear: the time traveler's arrival creates the stake, the diary provides the turn, and Elara's internal change directly *causes* the resolution. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the library is forgotten after its lesson is learned, lands with a clear and poignant conceptual cost. The 9+ quick test is met as the plot is shaped by the persistent constraint of the library's paradoxical nature.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmospheric and symbolic density toward a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot exhibits a flawless causal chain under a Causal drive lens. The appearance of the door is a direct consequence of the time and place, leading Elara to a logical (if fantastical) deduction that connects the journal's seal to the door's knot. The closure provides a Decisive Change (the journal is filled) and a Conceptual Repricing (the "fable of absence" is revealed as a protective measure), with the felt cost being the new responsibility to protect the truth. The structure is elegant and economical.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless single-scene causal structure. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of the conflict from antagonism to harmonization, is powerful and lands with the felt cost of the character's old identity becoming obsolete ("Her maps were obsolete"). The inferred Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens holds perfectly, with the final textural shift driving the conceptual breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure toward a single, resonant event.

The fantastic element is used to deepen the emotional stakes, not as a simplistic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration; the final image of the sprouting doll reweights Elara’s relationship to her past and future.

The closure, with the scars reconfigured as "maps," is both definitive and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Hybrid (Causal-dominant at closure) lens. The structure is efficient: inciting incident, investigation, climax, and resolution all occur in a single, continuous scene.

The plot mechanics are tight and serve the story's length and scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, where each discovery logically enables the next.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a flawless causal chain of discovery leading to an accumulative emotional payoff. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration for Silas, lands with palpable cost and grace, reframing his sorrow without erasing it.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story exhibits a flawless causal chain under a Hybrid lens (Causal dominant). The failure of the primary dead-drop directly necessitates the use of the puddle map, which leads to the phone booth, culminating in the confrontation with the patrol. The closure is a perfect example of Earned Stasis: Elara's reaffirmation of her mission is earned through the on-page risk and filth, carrying a palpable cost of perpetual vigilance and danger.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and evocative, and the narrative builds pressure toward a single, decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    The plot structure is elegant and efficient, moving from a contained status quo to a world-altering climax. The Causal lens holds strong from the discovery of the moonstone onward. The final Decisive Change—planting the seed—is a powerful on-page action with a clear conceptual cost: the sacrifice of Elara's orderly, known world for a creative, uncertain future. The inciting incident's reliance on a coincidental discovery is a minor weakness, but acceptable within the story's mythic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story follows a clean, compelling Causal lens from the inciting pattern of coincidences to the final discovery. The closure is an excellent example of a Conceptual Repricing (CR): the goal is not the greenhouse, but the tool within it, which redefines the protagonist's entire future. This repricing carries the felt cost of abandoning a life of certainty for one of managed probability.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. It builds atmospheric and emotional density that culminates in a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR) where Kael is re-understood not as "lost" but as "guardian."

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an impeccable Causal lens. The logic—from the soul's specific regret to the need for dissonance via the unique harp—is seamless. The closure is a decisive, on-page change for both the soul and Elara, with a legible cost (the lightening of a long-held burden) that is earned directly by the protagonist's climactic action. The structure is flawless for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is a single, elegant scene where atmosphere and internal reflection build pressure toward a Conceptual Repricing (CR). The closure, Elara's re-framing of her mission as a eulogy, lands with a clear and poignant conceptual cost, re-weighting her entire purpose. The coincidence of finding the shard serves as a catalyst for this internal work, not a simple solution, which is a sophisticated structural choice.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and satisfying causal lens. The problem is established, the stakes are raised through direct contact with the "shadow," and the resolution is achieved through the protagonist's specific, costly action.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure is an elegant descent and return, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing ("The place where explanations fail wasn't a location... It was a moment of pure acceptance").

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clear Hybrid (Causal-dominant at closure) drive. The inciting incident (GPS failure) leads causally to the discovery, which in turn causes the central epiphany and the final action. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the hiker's reaction validates Elara's new purpose, lands effectively on the page. The felt cost—the dismissal of her entire previous body of work as "childish"—is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.5)
    The accumulative structure builds beautifully toward a strong Conceptual Repricing at the climax. However, the final sentence introduces a jarring and un-scaffolded time jump to a "crisp autumn evening" when the story was set during the "melting of winter's last snow." This is a significant break in temporal continuity that undermines the story's otherwise solid causal frame.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, with a clean causal chain driving the narrative from the library to the lagoon and back. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: the meaning of Elara's fate is re-written on the page, not through exposition but through a direct, revelatory image.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story follows a clean and powerful Causal lens, where each beat logically propels the next. The closure is a perfect example of a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), landing with a palpable conceptual cost on the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.8)
    The story executes a flawless Hybrid (Accumulative-Causal) structure. It builds atmospheric pressure texturally before pivoting to a clean, high-stakes causal chain. The closure is a perfect Decisive Change (destroying the shaving) with a resonant, conceptual cost that is stated with precision on the page. The plot is economical, focused, and lands with immense weight.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure is simple but potent: a clear inciting incident (hatching), a single point of rising tension (dissipation), and an on-page resolution with a clear cost. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights Elara’s purpose, is both satisfying and poignant, with the creeping ice serving as a perfect image of the temporary, hard-won stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Hybrid (Causal-to-Situational) structure, culminating in a valid closure of Earned Stasis. The final choice not to act is well-established and resonant. However, the resolution slightly undermines the climax's cost by revealing the storm was "still hours" away and the towns prepared with "calm efficiency," retroactively lowering the stakes of her risky decision.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure builds atmospheric pressure that culminates in a single, transformative experience, leading to a powerful Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist's role and understanding of "stillness" are fundamentally reconfigured.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive perfectly. The structure is simple but effective, moving from stasis to a charged resolution without relying on traditional causal plot points. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands with undeniable conceptual cost as the ghosts depart and Silas internalizes their purpose. All elements cohere to produce a powerful, earned final image.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural drive, which succeeds in building toward a strong Conceptual Repricing at closure. The structure is sound, but the transition from Elara's search to the solution feels too convenient. The arrival of the woman with the gravy boat and the perfectly preserved attic trunk function as a narrative shortcut, slightly weakening the causal chain that leads to the powerful final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building atmosphere and perspective until a chance event tests them. The structure is elegant and economical, with a clear inciting incident, rising action, and climax.

The closure lands with a clear conceptual cost (the shedding of her old worldview), making the before/after state perfectly legible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story uses a Hybrid (Situational/Accumulative) lens effectively, building pressure toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the close. The inciting incident (finding the bird) effectively deepens the initial plan, and the cost is legible. However, the closure is weakened by the final image of "the first tender shoots of green pushing through," which feels magically fast and slightly unearned, undermining the story's grounded, melancholic realism.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building sensory details and discoveries that culminate in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands perfectly on the page, recontextualizing the entire narrative with a bittersweet emotional cost. While the discovery of the leaf in the engine block relies on a touch of coincidence, the preceding "preternatural quiet" frames it as a moment of grace, which fits the story's mythic tone and does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Pressure builds through atmosphere and memory, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The "glimpse" of the star serves as a perfect micro-turn, and the final image of the new map provides resonant closure with a clear, felt cost: the permanent loss of the old, stable universe. The lens holds perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story operates under a flawless Causal lens within a single, continuous scene. The structure is elegant: setup (the mission), tightening (the apprentice's awakening and revelation), and a Decisive Change (Elara's choice) that results in a Conceptual Repricing of her identity. The cost—forfeiting her promised fortune—is made tangible ("Her client’s promise felt like ash"), providing a clean, resonant closure that perfectly fits the story's scope.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is simple but powerful, building to a resonant closure. The final act—placing the pawn—is a perfect example of Charged Poise, reconfiguring the entire narrative from one of documenting absence to one of creating potential, with the cost of shared risk made palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.7)
    The plot is a masterclass in Causal-lens efficiency for this length. Each beat follows logically from the last: finding the stone necessitates investigation, which leads to the feather, which unlocks the memory, which provides the new purpose. The closure is a potent combination of Conceptual Repricing (redefining home, pain, and purpose) and Charged Poise (the final moment readying her tools), landing with a clear, felt cost. The structure is flawless and serves the story's emotional arc perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.6)
    The causal structure is flawless under a Causal lens. The initial failure to solve the labyrinth directly leads to a necessary shift in attention toward the tapestry, which in turn provides the conceptual key to both the puzzle and his internal state. The closure—a Decisive Change realized through a Resonant Reconfiguration of the puzzle's meaning—lands with a palpable felt cost: the surrender of pride.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.8)
    The story executes a flawless causal chain under a Causal lens. The setup (the ritual's nature and Kaelen's plan) leads directly to the attempt, which in turn causes the decisive reversal and closure. The ending is a powerful Decisive Change (Kaelen becomes the sacrifice) with an on-page, felt cost (the Stone of Forgetting), which also functions as a Conceptual Repricing of the canyon's echoes. The structure is elegant, tight, and perfectly suited to the story's length, delivering its payload with maximum impact.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is tight, coherent, and effective for the story's length. The narrative engine is a hybrid of Causal (the workshop is failing) and Accumulative (the memories are being gathered), which works seamlessly. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the workshop is lost (cost), but the statue is transformed into a beacon of meaning, re-weighting the initial premise. The lens holds perfectly, and the on-page cost is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure moves from a concrete inciting incident to a symbolic climax without relying on traditional causality. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where Elara fulfills her promise by leaving her art behind, is executed beautifully and carries a clear, felt cost: "She never found the entrance again." This is a sophisticated and resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story establishes its orientation and world beautifully, and the closure provides a Decisive Change for the sailor. However, the plot's central mechanism relies on a critical coincidence that resolves the conflict: Elara accidentally drops the cork, which triggers the magical event. While her *intent* is established, her ultimate success is a product of luck rather than a direct, costly choice, which significantly undermines the causal integrity of the climax. A resolution earned through agency, not accident, is required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, operating under a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens. The causal chain is tight (failure -> attempt to fix -> catalyst call -> new creation), leading to a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration for its closure. She is still stranded, but no longer lost—a change earned on the page with a clear conceptual cost (abandoning old tech for a new, almost mystical system). The final sentence provides a perfect Conceptual Repricing that elevates the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a flawless Causal drive lens, with each discovery leading directly to the next escalation. The structure is a tight two-shard sequence (orchard discovery, cabin revelation/confrontation) that is perfectly suited to the length. The closure is a powerful Decisive Change, with the on-page act of sinking the drive representing a clear, costly choice that reconfigures the protagonist's entire goal from isolation to shared guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean, causal line of discovery. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias delivers the message, lands with satisfying emotional weight. However, the central investigative leap relies on a significant coincidence—finding a cottage with a matching, rare flower patch in the exact direction the man was supposedly pointing. For a story built on deduction, this convenience slightly undermines the earnedness of the resolution, feeling more like luck than inevitable discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean, causal chain from inciting incident to resolution, fitting the two-shard structure perfectly for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, where Elara’s small acts build pressure and alter the environment, leading to a causal climax. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: the concept of a "bargain" is re-defined from a selfish trade to a selfless offering, which provides the power to heal the wound. The structure is elegant, and the cost of the final action—the offering of her most precious, painful memories—is deeply felt and visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, effective causal chain under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless single-scene structure under a Causal lens, where failure directly motivates the reflection that causes the final, decisive action. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, is masterful; planting the seed is an on-page act that redefines the protagonist’s entire approach with a clear, felt cost (the abandonment of his massive project). The final line beautifully re-frames the opening ambition, making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.5)
    The structure flawlessly executes an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through atmosphere and process.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building emotional pressure through resonant images rather than strict causality. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara plays music, is on-page and effective. However, the inciting discovery of the coordinates and the later arrival of the anonymous message feel slightly convenient, bordering on situational coincidence rather than a pure intensification of the established pattern, which slightly softens the causal integrity of her solitary process.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story executes a flawless Conceptual Repricing (CR) at its closure, with the protagonist's role shifting from seeker to guardian. The causal chain, driven by an Accumulative/Textural lens, is tight and logical, with each discovery building toward the final revelation about the watch.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a clean, Hybrid drive lens, culminating in a Causal closure. The inciting touch of the violin leads directly to the core choice, and the subsequent action provides a Decisive Change with a tangible on-page cost (the violin "soften[ing] at its edges"). The structure is economical and powerful, with every beat logically building to the final, transformative act.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.5)

The closure lands with a clear felt cost—the relinquishing of a desire for a final, static peace. The structure is elegant and efficient for its length, moving from a state of unease to discovery and finally to reconfiguration. The convenient discovery of the hairpin is a minor weakness, but it serves to enable the textural shift rather than resolving a causal problem.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Causal drive. The structure is simple but powerful, with each beat leading directly to the next, escalating pressure on the protagonist. The closure, a Decisive Change ("I'll find another way"), is delivered on the page with a clearly legible cost—the forfeiture of a simple solution for a "welcome weight" of complexity. All elements align perfectly for this scope.

Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the plot moves from a subtle disturbance to a dense, revelatory climax with perfect pacing. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where Kaelen's understanding of "harmony" is permanently expanded to include violence, is executed on the page with a clear conceptual cost—the loss of his former, simpler peace. The causal logic of pattern-break leading to re-evaluation is elegant and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, causal-accumulative structure that builds to a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The closure lands with a tangible, on-page cost, making Elian's choice to become a guardian feel significant and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building atmosphere and mystery toward a final Conceptual Repricing (CR). The closure, where Silas’s identity is reconfigured with the felt cost of his old self dissolving, is legible and occurs on the page. The plot's causal links are mythic rather than strictly logical (the key appears, then the sound begins), which is a coherent choice, though it relies on fortunate coincidence at the inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story's structure is a masterclass in economy, built around the "backwards prophecy" as a causal frame. The plot follows a tight, Causal-dominant logic from inciting incident (the vision) to closure. The ending delivers a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the meaning of Elara's task and tools are reconfigured with a felt cost (the struggle), making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.7)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot advances not through causal events but through the deepening resonance of a central ritual. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Silas is “no longer alone,” lands with profound, earned weight, and the felt cost of the “shared weight” is perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story follows a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. Instead of conventional plot turns, the structure builds through increasing density of observation, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a perfect Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot advances not through causal chain reactions, but through the deepening weight of discoveries that reconfigure the protagonist's purpose. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a flawless Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s renunciation of his old goal (“to expunge”) and acceptance of his new one is made tangible, with the felt cost of carrying the town’s grief. The final image of him walking back, keeper of the story, lands with immense power, fully satisfying the requirements of the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, effective structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) lens. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where Elara’s understanding of "harmony" is re-framed not as a synthesis to be forced, but a condition to be allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story's structure is a model of economy and causal precision. The single scene progresses through a clear setup, inciting incident, a failed attempt that deepens understanding, a climactic second attempt, and a resonant resolution. The closure is a Decisive Change, proven on the page by the brain going dark, and the cost is made tangible through Kaelen's tears. This is flawless execution under a Causal lens for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, with each discovery logically leading to the next action. The closure is a Decisive Change where the immediate threat is neutralized, and the cost (the seed's potential must wait) is legible. The primary structural weakness is the reliance on a central summary block ("She didn't just research...she delved") to cover the investigation, which compresses the rising action and lessens the feeling of earned discovery on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. There is no traditional plot, but the intensification of sound, memory, and desperate action builds pressure toward the final beat. The closure is a superb Resonant Reconfiguration: the wife's laughter doesn't reset the past but creates a new, “weathered” emotional reality, landing with a clear felt cost. The structure is elegant and fully serves the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain of events, and the closure provides a Decisive Change. However, the resolution lacks a meaningful, felt cost. Elara finds a "cultist's pendant," immediately intuits its negative nature, and disposes of it without any temptation, trade-off, or personal sacrifice, which softens the impact of the climax and makes the final peace feel too easily won.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.5)
    The narrative structure is flawless under a Causal lens, moving from stasis to insight to a climactic Decisive Change with palpable cost—the crozier's utter annihilation. Orientation is immediate and evocative. The final image of the living crystal constitutes a powerful, on-page resolution that reconfigures both character and world, perfectly satisfying the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story follows a Hybrid (Accumulative/Conceptual) drive lens flawlessly, building pressure through failed attempts until a conceptual breakthrough redefines the problem. The closure is a perfect Conceptual Repricing (CR): the signal is reframed as absence, not presence. This lands with a clear, on-page cost—the discarding of assumptions and the symbolic star—making the "before/after" state starkly legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear causal chain, but its closure is a soft reset that undermines the preceding stakes. The resolution, where everything snaps back to a bustling normal with only a "profound understanding" as the outcome, lacks a visible or felt cost. The final image of the hourglass as a "forgotten paperweight" actively trivializes the magical object central to the climax, weakening the story's structural integrity by suggesting the transformative event had no lasting consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.4)
    The structure is exemplary for its length, moving from a Causal premise to an Accumulative/Textural climax. The closure is a flawless Conceptual Repricing: Elara's core "equation" is shattered, and the cost of this new knowledge is the complete failure of her attempt and the destruction of her rationalist framework. The final image of her preparing "to listen" provides a resonant reconfiguration of her entire purpose, landing with undeniable force.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, structuring itself as a single, deepening lesson that culminates in a potent Conceptual Repricing. The closure is excellent; the final image of the "unfolded sky" reweights the entire premise with a legible conceptual cost ("a darker sky"). The causal chain is one of increasing conceptual density rather than plot events, which is perfectly executed for this narrative mode and length.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and compelling Causal lens from the inciting incident (the call) to the resolution. The closure, a Decisive Change where the spirit is released and Elara's duty shifts, is executed on the page with a clear felt cost—the new burden of speaking for the dead. The plot mechanics are tight, logical, and perfectly scaled for the story's length, meeting the 9+ gate for a clear lens and costed closure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens until the climax, where it falters. The "Emergency Return Protocol" functions as a deus ex machina, appearing precisely when needed without any prior setup. For a story reliant on because/therefore logic, introducing the single means of escape so late fundamentally undermines the earnedness of the resolution and breaks causality. The closure is a Decisive Change, but its mechanism is too convenient to be satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building pressure toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost as Elias accepts his flawed nature. The structure is tight, with every element serving the final, resonant image of the shard and the shift from "hollow" to "full" silence.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story follows a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Pressure builds not through a chain of external events but through an intensifying sensory and emotional experience.

This change, with its felt cost of accepting sorrow, is entirely earned by the protagonist's final on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where a sequence of increasingly strange phenomena builds pressure toward a single, decisive climax. The closure, a combination of Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing, is both definitive and resonant, landing with the felt cost of Elara's humanity. The structure is tight, contained, and every element contributes directly to the force of the final image, fulfilling the promise of the premise without a single wasted move.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story exhibits a flawless causal structure, with each action producing a direct and escalating reaction. The closure is a decisive change (the orchard is freed) that lands with a clear, felt cost in the form of a resonant reconfiguration—a "Charged Poise" where Elara faces a wild, unknown future. The plot is perfectly scaled for the word count, moving with an elegant and inevitable logic.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain within a single, continuous scene, which is perfect for this length. The inciting incident (the trade), rising action (the demand for information), climax (the exchange of chip for bottle), and resolution (a new destination/purpose) are all tightly linked. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), giving Kael a new, specific mission that reweights his entire purpose from abstract to concrete, with the cost of a powerful artifact clearly paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere effectively toward a single, transformative climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), is strong and lands on the page with a clear sense of purpose and felt cost (the shedding of silence). The inciting "wrong turn" is a permissible coincidence for this narrative mode, successfully launching the character into the story's core situation without straining credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story follows a flawless accumulative/textural structure, escalating conceptual density toward a powerful climax. The closure is a superb Conceptual Repricing: Elara's reality is permanently reweighted, and the cost is made tangible in the "spent" scarf. The causal chain, from touch to transformation to interruption, is perfectly legible within the story's established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.5)
    The structure is flawless, moving from an accumulative, textural depiction of stasis to a sharp, causal climax. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing, where Elara’s understanding of her role and tools is fundamentally reconfigured. The cost is tangible and felt—the spent light in the palette and the resulting silence of the islands—making the transformation consequential and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot progresses through a deepening of atmosphere and metaphorical weight, not strict causality. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where the freed idea becomes a new star, is both resonant and earned, with the cost legible in the locksmith's perpetual, solitary duty. The drive lens holds perfectly from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot is a masterclass in Causal-lens construction for a short piece. The chain of events—goal, investigation, discovery of a problem (misalignment), analysis, and resolution—is airtight and elegant. The closure is a Decisive Change (gaining the lost memory) that leads to a state of Earned Stasis ("settled peace"), with the cost being the confrontation of the buried trauma. The structure is flawless for its length, and the final revelation recontextualizes everything that came before, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Causal drive lens, with a clear setup, escalation, and a Decisive Change for closure. The mechanism for change ("annotate the past") is executed on the page. The primary weakness is the legibility of the cost; Kael's struggle to "speak the harder, truer thing" is commanded and achieved in a very compressed beat, making the cost feel more asserted than viscerally experienced. The resolution feels slightly too frictionless for the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, compelling causal chain under the Causal lens. The closure is a Decisive Change (world restored) with a legible, felt cost (Elara's exhaustion and the giving of her memories/wonder). Orientation is immediate, and the single-scene structure is perfectly scaled for the story's length, making for a tight, focused, and satisfying arc.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Causality, though magical, follows its own rules with absolute consistency from setup ("sympathetic magic") to payoff. The closure is a superb Resonant Reconfiguration, as the quality of the sanctuary's silence is tangibly transformed on the page, making the before/after state change legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length. The causal chain—from the torn map to the comparative video analysis to the physical discovery—is both logical and inventive. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), is executed with precision, landing on an image of renunciation with a clearly articulated cost ("her openness forever shielded by the weight of the secret"). The narrative lens is a masterful hybrid, using causal discovery to achieve a textural, resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clear and effective Hybrid (Accumulative -> Causal) structure. It establishes an emotional state, introduces a causal problem, and resolves with a Conceptual Repricing (CR) that recontextualizes the initial state. The closure, where Elara's understanding of "endings" shifts, is earned and lands with the felt cost of the radio operator's final message, making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens. The plot progresses logically from setup (the call) to inciting incident (the plate's activation) to a clear climax (the encoding during the storm). The closure, a Decisive Change in Elara's ability to sing, lands with a felt cost of emotional expenditure and vulnerability, creating a resonant final image. The structure is flawless for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.5)
    The plot is a masterclass in economy and causal linkage for its length. The discovery of the goggles leads to the diary, the light enables reading, and the contents motivate the final, decisive action. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, landing with a visible emotional cost on the page ("his shoulders began to shake"), perfectly satisfying the demands of the Causal lens held throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural drive to perfection, building pressure through the passage of time and the protagonist's growing body of work. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Aris achieves her purpose before rescue is announced. The final beat with the homing beacon is the only minor weakness; while it doesn't negate her internal resolution, it slightly softens the story's existential edge by providing a safety net after the core choice has been made. However, because her emotional closure precedes it, the impact remains very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story operates on a flawless Causal lens, with each beat logically following from the last. The structure is tight, using the impending demolition as a perfect clock to drive the narrative. Closure is achieved via a sophisticated Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the protagonist's understanding of his own quest is re-evaluated, landing with undeniable conceptual cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear and logical causal chain under the Causal lens, and the Conceptual Repricing at the end provides valid closure. However, the plot relies heavily on a series of fortunate coincidences: the specific theory being on a dog-eared page, the hopscotch board being a perfect celestial map, and a violinist being conveniently available. This alignment strains credibility and weakens the sense of an earned victory, making the resolution feel more engineered than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, elegant Accumulative/Textural structure that resolves into a causal climax. The closure, a Decisive Change where the paused world thaws, lands with conceptual weight and is perfectly foreshadowed. The narrative logic is internally consistent and the progression from arrival to resolution is seamless, fulfilling the 9+ quick test through its flawless execution and felt, resonant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story establishes a strong causal chain (problem -> investigation -> attempted solution) but abandons it at the climax. The community's engineering efforts ultimately fail, and the resolution comes from a `deus ex machina` where Elara's prayer miraculously creates a life-saving nebula. This breaks the established cause-and-effect logic, as this power was never foreshadowed, violating the principle that coincidence cannot resolve the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building emotional pressure that leads to a change in tactics rather than a simple causal turn. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis, is rendered on the page with a clear, felt cost ("slumped... spent... tired smile"). The structure is elegant and efficient, with every beat contributing to the final resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story follows a clean and compelling Causal lens. The inciting incident (finding the nut) is a coincidence, but it correctly serves to complicate Elara's stasis and introduce a new, high-stakes choice rather than resolving the conflict for her. The structure culminates in a clear Decisive Change with a visible cost (the risk of death) and a resonant reconfiguration of her identity, satisfying the closure requirements exceptionally well.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through a series of resonant observations rather than external events, which is highly effective for this internal journey. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Aris releases the chrysalis, provides a clear on-page change with a felt cost. The structure is elegant, though the "As the pieces fell into place" transition is a minor cliché that briefly shortcuts the causality of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless single-scene structure under a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing for Elias and a Decisive Change for the woman. The closure lands with a potent on-page image—the tear filling the void with light—and a perfectly legible cost/reward. Causality is impeccable, with each beat flowing logically from the story's unique premise into an earned and resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.8)
    The story follows a flawless causal-drive lens. Every action Kaelen takes—analyzing the pool, treating the coral, entering the pavilion, and subsuming the memory—creates a direct and necessary link to the next. Closure is a Decisive Change with a perfectly legible on-page cost for the protagonist, fulfilling the rubric's highest standards. Orientation is immediate and effective, anchoring the reader instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood and restoring a pattern rather than escalating causal conflict. The structure is clean and effective for this mode. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the city’s harmony is restored, lands beautifully with the grain elevator’s groan. The cost is somewhat soft—the "physical ache" is established but not felt as a price during the resolution, which is achieved with almost frictionless grace.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The plot progresses by layering memories, building emotional density toward a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's causal structure is exceptionally clean and effective for its length. The gravity inversion provides a direct, compelling trigger for the plot, and the escape is a logical consequence of the setup. The closure lands as a strong Conceptual Repricing, re-framing the initial quest with the weight of a new duty, satisfying the Causal lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is excellent. It establishes a state of being, introduces a problem, shows a failed attempt, and builds to a cadence-shifting climax. The closure is a Decisive Change (silent world to sound-filled) that lands on the page with a clear, felt cost—the "profound giving of himself"—making the transformation earned within the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a Causal drive lens with impeccable logic and pacing for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story follows a flawless Causal lens, where each beat logically propels the next. The structure is exceptionally tight for its length, moving from failed attempts to a crisis of faith, to a perspective shift that enables success. The closure is a powerful Decisive Change (the lock opens) followed by a Resonant Reconfiguration of priorities, landing with a clear, felt cost (the catalog must wait for the human connection).

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, where pressure builds through internal states and resonant experiences rather than a strict causal chain. The closure is an excellent example of a Conceptual Repricing: the meaning of "serenity" is fundamentally re-evaluated at a felt cost (accepting decay). The final image of stillness is legible and earned by the preceding accumulation of insights from the doodling, the storm, and the flower's scent.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure is a taut, linear journey toward a single point of revelation. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR): Elara's understanding of her world and her purpose is fundamentally reweighted. The cost—foregoing possession to become a guardian—is legible and deeply resonant, making the ending feel both inevitable and profound.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story's causal structure is flawless and serves as its primary strength. The progression from observation to hypothesis to action is logical, propulsive, and perfectly scaled for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an elegant Accumulative/Textural structure, building density towards a clear, on-page closure. The final Resonant Reconfiguration of the world is powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story demonstrates excellent causal logic under the Causal lens. The setup of the magician's silk is a classic Chekhov's gun, paying off perfectly to enable the resolution. The closure is a clear Decisive Change (Kael is freed) with a legible cost (the unique silk is consumed). The structure is tight and efficient for the word count, moving from preparation to search to a well-defined climax without wasted motion.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a Hybrid (Accumulative-to-Causal) drive lens effectively, building pressure through atmosphere and coincidence until a causal climax. The closure is a strong Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing, with a clear cost (the loss of a familiar sorrowful identity for a new purpose). The plot relies on a chain of conveniences—the storm, the open tower, the book on the correct page—which, while fitting the magical realist tone, slightly softens the causal integrity leading into the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Orientation is immediate, and the narrative progresses through a series of ritualistic actions that build density and pressure. The closure is a perfect example of Earned Stasis: the realm is “saved for now,” with the explicit and felt cost of required daily tending, creating a resonant and sustainable resolution rather than a magical fix.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Hybrid structure, moving from a Causal setup to an Accumulative/Textural climax and a Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The closure is excellent: the appearance of the book and Elara’s recontextualization of her solitude provide an on-page resolution with a clear conceptual cost ("profoundly altered").

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, with the discovery of the journal providing the crucial turn that enables the Decisive Change at the end. The closure lands effectively with a felt cost. The primary weakness lies in the setup: the transition from the gala to the specific derelict library, and the discovery of the conveniently broken lock, relies on coincidence and a vague "inescapable calling" rather than tighter, character-driven causality, slightly softening the foundation of the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is a clean two-shard sequence, moving from despair and discovery to a focused quest and climactic confrontation. The drive lens is Hybrid (Situational to Causal), and the closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the answer reframes the question. The cost—Elara’s vulnerable confession and the new burden implied by "Listen"—is legible and felt on the page. The inciting incident (the loose floorboard) is a minor convenience, but acceptable at this length to launch the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through collective memory. However, the climax relies on a quasi-magical event: the curator hearing a "click... not with her ears, but deep within her mind." This leap strains the established realism and weakens the causality of the resolution, making the lock yielding to "witness" feel more convenient than earned. The closure itself, a Resonant Reconfiguration, is strong, but the mechanism to reach it is a notable flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean, propulsive causal chain from inciting incident to resolution, fitting the scope perfectly. The closure, a Decisive Change, is executed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a tight, effective Causal lens, with each discovery logically leading to the next. The closure is a Decisive Change with a clear, felt cost. The structure is undermined by the central convenience of the numbers '10.17.23' serving as a timestamp, coordinates, and a safe combination; this degree of coincidence strains credulity at a pivotal point, making the discovery feel less earned and more constructed.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure is a clean two-shard design (studio, ruins) with a well-motivated transition. The Accumulative/Textural drive lens is held consistently, leading to a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end, where the meaning of the "masterpiece" is re-evaluated.

Cost is present—loss of Mrs. Gable, Elara’s humbled expectation—but lightly registered.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is tight: lantern-search → find hut → vow → public lattice-dedication; each step narrows Elara’s options. Closure reconfigures community meaning without betrayal; luminescent moss glow becomes the collaborative tag, foreclosing both secrecy and her solitary art with material stake.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the freed note reweights the premise—silence is not absence but origin—and the cost is the giant’s shallower breath, a city-scale price. Causal lens holds: each beat (climb → fracture → borrow → uncage → draw) is linked by because/therefore logic.

    Causal lens holds: contact with tessera → empathic flood → refusal to clear → renaming act. Closure is a decisive change (DC) that renames the sector and shields the family; the cost—career suicide, immediate peril—is legible in the lieutenant’s hand on the prod. Orientation anchors by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s timeline mends not by reversal but by being witnessed, and Leo’s palm closing over the coin is the decisive anchor that reconfigures both fates.

    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the single note becoming spectrum reweights the world-rule (“music before words”) and Silas’s identity, with the cost that he can never again be merely a lamplighter. Causal chain is tight—key → hatch → sphere → hand-in → vision—each beat therefore-linked. Orientation is clean by line 10; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lyra’s stance crystallizes into “I can almost see it… the paths between,” reweighting the premise that navigation is now about folded edges, not fixed stars. Causal linkage: because Elias teaches edge geometry and gives the anchor link, therefore Lyra apprehends the new cosmic web and accepts the darker cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s severed nerve is rejoined via the clock’s first chime and the elevator’s answering groan, with the oak weight as the pivot. Causal chain—missing weight → retrieval → recalibration → audible reconnection—is airtight under a Causal lens. Orientation is immediate; blackout and starlight anchor time and place by line 3. Cost is palpable in the “profound shudder” felt city-wide. A hairline slip: the grain elevator’s “groaning relays” is the first hint of its sentience, slightly late for perfect setup.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: causality is driven by density increase and resonant reprise rather than strict because/therefore. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the final memory folds the grandfather’s dream into Elara’s, charging the periscope with her own imprint, felt cost visible in the phrase “new memory … entangled with all the others.” No causal break, ellipsis taught by pattern and paid off.
