    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure (butterfly emergence as transformation symbol) lands effectively under the Accumulative lens. The piece teaches its pattern of dust accumulation early and pays it off. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two. The cost—Elara's shift from "needless drama" to humble acceptance—reads more conceptually than viscerally, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from ambush survival through investigation to discovery of truth and renewed purpose. Who/where/when anchors establish by paragraph 2. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elara gains knowledge and determination without sacrificing anything concrete, and the apprentice rescue remains future tense rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara discovering patterns in silence, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where silence becomes "a canvas waiting to be filled." Cost is implied through her lost musician identity but not viscerally felt on the page. The closure reweights prior material but lacks a visible price at the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.4)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the lens's completion and light spreading, but the cost remains abstract ("weariness lifting like a tide receding"). The accumulative structure coheres as Elias gathers fragments, yet the final transformation - water parting to reveal stars - introduces unmotivated physics that undermines the established underwater reality without earning this rule change.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (community transforms from isolated to unified) with some cost visible in the elders teaching and young caring. However, the transformation feels too smooth - the gathering succeeds without meaningful resistance or complication. The accumulative structure coheres but lacks the density increase or pattern break that would elevate the stakes at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with mystic discovery leading to healing, but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara gains the pendant, receives healing light, and walks away "lighter" without sacrificing anything concrete. The pattern of sparks → pendant discovery → statue placement builds coherently, yet the "unused love" resolution arrives through magical transformation rather than earned choice.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara entering the maze, experiencing visions through the fragment, and emerging transformed. However, the closure's cost remains abstract—"she had discovered herself" provides no visible price for this knowledge. The transformation from seeking ancestral memories to self-discovery shifts the stake without earning it through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain holds (chains→arrow→piano keys→vault→escape), but the closure lacks visible cost - the chains simply vanish without consequence, and the liberator escapes unscathed. The wall's collapse creates urgency but doesn't extract a price. The ending shifts to abstract future planting rather than dramatizing the immediate cost of this mission.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through layered sensory details (lavender hums, indigo rumbles) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara reframes broken trust as beautiful rather than traumatic. Closure lands with felt emotional cost ("resonant ache that echoed through her entire being"). However, the mechanics of "collecting absences" and how the forge "imprints memories into existence" remain vague, weakening causal clarity at the crucial transformation moment.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage (Lira seeks jar → finds trap → reads flower code → meets Elara → receives jar with new understanding). The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Lira transforms from "thief" to "seeker of illuminated moments," with the jar's true nature as captured soul providing conceptual cost. However, the ease of this transformation—Elara simply decides to give it away—undermines the earned quality of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara crafting glass spheres as metaphorical "safe zones," but the closure lacks visible cost—she simply places the bookmark in a sphere and walks away feeling accomplished. The piece teaches its pattern of glass-as-emotional-metaphor early but never tests or complicates this framework. No meaningful tightening occurs; the protagonist faces no opposition or trade-off that would constitute a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage from discovery to revelation. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara chooses identity over imposed role, with cost visible in the shattering mirrors. However, the magical resolution (glowing seashell, cracking mirrors into light) undermines the earned causality established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered stories building toward the map metaphor. Closure occurs as Resonant Reconfiguration when the oracle sees "the map taking shape—a map not of places, but of moments," but cost remains abstract ("knowing their work was far from over") rather than felt or visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing through Unit-7's realization that thoughts originate "in the vast, interconnected web of existence itself," with the violin serving as catalyst. However, the looped timelines mechanism feels underdeveloped—we see iterations but no clear because/therefore linkage showing how each loop builds toward understanding. The cost of amalgamating experiences through repetition is declared but not dramatized with visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the lens transforms from broken object to metaphor for their relationship ("Like us. Like honesty"). The accumulative pattern of crystals whispering, doodles communicating, and broken lens revealing truth coheres at closure. However, the cost remains more conceptual than felt—we see reconciliation but not what either character sacrifices or risks to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through the marble ritual and garden imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts imperfection. The closure lands with conceptual cost ("blooming withering—a paradoxical blend of life and decay"), but the cost remains more philosophical than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    The causal chain is functional but predictable: theory → experiment → crisis → resolution. The closure (proving time moves sideways) occurs but lacks visible cost—Elara succeeds without meaningful sacrifice or transformation. The "responsibility" she gains is asserted rather than dramatized through changed options or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Clara discovering musical patterns in water damage that lead to a ghost's final composition. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Clara finds "her place in the in between spaces," though the cost remains primarily atmospheric rather than decisively felt—she gains peace and purpose without visible sacrifice or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's journey from seeking clarity to accepting ambiguity, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she transforms the smudge into new art. The cost—accepting permanent uncertainty—is conceptually present but not viscerally felt. The "swallowed truth" that drives the entire quest never gains specific weight or consequence, weakening causality.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (discovery leads to valve, valve releases souls) with a Decisive Change closure, but the cost remains generic—"screams turned to sighs" without specific price paid by Mara. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established early and the drive lens reads as Causal throughout. However, the resolution feels mechanically convenient: insert valve, turn wheel, problem solved without meaningful sacrifice or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lira's transformation into "the silence she sought to preserve," with visible cost in the erased refuge and mysterious journal entries. The accumulative structure coheres through the swan→map→mirror→transformation sequence, though the mystical elements ("walls shifting," "swirling darkness") occasionally strain causality without sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the eclipse as temporal frame and the hair curl as recurring motif that gains luminous properties. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Finn's worldview shifts from fear to wonder, with the keepsake's purpose expanding from personal memento to shared catalyst. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt, and the transformation lacks sufficient resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure (world dreams again) occurs on-page but lacks visible cost - Elara simply performs the ritual successfully without sacrifice or trade-off. The causal chain is mechanically complete but feels predetermined: tapestry leads to diaries, diaries to scrolls, scrolls to ritual. No meaningful reversals or complications test the protagonist's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost - Li Wei's journey "begins" but never completes within the text. The piece reads as extended setup without a meaningful turn or deepening that narrows options. The mysterious lighthouse and microdot specs create atmosphere but don't converge into a closure unit that makes a before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the priest's rhetorical questions building toward confronting the possession. The closure shows a Resonant Reconfiguration where "unraveled stillness is not chaos but clarity," but the cost remains abstract—we see the possession dissolve but no concrete price paid by the priest. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) are established but the dimensional anchor remains vague as a setting.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through memory-mapping to the crystal harp's activation, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration when the symphony manifests "the sound of dawn breaking." The cost appears in the writer's collapse and the shell slipping away. Minor deduction for slightly abstract cost—the "slumping" feels mechanical rather than deeply felt, though "the horizon remained" provides conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara embraces rather than conquers the fractured timelines, with cost visible in her years of struggle. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as each timeline version adds density toward this reweighting. However, the middle section's rapid timeline tours lack causal linkage between encounters, and the tablet's "periodically eternal" nature is declared but never dramatized as constraint or enabler.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara embracing silence to find "music within the hush," with emotional cost visible in the tear and aching aliveness. However, the causal linkage between playing reversed songs and emotional awakening remains mechanically unclear—the story asserts transformation without showing how vibrations specifically unlock buried feelings.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage but the closure lacks decisive cost on the page—Elias finds "new purpose" but we don't see what he sacrifices or how his life actually changes. The quarantine revelation provides information but doesn't force a choice that forecloses options with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure as Elias moves from fearful avoidance to acceptance of grief, with visible emotional cost in his tears. The vial's revelation sequence drives causal progression through memory scenes that reweight his understanding. Orientation anchors (lantern shop, city setting) establish early and the accumulative lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through pattern recognition across rope, walls, and stars toward a Conceptual Repricing where time becomes "a poem to write—and rewrite." The cost is legible in the rope's placement (abandoning his lifeline/past). Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the "impossible choices" which never fully crystallize into specific trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from silence to sound to story, with the mendicant's bowl serving as the pivotal object that bridges past and present. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the hush transforms from enemy to muse, with visible cost in the "weight of those memories" and the land's need for stories, though the final insight edges toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara completes the emotional crafting, accepting that joy must include transience - a half-truth she "could live with." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward this moment of professional and philosophical acceptance. Deduction for slightly abstract handling of the transformation mechanics and the cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through "cycles of compassion" but lacks visible cost - the friendship enriches without sacrifice or foreclosed options. The mistaken envelope creates connection but no genuine stakes shift. Accumulative structure coheres but the "lighter" locket resolution feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure - Lira's recognition and belonging achieved through Echo's tag on her sculpture, reweighting her journey. The cost is felt in the "luminescent ache" softening and months of searching, though the Echo encounter itself lacks concrete dramatization, relying on summary ("revealed no face, only a voice").

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara shifts from trying to capture/own time to weaving and honoring it, with the cost being acceptance of temporality ("she couldn't stay"). The accumulative structure coheres through the infinity symbol motif and builds to the final image of her drawing with "newfound grace." The mystical journey strains plausibility but maintains internal consistency. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with discoverable linkages: glass eyes → shadow patterns → mosaic code → hidden journal → mentor's warning → breakthrough understanding. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara realizes emotion requires "harmony" not "control," though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The piece teaches its magical reality early and maintains consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the tape fragments building toward discovery, but the closure lacks decisive change with visible cost. The protagonist's smile and return to hiding doesn't foreclose options or demonstrate price paid. "Ready to share their story" promises future action rather than delivering present transformation. The who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure, but cost remains conceptual rather than visible. The transformation from "resistance to acceptance" lacks concrete stakes—what specifically does Mara lose or sacrifice? The linden leaf's dissolution and Mara feeling "lighter" suggest change without dramatizing price.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens: density builds through rain trails→ruins→brooch→map→exchange→painting with new purpose. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara shifts from failed artist to story-keeper, with the cost being her previous identity. The exchange beat lands but lacks visceral price—the old woman appears conveniently without Elara facing real obstacles or sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's merger with the cave, but cost remains abstract ("keeper of a secret," "bridge the gap"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds but the transformation happens too suddenly without sufficient pressure buildup—she touches the pearl and immediately gains understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through fragments and discovery. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara accepts her role as voice for the voiceless, though the cost remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The mysterious woman's appearance and immediate departure strains causality slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's relationship to mystery fundamentally shifts from fear to embrace, with the cost being abandonment of "meticulously mapped routes." The hybrid lens holds, though the transition from physical quest to psychological fortress strains causality slightly. The "greatest maps are not drawn with ink and paper" lands the thematic cost clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara's role shifts from isolated observer to community bridge, with cost visible in her acceptance of wonder over skepticism. The accumulative structure coheres through the tile's pattern revelations. However, the visions sequence feels mechanically convenient, and the "bridge between worlds" explanation arrives without sufficient groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: boredom → discovery of fragment → experimentation → dimensional mutiny → transformed purpose. The closure lands with Elyr gaining "a spark of purpose" at visible cost (the wreckage, unleashed consequences). However, the cost remains abstract—"consequences he couldn't yet comprehend" deflects rather than dramatizes the price on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the ink pot's mysterious energy accumulates toward Clara's crystallized stance against running. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Clara articulates a new path forward with her father's tentative agreement marking relational cost. The "mathematics of a fair trade" resolves conceptually as balance between honesty and survival, though the mechanism for "staying honestly" remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves a form of closure through Elara's discovery of the "memory" rather than "invented history," but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The piece establishes clear anchors early and maintains coherent accumulation, yet the final revelation lacks visible stakes—what does finding this particular memory cost her or change about her future actions?

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece accumulates fragments toward a Conceptual Repricing where "the texture of memories was not just in the fragments they collected but in the act of remembering itself," but this realization lacks visible cost on the page. The wanderer continues unchanged—"And so, they continued their journey"—without foreclosing options or paying a price. Who/where/when anchors establish by ~120 words, and the accumulative lens holds, but closure needs sharper cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where Mara reframes her grandfather's riddle from something to solve to something to live, with the cost being her abandonment of concrete proof-seeking. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and the cello's resonance build toward this reconfiguration, though the final paragraph's explicit thematic statements ("courage to embrace the ephemeral, to find meaning in the fleeting") slightly dilute the earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with graffiti discoveries building toward communal resistance, but closure lacks visible cost—the festival succeeds without sacrifice or trade-off. The final paragraph declares victory through abstract promises ("beacon of possibility") rather than dramatizing a decisive change with felt consequences on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis - Elara completes documentation despite pressure, with emotional cost visible in "heavy heart" and the preservation/loss tension. Causal chain holds: mission → discovery → determination → completion. Deduction for cost being somewhat told rather than viscerally felt in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with sensory details building toward the drone's restoration, but lacks a true closure with visible cost—the repair succeeds without sacrifice or trade-off. The final meditation on "every broken thing held the promise of renewal" reads as thematic summary rather than earned reconfiguration. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based escalation (condensation motif, falcon returns) building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara discovers the river's source. The closure lands with emotional resonance and the "new journey" implies cost, but the transformation lacks decisive visible price—the tears and peace feel unearned given the minimal on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with repetitive ritual building toward town revival, but the closure lacks visible cost—the bell simply rings without sacrifice or trade-off. The pattern of walking and tuning accumulates atmosphere but never crystallizes into a decisive change with legible price. "His work was done" arrives without earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (Maya's shift from survival to discovery) but lacks visible cost—she simply "feels peace" without dramatized trade-offs. The cave-in setup promises physical stakes that evaporate mid-story without causal resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens coheres through lighthouse imagery and the lattice's recurring presence, building to Elias's stance crystallization. The journal discovery provides causal linkage between father's legacy and son's choice. However, the closure's cost remains more declared than felt—"knowing he was no longer the son of the boy who cried wolf" tells rather than shows transformation's price.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.2)
    The ending achieves Charged Poise - the ghost bride stands at a threshold with the bead illuminating her path - but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. The piece establishes its accumulative pattern but the "glimmer of hope" conclusion lacks the visible price or foreclosed option needed for strong closure. The orientation anchors (greenhouse, ghost bride, bead) arrive clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the canyon's transformation, but lacks visible cost - Elara experiences no loss, sacrifice, or foreclosed option. The "hauntingly optimistic aura" and completed restoration feel unearned without showing what creating this transformation costs her. The accumulative lens holds but the closure lacks the required felt or conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara finds belonging through the mural discovery, but the cost remains abstract—"years of wandering" tells rather than shows the price. The accumulative structure works through layered discoveries, yet the transformation from "broken faith" to restoration lacks concrete on-page struggle. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing about preserving forgotten traditions, but the cost remains abstract—"futuristic nostalgia" washing over her doesn't constitute visible or felt cost on the page. The piece lacks a decisive change; Lyra simply decodes a message and feels philosophical about it. The accumulative texture builds atmosphere but doesn't narrow options or force meaningful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages: flame pulses → patterns shift → Lira arrives → reveals conspiracy → they act together. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elara crystallizes her purpose with visible commitment ("to unravel the truth, one stitch at a time"). The cost remains somewhat abstract—we see dedication but not sacrifice—and the conspiracy mechanics feel underdeveloped, preventing higher scoring despite solid structural bones.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based intensification through the unsent letters building toward Elara's own. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when she reads her letter and chooses to heal, with emotional cost visible in "regret, of love unspoken, of a moment lost in fear." The progression from general messages to her specific letter creates meaningful tightening, though the actual content of her letter remains too abstract to fully charge the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases building toward Elara's decision to carry the child's message forward. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration—she transforms from translator to active voice. Yet the cost remains largely conceptual ("shared anxieties," "promise") rather than viscerally felt on the page, weakening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively through discovery layers (fresco→film→network→painting), and the Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Lira painting stories onto fog. However, the cost remains abstract—"tears streaming" and "lost joy return" tell rather than show the price of transformation. The "fold of a daydream" frame muddles whether events are literal or imagined, weakening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through sound harmonics and restoration imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's worldview shifts. However, the closure's cost remains largely conceptual ("certainty was a cage") without concrete stakes—we never see what Elara risks or loses by this transformation. The magical escalation from mural animation to full garden awakening lacks causal grounding, feeling more like convenient fantasy than earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: infiltration leads to seed discovery, which reveals urgent warning, prompting recruitment for tonight's resistance meeting. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elias commits to standing with the Lexicon against the Tax Collectors with his "spark of defiance burning brighter." The cost (being hunted, risking capture) is declared but not viscerally felt on-page, weakening the ending's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the poet's gradual transformation through creation, but closure lacks visible cost—she simply "smiled, her heart full" without showing what was sacrificed or foreclosed. The "blossom armistice" concept remains abstract metaphor rather than dramatized change. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost remains abstract - "heart heavy with foxglove regret, yet also filled with quiet triumph" tells rather than shows the price. The accumulative pattern builds but the final transformation ("something had changed") lacks specificity. No concrete before/after is legible beyond assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the symphony of truth and reconciliation with Kael, but the cost remains largely abstract—"months" of suffering told rather than felt on-page. The magical realism of the inkwell creating Kael's presence strains causality without sufficient grounding. The orientation is clear, and the hybrid lens holds, but the closure's mechanism feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's compromise solution that transforms division into unity. The causal chain from sealed envelope to adhesive analysis to blueprint discovery to final design is traceable. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual—while we're told of "trembling" and resolution, we don't witness a concrete sacrifice or see what Elias personally loses in choosing this middle path, weakening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (dust motes, songs, messages) leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara achieves integration. The mysterious letter provides the key turn that reframes the dust as meaningful pattern rather than chaos. Closure lands with earned stasis as she preserves herself alongside the songs, though the cost could be more visceral—it's felt but somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara understands sacred thresholds as spaces requiring loss, with visible cost in leaving the logbook behind. The accumulative structure coheres through the prism imagery and memory integration. However, the cost feels more intellectual than visceral—we understand but don't fully feel the weight of her realization about her father's necessary distance.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's realization that belonging is "creating a rhythm that harmonized with the world" followed by her choosing to dance despite mortal danger. The accumulative lens holds as firefly patterns build toward this crystallization. Cost is visible when she risks death for one last moment of connection.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Lira's meditation building toward insight, but the closure lacks visible cost—the vanishing image causes only a soft smile, not the price required for Resonant Reconfiguration. The pattern of "missing pieces" → "hidden within her own heart" → "meant to be rediscovered" completes conceptually but without dramatized consequence or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based resonance, but lacks a true closure with visible cost. The ending ("ready to happen again") maintains status quo rather than achieving decisive change or reconfiguration. The performance sequence builds atmosphere but doesn't escalate toward a moment where Elias must choose, renounce, or pay a price for his philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Charged Poise closure - Lira's defiant display crystallizes her stance with the verse as "shield and sword," though the sentinel's retreat lacks causal grounding. The accumulative lens holds as pressure builds through layered imagery. Cost is visible in risking erasure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece establishes orientation cleanly (Pearl Bay, dawn, Elias at dock) and maintains accumulative coherence through ritual-to-revelation structure. However, the closure—Elias's decision to "share his reckonings"—lacks visible cost or concrete change. The "noctilucent reckoning" in the atrium reads as assertion rather than earned transformation, and no path is foreclosed with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias transforms the box from a vessel of guilt to one of purpose, with cost visible in his acceptance that "pain would never leave him." The accumulative structure coheres through the box's symbolic evolution. However, the transformation feels somewhat unearned—the feather's visions appear without clear causality, and the shift from guilt to purpose happens through reflection rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara creating patterns that build toward her realization. The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing where hope shifts from equation to lived experience, but the cost remains abstract—we see pattern loss but not what Elara sacrifices or risks. The piece teaches its meditative mode early but lacks the concrete pressure that would make the final insight land with force.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong causal chain from discovery to revelation, with the film strip serving as key that unlocks the chamber. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration—Echo's understanding shifts from mapping dreams to honoring memory, with visible cost in accepting the burden. Minor deduction for the slightly rushed pacing of the final revelation sequence, which could use one more beat to fully earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's sacrifice enabling others' transformations, with visible cost (her fainter heartbeat). The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through the lullabies' effects. However, the mechanics of "borrowed heartbeats" remain somewhat abstract, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration when the leaders sign the treaty after Elara's vulnerable admission, with the cost visible in her personal erosion and their "mixture of gratitude and sorrow." The causal lens holds as her operatively gentle approach leads to breakthrough. Orientation is clear early, though the transition from terrace to valley could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly when the rain begins after Elara plants the egg, creating a before/after shift with visible cost ("redemption she didn't deserve"). The accumulative structure coheres through salt/water imagery. Deducting for slight orientation delay and some causality softness around how exactly placing an egg triggers rain.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration - the city awakens and Elara's role transforms, with visible cost ("knew her role...would never be the same"). The accumulative lens holds as density builds toward the echo release. However, the cost feels more declared than dramatized, and the transformation's specific consequences remain vague ("potential for change").

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure presents a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias reversing his artistic method) but the cost remains abstract—"finding serenity once more" without visible sacrifice. The accumulative texture builds adequately but the final transformation lacks the concrete price that would make the before/after legible. Who/where/when anchors are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost—Elara simply completes her art and leaves, with no reconfiguration of options or meaningful change. The monarchs' absence creates atmosphere but never forces a choice or stance that would constitute proper closure under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara discovers her own name among the forgotten, achieving self-forgiveness with visible emotional cost. The accumulative structure coheres through the rope-weaving sequence building to musical revelation. However, the cost remains primarily emotional rather than requiring sacrifice or foreclosing options.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver genuine closure with cost. The revelation about "resonance" between paths and walkers reads as abstract insight without dramatized consequence—Foresight gains understanding but pays no visible price. The wafer seal dissolving represents change but lacks the before/after weight required for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows a simple quest structure (search → find → decode → revelation) but lacks meaningful closure with visible cost. Kael becoming a "guardian" is declared rather than dramatized through decisive change. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but the final "covenant" moment carries no felt price or foreclosed option—he simply accepts knowledge without sacrifice or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves basic closure with Kael's shift from resentment to hope, but the cost remains abstract—we never learn what specific resentment he carries or what he sacrifices by releasing it. The causal chain from music box metaphor to cellular memory to transformation feels mechanically assembled rather than organically earned. The sanctuary's "shifting realities" setup promises more than it delivers.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Charged Poise closure where Elara stands "at the threshold of both" worlds, with the cost implied through the "fleeting moment" and the sextant's fading glow. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and breathing rhythms build toward this reconfiguration. However, the cost could be more explicitly felt - what exactly does she sacrifice or risk in this moment?

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the ribbon's transformation into the glowing tree, but causality weakens when forgotten objects conveniently solve problems (key unlocks scroll, petals cause bloom) without established logic. The breach of contract backstory consumes ~25% without anchoring present choices beyond metaphorical reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost—Elara simply accepts her destiny without sacrifice or foreclosed alternatives. The mysterious woman's appearance feels deus ex machina, explaining the cameo's significance through exposition rather than dramatized discovery. "The astral orchard...was no longer just a setting—it was her destiny" tells rather than shows the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows clear causal links from Kael's arrival through finding the diary to accessing the library, and closure occurs with the successful "rescue mission" of knowledge. However, the cost remains abstract—"the weight of unlearned wisdom" doesn't specify what Elara pays or foregoes. The guardian negotiation happens off-page ("offering a bargain"), preventing us from witnessing the actual stakes or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through discovered narratives that reweight Elara's understanding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she steps through the door and feels "whole" for the first time, with the cost being acceptance of her "blissfully aberrant" parts. The emerald card dissolving and Lyra's voice create a before/after shift, though the conceptual cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a true closure with visible cost—Elara simply succeeds in unlocking a door and finding artifacts without sacrifice or transformation. The rope-braiding action creates no real tension or stakes. The ending celebrates achievement without showing what was lost or changed, failing the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain holds: energy beings create chaos → Lira must find bloom → she reads ice patterns → finds and activates bloom → silence restored. However, the closure lacks visible cost - Lira is merely "weary" after saving the world. The resolution feels too neat, with the bloom working exactly as intended without meaningful sacrifice or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves a Decisive Change when Elara sacrifices her memories to restore the prism, with visible cost ("her memories began to fade"). However, the causal chain weakens when the ritual requirement appears late without prior setup. The orientation is clear but the because/therefore linkage from star-tracking to memory sacrifice feels disconnected.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with atmospheric density building toward the vision sequence. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elara simply receives visions and commits to continue her work without sacrifice or foreclosed options. The final "deepening hush in her heart" attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but provides no legible price for this stance.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure (fortress transforms from despair to hope). However, the transformation lacks visible cost - Lira gives nothing up, risks nothing tangible. The piece teaches its pattern of light-versus-dark but the closure feels unearned because no price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's meditation building toward a Conceptual Repricing where she reconceives time's nature. The closure lands with her shift from seeking to becoming "a part of" time's texture, but the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt—we see her new understanding but not what she sacrifices for it.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear causal structure with the gravity inversion as the central mechanism enabling escape. The closure lands with Elara's transformation and newfound freedom, showing genuine change. However, the cost feels somewhat abstract—"she would never be the same" lacks the specific, visible price that would elevate this to a higher band. The orientation is clear and the lens (causal) holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the storm glass vial's reactions building to Mira's transformation. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira finds peace through silence, with cost visible in her weeks of prior anxiety now released. Orientation anchors (gondola, terrace, Elias/Mira) establish cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing (throne represents collective wisdom) but the cost remains abstract - "understanding" and "legacy" lack visceral weight. The causal chain functions adequately through discovery sequences, but the transformation from seeking power to gaining understanding needs sharper dramatization of what Lira sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage (darkness encroaches → Lira uses ring → sacrifices scar connection), delivering Earned Stasis as she accepts the cost of protecting the sanctuary. However, the cost remains conceptual—we never see the specific soul she loses or feel the particular weight of that severed connection, weakening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages (text message → portal → diamond transformation), but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara gains diamonds and hope without meaningful sacrifice. The orientation anchors (mushroom farm, Elara, present day) establish clearly by ~100 words, meeting the test.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a causal lens with clear setup (Eleanor seeks truth) and payoff (discovers betrayal), but the mystical bridge sequence breaks established reality without sufficient grounding. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing but the cost remains abstract—we're told about a "curse" and "internal betrayal" without seeing how this knowledge changes Eleanor's concrete options going forward.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with patterns of light and mystical imagery building toward Alaric's transformation, but the closure lacks visible cost—he simply gains understanding without sacrificing anything concrete. The "shivering bliss" and newfound purpose arrive without him paying a price or foreclosing an option.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara finding purpose in uncovering histories, but the cost remains abstract—we're told she's "broken-hearted" without seeing what she sacrifices or risks. The accumulative structure builds through dust patterns and artifacts, yet the closure lacks visible price beyond general healing.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Charged Poise closure with Mara vanishing as enforcers arrive, having broadcast the truth—a crystallized moment where options are legible. The causal lens holds with clear because/therefore linkages throughout. However, the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page, and the "stars winking in approval" undercuts the earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows a simple causal chain (prophecy threatens → music counters → prophecy dissolves) but the closure lacks visible cost—the saxophonist simply succeeds without sacrifice or transformation. The prophecy's nature and threat remain abstract ("threatened to unravel the fragile balance"), never dramatized as concrete danger. The resolution reads as convenient magic rather than earned change, with the grotto simply "exhaling" once the undefined threat vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through monuments and folklore research, but closure lacks visible cost—Elara stands "transformed" without showing what she sacrifices or loses. The moonstone discovery initiates change but the ending merely declares transformation without a decisive on-page choice or renunciation. Structure holds but the "ready to carry the message" ending provides stance without earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the tinkerer's shifted relationship with uncertainty, moving from trying to control time to celebrating its mysteries. However, the cost remains largely conceptual rather than felt—we see him change his craft but don't witness what he sacrifices or loses in this transformation, making the closure intellectually satisfying but emotionally thin.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's understanding shifts from seeking to redeem the coin to accepting it as part of her ongoing story. The visions provide causal linkage to this realization, and the cost is legible in her transformed relationship to regret. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established early and the single-scene structure maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the figure dissolving into light and Elara finding "a piece of herself," showing visible transformation. However, the causal chain from confession to dissolution feels mechanical—playing harp leads directly to healing without complication or earned resistance that would deepen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara releases the pewter strap and embraces mercy as "not erasing pain but understanding its purpose." However, this insight arrives through reflection rather than dramatized pressure, and the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from fragment discovery through painting decipherment to tower exploration, landing on a Resonant Reconfiguration where forgotten histories are reclaimed. The lens appears Causal with clean because/therefore linkages. Closure lands with conceptual cost (centuries of overlooked stories now burden Lila) though the personal price could be more visceral. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the clock repair heals both building and ghosts, with emotional warmth as the felt cost of Marcus's "weightless burden." However, the accumulative progression feels mechanical - each discovery leads too smoothly to the next without genuine resistance. The mainspring-to-clock connection reads as convenient rather than earned through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's acceptance of her caretaker role, with visible cost in abandoning the library's safety and embracing chaos. The accumulative structure coheres as frost patterns → whisper → cloud journey → living library revelation, each layer reweighting her understanding. Orientation anchors (glass library, letterpress operator) establish clearly within 120 words. The closure lands with felt transformation cost, though the final revelation could be more viscerally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration - Elara proves her theory and gains vindication but remains emotionally unchanged ("her own wounds remained unhealed"). The causal chain holds from theory dismissal through vindication, though the cost feels more stated than dramatized in "bittersweet triumph."

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkage from broken box to journey to restoration. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias understands restoration extends beyond objects to "truths, promises, and balance itself," with the cost being the spent magic of the chip. However, the stranger's disappearance feels convenient, and the Covenant of Rust discovery lacks sufficient setup—it appears suddenly without earned revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - Elara's acceptance of mystery over answers, symbolized by letting the compass sink. The accumulative lens holds through sensory details building to the lagoon's revelation. Cost is visible (losing the compass/connection to grandfather) though the "embrace of the unknown" edges toward abstraction rather than felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing where Mara's role transforms from artist to keeper of legacy, with cost implied through "profound sense of purpose." However, the magical revelation sequence (glowing slides, erupting light, instant map comprehension) lacks causal grounding and reads as convenient discovery rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (dream → postcards → journey → cathedral → painting) but lacks a decisive change with visible cost—Elara simply completes her commission with added understanding. The ending claims peace and answers but shows no trade-off or foreclosed path, reading more as successful task completion than transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the lagoon encounter. Closure occurs as Charged Poise—Elara's parley creates a crystallized moment where "the sands themselves were holding their breath" with promise of truth's release. However, the cost remains abstract ("no matter how painful") rather than viscerally felt on-page, and the guardian's immediate dissolution deflates potential pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows a simple wish-fulfillment structure where Elara finds bottle → visualizes revival → town resurrects without meaningful complication or cost. The closure (town revival) happens through unexplained magic rather than earned causality. No visible price is paid; the transformation occurs without sacrifice, struggle, or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara discovers her work continues the Orchadrians' emotional preservation project, reweighting her initial task. The accumulative structure coheres through foghorn silence → phonograph discovery → language recognition → garden response. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than felt—we understand the weight intellectually but don't see what Elara sacrifices or risks by accepting this ancient mandate.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.4)
    The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing as Elara understands her role extends beyond preservation to nurturing "borrowed moments," but the cost remains largely conceptual rather than felt. The piece teaches its vortex-inheritance pattern early but the actual mechanics of "decreasing entropy" and how it "reverses decay" remain vague abstractions that weaken the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Elias crossing "the threshold of zero hour" as keeper of secrets, but the cost remains abstract - "knowing he had crossed" lacks visible price. The accumulative texture builds effectively through microclimate tracking to bell resonance, but the final transformation needs sharper stakes to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - Lira places the lantern for the next seeker, having internalized its lesson about "flourishing stillness." The accumulative lens holds through imagery patterns. However, the cost feels more conceptual than visceral - we understand but don't feel the price of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the oasis's revival, but the causality operates through convenient magic rather than earned consequence. The covenant restoration follows a collect-the-pieces quest structure where each discovery arrives without meaningful obstacle, and the cost remains abstract ("weight of unspoken words") rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves basic causal linkage but lacks a decisive cost at closure - time is simply "mended" without visible sacrifice or transformation. The orientation is clear (Eldermere, silo, Elara as timekeeper) but the resolution reads as convenient problem-solving rather than earned change. "She felt a sense of belonging" asserts rather than demonstrates the supposed transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through mutual recognition and shared creation, but the cost remains abstract ("beauty in the incomplete") rather than visceral. The accumulative/textural lens holds but the closure lacks a decisive price—neither character sacrifices or loses anything tangible when they harmonize their discord.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward Elias's peaceful death, but the closure lacks visible cost—he simply "closed his eyes" without dramatized price for his transformation work. The orientation is clear early but the ending reads as Earned Stasis without the required "foreclosed path" being made legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    The closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing about homecoming but lacks visible cost - Elara simply places amber and descends with new understanding. The accumulative structure coheres but the final realization ("not in answers but in the questions") reads as abstract philosophy rather than earned insight with stakes. No path is foreclosed, no price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story presents a Resonant Reconfiguration through the transformation of the jetty, but the cost remains entirely abstract ("memories of what had been"). No concrete price is paid on-page—the coachman simply plants seeds and leaves. The accumulative texture builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a decisive moment where something specific is lost or risked.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the leaf's transformation and Elias's understanding that "the wasteland wasn't just a place of loss; it was a place of connection." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and the phonograph's revelations build toward this reweighting. Cost is primarily conceptual rather than visceral, visible in the shift from isolation to connection. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established clearly within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara reframes her role from curse to calling, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The piece teaches its accumulative pattern early through layered description, yet the closure lacks a specific, visible price—we're told she's "ready" without seeing what she sacrifices or risks.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkages (legend draws Kael → ascends spire → solves chess puzzle → unlocks spire's power). The closure lands as a Decisive Change with the sky restored and Kael's wonder rediscovered. However, the cost remains abstract—"gave back more than it took" doesn't specify what was taken—and the chess game's mechanics feel arbitrary rather than earned through prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's shift from performing others' pain to facing her own, with cost visible in the "luminous absence" that replaces her roles. The accumulative structure coheres through whispers→chessboard→walking pattern. Minor deduction for slightly abstract cost articulation in "space filled with potential."

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands - Elara achieves integration and reframes "home" as internal harmony rather than external place, with the cost being confrontation of buried pain. The accumulative structure coheres adequately, though the stone's discovery feels convenient and the mechanics of "seeding thoughts" remain opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's journey from frozen guilt to active self-forgiveness, with the labyrinth's message crystallizing this shift. The accumulative structure works—each element (tapestry, labyrinth, platinum thread) builds toward the closure. The cost is present but somewhat abstract; we feel the "weight of guilt" lifting but lack concrete stakes about what her past mistake actually cost her.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Lira's acceptance that "Forgiveness is not a gift I give, but a wound I choose to heal," creating a clear before/after with felt cost. The accumulative lens holds as poetic refractions build toward transformation. The "shard of her heart" she surrenders makes cost legible, though the mechanics of what exactly she loses could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transforms from seeking wholeness to embracing brokenness as strength, with visible cost (the workshop's near-collapse, time pressure). The accumulative structure coheres through the pockmark pattern discovery leading to memory recovery. Deducting for the slightly abstract resolution where "hope" materializes without more concrete consequence, though the kintsugi concept does reweight prior material meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's shift from isolation to connection, with the painted oasis serving as the mechanism. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual - "her heart lighter than it had been in years" suggests relief without visible sacrifice. The accumulative structure coheres but the transformation lacks a sharp before/after with felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's understanding that "intentions, when pure and quiet, had a power that shouts could never match," but the cost remains abstract rather than visceral. The mysterious woman's appearance and guidance lack causal linkage—she materializes without setup and vanishes without consequence beyond thematic validation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves basic causal coherence with the beacon-building leading to travelers arriving, but the closure lacks visible cost - Mara gains community without sacrificing anything meaningful. The "geography of loss" and "reverse migration" concepts remain abstract metaphors rather than dramatized stakes. The Resonant Reconfiguration attempt (station becoming refuge) occurs without the required felt price or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the glass eye serving as a pattern-breaking element that forces truth. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias returns the eye and achieves Earned Stasis, accepting that "some secrets were meant to stay buried, while others were meant to set him free" with visible cost (loss of control, forced vulnerability). The ritual resolution feels slightly convenient but the cost of involuntary truth and the choice to relinquish control are dramatized on page.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias accepts the stranger's memories as his own responsibility, with felt cost ("strange sense of peace"). The accumulative structure coheres through the journal discovery and memory fragments, though the cost could be more visceral at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias finds purpose as a guardian, with visible cost in accepting responsibility ("the weight of the promise settle on his shoulders"). However, the fantastical shift from antique shop to glowing cavern lacks causal grounding—why does touching the wall reveal a passage? The closure lands but the middle causality wobbles.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves a Decisive Change (disenchanted to purposeful) with conceptual cost (responsibility for kingdom's actions), but the revelation feels unearned—the shadow figure appears without prior setup and delivers exposition. The causal chain from dreams to grotto to truth feels mechanically convenient rather than inevitable. Orientation is clear but the closure's weight relies on telling rather than dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the glowing shell transformation, but the cost remains conceptually vague ("weight...not as burden, but as gift"). The accumulative texture builds but never crystallizes into a decisive change with legible stakes. The piece teaches its mystical-scientific pattern but the final "revaluing" lacks concrete before/after comparison.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through layered memories and the scroll's revelation building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts her continuum of selves. The closure lands on-page with felt cost ("The chaos had been distilled"). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The cost is more conceptual than visceral—we see the resolution but don't fully feel the price of abandoning her jealousy.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's understanding deepening through the birthing screw's revelation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she reframes her loss as a different way of seeing. The closure lands with emotional cost ("bittersweet expression") and conceptual shift. However, the causality between repairing clocks and understanding the screw feels somewhat loose, and Mira's arrival timing is convenient rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's internal journey from fear to acceptance landing as Resonant Reconfiguration—she finds peace through embracing rather than rejecting her past. The cost (accepting vulnerability of superstition) is present but could be more visceral; the transformation feels earned but lacks a sharp decisive moment where stakes truly crystallize.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara channeling her grandmother's spirit through the perfume bottle, achieving reconciliation. However, the closure lacks visible cost—the orchard will still be destroyed, and Elara's transformation from guilt to peace happens without meaningful resistance or sacrifice. The "induced currents" mechanism feels convenient rather than earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story reaches for Conceptual Repricing but the cost remains abstract ("a bridge between the old and the new"). The witness's journey follows accumulative logic but lacks concrete stakes or visible price—the dictionary merging with the mural creates spectacle without dramatized consequence. Orientation anchors clearly but the closure unit fails to show what specifically changes or is lost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.2)
    The scroll revelation provides closure through Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains abstract—"profound sense of peace" doesn't show what Elias sacrifices or forecloses. The hidden compartment discovery feels mechanically convenient rather than causally earned, and the transformation happens through reading rather than dramatized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.9)
    The closure achieves Conceptual Repricing as Elara shifts from "intrusion detection" to understanding "boundaries as bridges," but the cost remains abstract—"a quiet wildfire burning in her heart" lacks concrete consequence. The mysterious figure's appearance strains causality without sufficient grounding in the established world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Elara's "quiet resolve" and readiness to "begin" constitute intention without action—no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The accumulative lens could work but the density never increases toward pressure; instead we get meditation without escalation. The subway scrawls premise is introduced but never dramatized as method.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern intensification (repeated calls building the same melody) leading to Eli's decisive final call—a Resonant Reconfiguration where he chooses connection over estrangement. The cost is legible in "exhausted but strangely at peace" and the dissolution of his protective distance. Minor weakness: the disc's transformation from object to "key" feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's realization about participating in regeneration, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. The accumulative structure coheres around the preservation theme, yet lacks a decisive tightening that would create genuine pressure. The revelation about Mara's grandparents provides context but doesn't fundamentally alter Elara's options or extract a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration through the clock's transformation and Elara's realization about creating connection through reciprocity. The cost—accepting that loneliness requires active creation of connection rather than finding a cure—is conceptually present but could be more viscerally felt. The hybrid lens holds, though the metaphysical turn strains causality slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's realization that the uncharted depths lie within, with the compass ring's eternal stillness serving as tangible cost/change. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and emotional languages build toward the stillpoint revelation. The closure lands cleanly with "the greatest maps are those of the heart," though the final third tends toward summary rather than scene.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara uses the pen to "unbend the timeline" through understanding rather than force. The closure lands with conceptual cost (accepting uncertainty while finding peace), though the causality between writing invisible words and stabilizing the anomaly could be more mechanically grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when "silence was no longer empty; it was alive with meaning," but this arrives through assertion rather than dramatized cost. The camera's mysterious click provides texture without clear consequence. Who/where/when anchors establish by ~100 words, and the accumulative pattern holds, but the closure's cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (clues lead to discovery) but lacks a decisive change with visible cost—finding and reading the scroll produces tears but no altered options or foreclosed paths. The "closure" is discovery without transformation, missing the required on-page cost that would make a before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the lagoon revelation serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration that reframes the entangled memories from curse to bridge. Cost appears in "auroral sorrow" and the acceptance of shared grief, though it could be more visceral. The orientation anchors (garden, Elara, experimental treatment) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage (find coin/map/key → follow path → encounter Mira → unlock passage). Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Eli proves "whispers travel farther than shouts," though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral. The orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the stranger's lightened burden and the constellation pattern of shutters, but the cost remains primarily implied rather than visible on the page. The accumulative structure coheres around the weaving metaphor and builds toward the final image of reflected stars, yet the transformation lacks a decisive moment where the stranger pays a concrete price for their newfound hope.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost—the synchronized displays occur but we see no specific transformation or price paid, only abstract satisfaction. Causality is loose: the grotto visits don't causally connect to the window displays' success. The piece reads more as extended setup than complete arc, with the actual rebellion's impact remaining hypothetical.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.2)
    The accumulative structure builds from dock work through mystical discovery to self-revelation, with the scrimshaw serving as catalyst. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara integrates her guarded heart, finding "freedom was found not in escape, but in embracing who she truly was." However, the magical island sequence feels mechanically convenient, and the cost of transformation remains abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through whittling, dried flowers, and turbines, culminating in Earned Stasis as Elara continues her resistance ritual. However, the happiness mandate's mechanics remain vague exposition, and the cost—while conceptually present in the brother's fate—doesn't viscerally land in the final image of the carved heart.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a true closure with visible cost—the poet simply walks away enriched. The transformation sequence (ice floating upward, boundaries dissolving) creates atmosphere without consequence. No path forecloses; no price is paid beyond vague "weight of experience."

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the concertina awakening, but closure lacks visible cost—Elias gains insight without losing anything concrete. The transformation from colorblind limitation to artistic strength reads as conceptual repricing, yet the "before/after" change remains abstract rather than dramatized through specific loss or foreclosed opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara collecting sound fragments that build toward understanding, but the closure lacks visible cost—her "exhaustion but enlightenment" is asserted without showing what she sacrifices or forecloses. The lens activation device works as a literal prism refracting sounds into memories, providing coherent linkage. The pattern accumulates but the final "renewal" feels abstract without a concrete before/after change.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara accepts the tattoo and commits to her purpose. The cost is present but somewhat abstract—we see her transformation but the price of moving forward isn't viscerally felt. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established clearly within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through "from its ruins, something new could rise" but the cost remains abstract—no specific price is paid or path foreclosed. The accumulative build through cards/data/measuring tape creates texture but the final "hope" lacks the concrete weight required for publishable closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing but lacks visible cost—Elara's transformation from seeking external knowledge to finding internal truth happens through exposition ("She understood then") rather than dramatized action. The accumulative texture builds adequately but the final reweighting feels unearned, with no clear before/after legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara transforms the shadow into "a sculpture of light and darkness," with visible cost in her "mix of triumph and sorrow." The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward this crystallization. Orientation is clear early, and the shadow's progression from footage to manifestation to sculpture tracks causally.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara processing betrayal through reflection and symbolic transformation, landing on a Resonant Reconfiguration where she reframes the chameleon's tail from "token of betrayal" to "talisman of resilience." However, the closure lacks visible cost on the page—we're told she'll face "wounds that needed healing" but see no actual price paid in the present moment, only philosophical acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's journey building through sensory details and plant whispers toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when the hourglasses merge. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph. The closure lands with "scars on her soul began to fade" suggesting healing, though the cost feels more conceptual than dramatically earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara decides to take the film strip and "release the love it held," with felt cost implied through her reflection on her own unspoken loves. However, the cost remains largely conceptual rather than dramatically visceral, and the accumulative structure, while coherent, doesn't fully exploit the tension between discovering and releasing stored love.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.2)
    No closure occurs—the story ends with Lira "ready to follow their path wherever it may lead," pure anticipation without transformation. The piece establishes atmosphere but never moves beyond setup into actual event. Cost remains entirely conceptual ("challenges and revelations" ahead) rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the archive transforms and Mara understands her expanded role, with the clock's restarted time marking genuine change. The accumulative progression from dune to archive to divergent futures coheres well. Deducting for slight ambiguity in the cost—while hope and renewal are present, the specific price Mara pays remains somewhat abstract ("knowing she had done what she came to do").

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Eamon's wandering building toward enlightenment. The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing where the rainforest-as-mind metaphor reframes everything, though the cost remains abstract ("for the first time, he felt ready to embrace it"). The machine activation feels convenient rather than earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the ticket punch transferring its star to Mara's being, a symbolic closure that reweights the journey. Cost is primarily conceptual/metaphorical rather than viscerally felt. The accumulative lens holds, though the ferryman's dual presence strains logical coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - Elias transforms from passive keeper to active guardian of truth, with the cost being his permanent commitment to the fortress. The accumulative structure builds through silence/sound imagery effectively, though the revelation chamber sequence feels slightly rushed for the weight it carries.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows a causal lens but the closure lacks visible cost—the pretender simply "cracks" without dramatized consequence. The orientation is clear, but the resolution arrives through convenience: why does the pretender appear at precisely the right moment? The pellet-dropping gesture meant to signal defeat reads as theatrical rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver clear closure with cost—Elara's realization about the torn page's meaning doesn't alter her options or force a choice. The piece ends on conceptual insight ("Some paths disappear because we stop walking them") without dramatized consequence or reconfiguration of her present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Lira's vision-induced purpose renewal, but the transformation mechanism (opera glasses suddenly revealing cosmic truth) lacks causal foundation. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the stone circle's hum, yet the cost remains abstract—"reignite them...with thunderous serenity" doesn't specify what Lira sacrifices or risks.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Mara crystallizes as revolutionary leader with the embryo as beacon. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. The causal chain from discovery to unsealing to acceptance works, though the guard encounter feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through Zara's artistic renewal, but the cost remains abstract ("wasn't healed, not entirely"). The photograph near-fall provides a physical crisis, yet the epiphanic realization about "quiet strength within her" arrives without sufficient causal pressure—the story tells us about transformation rather than dramatizing the specific friction that forces it.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transforms her relationship to darkness and creativity, with visible cost in abandoning the broken box. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through card imagery and metaphorical weight. The closure lands cleanly with "her guide, her muse, her truth," though the transformation's speed slightly undermines the cost's full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara shifts from seeking control to accepting understanding) with emotional cost visible in her tears and transformation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the story builds through imagery and pattern toward the ink's revelation. However, the cost could be more concrete—we see emotional release but limited practical consequence of choosing understanding over control.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (letter arrives → breaks seal → accesses network → copies data → faces consequences) with a Decisive Change when Elara crosses from protector to transgressor. The closure lands with stated cost ("at what cost to herself, to her world?") but this remains abstract rather than viscerally demonstrated. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story reaches Earned Stasis (Elara maintains her sanctuary despite threats) but the cost remains largely conceptual. The phrase "she had carved her own path" declares rather than demonstrates the price of her choice. No concrete loss or sacrifice appears on the page at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the garden is restored with the goddess's echo woven into its fabric. The cost is legible in Kael's transformation from fisher to keeper of the echo. However, the middle section lacks sufficient density increase before the goddess appears, and the causality of why the rail spike becomes a "key" feels asserted rather than earned through prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure fails to deliver on-page cost - Eleanor simply leaves "ready to share her findings" without showing the actual confrontation or its consequences. The story summarizes investigation and discovery rather than dramatizing the decisive moment. The recalibration of the telescope is symbolic gesture without causal weight or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the letters leading to emotional release. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when silence replaces dissonance, with cost visible in Elara's years of suffering, though the final transformation could use sharper dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing through Elara's realization that "meaning was not found but created," with the grotto's cautionary tale providing conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as patterns shift and density increases toward the mandala's dissolution. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt—we see Elara's "trembling hands" but no concrete price for her new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure presents symbolic action (rebuilding the mosaic) but lacks decisive change with visible cost - Elara simply rearranges tiles while the narrative asserts transformation without dramatizing resistance or sacrifice. The accumulative structure builds imagery but doesn't achieve the required resonant reconfiguration with felt price. Cost remains conceptual rather than embodied on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara guides her alternate self from despair to hope, with the garden's transformation mirroring internal change. However, the cost remains largely abstract ("bittersweet smile") rather than concrete, and the fractured timeline mechanics feel ornamental rather than essential to the closure—the same emotional beat could occur without the time-fracture element.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the light painting as metaphor for healing, but the cost remains abstract ("willowglass hope—fragile yet unyielding"). The piece teaches its accumulative pattern but the final image doesn't reweight earlier material with felt consequence - Elara's "way forward" lacks specific sacrifice or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara discovers the chamber and understands her expanded purpose, but the cost remains abstract - we're told she feels "purpose unlike anything she had ever known" without seeing what she sacrifices or risks. The causal chain (fossil discovery → emotional flooding → chamber revelation) holds, but each link lacks the tension that would make the transformation feel earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres adequately with the echo "unscrambling" into shared wisdom, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost remains abstract - we're told about "choices made and paths untaken" but see no specific price Elara pays. The bone button discovery feels convenient rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara discovering the letter as a Resonant Reconfiguration that reframes her courage. While the pattern of codes-to-tree-to-letter provides causality and the ending shifts her stance, the cost remains abstract ("stir of unused courage") rather than visible on the page, limiting closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with atmospheric density building toward the coachman's philosophical realization, but the closure—"not an answer but a way of seeing"—lacks visible or felt cost on the page. The figure's appearance and scroll feel coincidental rather than earned through the coachman's agency, and the transformation from seeking to understanding happens through dialogue rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition building toward revelation, but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara gains understanding and community healing without losing anything. The "fractured timelines" concept functions more as discovery tool than active constraint on choices. Orientation is clear but the transformation from wasteland to healing oasis happens without dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the mutual recognition scene, with the tooth serving as catalyst. However, the cost remains largely abstract ("protected vulnerability") rather than concrete. The accumulative texture builds adequately but the final "kindred spirit" resolution feels unearned given the brief interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage (sundial unlocks door → touches orb → receives visions → becomes bridge). However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elena gains power without losing anything tangible. The transformation happens TO her rather than through her agency, and the "promise of coexistence" ending feels abstract rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with sensory detail building toward revelation, but the closure moment when the installation "comes alive" feels unearned—no prior mechanics establish why the spiral fits or what cost Elara pays. The transformation reads as magical convenience rather than resonant reconfiguration with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: signal disrupts → Elara decodes → deploys counter-frequency → temporary victory while community divides. Closure achieves Earned Stasis as Elara commits to vigilance with visible cost (isolation in her "small bastion"), though the cosmic stakes remain somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear goal-pursuit (find key) leading to discovery and transformation. However, the closure—Elara's liberation through "embracing the mutiny"—lacks visible cost or trade-off; the chamber simply expands without explaining how or what price she pays. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's final portrait that "bridges the gap," with conceptual cost implied in confronting "the void." However, the closure's cost remains primarily metaphorical ("dormant empathy...begun to stir") rather than concrete, and the mysterious figure's appearance/disappearance lacks clear consequence on Elara's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves closure through Elara's choice to reverse the exile, with visible transformation of the station. However, the cost remains abstract - we're told she "chose wisely" but the actual price of her decision isn't dramatized. The causal chain works but the stakes of "restore or protect" arrive too late without prior development.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Bridge-Song piecing together clues to find a hidden sanctuary, but the closure—discovering "pixelated amnesty" as a place and playing fiddle—lacks visible cost or meaningful reconfiguration. The hitchhiker's disappearance initiates the quest and the glass flake guides it, yet the final revelation ("a sanctuary for those who dared to defy fate") remains conceptually vague without dramatized stakes or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's final understanding that "some paths circle back, not to trap us, but to teach us," with emotional cost visible in his father's defeat and debt. The accumulative structure coheres well, building from money to train to journal to final insight. However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral - we understand but don't fully feel the price of these circular paths.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition building toward understanding, but the closure arrives through abstract realization ("she had not just decoded inscriptions but unlocked a truth") without visible cost or concrete change. The transformation from chronicler to healed individual lacks causal linkage—no dramatized event forces this shift.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the vortex journey serving as both literal and metaphorical unbending. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration as Eira transforms from guarded to open, with visible cost in her vulnerability. The expanding circles structure provides coherent escalation. Deduction for the vague nature of the original failure, which dilutes the cost's specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with Elara discovering the clipping, entering the maze, and restoring the covenant—a Decisive Change with visible cost (her scars glow and connect). However, the cost feels more declared than dramatized; we see the scars activate but don't experience what Elara sacrifices or endures in the restoration moment.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Earned Stasis—Elara chooses to remain bound to the catacombs, accepting her trammel with visible cost. The deal's revelation ("This was never about the card... It was about the choice") reweights prior actions and the final image of her returning to work lands the cost. Orientation anchors (catacomb orchard, Elara, her mission) establish clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the shadow-figure's somewhat abstract entrance and dialogue that verges on thematic exposition rather than dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's shift from insulating with facts to embracing hope, but the cost remains abstract ("the echo valley longing in his heart would always be there"). The accumulative/textural lens holds but lacks a decisive tightening—Elias's transformation occurs through internal declaration rather than a dramatized choice with visible stakes. No concrete action or renunciation makes the before/after legible with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the seed's growth serving as the central metaphor for understanding. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Eliara achieves peace through lived understanding rather than theoretical knowledge, with cost shown in her years of isolation. However, the cost could be more visceral—the "years" of work are told rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through rune reconfiguration and identity stabilization. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when identities stabilize "not in their original forms," with cost implied through permanent transformation. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the pearl discovery leading to crown activation and spiritual purpose. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transforms from inspector to "bridge" for collective hope, with cost implied through "walls of mistrust" breaking. However, the transformation happens too smoothly—the pearl-to-crown progression lacks intermediate resistance or complication that would deepen the earned quality of change.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through map fragments, graffiti wisdom, and the accordion's patches, but the closure lacks visible cost on the page—Elara simply "found the first steps" without dramatized price or foreclosed options. The stranger's appearance and exit feel coincidental rather than causally earned. While the final image of the accordion feeling "lighter" attempts resonance, it doesn't demonstrate the required decisive change or reconfiguration with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the dreamer transforms from seeker to conduit, with visible cost in accepting her role. The accumulative structure coheres well - each discovery (entrance symbols, humming watch, writing desk) builds toward the revelation. Orientation anchors establish clearly by paragraph two, and the lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a Hybrid lens (accumulative-causal) with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the violin transforms from transparent to opaque. However, the cost feels asserted rather than dramatized—we're told about "mulberry ache" and "sacrifice" but don't see what specifically Elara loses. The Dominion scouts freezing feels like convenient resolution rather than earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's shift from seeking movement/sparks to embracing stillness, with the emerald chip serving as catalyst. The accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns build toward the final reweighting. Cost is present but somewhat abstract—"tremor in her soul" and letting go of her previous method—though the closure lands with "newfound understanding."

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost remains abstract ("knowing she had finally found her source of contentment"). The mystical lake sequence breaks established realism without teaching this possibility early. Orientation is clear but the shift from grounded garden-tending to magical realm lacks proper setup.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing through the mirror shard metaphor ("in brokenness, there was beauty"), but the cost remains abstract and unembodied. The accumulative structure coheres around doubt/certainty themes, yet Mara's transformation happens entirely off-page through a letter we don't see. Orientation is clear but the closure lacks visible stakes or felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's revelation, moving from withholding to disclosure. The accumulative structure builds through ripples, memories, and dual stone throws. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than felt—we're told about "fear" and "chaos" but don't see concrete consequences of her revelation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing when Kael reframes the arrowhead as a compass to states of being rather than physical destinations, but this shift lacks visible cost on the page. The accumulative/textural lens holds through lyric descriptions building toward revelation, yet the closure reads as pure insight without dramatized price or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a basic quest structure with clear causality but lacks a decisive change with visible cost. The closing trap provides pressure, but Eli's success feels convenient—the harness he crafted for a technique he never mastered works perfectly under stress. The ending's conceptual repricing ("the keystone's power wasn't in its ability to accommodate impossibilities but in its reminder") deflates the established stakes without dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (discovering his purpose through the luminous vows) but lacks visible cost—Elias gains understanding without sacrificing anything concrete. The phrase "meteor hush" appears twice without clear meaning, creating orientation debt. Causality weakens when the hatch opens "with surprising ease" and the underwater library is inexplicably dry.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the story builds through symbolic accretion: coins, static bursts, distillation, prophecy. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira becomes "navigator" of the backwards prophecy, with felt cost in bearing "the fate of what remained of existence." The who/where/when anchors clearly by paragraph one.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara finds "purpose in the nameless fears" with visible transformation. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt, and the naming sequence feels procedural rather than pressured—the sea monsters manifest without resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the "dripping rates" pattern, but closure lacks decisive change or reconfiguration with cost. The waves returning feel unearned—magical thinking without established causality linking bell repair to cosmic restoration. No visible price is paid for this resolution; Eliard simply succeeds through persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias discovering photographs that build toward the exhibit's creation. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the town emotionally resurfaces through shared memory, with cost implied in years of collective amnesia. However, the discovery sequence lacks sufficient pressure or complication to fully earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with mystical discovery leading to internal transformation, but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara gains harmony without sacrificing anything concrete. The "transformation" is asserted ("she was no longer just an alchemist; she was a weaver of wonder") rather than demonstrated through a decisive change with legible price. The starling patterns guide her to the crystal, but this discovery requires no trade-off or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver genuine closure with visible cost. The "pattern finally revealed itself" moment is told rather than dramatized, and the resolution ("mission was complete") arrives without showing what was actually accomplished or what price was paid. The piece teaches no clear pattern early and the ending's "silent witness to the seeker's triumph" is assertion without earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the jar shattering and essence merging, providing visible transformation. However, the piece teaches its metaphysical rules late, and the "duel" with the brain lacks clear mechanical grounding—how exactly does a brain in a jar respond with movements? The accumulative texture builds adequately but the cost remains more declared than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the seed-to-key transformation serving as the central turn. However, the closure—discovering a chamber of mystery artifacts—lacks visible cost; Elias simply steps through a door without sacrifice or trade-off. The magical realism elements (glowing key, parting water) arrive without sufficient grounding in the story's established reality.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the return of laughter, with felt cost in Eli's exhaustion. However, the accumulative structure lacks sufficient density increase or pattern break to fully reweight the dominant stake - the transformation feels asserted rather than earned through textural accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves Earned Stasis closure—Elara refuses the pendant's offer, accepting continued exile to protect the library. The cost is legible ("the homesickness clawed at her, a constant ache"), and causality holds through a Situational lens as the keeper's revelation forces stance crystallization. However, the orientation arrives late (keeper's identity/purpose unclear until dialogue), and the dimensional travel backstory lacks concrete anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's purpose shifts from resurrection to transformation. The closure lands with visible cost (her years of failure become the foundation) and the sapling's emergence from the crozier fragments creates a clear before/after. The "penny drop" moment provides causal linkage though some transitions feel slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the city's rebirth and Elara's self-discovery, with visible cost in letting go of assumptions. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the piece builds through layered discoveries about the shard's nature, though the transformation from "abandoned" to "reborn" city feels somewhat abrupt without intermediate stakes or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves closure through Mara's successful merging of timelines at personal cost (Resonant Reconfiguration), with clear before/after states. However, the mechanics of time manipulation remain vague ("channeled her energy"), and the resolution feels somewhat convenient despite the personal sacrifice. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds but lacks the density shifts that would strengthen it.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's weaving patterns building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where she discovers connection's fragile texture. The closure lands with felt cost ("worth every risk"), though the shadow-man's late appearance and quick resolution weakens causality. Who/where/when anchors clearly by paragraph one.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's teaching method synthesis serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost remains abstract—"unity" and "understanding" without concrete loss or price. The orientation anchors (benthic city, post-alien contact) arrive clearly by ~120 words. The closure image of Elara feeling "strange resonance" while smiling at stars attempts Charged Poise but lacks the visible stakes or foreclosed path that would make the cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara accepting the photograph and its implied responsibility, with the cost being her ongoing commitment to finding more lost stories. The accumulative/textural lens holds as atmospheric details and whispers build toward the final image of the "reeling hush" as her companion. Minor deduction for the relatively abstract nature of the cost—while emotionally resonant, the specific price Elara pays remains somewhat conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear causal chain from entering facility to finding codex to phase transition revelation. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration) lands with Elena understanding the cables' true nature and accepting some things should remain invisible. Cost is visible in her confrontation with fear and acceptance of mystery. However, the phase transition mechanism feels under-explained, and Dr. Voss's appearance/message borders on convenient resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with data fragments coalescing into understanding, but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara gains wisdom without losing anything concrete. The death certificate error creates intrigue but never faces a dramatized test. The resolution that she's "a survivor of the system" arrives through assertion rather than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with Lira entering the tunnel, deciphering echoes, and shattering the diamond to save her language—a Decisive Change with visible cost (her drained strength, faded veins). However, the resolution feels mechanically convenient: she hears the pattern, sings, the diamond responds, and succeeds despite the curse, without meaningful complication or tactical adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with garden transformation and cryptid awakening, but closure lacks visible cost—Lena simply carries "frostbitten hope" without paying a price for her insight. The arrowhead's dimensional properties and the cryptid's message ("the lock is within you") remain abstract concepts that don't crystallize into concrete stakes. Orientation anchors adequately by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong causal chain from discovery to realization to action, with clear closure as the orchard defeats the statues. The cost (risk to Elara, destruction of the old order) is visible. However, the "resonantly soft melody that seemed to breathe life" and similar phrases feel overwritten, and the transition from realization to action happens too quickly without sufficient intermediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the storm's release creates temporary unity with visible cost (Elias's continued isolation, the temporary nature of peace). The causal chain from mail delivery to drone smuggling to border crossing holds well. The closure lands with "that was enough" showing both achievement and limitation, though the cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the carousel's restoration and the carpenter finding his voice, with cost implied through "years of shaping wood into dreams" and "memories that stole his voice." However, the accumulative lens wobbles with causal elements (finding fragment leads to oasis, then to singing), and the cost remains more told than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Elara discovers the story-place and accepts guardianship, with the scarf's transformation marking visible cost/change. The accumulative structure coheres through geometric patterns building to portal opening, though the return to normalcy slightly deflates the earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Elara simply paints, notices something magical, and smiles with newfound courage—but no path is foreclosed, no price is paid, and no options narrow. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but fails to achieve the required density increase or pattern break that would reweight stakes. The ending assertion that she found "courage to create it anew" arrives without dramatized causality.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (locksmith seeks vault → uses key and hair → releases idea) but the closure lacks visible cost—"Elara stood unchanged" explicitly denies transformation. The "everything felt different" assertion doesn't constitute a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration when no specific alteration is shown. The piece teaches no clear drive lens; it reads as straightforward causal but doesn't deepen sufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves Charged Poise at closure - Elara stands ready to recover her memories with the fairy ring glowing "as if in approval." However, the cost remains abstract ("decades later, the truth was within her grasp") without visible price paid. The accumulative structure coheres but the final crystallization lacks the undeniable pressure needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost. The ending declares transformation ("The shard-mirror no longer felt like a prison but a portal") without dramatizing the change through action. The annotation process completes, but no before/after is legible beyond assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the seed's transformation but lacks visible cost - Elara succeeds without sacrifice or foreclosed options. The accumulative texture builds but never crystallizes into a moment where something meaningful is lost or irrevocably changed. No genuine "before/after" legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through whispers building to "flood of whispers" at the climax. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara finds peace through honoring spirits' stories, with visible cost in her trembling hands and heavy heart. The orientation is clear (sanctuary, before dawn, mask restorer), and the accumulation of silence/whispers creates coherent pressure toward the ending realization.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.8)
    The discovery follows a linear treasure-hunt structure (notice discrepancy → dig → find chapel) without meaningful complication or cost. The closure lands as fulfilled expectation rather than transformation—Elara finds exactly what she expected. The "healing the divide" assertion lacks dramatized consequence or visible price paid for the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's final act of placing the globe down demonstrates learned release with visible cost (leaving behind the object she's been studying). The accumulative structure coheres well through the snow globe's evolving meaning from mystery to memento to practice object. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay regarding the underwater setting's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara releases the ghost and commits to finding others, with the cost being her solitary dedication to this work. However, the causal linkage between discovering the bolt plate's purpose and successfully using it feels convenient rather than earned through struggle, and the "between lightning and thunder" mechanic appears without prior setup or clear stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with each floor building toward the diary's decryption. The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing ("Joy is not the absence of anguish but the light that shines through it") but the cost remains abstract—we see tears but no concrete price for this wisdom. The floor-by-floor structure provides clear escalation though each discovery feels predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where Elara validates her theory, but the cost remains abstract—we see her return transformed but without visible price. The magical resolution (string replaced, gondola steady) undermines the established stakes of being stranded, breaking causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.2)
    The accumulative structure builds through discovery stages (tree, book safe, decoding, creation) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where infinite sky becomes contained in finite pages. The closure lands with the building's collapse providing temporal pressure, though the cost remains more conceptual than felt. Causality holds but the transformation from searching for "something she couldn't yet name" to completing the cosmic puzzle lacks intermediate stakes that would deepen the achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkages: deciphering leads to glow, glow reveals beam, beam exposes hidden chamber, chamber contains map. Closure lands as a Decisive Change when Elara discovers the stranded luminance and Thorne's map, transforming her from isolated apprentice to heir of his quest. The cost—months of solitary work and Thorne's absence—is present but lacks visceral weight in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through prophecy fragments leading to the hall of mirrors discovery. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara gains the gears and understanding of interconnectedness, with the "harmony she had always been searching for" marking a before/after shift. The cost is somewhat abstract but present in the vortex of memories showing what she's sacrificed. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands with the nebula's return and Elara's fade-out, achieving basic Decisive Change with visible transformation. However, the causal chain feels predetermined—discovery of message leads directly to restoration without meaningful complication. Cost remains abstract (Elara's fade feels ceremonial rather than sacrificial).

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the puppet's mending and Elara's renewed purpose, showing visible cost through her blood and exhaustion. The accumulative lens holds consistently through nested patterns and symbolic layering. However, the actual mechanics of the "nested patterns" remain vague, and the mending happens too quickly without sufficient build-up to feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Decisive Change from cursed stasis to weakening curse through Elara's discovery and use of the nut-key, with visible cost in risk taken. Causal lens holds: nut discovery → impression pattern → map creation → traveler rescue → curse weakening. The bud emerging provides on-page closure with earned hope. Orientation anchors solidly by paragraph two, though the blueprint concept could integrate more tightly with the map revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elena's insight about separation/reconnection serving as a Conceptual Repricing. The closure lands with emotional cost ("loosened grief" transforming to guide rather than weight), though the transformation feels slightly unearned given the limited on-page struggle. Orientation is clear by ~100 words with who/where/when established.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver meaningful closure with cost. Elara retrieves the vial and fills blank pages with words, but this resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through pressure. The transformation of the library from fragmented to integrated happens through magical convenience without visible sacrifice or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands with Elara subsuming the remorse and the pavilion melting, achieving resonant reconfiguration with visible cost ("tears welled," "her own sorrow"). The accumulative lens holds through memory-tasting sequences. However, the cost feels somewhat abstract - we see tears but not what specific dream or memory Elara sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara experiences no loss, sacrifice, or price for her success. The transformation from fragmented community to unified chorus happens through convenient magic realism (clock responds to song) rather than earned causality. The "tears streamed down Elara's face" attempts to signal emotion but doesn't constitute cost when everything succeeds perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing through the mirror's transformation from reflection to portal, but cost remains abstract ("no matter the cost"). The accumulative structure coheres around memory-as-artifact, yet the actual modification process and its risks stay vague. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkage (doodle leads to grotto, gravity inversion enables access, alignment unlocks seed). Closure lands as a Decisive Change with felt cost ("responsibility, a promise to protect"). Orientation is anchored early. The cost could be more visceral at the moment of taking the seed rather than summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the sculpture's completion, but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara succeeds without sacrifice or meaningful trade-off. The transformation from silence to music happens too smoothly; "Her work was done, but the melody would linger" asserts rather than demonstrates consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where Alara reframes her exile as opportunity rather than punishment, with the toppled king symbolizing transformation. The accumulative/textural lens holds as chess movements and magnetic pulses build toward revelation. Cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt, and the nexus's magical intervention weakens protagonist agency at the crucial turn.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the diary opening, but closure lacks visible cost—Elara gains understanding without sacrificing anything concrete. The "who/where/when" anchors clearly by ~120 words, and the single-scene structure holds, but the change from locked to unlocked diary doesn't create a true before/after with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the corpse flower as focal point building toward wisdom revelation. However, the closure—Elara's sudden understanding of interconnectedness—lacks visible cost beyond tears. The "journey it had prompted within her" is told rather than shown through concrete choices, and no path is genuinely foreclosed with dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong causal chain from arrow discovery through grove restoration, with clear orientation anchored early. The closure (Elara becoming protector) lands on-page but lacks visible cost - she gains purpose without sacrifice. The "generations to come" ending feels declarative rather than dramatically earned through prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage as Elara pieces together the crash, but closure lacks visible cost on the page—her mission continues unchanged. The revelation about the flight engineer's attempted landing provides knowledge change but no decisive alteration to Elara's options or stance. The "silence of the town" remains abstract rather than a concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with sensory layering building toward the materialization of the sculpted hush. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elara succeeds without sacrifice, and the "unfettered hope" feels declared rather than earned through dramatized struggle. The orientation is clear but the stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkage (failure with crystal orb → seeking flute → playing it despite fear), but the closure lacks visible on-page cost—Elara simply arrives in a new realm "ready to face whatever came next." The transportation to another world qualifies as a Decisive Change, but without dramatized price or trade-off, the closure feels incomplete.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative structure builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias transforms from mask-wearing to integrated understanding, with visible cost in his physical struggle. However, the resolution's abstract language ("threads in a larger tapestry") dilutes the concrete cost. The orientation anchors (Elias, workshop, dawn hours) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story achieves a Decisive Change when Elara discovers she's not "just the courier" but chosen by the relic itself, with clear cost in leaving her known world behind ("the fade now called to her"). The causal chain from courier→vibration→revelation→transformation holds, though the scholar's immediate knowledge strains credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's theoretical pursuit transforms into understanding the human cost embedded in objects. The accumulative structure builds through sensory layers to this realization, with visible emotional cost ("her hands trembled"). The orientation is clear by ~100 words and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with mystical imagery building toward transformation, but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara steps onto the bridge feeling "hope" without dramatized sacrifice beyond leaving home. The puzzle-as-map discovery provides a turn, but the final "becoming the message" remains conceptually vague without clear before/after stakes. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows what Elara loses or trades in her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore linkage from stranger's arrival through mine descent to planet healing. The "awakening" cost remains conceptually vague—we see Eli changed but the precise nature and price of this transformation lacks concrete dramatization, weakening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts a Decisive Change (Elara becoming guardian) but the cost remains abstract - "weight of responsibility" without concrete sacrifice or foreclosed options. The parallel universe mechanics arrive late without sufficient setup, and the truth she seeks (her role as guardian) feels arbitrary rather than causally earned from childhood haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's transformation from passive keeper to active guardian, with visible cost in accepting unknown responsibility. However, the causal mechanics (stone code suddenly opening wall compartment) strain credibility, and the shift from textural to puzzle-solving mode creates lens ambiguity that weakens structural coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure - the Herald accepts their role as bridge between worlds. Cost is implied through "work was far from over" but lacks visceral weight. The lighthouse beam's independence creates a meaningful turn, but the resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Kael's gift drawing him to the widow's story, culminating in shared understanding. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as both characters reach new awareness about carrying stories. However, cost remains conceptual rather than visceral—we see emotional exchange but no concrete price paid or path foreclosed, weakening the before/after legibility required for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation through dream fragments building toward the sextant's healing as a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands with the "resilience of the human spirit" realization, though the conceptual cost remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands with clear cost—darkness transformed to dawn, isolation to unity—through the accumulated song fragments. The accumulative structure coheres well with each discovered thread building toward the final transformation, though the mirror world mechanics could be cleaner.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's decision to "hide no more" and carry forward the conclave's legacy, but the cost remains abstract—"enlarged tranquility" and internal resolution lack visible price. The accumulative structure builds adequately through discovery beats, yet the closure's transformation feels unearned without concrete stakes or sacrifice demonstrated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through discovered plaque and pattern of renewal. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elara accepts the ongoing, fragile nature of her work with visible cost: "her work was far from over." The who/where/when anchors clearly by ~60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara transforms from passive preserver to active connector, with visible cost in her shifted role and the weight of carrying forward the vows. The slide's transformation provides clear causality, and the Drive Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently. Orientation anchors effectively (frozen library, Elara's role established immediately). Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient timing of the slide's message being "meant for her" without earned build-up.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (theft → investigation → confrontation) with Lila as active agent. Closure lands as Earned Stasis - she maintains the "truce of hush" through words rather than violence. However, the cost remains conceptual ("trust, once broken, could never be fully repaired") without visible price on the page, and the fortune-teller beat creates false momentum without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves Charged Poise closure with Elara stepping forward toward the forest election, options crystallized but cost not yet paid. Causal linkage from ring sensation to shadow figure to acceptance works, though the middle section relies heavily on exposition rather than dramatized discovery. The "who/where/when" anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through cave/crystal imagery, artistic metaphors, and the lock symbol, culminating in Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara paints herself rather than others. Cost is visible (years of silence, creative suppression) but the forgotten painting discovery feels convenient rather than earned. The "after the last echo" refrain effectively bookends the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain holds: discovery → investigation → revelation → action → change. However, the water trickling at the chamber feels unearned by the mechanics shown. The closure lands (Elara choosing truth despite cost) but the immediate physical consequence (water appearing) lacks sufficient setup. Orientation is clear by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a true closure with visible cost—Elara simply completes her work and walks away unchanged. The "symphony of truth" moment creates atmosphere but no decisive change or reconfiguration occurs. The piece reads as a static vignette where nothing is at stake or foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's acceptance of her changed state, but the cost (distant memories) lacks concrete dramatization. The causal chain from magnetic shift to opening the box feels asserted rather than earned through pressure. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages (locket discovery → mailbox observation → Mrs. Ellis revelation → key discovery → letter reading). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where Clara discovers purpose through listening, though the cost remains abstract rather than visceral. The orientation anchors (courtyard, dawn, Clara as curator) establish cleanly within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the dance unlocking passages as its decisive change. While this moment lands on-page with transformation (laboratory awakening), the cost remains abstract—"quiet, unwavering determination" and "calm defiance" don't show what Elara sacrifices or risks. The orientation anchors clearly (sunken laboratory, Elara seeking codes), but closure lacks the visible price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story reaches for Conceptual Repricing (memories aren't lost but misplaced) but this arrives through abstract revelation rather than dramatized discovery with cost. The mystical journey into "a space where memories floated" lacks concrete causality—we never see how coffee patterns or wildflowers mechanically enable this transition, making the closure feel asserted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a true closure with visible cost—Elara simply succeeds at "smoothing the hush" without meaningful sacrifice or transformation. The prophecy threat remains abstract ("chaos," "tranquil blaze") never manifesting as concrete stakes. While she seals the prophecy, no before/after change is legible beyond task completion, and the "fragile balance" ending deflates rather than crystallizes tension.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Clara knocks on her neighbor's door, transforming isolation into connection with the pouch of sugar as catalyst. The accumulative lens holds as metaphorical teachings about "languages" build toward this concrete action. However, the cost remains more implied than visceral - we see the action but not its emotional price beyond the earlier "twinge of shame."

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Elara's transformation from skeptic to believer, isolation to independence, carrying the garden's memories forward. The cost is present—she becomes the archive's keeper—but remains more conceptual than visceral. The accumulative lens holds, though the middle section's vision sequence strains coherence without clear pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where erasure becomes liberation, with felt emotional cost legible in "a weight lift from her chest, a chain breaking." The accumulative lens holds as symbolic actions build toward transformation, though the final paragraph's explicit thematic statements ("had found a way to forgive the unfinished") slightly diminish the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing through Elara's understanding of echoes, but the cost remains abstract—"quiet resolve" replacing "melancholy" lacks concrete stakes. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward revelation, yet the closure feels unearned because no path is foreclosed with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the globe clears to reveal the untouched village, reweighting the family's story from loss to preservation. The accumulative structure through dream fragments coheres well, building toward Elara's promise to "keep their story alive." However, the cost remains primarily conceptual—while the family's tragedy is clear, Elara pays no visible price for her connection, limiting the closure's full impact.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered imagery (fireflies, moon paths, whisk), but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost—Elara simply "felt a sense of peace" without earning it through dramatized change or renunciation. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear early. No causal linkage drives the ending; her realization about "hidden patterns...within herself" emerges as unearned epiphany rather than through accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves closure through Elara's decisive action to reinforce the seal, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where the orchard's survival comes at the cost of constant vigilance and the return of dust storms. The causal chain from investigation to discovery to containment holds, though the sudden appearance of the shadow-mass entity feels slightly underestablished given its centrality to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story reaches a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elias becomes prophet/bridge) but the cost remains abstract—"weight of his journey" without specific losses shown. The accumulative lens holds but relies on vague intensifiers ("visions grew more vivid") rather than concrete deepening. The portico's activation lacks causal mechanics—we don't see HOW Elias "activated" it or what specific choice he made.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the music box plays autonomously and Elias discovers his purpose, with visible cost in the shattered jar. The accumulative structure coheres well through sound-layering toward this crystallization. Minor deduction for slightly soft causality around why the box suddenly plays on its own after initial resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.2)
    Closure occurs (Elara defeats the figure and remains guardian) but the cost is abstract - "the battle wasn't over" tells rather than shows consequence. The causal chain breaks when Elara suddenly "realized the truth" about the figure's deception without earned discovery. The orientation is clear but the resolution relies on convenient revelation rather than dramatized causality.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's transformation and the spreading "patient revolution," with visible cost in her deliberate renunciation of urgency. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as moon observations and viaduct encounters build toward change, though the transformation mechanism ("understanding" atop the viaduct) lacks concrete dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves closure through Elara's decisive break from her mentor (DC) with visible cost—she must confront corruption that implicates her own training. The causal chain from investigation to journal discovery to photographic proof holds adequately. However, the revelation feels rushed in the final third, and the cost of breaking free isn't fully dramatized beyond metaphorical language about being "a force."

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the clockwork heart as metaphor accumulating meaning through repair parallels. However, closure lacks decisive on-page cost—Elias leaves "ready to face" the storm but we don't see him pay any price or make a consequential choice. The resonant reconfiguration exists conceptually but needs visible stakes at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Lira's tinkering building toward the bell's manifestation, which qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The world's response (wolf howl, avalanche, wave) suggests cost through awakening, but this remains largely atmospheric rather than showing concrete consequence for Lira. The closure lands but the "before/after" change lacks specificity—what has Lira gained or lost beyond satisfaction?

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages (patch leads to numbers, numbers lead to coordinates, coordinates reveal truth), but closure lacks visible cost—Elara steps out "ready to face whatever came next" without any on-page consequence or price. The investigation progresses logically but the ending offers only declared intention rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the crystal ball's reconstitution and the lighthouse beacon's activation, with visible cost in Elara's merging with the anomaly's courage. The accumulative/textural lens holds as mirror glimpses build toward the final synthesis. However, the mechanics of fragment gathering feel convenient—hidden pieces rising "from their corners" by "unseen force" undermines earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara arriving at the marina, engaging with survivors, and reaching a Resonant Reconfiguration about accepting endings. The closure lands with her realization that "the sound of approaching endings...was a reminder to live," though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral. Orientation is clear early (marina, Elara, dawn), and the pattern of accumulating survivor stories builds toward the northern lights moment, but the transformation lacks sufficient on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara reframes her understanding of connection, but the cost remains primarily conceptual—we see her new stance but not what she sacrifices to reach it. The accumulative structure works through layered reflection on the vineyard/relationship parallel, though the transformation happens entirely in thought without external test.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's completed consecration and the prophet's acknowledgment, with visible cost in the "imprints in the sand that the wind would soon erase." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established early and the accumulative lens holds. However, the closure's emotional cost feels more declared than dramatized - we're told about fulfillment rather than shown its price through specific sensory detail or embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. Elara arranges photographs and leaves with "quiet hope," but no path is foreclosed, no choice crystallizes under pressure. The orientation is clear but the accumulative texture doesn't achieve the required resonant reconfiguration or conceptual repricing with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias gradually decoding the crystal's patterns until the final revelation. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—he discovers the pattern but at the cost of the crystal's energy being spent. The cost is stated ("filled him with both triumph and sorrow") but lacks visceral dramatization; we're told about the bittersweet victory rather than feeling it through specific sensory details or embodied reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias hearing the sought sound and releasing the chalk, with cost visible in "years he'd spent chasing echoes instead of living." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through sculpture encounters toward the final crystallization, though the middle section could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara transforms from trying to stop time to expanding it, but the cost remains abstract—we see fulfillment but not what was sacrificed. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through the clock hand's acceleration, the leaf metaphor, and the final harmony, though the closure lacks the visible price that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure lands with mother-daughter reconciliation and visible emotional cost ("years apart," "red from crying"). However, the transformation feels somewhat predetermined—Mrs. Bennett's whisper of "Claire" leads too directly to resolution without meaningful complication. The accumulative texture builds adequately but lacks a decisive reweighting that would elevate the ending beyond expected satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages (research leads to workshop, runes enable key activation), but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara achieves her goal without meaningful sacrifice or trade-off. The mystery resolution feels mechanical rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkages (tooth leads to maze, maze to garden, offering to transformation). The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (surrendering her "certainty" stone), though the transformation feels slightly unearned given the brief encounter with the fountain woman.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Lira prepares to share her light. However, the closure lacks visible cost—she simply walks to the village with newfound peace. The transformation from isolation to sharing needs dramatized friction or sacrifice to earn its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as moss patterns, icicle traces, and amber light build toward a resonant reconfiguration where "vulnerability, when protected, could bloom." Cost appears in Elara's exposed confession and careful trust, though the shift from "refuge" to "beginning" needs stronger causal grounding beyond shared notebooks.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara places her fragment among others and begins writing, with visible cost in carrying others' stories "into the future." The accumulative structure coheres as whispers become "a single, resounding voice," though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually stated.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with golden light and song fragments building toward restoration. The closure shows Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara gains the orbs/stories, but the cost remains abstract—"work far from over" doesn't demonstrate visible price for what she's gained.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost—Elara simply completes her task and leaves satisfied. The "glowing illustration plate" represents completion but no path is foreclosed, no price paid, no options reweighted. The piece reads as a successful procedure without the required before/after transformation or meaningful tightening that would constitute proper closure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure lacks visible cost - Elias simply succeeds at fixing the timer and harvesting echoes without sacrifice or trade-off. The accumulative lens holds but the ending provides completion without the required reconfiguration or price that would make a before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara pivots from collecting others' burdens to weaving "a fractal map of her own soul." The cost is conceptually present—she must confront her calcified layers—but lacks visceral dramatization. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the figure's arrival feels slightly convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural structure coheres well, building through the carving process toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara achieves "rust-hued peace." The closure lands with felt cost—accepting impermanence while creating something lasting. The piece teaches its metaphorical pattern early and pays it off, though the reflection on Marius's philosophy could be more tightly integrated with present action.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara reframes her ghost from enemy to guide, with emotional cost visible in her years of regret. However, the transformation feels slightly rushed - the voice in the wheel provides too convenient a revelation. The accumulative structure coheres but the final insight needed more grounding in prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as Eli's explorations build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the terminal transforms from "desolation to something resembling vitality." The closure lands with conceptual cost - the terminal "would never see passengers again" - creating a bittersweet achievement. The sextant piece effectively guides the accumulation pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the whispers building to "bear" as catalyst, leading to Elara completing her father's clock as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure reweights her relationship to the sanctuary through concrete action with emotional cost visible in "hours passed." Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract cost—while the emotional journey is clear, the specific price of accepting her confined life could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with adequate setup, but closure lacks visible cost - Elara gains truth without losing anything concrete. The journal discovery and sundial activation constitute a revelation but not a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. "She had salvaged a truth that would change everything" declares impact without showing the price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.2)
    The accumulative structure builds atmosphere effectively, but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara simply succeeds at decoding without sacrifice or foreclosed options. The revelation that the rope is "a map, a guide to something greater" remains vague, and "her work complete" suggests resolution without demonstrable change or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the traveler receives the second thread, reweighting her role from observer to participant in the "tapestry." The accumulative lens holds as the thread metaphor deepens throughout. Slight deduction for the abstract "geography of healing" concept that doesn't fully crystallize into concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where Kael realizes "beauty could not be forced, only nurtured," but the cost remains largely abstract. The causal chain from discovery to assembly to vision works, yet the "flawed genesis" revelation that it was "a choice to prioritize progress over preservation" arrives as exposition rather than dramatized discovery. The ending stance of "possibility" lacks visible sacrifice or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's shift from seeking atonement to accepting transformation's possibility, with the grafting act serving as the decisive moment. However, the cost remains largely conceptual—while we understand she risks failure and continued rejection, the immediate stakes of this specific attempt lack concrete consequence that would elevate the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkages: box arrives → breadcrumbs appear → each clue leads deeper → final piece triggers transformation. The Decisive Change closure lands with visible cost as Elara's action resurrects the city's fountains and releases trapped memories. Minor deduction for slightly mechanical quest structure and the convenience of the mirror showing exactly what's needed at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts Accumulative/Textural mode but lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Elara achieves her goal of sharing light without fire, but the transformation happens through vague "connection forming" and "bridge between physical and ethereal" without concrete mechanism. The closure paragraph declares success ("she had found her way") but the actual moment of change—when/how the gear becomes part of her—remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Conceptual Repricing closure lands cleanly—grief transforms from static shape to migration, with the ribbon pattern etched into marble as concrete manifestation. The accumulative structure coheres through butterfly/ribbon/migration imagery building toward this realization, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias becomes "the pendulum bob himself," but the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral. The accumulative structure coheres around the clock/balance metaphor, though the middle section's summarized interactions ("A fisherman...found solace") deflate pressure rather than building it.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the tapestry's emotional map connecting to cemetery lives, but the cost remains abstract ("a connection to the past that would forever shape his intentions"). The accumulative lens holds but the closure lacks visible price - Elias gains insight without losing anything concrete. Orientation is clear by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing through the metaphor of writing creating reality, but the transformation occurs through magical thinking rather than earned causality. The cost remains abstract ("the weight of the scroll") without visible sacrifice or foreclosed options that would make the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the radio's intensifying glow and the emergence of the pirate broadcast. Closure achieves Charged Poise as Clara stands with "quiet determination," having received the fragment that will guide her work—though the cost (abandoning her copying work) could be more explicit. Who/where/when anchors clearly by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's completed ritual, with the ash-scattering crystallizing grief into acceptance. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through layered imagery (mask, chair, ash). Cost is visible in "the weight of her task pressed heavily" and the final acknowledgment of universal impermanence, though the emotional price could be more viscerally felt rather than philosophically stated.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage (Kael clings to past → Lira challenges → collapse forces choice), but the closure lacks decisive change or visible cost. The ending's "perhaps there was room for both" reads as unearned reconciliation without demonstrating what Kael sacrifices or how his stance actually shifts. The collapse news arrives conveniently to force movement rather than emerging from character choices.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through repeated choir sessions, but closure lacks visible cost—applause arrives without showing what was sacrificed or transformed. The shift from "mausoleum of silence" to "living cathedral" reads as assertion rather than earned change. Orientation is clear but the stakes remain abstract ("unlearning hatred") without concrete dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with the transformed greenhouse and shared fruit promising gradual change. The accumulative lens holds through symbolic layering (rust/renewal, pruning/growth), though the celestial alignment's convenient timing and the seed's magical properties strain causality without sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves a Decisive Change when Elara discovers the truth about the drone sacrifice, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The causal chain (find box → read riddle → find key → discover truth → reveal truth) progresses logically but mechanically, lacking the visible price or foreclosed path that would make the closure resonate. The orientation is clear but the stakes feel abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost—Elias simply walks away "ready to hear" stories without any foreclosed path or price paid. The orientation anchors (who, where, when) are established early, but the piece never escalates beyond philosophical musing about displaced objects. The "shard of hush" enabling understanding represents potential change but manifests only as abstract readiness rather than an on-page transformation with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Liora's shift from passive observer to active guardian, with clear causal linkage between warning and outcome. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The accumulative lens holds but the stakes feel distant through summary ("Weeks later") rather than immediate dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara accepts impermanence over perfection, with cost visible in letting the chipped die fall. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by ~100 words, and the accumulative lens holds through mathematical imagery and philosophical layering, though the final paragraph's explicit thematic statements ("progress was not about perfection but about embracing the impermanence") weaken the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through sensory details and the painting's evolution, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara finds purpose. The closure lands with felt cost ("the kind that comes from knowing you've found your purpose") and the transformation from personal to communal art is legible. However, the mystical elements (greenhouse shifting, moon brightening) introduce slight causal wobbles that don't fully integrate with the textural approach.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the community gathering revives the bread tradition, but causality feels mechanical—the lens chimes approval, people gather, traditions spread "like wildfire." The cost remains abstract ("weight of her mission") rather than a concrete price paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Decisive Change when Elias activates the hunger stone and transforms the lighthouse, with clear causal linkage throughout. However, the cost remains abstract ("at what cost?" "consequences were impossible to predict") rather than concrete. The orientation is clear and the causal chain holds, but the ending needs more tangible price to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Clara understands fear's weakness ("the need to be acknowledged"), with cost visible in the shattering mirrors and dissipating funhouse. However, the accumulation toward this insight relies heavily on abstract pronouncements ("Fear is a paradox") rather than dramatized discovery. The orientation anchors (abandoned carnival, post-resuscitation Clara) land clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure presents a Resonant Reconfiguration through the music harmonizing chaos, but the cost remains abstract - "restlessness was gone" without showing what was sacrificed or foreclosed. The accumulative lens holds but the transformation from discord to harmony lacks concrete stakes or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.1)
    Strong causal chain from whistle to crack to discovery, with clear because/therefore linkages throughout. The closure (Charged Poise - Elara poised for the next journey with new purpose) lands with felt cost - the weight of Valtara's survival on her shoulders. Deduction for the somewhat convenient revelation mechanism and the watchers' passive role that borders on deus ex machina. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with symbolic density (rose petals, illuminated letter, mirror) building toward Elara's discovery and recontextualization of noble lies. Closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing where finding the archive shifts her understanding from pure opposition to contextual acceptance of historical deception. However, the cost remains primarily intellectual rather than felt—she gains "peace" without visible sacrifice or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias transforms from surveyor to "keeper of what had been lost," with the lagoon's whispered gratitude and calmer waters marking visible change. The accumulative structure builds through discovery (journal), action (repairs), and revelation (mosaic) toward this earned stasis. Cost is present in his raw hands and the weight of carrying others' dreams, though the emotional price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure lands as a Decisive Change when Elara discovers the untainted record, but cost remains conceptual rather than felt—she gains knowledge without visible sacrifice. The causal chain from stamp to map to mechanism works logically but the transformation lacks immediate stakes that would elevate the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration: Kael shifts from trying to craft away grief to honoring it through his work, with visible cost in the unfolding crane scene. The basilica revelation about his shadow-as-shield reweights earlier material effectively. Slight opacity in the "descending while ascending" paradox and its narrative function prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Zara's gradual awakening through crystal study, but the closure lacks visible cost—her transformation is declared ("she was no longer just a survivor—she was a seeker") without showing what she sacrifices or risks. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established adequately by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows mechanical fetch-quest causality without meaningful cost at closure. While Kael assembles the three pieces and activates the device, the ending's "frequency of belonging" and self-discovery remain abstract assertions. The phrase "his journey was far from over" explicitly avoids closure rather than landing a decisive change with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of fractured tiles reflecting Elias's fractured soul, with visible cost in his "trembling legs" and carried truth. However, the revelation about the client's father feels inserted rather than organically discovered, and the accumulative pattern could tighten more decisively toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece reaches Earned Stasis as Kael agrees to "begin anew" while withholding full forgiveness, creating a crystallized moment of provisional agreement with visible diplomatic cost. However, the accumulative lens lacks density increase—the negotiation proceeds through linear dialogue without pattern breaks or cadence shifts that would reweight the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's shift from compass to utility poles as navigation metaphor, but the cost remains abstract ("backlash of regrets") rather than concrete. The final paragraph's explicit moralizing ("acknowledged the past while embracing the future") undermines the closure's subtlety, stating what should be felt.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the lake's imagery building toward Elias's realization, but the closure lacks visible cost—he simply gains insight without sacrificing anything concrete. The baseball's loss in the water suggests price but doesn't alter his capabilities or options. The final "jaded wonder" and new perspective arrive without earned transformation through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's realization that "the bond she sought was not with another but with herself," with visible transformation in her glowing hands and renewed purpose. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details (spices, moonlight, fortune cookie) build toward this reconfiguration. However, the cost remains somewhat abstract—"the weight of her past lift[ing]" doesn't show what specific path or option she's foreclosing, weakening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a valid Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the cracked saucer transforms from wound to reminder, and Elara commits to presence over duty. The cost is visible in her shed cloak and tears, though the magical vision sequence risks convenient resolution. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the dimension opening and Elara's transformation, but cost remains abstract ("weight of forgotten pain"). The accumulative structure builds adequately through stitching imagery, yet the closure lacks a specific, felt price for Elara's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara releases the lightning bugs, merging their light with the stars—a decisive act that reweights her entire journey. The accumulative lens holds as details build toward this crystallized moment. However, the whispering hush's transformation into explicit words weakens the subtlety, and the cost, while present in her destitute state and annual pilgrimage, could be more viscerally felt at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.8)
    The closure (activating the cradle as a "wake-up call") lands on page but lacks visible cost - Elara slips away unscathed and the revolution begins without clear sacrifice. The causal chain holds but the transformation from blackout to awakening feels mechanically convenient rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through rock placement culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kael grasps the universal patterns.

However, the orientation is slightly delayed (who/where clarified by ~150 words), and the philosophical resolution feels somewhat predetermined rather than genuinely discovered through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the library's transformation, but cost remains abstract ("whispered its own story"). The accumulative progression from decay to rebuilding tracks, yet the final image lacks a concrete price—we see the result but not what was sacrificed to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara moving from stasis at the piano through film-world exploration to acceptance, achieving Resonant Reconfiguration when she plays "a new song altogether." The closure lands with emotional cost visible in the shift from playing "for herself" to playing with "newfound purpose." However, the film reel mechanics remain vague (how does stepping into it work?), and the hidden sections promised strategic revelation but deliver only personal memories without clear transformation logic.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows a clear causal quest structure with adequate closure—Elara plants the seed and saves collective memory. However, the cost remains abstract ("burden of light and darkness") without concrete sacrifice or trade-off. The creature's test resolves too easily through philosophical statement rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias releases regret by reading then dissolving the letters, understanding forgiveness as "letting go." The pattern of discovery (compass→lace→letters) builds coherently toward this realization with felt emotional cost. Deduction for abstract conceptualization ("the hue of letting go") that somewhat dulls the visceral impact of the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Inferred causal drive lens holds firmly. Closure is a decisive change (activation of the cradle) with a clear, felt cost—the end of the old order and Thorne's silent complicity. The linkage from blackout to investigation to confrontation is tight and logical. The final image of the "winking hush" successfully reconfigures the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a powerful Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost: the world feels different, "as though friction itself had disappeared." The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly, with pattern density increasing through the rock sequence and eel dance to a decisive cadence shift. The final image of the new pattern provides a resonant, open-ended charge.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    An Accumulative/Textural lens is dominant, with pressure building through pattern and cadence toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The final image of writing with "storm-kissed wonder" reconfigures Elara's stance with undeniable cost—the burden of the past transformed into a guide. Orientation is immediate and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds strongly. Closure is a resonant Conceptual Repricing, landing with clear cost in the final realization that "Questions were not paths to answers; they were the answers themselves." The pattern of accumulating images (sundial, needle card, brook) coheres into a decisive reweighting of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    An accumulative/textural lens fits best, with pressure building through density of imagery and thematic resonance. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the library is reconfigured into a beacon; the cost is legible in the final image of its glowing, less-worn walls. The structure coheres, with a clean, purposeful transition into the final, charged moment.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost—the clock ticks, compasses still, and she plays a "new song." The accumulative/textural lens holds, building through sensory and emotional density to a cadence shift that reweights her stance toward fate.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds strongly. Closure is a decisive change (planting the seed) with a visible cost (the impending monsoon). The linkage from dream to quest to confrontation is tight. The only minor slip is the creature's test, which is resolved a bit quickly, but the cost of the monsoon threat charges the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure builds through sensory and emotional density, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elias releases his regret. The closure lands on the page with clear, felt cost ("his heart lighter"). Orientation is immediate, and the drive lens holds consistently, with the lace pattern and compass guiding the accumulation of meaning toward the final, decisive release.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: iterative dust patterns deepen from observation to interaction to manifestation. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the causal drift is purposeful rather than plotted. Closure lands on the page with the butterfly’s appearance, a resonant reconfiguration that reweights prior material. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional, not materially priced, keeping it just shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal throughline is clean: ledger strip → frost mapping → caches → grotto → revelation → renewed plan. Orientation is solid early, and the closure lands as a Charged Poise with new knowledge and intent. The investigative steps feel a touch convenient (the frost mirroring the ledger), and on‑page cost is muted. Still, the structure tightens effectively toward the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds pattern density from solitude to joint discovery to a reweighted final image. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: silence reframed as language, with the tuning fork reprise as the on‑page turn. Orientation is clean and the one tightening beat (Kael’s pattern → all‑night work → dawn strike) coheres. Cost is felt but mostly implied as identity reconfiguration rather than a concrete forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/why), and the causal chain—package → lens/history → fragment hunt → reassembly → signal—reads clean. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the city’s voice is finally heard and Elias’s role reframes from burial to bearing witness. However, middle beats compress the search into summary, dulling pressure and cost. The end image is clear and on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: night runs → accidental exposure → rumor momentum → public declaration → communal buy-in, with the sacrificed anonymity as cost at closure. Orientation is early and strong; the bell is set up and paid off. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration (community identity shifts; Mara’s role shifts) with a legible price. The escalation is gentle but coherent under a Hybrid lens skewing accumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: breath → spark → compartment → pendant → alcove → emplacement → release. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the closure lands on‑page with a resonant reconfiguration (grief/love reweighted). The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional and could be sharper, but the before/after is legible. No causality breaks or unkept set‑ups undercut the cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: atmosphere thickens → discovery → pedestal choice → vortex → aftermath. Closure lands on‑page with a Decisive Change and a conceptual repricing (memories restored; fragment lost). Causality is clean though friction is minimal and coincidence (maze revealing the pedestal) does some heavy lifting. Cost is legible but light.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal. The throughline (decode arrow via piano → locate hatch → descend → grab seeds → escape as wall collapses) is clear and motivated, with enemies’ approach tightening the sequence. Closure lands: the liberator exits with seeds as the wall falls, a decisive change with implied cost. Costs are present but modest; nothing crucial is lost, though the time‑lock and chains shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: detail density builds to the forge activation and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early (who, where, what she wants), and the sequence from collecting absence to imprint forms a coherent tightening. Closure lands on the page with cost (the ache, trembling, reweighted meaning). No errant rule changes or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is crisp: who/where/when are established early, and the causal spine (goal → trap → reinterpretation → reveal → transfer) holds. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: Lira accepts charge of the jar with a reframed identity. Cost is more conceptual than felt, with minimal resistance or consequence on the page. The single scene is cohesive with one clean tightening at the flower‑code turn.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece follows an accumulative/textural drive, building patterned motifs (ice, glass, bookmark) to a Charged Poise/RR closure. Orientation is firm early; the final act (placing the heirloom into a sphere and leaving) delivers an on‑page before/after. The cost is legible conceptually (relinquishing control, reassigning the bookmark’s function) even if external stakes remain quiet. A slightly stronger mid‑scene constraint or complication would lift causality pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain is clean: notes → pattern → key → door → mirrors → unified shell → stance crystallization. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration with a decisive act (joining halves) and a conceptual repricing of identity. Cost registers mostly as internal (shattering prior self‑image); an external price or pressure would deepen it. Orientation and scene continuity are strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Anchors are established early (oracle, fort, storm, booklet), and the accumulative/textural drive is taught and held. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the last star vanishes, the map “taking shape,” and the oracle commits to ongoing work. The cost is conceptual and quiet rather than dramatized, but legible. Structure is coherent with one scene and a tightening clock (“when only one star remained”).

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-scene accumulative structure coheres: the discovery of the violin leads to music, iterative visions, and a realized reweighting at closure. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing—the origin of thought reframed as “the vast, interconnected web of existence”—with light but present cost (identity shed, time/experience amortized). Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and the pattern of escalation is taught and kept. The cost is more implied than dramatized, which trims peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, details build toward a clean on‑page reconfiguration when she slides the lens and doodles to Kian and he responds. The cost—risking candor after a rift—is legible, and the before/after shift is clear. Orientation is solid, single scene holds, and the closure feels earned without clunky mechanics. The arc is modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the ritual accrues meaning and culminates in a charged final placement and realization. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis—he renounces proving himself to the garden with a felt cost (accepting age/limits). Orientation is clean and scope fits one continuous window with a time-lapse feel. The cost is subtle but present on the page in the “blooming withering” cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    Causal lens holds: calibrate → pull → overload → manual struggle → precise correction → stabilization, with a clean before/after. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: proof achieved at real risk, followed by a tempered stance. The cost remains mostly near‑miss rather than lasting consequence, limiting impact. Orientation is crisp from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene, single-POV structure is clean, with clear orientation and a held accumulative/textural drive. Pressure coheres as density: sighting the ghost, humming the melody, and the environment’s response culminate in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page—ghost’s vanishing and the program’s dissolution with Clara’s peace—offering a before/after. The cost is present but mostly conceptual/emotional, not materially constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration at the close. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the scene coheres around one stake. The smudge and the wanderer’s arrival deepen pressure and reweight meaning toward acceptance; cost is the relinquishment of pristine certainty. Closure lands on the page as she alters the drawing rather than repairing it.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain is tight: interpreting the father’s calls → locating the valve wheel → following noise → activating the machine to release the ghosts. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act and a before/after state (ghost shift ends, Mara’s peace). Orientation is clean from the outset. The cost at closure is modest but legible (risk, renunciation of disbelief, emotional reckoning).

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Causality is clean: swan reveals “Burrow” → map → journey → mirror dissolution → return transformed. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the refuge erased, journals filled, and her stance reweighted; the cost is legible in the loss of the place and her ceded certainty. A few symbol mentions (undeciphered symbols) don’t affect options, but the structure holds.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the eclipse’s deepening hush and the curl’s glow create a cadence shift that culminates in Finn’s reawakened wonder (Conceptual Repricing). Orientation is clean early, and the closure sits on the page. Cost is subtle (abandoning the telescope as necessary lens; Elara’s keepsake repurposed), but legible for this length. Causal links are light but coherent and consistent with the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Causal—diaries → scrolls → ritual → reawakening. Closure is an on‑page Decisive Change (the world dreams again), but the cost is not legible; urgency is asserted (“act quickly”) without pressure testing. Discoveries arrive conveniently (hidden compartment, intact ritual) with no setbacks. Structure is coherent and linear within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive reads as accumulative/textural, culminating in a stance shift: Li Wei commits to the journey. The closure (beginning the quest) lands, but cost is not legible on the page—no foreclosed path or concrete price beyond implication. The scene stays anchored in place and time with a clean throughline. Dependencies (specs → clarity → plan) are more declared than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: questions → tremor/shudder → cracking → declaration → dissolution. Orientation is clean and the closure lands as a conceptual repricing (“unraveled stillness is… clarity”). Cost is thin—victory arrives without a concrete forfeit—yet the on‑page reconfiguration of the possession’s power is legible. One continuous scene with a single tightening arc works at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns (mirror, shell, dawn, hush) intensify toward the activation of the crystal harp; closure lands on the page with cost (slump, shell slipping). Orientation is clear early (glass spire, frozen lake, predawn). The causal thread—shell → inscription/whisper → harp resonates—is legible and earned. The final mirrored horizon image functions as a charged repricing rather than a decisive plot turn, but it’s effective.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural lens is coherent: iterative paths build to a conceptual repricing at center and return. Orientation is strong early, and the fractal transition is legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—fracture reframed as gift—but the cost is mostly conceptual, not vividly priced. Setups (tablet, viaduct, selves) pay off cleanly without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery of the needle → decision to reverse songs → iterative work → sensed awakenings → tear and re-entry into the world. Closure lands with cost: numbness replaced by raw aliveness while deafness persists, reweighting silence as possibility. Orientation is clean early; single POV, single locus with one temporal glide. The causal chain is simple but tight and sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain: tube → coordinates → gate/patrol pattern → lab → revelation → reweighted purpose. Orientation is solid from the outset; the drive lens reads Causal with a closure that’s a conceptual repricing toward duty. The quarantine and guards set pressure but obstacles resolve too smoothly. Cost at closure is more conceptual than dramatized, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative structure holds: the vial triggers a sequence of deepening shards (greenhouse → hospital → backyard) culminating in a present-tense choice. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost (he permits grief via scent), clearly on the page. Causality is clean and the pattern is taught early. The inciting stranger handoff is convenient but doesn’t undercut the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The grotto’s shifting patterns → rope alignment → alcove mirror sequence coheres toward a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis close when Elias sets the rope down. Orientation is clean and single‑scene; cost is legible in the relinquishment of a survival object and past self. Minor softness comes from an explicitly stated thesis in the final line rather than wholly letting the image carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds through sensory density until a cadence shift: music → storytelling breaks the hush and reweights meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the hush reframed from enemy to muse. Orientation is crisp and the scene remains single-window coherent. Cost is present but modest (accepting the hush’s terms; leaving the bowl), keeping it out of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single‑scene accumulative design holds: preparation → sensing → subsuming → exit, with a legible cadence shift at the dissolution. Closure lands as an earned stasis/quiet repricing: she completes the transformation and accepts the half‑truth at a small emotional cost. Orientation is crisp from the opening paragraph. The causal weave is modest but coherent, with no dropped setups.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    Causal chain is clear: mistaken envelope → reading → writing → correspondence → meeting → reveal that reconfigures the locket’s meaning. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, but it lands on the page with a before/after. Cost is mostly implied (risk of vulnerability), not dramatized. The drive lens reads causal with gentle pressure and holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative structure holds: tag discovery → inquiry → extended search → Echo encounter → reweighted return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when Echo marks her sculpture and she recasts belonging. The cost is implied (months of searching, vulnerability) but not strongly dramatized, and the Echo meeting veers convenient. Orientation is clean and the lens remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: pendant warms → follows pull → canal reconfigures → gate opens → pool insight → return with cost (time window closing, power spent). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: time as tapestry rather than river, with the loss of staying/continued access. Orientation is solid early; the single transition is legible. Stakes stay contained and coherent under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant lens: Causal. The chain—eyes → shadows → mosaic code → warm stone → journal warning → revised understanding—tracks cleanly and stays single‑POV. Closure lands as a conceptual reconfiguration (control → harmony) with a charged final image, though the cost is mostly implied. Orientation is clear early and the one transition (orchard ↔ workshop) is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragments discovered → deeper pursuit → tape hums to life → internal repricing. Orientation is strong from the outset (library at dawn, crawl space dweller, outage). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the playback, but the cost (risking sanctuary) is lightly felt rather than exerting concrete pressure at the end. The single scene coheres with one dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the storm’s cadence and repeated engagements with the leaf intensify toward a Charged Poise ending. Closure is on‑page as she surrenders control and reconfigures her space/self, with cost legible in fear and forfeiture of old tactics. Orientation is solid and the single scene coheres. A touch of symbolic neatness (leaf dissolving) feels convenient but doesn’t break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain under a Causal lens: rain trails → ruin → brooch → map → cove → exchange → book → painting. Orientation is swift and stable; props and information pay off. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: her role redefined through the exchange. The on‑page cost is subdued (brooch for book), keeping the close from the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, with escalation via density and cadence shifts culminating in a Conceptual Repricing/RR. Orientation is solid, cause/effect holds (touching the pearl leads to inhabitation), and the final return carries a reweighted identity. The cost is conceptual—she trades certainty for guardianship—which lands, if gently. The single-scene arc is coherent and fulfills closure requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the scene coheres around one dominant line—attuning to the harbor, discovering the fragment, then sounding the valve. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: absences reprice into spaces to fill, with Elara accepting the charge. The on-page cost is light but legible as commitment and identity shift rather than a concrete sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under a Situational lens, pressure coheres around the midnight test and culminates in a Decisive Change (punching the ticket) that reconfigures stance. Orientation is clear early (Eldermere, abandoned station, midnight), and the glyph-punch → gate → labyrinth → ticket sequence tracks. The cost is present—abandoning mapped certainty—though it reads more conceptual than visceral. No glaring causality breaks; the environment’s coincidences complicate without resolving her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: discovery → compulsion → ascent → vision → repriced purpose. Orientation is clean, and the beats connect via sensation and motif rather than hard causal turns, fitting the mode. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing when the symphony “lives in her heart.” The on‑page cost is modest (surrendering skepticism), keeping it short of a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain under a Causal lens: find fragment → experiment via magnetic fields → storm‑amplified mutiny → shatter → reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate and consistent, and the fragment’s break is the decisive on‑page turn with costs visible in the world’s rupture. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (purpose gained, consequences looming). A hair more specificity in the “price” on Elyr’s body or resources could have pushed the cost from conceptual to visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-scene, single-POV structure is clear; orientation lands early and the lens reads Situational: pressure coheres when the father enters. Closure is a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration: Clara rejects flight for honesty, foreclosing a path. Cost is implied (abandoning asylum plan) more than felt, keeping the climax quiet but functional. The ink pot’s catalytic beat ties cause to choice without breaking logic.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: the hum strengthens, the lamp flickers, and dawn’s fade creates a natural cadence shift. Closure lands as a quiet resonant reconfiguration: what she calls “invented histories” reveals as memory, and she claims it with charged restraint. The cost is subtle—fatigue and the impending loss of the night’s clarity—so the before/after is more conceptual than decisional. Orientation is clean and the single-scene window holds.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragments accrete toward the archive discovery and the closing repricing of purpose. Orientation is clean from the start (port, containers, tides, nameless survivor). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the poison label’s meaning shifts and the protagonist assumes a guardian stance. Cost is more conceptual than felt; still, the cadence shift is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound → resonance → conceptual repricing. Orientation is crisp from the opening; the cello sequence coheres and culminates in a charged silence. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a felt cost (relinquishing proof for lived ambiguity). The causal weave is soft but sufficient within the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Situational lens fits: looming privatization applies steady pressure, and the Festival of Lights creates a closure beat (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis). Orientation is clean; the causal chain (graffiti → decoding → rally → festival) is coherent. The cost at closure is conceptual more than felt—Vorin’s disruption is noted but not dramatized, softening impact. Still, the final image reconfigures stance credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene structure with clear anchors and a steady because/therefore chain: arrival → hidden message → decision to “outlast” → dawn photo. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she endures until dawn despite pressure. The cost is modest (disobeying urgency rather than a concrete penalty), so the ending resonates more quietly than decisively. Lens reads Situational with a textural deepening as dawn approaches, held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orientation is clean early, single scene coherence holds, and the accumulative/textural lens is apt. Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise: the drone flies, the traveler’s relief, and the sanctuary image reframing her work. The cost is light—no meaningful risk or foreclosed path is felt—which caps impact. Still, the anchor motif provides a mild cadence shift that coheres the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative finish: condensation pattern → thin ice/vibration → mist line → fissure/source forms a coherent, motivated progression. Orientation is clean from the opening and the single scene holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she finds the origin and reframes it into “the language of the river.” The cost is subtle (leaving the outpost, exposure and renunciation of maps), adequate for this quiet scale.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated footfalls and tuning fork use build toward the bell’s return, a clear on‑page closure beat. Orientation is crisp from the outset (archway, ghost town, Elias), and the routine’s accumulation reads as the structural driver. Cost is implied (time, solitude) more than explicitly felt, keeping the closure strong but not piercing. The cause‑effect is poetic rather than literal yet consistent within the story’s rules.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single‑POV causal arc is coherent: trapped → vial memories → decoding → exit with reweighted aim. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration (from survival to discovery), but the cost is soft. Beats connect via “therefore,” yet obstacles resolve without friction, muting the decisive turn. Orientation is clear early; the drive lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under a Causal lens, the descent → journal revelation → decision forms a clean because/therefore chain. Orientation (who/where/when) lands early; the lighthouse, door, staircase, and chamber cohere. Closure is a Decisive Change/renunciation with a hinted cost (“before they find the bodies”), though that ticking clock is not dramatized beyond mention. Strong linkage, slightly soft on the on-page price at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the bead’s activation draws other spirits and reweights the debt from personal to collective, culminating in a charged-poise exit. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the object and anchor tree track throughout. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with implied cost, though stakes never face a concrete on‑page test. No causality breaks; pressure accrues via image density rather than turns.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single‑POV, one continuous accumulative/textural scene lands a resonant reconfiguration: the canyon “exhales” and the aura turns from sorrow to hope. Orientation is clean and the story maintains its taught pattern (sleepwalk sewing guided by the plate). The cost at closure is modest and mostly retrospective (life dedication, fatigue), but the cadence shift reads clearly. Structure coheres even if the turns are gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is clean from the outset; structure proceeds from discovery to entry to revelation. The closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/soft causal turn: placing the sundial base opens the tomb, and the mural reweights her quest into belonging. Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional; pressure is gentle but coherent under an accumulative/textural lens. No glaring teleports or broken setups; the causal click (base fits slab) pays off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads Hybrid leaning causal: chalk → coordinates → mailbox → letter → realization. Orientation is clean and the sequence is coherent, but the closure unit is a soft conceptual repricing without on‑page cost; the “clock” never forces a trade‑off. The retrieval succeeds too smoothly, so the final recognition lacks a decisive consequence. Effective linkage, modest payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid lens with an accumulative cadence: the pulsing flame → unintended patterns → Lira’s arrival → synchronization → completed chart provides a new path. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara’s purpose crystallizes with the chart complete and the conspiracy reframed as cosmic. Cost remains conceptual (mentor’s “silencing,” severed connection if they fail) rather than dramatized, keeping the ceiling mid‑high. Orientation is clean early (observatory, Elara, autumn night).

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats tighten cleanly: wandering → condensation messages → map → pedestal letter → reading. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: she opens and reads the unsent letter, and the world audibly shifts (spirits fall silent, single note). Orientation is strong from the outset; causality is patterned rather than mechanical but consistent. The cost—confronting a buried regret—is present, though understated.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from mood and fragments into a deciphered map and a reweighted closing image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the last line reframes her task from translation to advocacy, with implied risk. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when are legible), and the through‑line (decoding → sanctuary knowledge → chosen burden) holds. The explicit, immediate consequence is understated, tempering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: discoveries accrete (fresco → path → film → network → display) and culminate in a resonant reconfiguration (she reclaims purpose by painting on fog). Orientation is solid early; cause/effect is plausible without strain. Closure lands on the page, though the felt price is modest. The single scene holds coherence and cadence through one meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single‑scene accumulative design coheres: restoration → harmonics → apparitions → offered trade → humming/conducting → awakening. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing where her stance shifts and the garden reconfigures meaning. Causality is clean, though the price of the change is modest. Orientation is clear early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Situational with causal links. The scene tracks cleanly: infiltration → discovery → unease → reveal → call to action → departure. Closure is a Charged Poise: decision to join a risky convening, cost implied by “infiltrated ranks.” The price isn’t viscerally on-page, but the before/after reconfiguration is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repetition of singing and wind builds to the night when the shell “hums” back, and the final lullaby-cadence reweights the stake. Orientation is clear from the opening. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis blend) with a felt price (time, wear, endurance), though cost remains gentle. Structure is unified, with one meaningful tightening at the shell’s acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate; the call → museum → Vessel → song → shattering forms a clean pressure arc. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on‑page cost (the chime breaks; Elara is flooded and altered; the names are preserved). Causality and cadence tighten appropriately without contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Resonant Reconfiguration via the writing act and Kael’s appearance with a reweighted bond. Orientation is clean; the build toward the inkwell and the promises tightens coherently. Cost is present but modest—magic assists reconciliation quickly, reducing friction. Still, the because/therefore of her vow-writing → activation → reconciliation is legible and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal lens holds: adhesive → code → chain‑poem map → design choice → outcome. Closure lands in a decisive plan that reconfigures the central stake, but the “By dawn” acceptance compresses friction and cost off‑page. Some contrivance in discoveries (poetic chain, adhesive clue) smooths pressure. Cost at the ending is conceptual rather than felt, limiting punch.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust mapping density increases after the letter (“The songs are in the dust”), culminating in a reweighted final image. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she pivots from reinvention to truth with the songs reclaimed through pattern. Orientation is clear early and the inciting letter causally tightens focus. The cost is gentle and conceptual rather than viscerally staged, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: terrace → codes → shifting prisms → memory → repriced understanding → offering of the logbook. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with a visible price (abandoning the heirloom and foreclosing further pursuit). Orientation is clear early and maintained; the single transition into memory is cued and paid off. The because/therefore is lyric rather than causal, but the internal logic is consistent and the final image reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural, with density building through bioluminescent patterning → alarm rupture → charged exit. Orientation is crisp from the opening; the facility and its pressures are clear. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she briefly reenters danger to join the dance, then departs, carrying a reconfigured understanding at a cost. A slight convenience in the timing of alarms is forgivable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure is coherent: seed → failed images → reframed tactic → partial vision → conceptual repricing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—acceptance that rediscovery is the point—though the cost is subtle. Orientation is crisp and props track. The because/therefore is modest rather than forceful but holds under a textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the patterning of bishop moves against crowd motion builds to a charged poise at the skylight. Orientation is crisp (city arcade under stars; between acts), and one escalation arrives with the bishop centered under a starlight beam. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Elias affirmed as antidote to monotony—but the cost is soft and largely conceptual. The scene’s clock (“between acts”) tightens but never corners him.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Situational lens holds: a single scene of pressure culminates in a charged poise when the sentinel pauses, then departs. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the dominant stake (risk of erasure vs. expression) is tested on the page. The closure carries conceptual cost—her defiance remains dangerous even as she “wins” the moment. The sentinel’s withdrawal reads slightly convenient, but is at least motivated by the verse’s charged presence.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    Orientation is solid from the opening, and the accumulative structure coheres: dock → pond → atrium → return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes himself from glazier to “keeper of light” and commits to action. Yet cost is light and largely asserted; the pressure toward decision is atmospheric rather than causally tightening. No props or rule shifts break coherence, but the climax resolves without a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene advances cleanly from discovery to reflective visions to a charged final placement of the box (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise). Orientation is clear early (moonlit ridge, firefighter with a relic) and closure lands on the page with a before/after. Cost is present but soft—choosing to carry purpose instead of guilt—but legible in the act of leaving the box and walking away. The feather-vision beat provides the key deepening without breaking the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the tide’s approach and the density of patterns build to a conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/what), and the closure lands via acceptance of impermanence with the washed patterns as cost. The escalation is modest but coherent, and the final return to the gauge consolidates the journey. The price is felt more as relinquishment than consequence, hence just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under a Causal lens, beats link cleanly: diaries → heightened lure; film strip as key → dead‑end wall → hidden chamber → reconfiguration. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (the walls want remembrance), with the film strip’s placement catalyzing the final image. Cost is felt conceptually (taking up the burden) rather than viscerally, but the before/after is legible. Orientation is clear early and the single‑scene scope holds.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: notes one to three, mirrors’ resistance, then the bells and surrender create a clear cadence shift. Closure lands on the page with cost: “her own heartbeat now fainter,” and the mirrors’ function decisively changes. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early, and the ticking clock is clean. No causality breaks; each intensification follows her purposeful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: descent → grueling talks → emotionally costly appeal → signatures at zenith → dawn return. Closure is decisive (treaty signed) with a felt cost in her voice breaking and the toll on her ideals. Scope fits a single scene across days with one transition and no causality breaks. Slight ease at the signing after one speech is mitigated by the “hours into days” pressure already established.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear single-scene arc with accumulative pressure: cracks lead to damp earth, egg placed, rain answers. Closure lands as a charged poise/earnest stasis moment, with a decisive act and a reweighted final image. The cost is more implied than enacted, and the rain’s timing flirts with convenience. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/goal) with no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the scene coheres: approach → tactile untangling → harmonic convergence → opening → release. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (unlocking and release) and conceptual cost (city must face complacency). Causality is clean, though stakes deepen more by assertion than by obstacles. Orientation is solid from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, orientation is immediate and the reflective build coheres toward an on‑page decision that reweights the premise. The closure—choosing to “reverse” and rebuild—lands clearly and is embodied by prepping the stage and packing the puppets. The cost signal is modest (no on‑page social or relational price is paid), which limits force. Structure stays within single–scene scope and maintains continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when rapidly and sustains one scene, building toward a Charged Poise closure: the monarch wing addition and descent seal a stance of honoring transience amid loss. Causality is soft but coherent; the air’s “interrupted cadence” prompts humming, then the charged placement of the wing. The cost—accepting scarcity and impermanence—lands, if quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: preparation → reconfiguration → illumination → conceptual repricing (memory as connection, not just preservation). Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the ritual culminates on the page with a clear before/after. Cost is felt as earned release and years of regret transmuted, albeit subtly. No causality breaks or late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the storm’s approach, wafer pulses, and symbol‑dance build toward a conceptual repricing. Closure arrives with the resonance insight and the wafer dissolving, but the on‑page cost is minimal. Orientation is clean from the outset, single scene maintained. The beat sequence is coherent, though largely inward and pre‑decided.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. The sequence—search, discovery, observatory alignment, deciphered message, renewed purpose—tracks cleanly and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. However, the key beats arrive with minimal complication, and the closure’s cost is conceptual rather than felt. Orientation is early and stable, but escalation is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single-scene coherence with a situational drive: Elara applies pressure, Kael resists, then chooses to begin release. Closure lands as a quiet decisive change with a felt (if modest) cost: vulnerability and relinquishing a hardened stance. Orientation is clean; no lens confusion. Stakes resolve on the page without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coherently builds from examination to synchronized repair to threshold crossing. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: boundaries thin and a charged final image reframes possibility. The cost is mostly conceptual (fleeting glimpse; tool’s glow fades) rather than felt on the page, softening impact. Orientation is clear early; setup/payoff are tidy without mechanical over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.7)
    Hybrid lens leaning causal: her decision to persist leads to using bag items → altar scroll → blooming tree → vow transformation. Orientation is crisp early; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the ribbon woven into the glowing tree. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized loss, keeping the change persuasive but soft. The chain of actions holds together without major gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as a single scene with one transition (orchard → bathroom → encounter) and culminates in a Conceptual Repricing: the cameo as nonlinear inheritance. Orientation is strong early; closure lands, but the cost is mostly implied rather than felt on the page. The woman’s exposition resolves tension efficiently but softens structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal lens holds: diary → chrono‑blossom → hidden door → guardian renegotiation → access. Orientation is clean and the sequence is coherent, but the closure’s cost is mostly conceptual—“balance of time”—rather than on‑page loss. The library entry is a Decisive Change, yet the price is lightly sketched. Stakes declared as “time collapsing” don’t materially compress the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: ship → threads → bow → mist door → step through, with the emerald card linking beats. Closure lands on the page via a conceptual repricing—garden as state, not place—and an enacted choice (crossing, card dissolving). Causality is sufficient for this mode, though obstacles are minimal and the price remains soft.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under a Hybrid lens (causal acts within an accumulative atmosphere), the chain—seal study → rope reconfiguration → door opening—reads cleanly and culminates on the page. Closure is a Decisive Change with a light Resonant Reconfiguration (the chimes and chamber reweight the tower’s meaning). Cost is underplayed; effort and risk feel low. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the one-scene flow holds.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is immediate and clean; the scene progresses coherently from search to activation. Closure lands on the page (the bloom unfurls; the storm dissipates), though the cost is modest (fatigue more than sacrifice). The drive reads Hybrid leaning Accumulative: density of hum/light motifs crests into a cadence shift at activation. Causal beats connect (ice cracks → path → song), but pressure stays smooth, not tightening into a hard corner.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear causal progression: research → weeks of star‑mapping → partial success → discovery of the ritual → memory sacrifice → prism reforms. Closure lands on‑page with cost as memories fade and the prism restores, reconfiguring options and meaning. Orientation is strong from the outset; the drive lens reads Causal and holds through the end. Minor convenience in discovering the ritual is offset by the earned sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure is coherent: measuring shadows → anomalous wing shadow → fog wall → visions → renewed stance. Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—she recommits to safeguarding memory—though the on‑page price is mostly tonal. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when). The because/therefore chain is modest but intact for an accumulative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the scene densifies from approach → ignition → communal mosaic → charged finale. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the fortress moves from hush to cheering, darkness to beacon. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph, though the cost at closure is modest. The pattern is taught and kept; escalation is mostly tonal rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the scene builds density via the cicada’s hum, patterned star‑light, and layered time perceptions toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is clean early, single POV, one continuous scene with a clear throughline from pause to return. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing; the before/after is legible. The cost is implied (risk to professional standing, surrender of linear proof), not dramatized, slightly softening the landing.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal chain is clean: inversion arrives → climb under time pressure → doll slip micro‑turn → attained silence → return with reconfigured stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change; the cost is conceptual (returning to an intolerable bunker) more than immediate. Orientation is clear early and the single‑scene window holds. A slightly sharper on‑page consequence at the end would heighten the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the vial’s shifts and environment intensify toward a calm that reweights the stake. Orientation is clean early, the single scene is coherent, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Mira leaves lighter; the vial glows). The cost is subtle and mostly conceptual (relinquishing agitation), which limits impact but remains legible. Causality is soft but continuous via the gondolier’s micro-choices and the vial’s feedback.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.1)
    Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: murals → mechanism → stair → throne → conceptual reversal. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing (the throne’s collective purpose), on the page and coherent. The cost is mostly conceptual, with little on‑scene pushback from the world or time constraint, keeping stakes modest. Orientation is strong from the outset and remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain under a Causal lens: darkness encroaches → Lira gathers strength via scars → uses the ring → pays a price → threshold stabilizes. Orientation is clear from the opening and the choice is motivated by established stakes. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (ring cracked, bond severed). No major teleports or soft resets; setup elements pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Causal chain is clean: texts → bolt on mushrooms → portal → machine → diamonds → return with reweighted purpose. Orientation is solid from the farm onward; the single transition to the concept-world is legible. Closure lands (RR/DC hybrid: role adoption as “guardian”), though the cost is soft. Setups (bolt, texts) pay off, and there are no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is coherent with a clean two‑shard movement from room to vision and back; orientation is never in doubt. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she accepts a reframed role with a painful truth. However, key turns arrive conveniently via the shadowed figure and journal, reducing causal pressure. The accumulative lens holds, but the cost is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: imagery intensifies (vines → patterns → puppet self → no-strings image) toward a conceptual reconfiguration. Closure is on-page: he renounces the old orientation and accepts an allegiance to agency, with the talisman absorbed into him and the place. Orientation is clear early; cause/therefore linkages are soft but consistent with the chosen lens. The cost is present but restrained, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orientation is immediate (file room, Elara, the button) and the accumulative lens holds: find object → decode via dust → tie to letter → repurpose herself. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the room becomes a “sanctuary,” and Elara commits to unfurling the story. The because/therefore chain is soft but coherent; no plot leaps. Cost is mostly emotional and implicit, just sufficient for this quiet form.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal chain: lagoon → key → door → archive → enforcers → broadcast → escape. Closure lands as a charged poise/decisive broadcast with implied cost (becoming a hunted “ghost in their machine”). Minor conveniences (perfect key fit, instant citywide transmit) slightly blunt pressure but don’t break the lens. Single-scene coherence with a meaningful tightening at the enforcers’ arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, escalation is coherent: music intensifies, the grotto responds (humming, rotation, beam), and the prophecy dissolves on the page. Orientation is clear early; single scene holds. Closure is a decisive change (prophecy undone), yet the cost at the end is faint (fatigue only), keeping the cadence satisfying but low‑risk. The because/therefore is soft but consistent with the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.5)
    The structure follows a clean accumulative arc: discovery → ritual → revelation → research → reconfiguration of identity. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, and it lands legibly. The cost is implied (responsibility, reoriented life) rather than dramatized, which softens impact. Orientation is clear and the lens holds, but the final shift is conceptually weighted more than narratively pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Hybrid lens (causal spine with textural accrual) holds: stranger → compass → greenhouse → cavern → map → repricing. Orientation is clean and the closure works as conceptual repricing/Earned Stasis when he declines possession and redirects his craft. The cost is conceptual (relinquishing control, treasure), not visceral; still, it’s legible on the page. No major dropped setups; momentum is steady.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density, patterning (coin, furnace, visions), and cadence shift culminate in a conceptual repricing of “redemption.” Orientation is clean from the outset. Closure occurs on the page as the coin fixes to her sign and she accepts carrying it; cost is conceptual/emotional (luminous regret softened, the burden assumed). The structure is single‑scene with one intensification, coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal chain: descent → encounter → confession via harp → release → tooth falls → sunrise and aligned strings. Closure lands on the page with the figure’s dissolution and Elara’s reconfiguration; cost is the accrued ache and the tooth’s spent power. Orientation is solid early; single scene coherence holds. The lens reads Hybrid with an accumulative cadence culminating in a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory and symbolic density increases as she moves deeper until the strap’s release, a visible cost that reweights meaning. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and the single-scene progression is coherent. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: pain’s purpose reframed and a tangible renunciation performed. The turns are modest, but the ending lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal drive holds: symbol → hidden compartment → map → tower → murals → assembled narrative, culminating in the fragment’s glow fading. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis—the job is completed and a path closed—though the on‑page cost is light (the fragment’s purpose spent, fatigue). Orientation is strong early, and the two-shard market-to-tower movement remains coherent. A firmer on‑page pinch point would deepen the felt price at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal spine: whisper “engage” → dust analysis/ceiling attention → discovery of clock → barrel insertion → environment/ghosts resolve. Closure lands on the page (clock reanimated, cracks seal, lights steady), with a conceptual after‑cost (cracks return; ongoing duty). Stakes are modest but coherent under a causal lens; no major causality slips or teleports. The cost is felt lightly rather than acutely.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: frost pattern → rupture → bottle → descent → re-seen library → caretaker resolution. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—the library reframed as living and her role redefined. Causality is coherent, but on‑page cost is light, limiting impact. Orientation is crisp early, with one clean transition.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a Causal lens, the plan → storm → ritual → visions → evidence sequence links cleanly, and the closure lands with a Decisive Change (proof etched in the shard) plus cost. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when) and the single‑scene window holds. The price is emotional rather than tactical, yet legible in the final beat (“triumph was bittersweet... wounds remained unhealed”). Opposition (Empiricists) is off‑stage, slightly softening pressure but not breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal throughline holds: stranger → box/tether → journey → Covenant release with an on‑page Decisive Change and conceptual cost (stone gone dull). Stakes progress logically via the tether mechanics; no major causality gaps. Some beats (tinker exposition) are told rather than stressed in scene, softening urgency but not breaking closure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: factory → basement → door → tunnel → lagoon is clean and purposeful. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she sacrifices the compass and reprices her aim from answers to mystery, with the cost legible on the page. Orientation is solid and the single-scene architecture holds pressure without soft resets. A slightly greater on-page test of options would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Coherent causal chain: slide → archway → passage → carvings → slide merger → map/realization. Closure reads as a Conceptual Repricing (she reconceives her role), and the lens holds. Cost is soft—responsibility is named but not paid on the page, and the storm conveniently stills to enable resolution. Orientation is clean and consistent within a single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: pavilion → decision → cathedral immersion → studio completion → realization, cohering under an accumulative/textural lens. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing (beauty in darkness) connected to the mural’s completion. Causality is modest but consistent; no teleports or broken setups. Cost is implied rather than dramatized, keeping it short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds toward a Charged Poise: the lagoon figure acknowledges her parley, reweighting the quest. Orientation is crisp early, and cause/effect tracks (letters → diary → lagoon → ritual → answer). The closure lands on-page, though the felt cost is mild. One scene with a single tightening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation is crisp, the bottle functions as a hinge, and the piece holds a Hybrid drive with an accumulative finale. Closure lands via an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she revives the cove and chooses to move on; the price is refusing comfort. Escalation is smooth rather than pressurized, with minimal narrowing of options. The causal chain (conception → lanterns/buildings → community → departure) is coherent but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats link cleanly: foghorn silence → playback/prophecy → symbol decoding → spoken acknowledgment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the orchard responds and her path is reweighted. Cost is soft but present conceptually (accepting a vast, ancient burden). Orientation is solid from the outset, and the pattern taught early pays off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/goal), and causal moves track: cap → arch → vortex → reframe → crossing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (accepting stewardship), but on-page price is light. Escalation is minimal; the mechanism reawakens without meaningful complication. Still, the sequence coheres under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds cleanly from sensor prep to twitch → tug → hum → bell → rain, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external change. Orientation is immediate and stable, and the bell rope’s switch quality is paid off on the page. The cost is conceptual (a vocation reweighted), not materially felt, which keeps the closure effective but modest. No causality breaks, but pressure remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the lantern’s glow → constellation map → empathic comprehension → quiet renunciation. Orientation is clean early (who/where/role). Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: she returns to duty changed, placing the dimmed lantern aside with a cost of letting its guidance go. The causal chain is soft but coherent; pressure is internal and steady rather than sharply turned.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: discoveries, symbols, melody, and water accrete toward a ritual that lands on the page. Some conveniences (dream‑opened box, immediate deciphering) soften pressure, but the closure (oasis stirs, ghosts dissolve) is clear with a conceptual cost. Orientation is firm early; the two‑shard feel (discovery → ritual) is coherent. The because/therefore chain is light yet legible under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clean causal chain from chronometer glitches → fragment → garage‑sale messaging → Thaddeus’s knowledge → hidden chamber → activation and stabilization. Closure lands on the page (device mends time), but the cost is thin and convenience is high (Thaddeus’s timely recognition, device working on first try). Orientation is solid throughout. Lens: Causal, held through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; pressure accrues through motif and cadence rather than hard causal turns. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the repaired kite lifts, the poem glows, and the feather’s transfer reweights meaning. Orientation is swift and clean; the beat progression (snap → examination → encounter → repair → flight) coheres. Cost is quiet but legible: she parts with her talisman, and both accept incompleteness as the enduring rule.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate and stable; the orchard remodel and discoveries accrue toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure (the final entry and quiet acceptance). The because/therefore chains are soft, but the pattern of shaping → revealing carvings → reweighting legacy coheres. The cost is mostly conceptual (spent time, relinquishment), which lands but without a sharp on‑page squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ascent → chamber → amber‑fusion → descent forms a coherent cadence that culminates in a conceptual repricing of “homecoming.” Orientation is clean from the outset; the causal thread is simple but intact. Closure lands on the page when she places her amber and reads the “map,” with a modest but legible price (yielding skepticism). Pressure is quiet, yet the pattern intensifies meaningfully toward the pedestal scene.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: patterned acts (planting, listening, speaking) accrete toward a Charged Poise ending as he departs, hope planted. Orientation is immediate (coachman on the jetty after the reef’s death). Closure lands conceptually but with light cost; the final carriage departure is a cadence shift more than a decisive turn. The scene holds coherence with one continuous window and a clean exit image.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around the leaf and phonograph, building toward a conceptual repricing: connection in a ruined world. Closure lands in the charged return to Rustveil with the transformed leaf, but the cost is soft—Elias’s shift feels more reflective than hard‑won. Orientation is clean and the two‑shard structure is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.7)
    Orientation and throughline are solid from the outset, and the accumulative/textural lens holds: the night’s sketching accrues until dawn yields a Charged Poise resolve. Closure lands as a stance shift (accepting the “blessed pariah” calling), but the cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in-scene. The beat structure is one steady swell rather than turns, yet it coheres and ends on a reweighted image (the gleaming compass rose, the filled sketchpad).

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under a Causal lens, the path—legend → ascent → chess trial → unlocking—tracks cleanly to a Decisive Change with the sky restored. Orientation is firm and the chain of actions is coherent. Cost at closure is soft, with the trial compressed and won without a concrete loss beyond a chess sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: present‑tense walking pattern ratchets meaning toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when). Closure lands with a before/after reweighting—Elara’s “luminous absence” and revised reading of the pawnless board—though the cost is more conceptual than visceral. The throughline holds without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discovery → activation → spatial reconfiguration → realization, culminating in a reweighted understanding (CR). Orientation is solid early; causality flows from action to internal shift. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional and could be sharper on the page, but the ending image (circle, floating stone, language as map) provides credible closure. Tight single scene, clean throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is steady: decoding → entrance opens → heart‑thread message → reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration with on‑page action (pulling the thread) and a felt emotional cost. The cause/effect is simple but coherent; the king/pawn parable reframes Elara’s guilt before the labyrinth’s invitation. Stakes remain intimate, but the cadence shift at the thread read is decisive enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single scene, single POV, clean orientation, and an accumulative/textural drive are taught early and held. The closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: “a piece of herself” surrendered, path revealed, elders’ path foreclosed. Because→therefore logic is secondary to patterned intensification (mist, echoes, glow) that coherently culminates. Cost is legible in the final image and alters future options.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens reads Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pattern matching and narration charge the environment, and a cadence shift at the end reconfigures stakes. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: the workshop steadies and Elara reframes her past into hope. Causality holds (charm → glow → memory tapestry → crisis → declaration → calm), but the cost is underplayed; little is lost beyond momentary peril. Orientation is clean by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The detour to the hidden oasis, the decision to paint, and the public display build toward a Conceptual Repricing closure (eternity as a moment, vulnerability as kept promise). Orientation is clean and the single POV holds; the causal chain is simple but coherent. Cost is present (risk of exposure) though lightly etched; escalation is more atmospheric than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural culminating in a Conceptual Repricing—he reweights agency from the object to himself. Orientation is clean and the two-shard structure (lighthouse → shore/grove → return) coheres. Closure is on-page with a felt shift, though the cost is light (shedding doubt without a steep tradeoff). The beckoning functions as the single meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    The causal chain is clean: cryptic calls → building → beacon → arrivals → renewed commitment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with an ongoing cost (the censer’s waning glow and cyclical labor). Structure stays coherent and anchored in one locus with legible escalation. The price is felt but modest on the page, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: discovery → compulsion to truth → consulting discredited sources via Mara → dawn ritual → relief. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (curse lifted) and a conceptual repricing around which truths to carry. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the lens remains causal through the end. The felt cost is modest but legible (foregoing the charged relic to regain autonomy).

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → discovery (boot print, journal) → conceptual reweighting. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he assumes stewardship of the borrowed memories with felt, if quiet, cost. Orientation is clean early; sequence is coherent. The journal’s timely appearance skirts convenience but does not break causality under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.9)
    Structure is clean: discovery → passage → portal → charge scene → study/realization. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing (decisions as the true doorway) but the cost is light and the prophecy-style exposition undercuts earned pressure. Causality holds albeit conveniently (ants, instant mentor figure). The ending reads coherent under an accumulative/causal hybrid lens but with limited weight.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clean causal flow: warning → ascent → discovery → revelation → vow → descent. Single POV and two‑shard progression stay anchored; the closure is a decisive internal turn plus conceptual repricing of starlight as lifeblood. Cost is implied rather than dramatized, slightly softening the landing. The lens reads primarily causal with a thematic reveal at the apex.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds toward a conceptual repricing: the world is “revalued” by the ritual and the final shared recognition. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when), and the single scene coheres. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, though the cost is modest and largely conceptual. The because/therefore chain is soft but sufficient for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece coheres from cabin to star expanse to return, culminating in a conceptual repricing—“The story is…now.” Anchors are clear early; single POV and scope hold. Closure lands on the page, though the price is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than materially costly. The scroll’s reweighted sentence cleanly seals the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene gathers pressure from atmosphere to the charged exchange with Mira, culminating in a conceptual repricing of Elara’s loss. Orientation is crisp early; the closure lands via a final image of clock and screw reweighted by insight. Causality is light but coherent: Mira’s return enables Elara’s request and tactile epiphany. The cost is subtle yet legible—her anosmia persists as the price of her new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single-scene, single-POV structure is clean; anchors arrive early and the lens reads as Situational/Accumulative. The decisive shift (recognizing fear as the source of stress, quill smoothing, rain ceasing) lands on the page. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional but present at closure. Causality is tidy with no dropped setups.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density and motif recurrence build to a resonant reconfiguration where forgiveness is accepted without undoing loss. Orientation is solid from the opening (archive, orchard, bottle, grandmother). Closure lands on the page with the bottle’s lightness and the orchard’s “sigh,” the cost preserved (trees still doomed). Beats link coherently from hum → vision → apology‑pulse → altered atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery and ritual intensify to a Conceptual Repricing when the dictionary merges with the mural. Closure lands on the page and reweights identity (“end” to “beginning”), but the cost remains mostly conceptual. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/why). The sequence escalates coherently, if gently, from walk → mural → glow → merger.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under a hybrid leaning toward accumulative/causal, the sequence is coherent: counting back → dropped key → notch → hidden slot → parchment → reweighted understanding. The closure is a conceptual repricing that redraws the meaning of “time,” with a clean before/after. The cost is more conceptual than felt, which limits impact but doesn’t break closure. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph with place, role, and stake anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.3)
    Hybrid lens (causal spine with accumulative reweighting) holds: patrol → disturbance → footprints → encounter → token transfer → reconfigured role. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise: taking the mushroom redefines “intrusion” as “bridge,” with a legible before/after. Orientation is clean and continuous, single scene, single POV. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but it lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain, lantern, scrawls, and reflection build to a conceptual repricing where “lucid contradictions” shift from puzzle to guide. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the single scene coheres. Closure lands as a quiet stance crystallization, though the cost signal is light. Structural turns are soft but legible (midnight and the decision to write).

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: looping calls and a recurring melody build pressure to a decisive reconfiguration—he uses the disc to connect and then dials the long‑avoided number. Orientation is clean from the start, and each call tightens the pattern toward the final act. Cost is implied (abandoning estrangement for risk), if not dramatized in consequence. The closure lands on the page with a credible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The scene anchors cleanly and accrues toward a Charged Poise ending where Elara chooses to document and participate in the covenant. Causality is soft but coherent (locket → investigation → Mara’s account → renewed purpose). Cost at closure is conceptual rather than felt, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: atmosphere and motifs accrue toward a conceptual repricing at the clock. Causality holds (rumors → station → clock → transformation → realization) with one decisive turn when she touches the device. Closure arrives via a reweighted premise (reciprocity as answer), though the price is soft. Orientation is clean and scope-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the melody and ring build toward the stillpoint, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early, and the closure is on‑page with the compass’s reweighted function and the needle’s final stillness. Cost is more conceptual than felt, but legible (ending an outward search to accept an inward compass). Structure is a single coherent pursuit with one meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/why), and the structure is clean: approach → entry → temporal kaleidoscope → writing → stabilization → return. The causal chain is intact (the anomaly prompts entry; intent activates the pen; writing adjusts relationships; anomaly settles). Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and light conceptual cost. The price is subdued, but the arc is coherent under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The camera hum/click/glow sequence forms a decisive intensification, culminating in a conceptual repricing: silence becomes legible music and “alive with meaning.” Cost is present—solitude persists and her energy is spent—yielding an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid in the final image. Orientation is clear early (harbor, moonlight, who/what), and the single scene holds coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clean causal chain: tapestry → mural → sketches → door → scroll. Orientation is stable and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the promise is reframed as living testament. Cost is light and largely conceptual; no real obstruction tests the drive. Still, the because/therefore sequencing holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the symphonic garden and water hum accrue to a Resonant Reconfiguration where memories shift from curse to bridge. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and the single scene tightens through the ripples and hum synchronized with her drumming. Closure lands on the page with a before/after—victim to creator—though the cost is mostly emotional rather than materially foreclosing options. The causal line is soft but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid drive with causal beats inside a situational crucible: coin → map → key → wall → Mira’s lock → turn of the key. Closure lands via a Decisive Change (opening the passage) paired with a conceptual repricing (whispers > shouts). Cost is implied (risk, treacherous environment, potential relational stakes) rather than concretely paid on the page, keeping it shy of higher bands. Orientation and continuity are clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the patterned shutter work builds to a constellation image that reweights the scene. Orientation is clear early (dock, rain, twilight, two characters), and the single scene stays coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (hope flicker via mirror), though cost is gentle rather than sharp. Beat sequence tightens from approach → listening → confession → completed pattern → release.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens is clear: preparation → grotto attunement → display night. Closure lands as a quiet tableau (Charged Poise), but cost is faint—no option foreclosed or price paid on the page. Causality holds, yet turns feel pre-declared rather than earned under pressure. Orientation is clean and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: find scrimshaw → dream → whale call → island → barrier → detachment → change. Closure lands on the page with cost (she lets the key sink and loses it to gain access). Orientation is crisp from the opening and the single POV never wavers. Stakes remain intimate but coherent through to ending.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressures accrete via turbines, bouquet, and ritual until a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure—placing the heart by the bouquet with a hardened resolve. Orientation is clean and scope-controlled, single scene with one reflective inset that feeds the ending. Cost is legible conceptually (living under the mandate; brother’s loss) though not tested by an on‑page confrontation. The final image clearly reweights what came before.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: hum intensifies, ice cracks, chorus swells, then a cadence shift into quiet with a reweighted understanding. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: “the sacred was not in the walls we build, but in the spaces we dare to cross.” Cost is present as self-boundary dissolution, though it’s more conceptual than visceral. Orientation is clean and the single-scene arc is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of whispers, furnace hum, and the reed’s vibration intensifies toward a cadence shift when the music swells and Elias’s understanding lands. Orientation is clean early. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act, and it’s on the page via the painting and the glassblower’s confirmation. The cost is conceptual (renouncing the chase for literal color) rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the lens triggers a sequence of sonic shards that culminate in a reconfiguration of purpose. Orientation is clean early (lab, post‑grid stabilization, object in hand). Closure lands as a resonant repricing (balance between progress and humanity), but the cost is modest (“exhausted but enlightened”) and stakes remain largely conceptual. Causality is coherent but light; beats connect more by theme than necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: patterning of stillness → shimmer → illumination → tattoo → renewed purpose. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (she accepts the tattoo) and a felt emotional price. The causality depends on magical selection by the curtains but is coherent within the world’s taught rules. Stakes are contained and resolved without mechanical over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.9)
    Orientation and causality are clean: Mira’s confiding prompts the investigation, which produces the “engineered” realization. The closure lands as a conceptual repricing (Tower as blueprint; hope reweighted by control) rather than a decisive act. The cost is primarily conceptual and emotional (lost wealth, overnight labor), light but legible. Hybrid lens holds, with causal beats carrying an accumulative tone to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: perception density builds to a cadence shift (recognizing absence, speaking the purify/remember word) and a Conceptual Repricing (the pagoda as mirror). Orientation is clear early, and the closure lands on the page. Cost is present but conceptual, limiting maximal impact. Structure remains single-scene coherent with one meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates from observation → archival search → encounter → transformation, culminating in an on‑page reconfiguration (shadow becomes sculpture). Orientation is clean early, and the causal links—obsession to the forgotten vial to direct act—are legible. The cost is conceptual but present (sorrow, letting go of the stone/world below), and the closure image is clear and reweights the premise. A slightly frictionless path keeps it just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres as a single reflective scene culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is solid early, and the closure image (placing the tail tip on the shelf) makes the before/after legible. Cost is primarily internal and conceptual, present but soft. The scene’s progression is steady if modest, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Causal. Because/therefore linkages hold (rings → tunnel inference → descent → double hourglass reunion), and closure lands on the page when the sands merge. Orientation is clean from the first lines; single POV and one scene progression are coherent. The cost at closure is largely conceptual/affective, not dramatized as a trade-off, keeping it out of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is crisp (vintage movie palace, projection booth, single night), and the pattern of images (still frames/letters) builds to a conceptual turn. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: she reconfigures her stance by taking the film with a plan to release its love, with a subtle emotional price. The cost could be sharpened on the page (e.g., a foreclosed alternative), but the cadence shift is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates via density: aurora intensifies, symbols shift, the astrolabe trembles, culminating in a Charged Poise—“only the beginning” with readiness. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). Closure lands as a poised commitment rather than a decisive act, and the cost is mostly conceptual (patience, uncertain duration). Because cost is soft and no option is dramatically foreclosed on the page, it stops shy of high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Causal chain is clean: dune → charm → archive → clock revives sparks → redefined role. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph. Closure is on‑page (Decisive Change plus a small Conceptual Repricing), but cost is underarticulated, keeping the turn low‑pressure. One transition (surface → archive) is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, beats build from wandering/chafing to a cadence shift at the dormant machine and activation. Orientation is solid; cause‑effect is soft but coherent, with the gear and hum escalating toward the final image. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing: the rainforest reinterpreted as mind with a new stance as “guardian.” Cost is implied (foreclosing aimless wandering) but not strongly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: twilight passage → ridgeway traverse → charged reprise with the punch. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (the star now on her being) with a quiet felt cost (leaving the former life, vigil ending). Orientation is strong from the start, and the two‑shard flow stays continuous. The cost could read sharper on the page, but the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural, with causal steps (stain → door → bolt → vision → decision). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: he redefines the fortress’s silence and his role, then acts (plays). The causal chain is clean and contained within one window, though the cost is more intellectual than visceral. Orientation is crisp from the opening and supports the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hybrid causal/accumulative structure holds: the escalating placements (ledger, diary, speech) lead to the confrontation, and the pellet exchange lands a decisive unmasking. Orientation is clean from the outset; set‑ups pay off. The cost is mostly conceptual rather than felt—Elara sacrifices little, though the pretender’s collapse provides closure. The chain is mostly told rather than dramatized in scene, muting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is clean: station routine → intrusive object → research/assembly → realization. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds through pattern and returns to the charged object for a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Cost is conceptual—recognition of human culpability and overlooked warnings—more felt than dramatized but legible. Orientation is clear and single‑POV continuity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the hum’s intensification and the opera‑glasses vision steadily reweight the dominant stake and culminate in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis resolve. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; one scene, single POV, and a coherent tightening through the stone circle’s activation. Closure is on‑page—she chooses a path forward with a redefined approach. The price is implied rather than sharply dramatized, keeping it just shy of top‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clean causal chain: decoding the kite → confrontation → ritual alignment → unsealing → decision to act. Closure lands on the page with the embryo cracked and glowing and Mara’s new stance, but the price is light; the guard’s retreat reads convenient. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph. The lens reads chiefly causal with a slight lyric accumulation in the eruption/vision beat.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is immediate (arboretum on a cliff; Zara; present goal), and the structure holds to a single, coherent scene with one transition to the bench. Under a Situational lens, the wind‑snatched photo creates external pressure that forces a stance crystallization. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (she re-enters as artist), with a modest but legible cost. The causal chain is clean if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues via environment and patterning, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration as she accepts darkness as the origin of light. Closure is on‑page: she ascends with a new stance and leaves the broken box—a before/after legible with cost (abandoning control/perfection, ache persists). Orientation is crisp from the outset; causality flows from handling The Tower to rearranging the cards to the ascent. The cost is conceptual but felt; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: drone leads → confrontation with the ink‑keeper → the vial’s vision → repriced understanding. Closure is a conceptual repricing with felt cost that lands on the page and coheres under a causal lens. Orientation is strong early; single scene unity holds. The arc is linear with limited complication, but it tightens meaningfully at the vision beat.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: letter → descent → terminal access → copy under a live clock → exit with cost. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: she’s crossed a line and must bear consequences, reweighting the premise on the final snowy image. The cost is felt but largely prospective; no external disruption tests her mid‑task, modestly reducing impact. Orientation is solid early and never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean, the beats cohere, and the piece holds a Situational drive: warning arrives, choice is made, haven is fortified, and the final stance is crystallized. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: Elara stands with the sheathed blade and keeps the farm. The cost is present but mild, with threats mostly off‑page and no concrete test on the scene. Still, the because/therefore progression remains legible and tight for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds (silence/sound, zigzag, rail spike) to a resonant reconfiguration where the garden is retuned and the echo is tethered. Orientation is clean and single-scene coherence is strong. The decisive shift arrives when the goddess appears and charges the spike’s function; cost is implied (presence traded for echo) but not deeply pressed. Escalation is graceful, not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.9)
    Drive lens: Causal. The call prompts investigation → discovery → meeting → night return → defiant recalibration and resolve; orientation is clean. Closure lands as Charged Poise via the symbolic act and decision to publish, but the cost is mostly implied (vanished journalist) and not felt on the page. Heavy summarization compresses turns that would otherwise tighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: lab ambience, firmware pressure, and letters build toward a resonant hush. Closure lands via a felt reconfiguration—the machines fall silent as she accepts listening over silencing. The cost is emotional but legible; causality is soft but coherent. Minor convenience in the firmware’s quick softening keeps it below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure intensifies via the hush and pattern density until the mandala dissolves. Closure arrives as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing—she accepts the ongoing unease and the refusal of single meaning. Cost is legible on the page (“had not found a single, clear meaning”) and reweights the premise. Orientation is clean and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the story coheres: present action (reworking the mosaic) gathers reflective charge (memories of mercies during the fire) and culminates in a reweighted final image. Orientation is crisp from the opening (plaza, minaret silhouette, ash). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—mercy reframed from aberration to foundation—though the cost is implied rather than pressed. The because/therefore chain is soft, but pattern density and cadence shift do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene builds coherently from summoning to transfer to environmental reconfiguration, landing in a resonant reconfiguration as dawn arrives. Orientation is firm early (hedge maze/orchard at night; Mara’s status and goal). Closure occurs on the page with a legible before/after (fracture mending; the other self leaves with renewed agency), though the cost is soft. The pattern (coin→summon→echo→shift) holds without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the scene coheres: setup → night of making → dawn image that reweights the stake. Closure lands as a charged poise: she accepts an ongoing, costly path (“far from over”) and secures a fragile commitment (willowglass hope). Orientation is clean early; causality is soft but consistent, with the recall prompting the creative response. The cost is modestly felt rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: patterns → floating fossil → hidden chamber → reweighted meaning. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (maps as bridge; she becomes the “voice of the unknown”), but the cost remains abstract. The weeks‑long summary is clean and does not break causality. Beats link coherently, with the fossil functioning as the throughline motive force.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: detail density builds to the bone‑button reveal and the echo’s chorus, culminating in a conceptual repricing where the echo becomes guidance, not warning. Orientation is solid early, and the throughline remains single‑scene and coherent. Cost is light but present as ongoing burden/mission; escalation arrives chiefly via pattern intensification rather than causal obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats cohere: trek → codes → pillbox/letter → dawn path. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise): she pockets the pill and proceeds with a reweighted stance. Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks. The cost at closure is more inferred than felt, keeping it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog, ticking gutters, and the needle accrue to a conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is early and clean; single scene coherence is strong. Closure lands as CR (a reweighting of reality’s layers) with a modest time constraint cost. The sequence (figure arrives → reframe of the needle → articulated insight → fog lifts/gutters stop) is coherent if low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.5)
    Orientation is crisp from the start; the accumulative/textural lens is taught early (light, thrum, patterns) and held. Closure functions as a Conceptual Repricing: the oasis as a kindness beacon reweights prior images and reorients Elara’s aim. However, the rebuild and communal turn are summarized, softening on‑page cost. A single, concrete consequence at the end would tighten the cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: harbor hush → approach → recognition → exchange. Orientation is clean early; single scene, single POV. Closure is a quiet Charged Poise in the shared object/lantern moment; the cost is mostly emotional and underplayed. Causality is simple but intact, with no late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under a hybrid lens (causal spine with textural accrual), the beats link cleanly: hum → door → orb → integration → return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she embodies the library’s legacy and forecloses her hermitage. However, pressure is low and cost faint; the “tests” posed by the living library never tighten options materially. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the set‑ups (sundial, hum) pay off without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene tightens from pond to installation to activation, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: connection becomes literalized. Orientation is clean and the causal action (placing the spiral) earns the turn. The cost—relinquishing the talisman—lands on the page. Slight convenience in the groove fitting perfectly softens rigor but doesn’t break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a causal lens, the beats link cleanly: mysterious signal → decision to counter subtly → successful disruption → external consequences and renewed stance. Orientation is crisp early; tools and constraints are established before use. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: she regains local control while accepting ongoing conflict and social cost. The cost is on the page (sponsor loss, protests), though the climax’s danger feels relatively risk‑light.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a primarily causal lens: compass points → passage squeeze → shard retrieval → chamber contracts → she chooses to embrace mutiny → space reconfigures. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration with emotional cost (fear faced) and changed options (expanded chamber, path forward). Orientation is clean early and the throughline holds. Cost skews internal; world stakes remain abstract but don’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-scene accumulative structure holds: quarry arrival → figure appears with second ribbon → she arms, chooses to sketch → dawn departure with a conceptual reweighting. Orientation is clear early and the closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing with the price of foregoing answers now. Causal linkage is light by design but consistent; the figure’s silent offer tightens options credibly. Cost is soft yet legible in the unsolved case she accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: decipher stanzas → identify map nexus → deploy copper nail → summon exiles → posed choice → world reconfigures. Orientation is strong from the opening and props track. Closure occurs on the page (Decisive Change), but the price of “restore or protect” is implied rather than dramatized, reducing impact. No key setups are dropped, though the choice’s outcome is told as “chosen wisely” instead of shown.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a closure in Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—discovering pixelated amnesty as a place and reweighting the premise. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and the throughline from flake to clearing is coherent. The because/therefore is soft but present in the noticing → aligning → unwrapping sequence. Cost at closure is modest, limiting impact despite a clear cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as one scene with a gentle deepening: exploration → journal discovery → encounter → closing realization. Closure is a quiet RR/CR: he reframes the train and money as cautionary emblems and chooses to leave at peace; the cost is conceptual (letting go of inherited illusions) but present. Orientation is clean; causality is light but intact under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as a single nocturnal arc where density and patterning (variable stars → constellation → telegram’s meaning) build toward a conceptual repricing at dawn. Closure arrives with a resonant insight and reweighted premise, but the on‑page cost is soft. Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks, though turns are gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a causal lens, the chain is clean: failed magic → volatile vortex → Eira enters with seed → surrender/unbend → confession → seed transforms chaos → lake heals. Orientation is crisp early, and the closure is on the page with a felt emotional price. The decisive turn—spoken failure—credibly triggers the transformation. Resolution skews neat with minimal resistance after the admission, keeping cost modest.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under a primarily Causal lens, the because/therefore chain holds: clipping → maze entry → hidden path → pedestal → restoration. Closure is an on‑page Decisive Change (covenant mended), but the cost at the ending is light and mostly retrospective (old scars, treacherous path asserted). The path through the maze offers minimal resistance beyond thorns and guided whispers, so tightening is modest. Orientation is clean and single‑scene scope fits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative texture and a causal spine: warning → deeper chamber → confrontation → renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with on‑page cost (she forecloses freedom to remain bound). The cost is legible but not maximally pressed; the “debt due” threat resolves without a tangible squeeze beyond the realization. Orientation is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through patterning toward a resonant reconfiguration when he reframes the cloth as bridge and claims a new stance. Orientation is clean early (quarry trailer, auction failure) and the scene holds to a single window. Closure (RR/CR) appears on the page with the pocketing gesture and choice to “wrest” the story back. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clean causal flow: observation → analogical inference → planting → visions → nurturing → fruit/realization. Single POV and clear anchors throughout. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing—transition reframed as connection—with the fruit pluck as a decisive image. The cost is implied rather than concretely felt, which limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative build is coherent: puzzle → ritual → pattern deciphering → stabilization with reweighted outcome. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing—identities stabilize in altered forms—and the cost (loss of originals) is on page, though lightly felt. The drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds; escalation is gentle but consistent. No orientation debt or causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Structure is clean: find pearl → pull to chamber → crown activation → renewed purpose. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a causal pivot at the insertion of the pearl. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration, but the cost is soft, mostly a conceptual acceptance of duty without concrete loss. Orientation is clear early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; the pattern of maps, graffiti, and the bellows densifies to a Charged Poise closure as she traces her self-made map. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the final turn (the man’s nudge → her decision to trace her own map) reads as a felt reconfiguration. Cost is legible: choosing clarity amid “raw ache” and the foreclosed anesthesia of medication. Escalation is modest but coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: mist → archway symbols → hum/cipher → desk → backward watch → writing → departure. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she redefines herself as conduit and exits with the living document. Causality is soft but coherent (the watch’s code guides her path); no orientation debt. The cost is modest (leaving under a closing window), not fully stress‑tested.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    Coherent causal progression: scouts near → divination image → balcony choice → played violin → agents neutralized → price paid. The ending lands as a Decisive Change with on‑page cost under a Hybrid drive (lyric build with causal closure). Orientation is firm by the first paragraph (who/where/when, stakes). The single scene tightens once and resolves without soft reset or handwave.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.3)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing closure. The sequence—chip activation → awakening → proposition about stillness → Elara’s acceptance—holds causally and rhythmically. Closure lands on the page with a felt renunciation and a reweighted final image (emerald steady, traveler gone). The cost is present but soft; external stakes (world unraveling) remain largely atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under a primarily Causal lens, the chain is clean: dropped hairpin → map → shell → lake → visions → repriced understanding → return. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: contentment reframed as practice with the hairpin charged in the final image. The cost—facing memories of mistake and forgiveness—is implied rather than dramatized at high pressure, softening the final turn. Orientation is strong and the two‑shard structure is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lighthouse → chimes → letter → shard reprise. Orientation is clean early and the closure arrives as a conceptual reweighting (acceptance of uncertainty). Causality is soft but coherent (he “deciphers” chimes, then drafts the letter accordingly). Cost is muted, but the ending image is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene builds from first stone to second stone to spoken revelation, achieving a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the outset; the single stake (reveal or continue to hide) sustains. Closure lands on the page with her speech, with a legible before/after. The cost is present but soft, as immediate consequences are deferred.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing closure (“the arrowhead…a compass” leading to inward stillness). Orientation is strong early (Kael, canyon, bone towers), and the flock’s arrival provides the single meaningful tightening. Closure lands conceptually but the cost is soft, registered as a stance shift rather than a pressured sacrifice. The pattern holds coherently through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.3)
    Causal chain is clean: quest → trap → tool‑enabled attempt → touch → revaluation. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (the keystone’s “power” reframed) rather than a decisive external change, and it reads on the page. The cost at closure is modest, thinning the impact. Orientation is solid, the single scene holds, and the drive lens remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: lanterns → blue light → hatch → library → book → vow is coherent and legible. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—he reframes the lanterns as vows and commits, with a new before/after. Cost is present but modest, leaning more toward promise than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats accrete (apparatus on → essence formed → coin immersion) but the path is largely frictionless. Closure reads as a conceptual repricing—recasting contraction as beginning—but the cost is minimal and no option is visibly foreclosed. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherence holds. The prophecy’s “roadmap” payoff lands, yet the lack of a pressure point dulls the decisive shift.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ritual intensifies via light, whispers, and embodiment, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where “sacrifice” is repriced and her path reopens. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph; single scene coherence is excellent. Closure lands on the page with cost—the acceptance of grief into duty and the decision to carry the names onward. The causal chain is simple but coherent: page → runes → crystallization → naming → repriced purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the patterned “dripping rates” build toward a cadence shift when the bell is hung and the world briefly pauses before waves return. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration with a tangible effect (waves) and conceptual price (repair remains imperfect). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph and the single scene coheres. The cost is felt but not searing, keeping it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds from the label to the photo trail to the bottle to the exhibit, culminating in an RR/CR closure where the town’s memory is reweighted and made communal. Orientation is clean and the throughline holds, but the cost at closure is mild and largely conceptual, limiting impact. Still, the final image (chime ringing, label framed) lands coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: starlings → grove → crystal → flame/altar → illumination forms a coherent build. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (she reframes the crystal as a bridge), but the cost is soft and mostly conceptual. Orientation is clean; scene scope is appropriate. The final cadence lands, though consequence remains largely inward and low‑stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues through pattern-seeking and resolves in the dawn image once the pattern is discerned. Closure lands via a cadence shift (mission complete), but the cost at the ending is minimal and largely conceptual (“the burden remains”). Orientation is adequate and single-POV consistent. The sequence is coherent, yet the decisive turn feels soft because obstacles never bite.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a primarily causal lens, the scene advances cleanly: Lira frames the choice, Kael engages, an intensification occurs, and a decisive act reconfigures the self. Closure lands on the page with the jar’s shatter and integration, though the cost is more implied than dramatized. Orientation is crisp and consistent; no lens ambiguity. The arc’s simplicity fits the length and avoids loose ends.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    The causal chain is coherent: seed arrives → he plants → it becomes a key → study attempts → drop into brook → door opens → chamber revealed. The closure is on-page with a decisive change of access and purpose, though the price paid is conceptual rather than felt. Orientation is clean from the opening. One scene with a small time-lapse works structurally without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and sustained: song + machine builds density to a crescendo, then a charged exhale. Closure lands on the page with cost: exhaustion and the faint, returning laughter. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established by the first paragraph), and the final image reweights prior action. The structure is simple but cohesive, with no causality breaks under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Situational lens holds: pendant appears → keeper articulates cost → Elara chooses to wait, preserving the library at the expense of relief. Closure is Earned Stasis/Charged Poise; the path home is foreclosed for now with felt cost. Orientation is clean early, and the single scene keeps coherent pressure. The keeper’s timely arrival is convenient but functions as the necessary pressure engine rather than a shortcut.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a Causal lens, the sequence reads cleanly: idea emerges → crozier repurposed → chant/action → sapling → redefined purpose. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and decisive reorientation of her life’s drive, with the crozier sacrificed and the old goal foreclosed. Cost is present but more conceptual than visceral, limiting peak impact. Orientation is clear early, and the single-scene structure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern‑building through sound/silence culminates in a cadence shift as the city “comes alive.” Closure is a conceptual repricing—silence reframed and the city reborn—achieved on the page. The visible cost is light (letting go of assumptions rather than a consequence that bites), but the turn when the shard dims provides a functional tightening. Orientation is clean from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Causal. Setups (hourglass, patterns, rift) pay off cleanly; stepping into the rift and using the hourglass to rewind produces a decisive change with on‑page cost (physical weakening, altered self). Orientation is strong and the single transition is legible. The resolution edges toward convenience but stays earned by prior patterning.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orientation is immediate (who/where/goal) and the accumulative/textural lens holds: weaving intensifies illusions → warning → contact → dissolution → charged exit. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she leaves changed, with a tangled tool and a repriced understanding of connection’s cost. The cost is legible in the tangled thread, the dissolving gallery, and the admitted risk of self-unraveling. Causality remains lyric but coherent and builds to a clean final image.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative drive is coherent: Council pressure → Elara’s counter‑move → community uptake → charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—towers remain, practice evolves, anchor object charges the ending. However, key turns (Council reversal, institutional stakes) resolve off‑stage, softening felt cost. Orientation is clean and pattern consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the beeps and thickening mist guide a steady approach toward the photograph and a quiet, resolute ending. Orientation is strong and the throughline (find and protect the last photograph) holds. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she retrieves the object and accepts the duty, but the cost is mostly conceptual, kept soft. The structure is coherent and tidy, if low on consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: promise → descent → vault breach → fleck trigger → liminal revelation → repriced return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she keeps the codex and reframes control as respect for the unseen, with the felt price of enduring claustrophobia and the uncanny transit. Orientation is crisp early, and the vault-to-liminal shift teaches its rule on contact. The physical path back is a touch easy, but the conceptual turn holds.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    The piece reads as a Hybrid with accumulative texture and causal turns: perception of the ink data → defragmentation → ghost voice → reconfiguration of self. Orientation is crisp early (observatory, night, cold), and the single scene holds focus. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual repricing of the death certificate’s authority. The cost signal is subtle (nightlong effort, tears, relinquishing the certificate’s hold) but on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal chain: canyon → pattern heard → humming with the diamond → language coalesces → curse drains her → shatter and aftermath. Orientation is immediate and stable; single scene flow holds. Closure lands with on‑page cost (diamond destroyed, her depletion) and a decisive change (language etched into the canyon). The path is linear with limited complication, but coherent under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid lens (causal turns within a textural pressure): arrowhead found → phone command → garden metamorphoses → alcove vision → internal shift. Orientation is clear early; the sequence holds coherently. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/soft conceptual repricing: she relinquishes control and carries the harmony. The price (letting go of bitterness/control) is felt but light.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid lens with causal throughline: shell as signal → synchronized heartbeat → roots counter the statues → orchard restores. Orientation is clean early, and the closing decisive change lands on the page. Cost is present but light; the risk feels real yet largely unscathed. Still, the because/therefore chain is coherent and the scene resolves its dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal chain is clean: prepare Luma → surveillance pressure → chase/crevice → drop → opening bottle reconfigures the border. Orientation is anchored early; the lens reads Causal with a clear on-page Decisive Change. The cost is modest (temporary respite, personal solitude), making the close satisfying but not searing. No major teleports or rule breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; the piece layers motifs (bells, misting hush, halo) toward a cadence shift when he sings and the fragment ignites. Closure lands with a Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration (carousel restored; purpose regained). The causal thread is coherent (find fragment → follow bells → oasis → sing → restoration), but the on‑page cost at closure is light. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and scope fits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the patterned rearrangements escalate coherently to doorway → passage → repricing (guardianhood). Causality is magical but taught early and paid off by the three‑step geometry sequence, with the “hardest” children’s section as the tightening beat. Closure is on the page with cost (the fading place and her acceptance). Minor softness: external resistance is minimal, so pressure relies on design cadence rather than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: pressure builds through pulsing light, layered image-making, and a cadence shift into revelation. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early), single POV, one continuous morning arc. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing; the cost is the relinquishment of the old pursuit in favor of a new creative stance, though it’s subtly rendered. Causality is less “therefore” than patterned intensification, consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lens: Causal. The sequence is clean—star hint → crafted key → lock phrase → orb → release—and orientation is crisp from the outset. Closure arrives with the orb shattering and the world “felt different,” but cost is light and largely conceptual. The decisive act is on the page, yet the afterprice is not dramatized, trimming impact.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The fairy ring → missing cap → locket → note → constellation alignment accrues toward a Charged Poise ending. Closure lands as a reconfiguration of meaning rather than a decisive act; the cost is mostly conceptual/emotional. A slightly clearer price at the end would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is steady: tea‑leaf geometry → annotation → shadow’s shimmer and reconfiguration. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and held. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror reads “portal not prison,” with an earned cadence shift at twilight. Cost is more felt than explicit, keeping it strong but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure occurs as a resonant reconfiguration when the seed sprouts and the orchard reanimates, reweighting the premise toward guardianship. Yet the cost is soft—no credible price or foreclosed path is legible at the ending, weakening the cadence shift. Orientation is clean and the one‑scene arc holds, but the turn feels inevitable rather than earned against friction.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the silence and whispers densify toward a cadence shift when the last knot breaks. Closure is an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration: the net slackens, whispers fade, and Elara’s purpose is reweighted with a felt cost. Orientation is clean from the outset; the single-scene structure holds. Minor softness comes from a somewhat declarative epiphany rather than a purely image-led turn.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under a causal lens: footage → misalignment → excavation → discovery lands cleanly with a quiet RR closure (reframing the henge and chapel). Orientation is clear early, and the single-scene window holds despite time compression. The cost at closure is light, mostly conceptual reverence and elapsed labor rather than a tightened price. Still, the final image reweights prior material in a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate; the throughline moves from object to map to letter to conceptual repricing at the end. Closure lands as a conceptual reweighting—she adopts “letting the snow fall where it may”—with a gentle but legible price (relinquishing preservation). Escalation is modest but coherent, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: storm window → encoding → manifestation → release. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the bolt plate setup pays off cleanly at closure. The cost is soft but legible (release/solitude and foreclosed connection) with a resonant reconfiguration. A tighter before/after price would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)
    Structure is coherent and accumulative: each floor yields a clue leading to key + diary → realization at the observatory. The closure is a conceptual repricing that lands on the page, though the cost is modest. Because/therefore linkage holds (relics → book → clocks → portrait/key → decryption). The elevator‑as‑clock scaffolds momentum effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is crisp from the first lines; the accumulative/textural lens holds as images intensify toward the leap. Closure lands via conceptual repricing: the sky redefined as memorial and Elara’s role reframed. The leap is the concrete cost, though the post‑leap reset (string replaced) softens consequence. Causality is clean within the chosen mode, with one meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hybrid lens (causal spine with textural accumulation) holds: coin → safe → book → decoding → collapse → reconfigured stillness. Orientation is clear early; scene stays within a single window. Closure arrives via a resonant reconfiguration when the stillness is reinterpreted after she completes the task and escapes the shuddering building. The cost is light on the page; external collapse cues urgency but doesn’t extract a tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain: patterns → beam → hidden hatch → chamber → map → resolve to act. Orientation is crisp from the outset (airship, navigation chamber, starlings) with a single scene plus one descent shard. Closure arrives as a decisive discovery plus reconfiguration (the board as compass), though on‑page cost is light. The lens reads primarily causal, held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine: prophecies → door → hall of mirrors → gear → repriced understanding → return. Orientation and stakes are clear early; the mirrors provide the primary tightening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive change, with light cost. No major causality gaps, though the exit from the vortex feels frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain is clean: chalk message → team gathers → restore bell → ring → nebula returns; closure lands with Elara’s departure as cost. Structure holds in a single coherent arc, and orientation is solid early. However, problems solve too smoothly with few narrowing turns, softening the decisive feel of the climax. The drive lens reads primarily causal but under-pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure coheres: heavy hush → stuttering beam → doubt → recommitment → visible mending. Closure lands on the page with cost (blood, exhaustion, acceptance of impermanence) and a charged final image (beam steadies, puppet smiles). Orientation is clean from the opening; the single scene holds. The tightening is gentle rather than sharp, but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a Causal lens, the nut’s rule leads to map assembly, to rescue, to planting and a bud—a coherent because/therefore chain. Closure arrives via a small but decisive change (the bud) paired with a reconfigured role. The cost is present as risk and ongoing obligation but is light. Orientation is clean from the opening and the single transition is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: observation → reflection → reweighting culminates in a clear RR as she chooses to reframe separation as connection and climb out. Orientation is clean early; single scene coherence is tight. Cost is soft but legible (leaving refuge, accepting uncertainty) and carried into the final image with the chrysalis. The turn hinges on an on‑page, scene‑born insight rather than a summary patch.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the ascent → incision → uncorking → reconfiguration track coherently and culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration (library and patrons shift; the vial is emptied). Orientation is clean early; cause/therefore links read tight enough for the mode. The on‑page cost (sacrificing the vial) lands, though the pressure around the incision could push harder.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid with Accumulative/Textural dominant: pressure builds via successive encounters (etchings → central shard) and resolves with a Resonant Reconfiguration as the pavilion dissolves. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early), and the method (tidal pools) motivates access. The closure costs are on-page (remorse flooding, tears), though the solution unfolds smoothly with minimal resistance. The because/therefore chain is adequate if understated.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The song gathers force, gears reawaken, townsfolk join, clock chimes, and communal testimony lands the closure—a resonant reconfiguration of the town’s stance. Orientation is clean and the end image (dawn, clock now symbol of reconciliation) delivers closure, though cost is gentle. No causality breaks; the pattern taught early pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive is steady: mirror → modification → shimmer → vow lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the opening, and set‑ups (mirror, synaptic plasticity, risk) pay off in the portal image. Cost registers conceptually (mind‑risk, renunciation of old career) but is not felt acutely on the page. The because/therefore links are soft but coherent for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Causal. The because/therefore chain is clean—waits for inversion, enters, inversion reveals passages, aligns doodle, unlocks seed—culminating in an on‑page Decisive Change. Orientation is strong and the single‑scene window holds. Cost is light; the acquisition occurs without a meaningful sacrifice beyond a stated burden of responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single scene, clear anchors (grove, evening to dawn), and a clean accumulative/textural drive. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the sculpture’s music reweights the world’s “silence,” with the hedgehog’s curl bookending the arc. Cost is mostly stamina and concentration, conceptually scaled but felt. Causality is gentle but coherent—no breaks or teleporting elements.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the nexus’s hum, piece movements, and ritualized play build toward a reconfiguration where toppling the king signals a new stance. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the closure lands on the page. Cost is present conceptually (letting go of a self-conception; sacrificing the knight as emblem) but remains somewhat abstract. The single-scene arc holds without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single‑scene accumulative arc is coherent: attune → unlock → read → reprice silence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (realization about empathy and identity) but the cost is soft and the unlock occurs without a true obstacle. Orientation is crisp from the outset. The causal chain is intact though lightly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: planted seed → tide‑charged tending → scent release → realization. Orientation is clean early; scope stays within one POV and scene with light reflection. Closure is a conceptual repricing: serenity reframed as harmony of motion and rest, with a modest on‑page cost. The linkage is sound, though pressure remains low‑amplitude.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    Drive lens: Causal. Because → therefore linkages run cleanly (tip pulses → map → grove → insertion → restoration), and closure is an on‑page decisive change. However, the resolution is nearly frictionless; the live constraints (inversion, failing instruments) never force a trade‑off, and the cost of success is not legible at the end. Orientation is strong from the outset, with a single POV and scene continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal spine: survey → anomaly → aircraft reveal → heading clue → synthesis and repricing of the disaster’s meaning. Orientation is strong from the opening and remains consistent within a single scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing, with the patch and the town’s silence charging the cost. The deductions are explained rather than dramatized in parts, slightly softening the on‑page pressure at the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds toward a cadence shift when the hush manifests and reweights silence as possibility (a conceptual repricing). Orientation and throughline are clear, and the timing constraint provides a neat hinge. The closure lands on the page but the cost is soft, more conceptual than felt. The arc resolves without a setback or narrowing that would heighten consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal lens holds: map → markers → alcove → flute → play → crossing. Orientation is clean and the single transition is legible. Closure lands via a decisive shift of world and a reconfigured purpose (Charged Poise), though the on‑page price is light. No broken set‑ups, but the climax resolves without testing consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure builds from ritual work to deliberate disorientation to contact to overwhelm, landing in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is on the page with cost (identity edges soften, near‑loss of self, halo dims). Orientation is clean from the start; single scene coherence is strong. The turn is quiet but decisive under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hybrid lens leaning Causal: travel → intensifying hum → scholar’s reveal → reweighted identity. Orientation is clear early, and the structure stays within one contiguous scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing (she leaves sharing a heartbeat with the relic), though the cost is more implied than felt. No plot breaks, but the decisive turn is explained rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats cohere: preparation → silence → resonance → grief → repricing of her aim. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with cost; she shifts from proof-seeking to witness of stories, and the final image (heavier air, mist gone) seals the after. Orientation is clean from the first lines; single scene, one stake. Slightly gentle pressure keeps it below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: puzzle → phenomena → final piece → bridge, a coherent buildup that culminates in a Charged Poise/RR when she steps onto the bridge. Orientation is solid early; the orchard/bamboo frame and single POV stay clean. The rummage-sale box is a convenient intrusion but operates within the fable logic and pays off causally. Cost is on-page (leaving home, committing to the bridge) and legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    Causal lens holds: stranger’s offer → choice → descent → weaving → planetary renewal and Eli’s altered state. Orientation is clean, and the closure lands with a decisive change plus a resonant reconfiguration. The price—his “awakening”—is legible, though the nature of that loss is abstract and under-detailed. Middle beats compress the treacherous journey, softening felt cost but not breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clean causal chain: shard → transport → encounter → instruction → combination → realization. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (guardianhood reweights prior material), though the cost is mostly stated rather than dramatized. Orientation is early and solid; the lens reads Hybrid with causal beats leading to a conceptual end. Expository convenience (the woman explains everything) softens the earned feel of the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain: lamp failure → sea‑glass message → stone code → hidden letters → reframed duty. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (acceptance of guardianship) rather than a decisive act, but it’s legible. The cost is mainly conceptual (burden of duty) and underplayed. Orientation and scene unity are strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid drive with causal dominance at the end: the beam slips control → Herald tests agency → gateway opens and beings emerge. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing (their routine was a bridge) plus a decisive act (steering), but the cost is soft—no sacrifice or loss beyond effort and risk. Orientation is clean from the opening. The ending reconfigures meaning, yet the price paid remains largely conceptual, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orientation is clear early; the piece holds a single scene and POV. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the wing, light, and “threads” build to a Charged Poise closure where Kael recommits to illuminating others. Closure lands, but the cost is soft and largely conceptual. The because/therefore chain is thin, relying more on mood than turns.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: moonlight, fragments, and the sextant’s repair cohere toward a Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is clean, and the beats sequence plausibly (tool → deconstruction → fragments → healing → reconfiguration). Cost is felt only in conceptual terms (“weight of… quantified sorrow”), with no sacrifice or foreclosed option on the page. The closure lands but softly.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under a primarily causal lens, the beats link cleanly: mica → mirror world → roots/stream threads → elusive final thread → felt lullaby → return and rekindling. Orientation is crisp from the outset and the single transition is legible. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (dawn returns, communities reknit), though the cost is modest. No major teleports or causality slips; pressure is linear but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the story advances from discovery → guidance → blank-book reveal → stance shift, with a clean closure image. Orientation is solid and the cause-and-effect of beats is coherent, though the tightening is modest. Closure is a quiet RR/CR, but the cost is mostly implied. The structure fits the 600–800 scope with one steady scene.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: courtyard → tea house → uncovering the plaque → return to sanctuary. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the plaque literalizes her quest and she plants lavender, then seals the moment with tea and lantern. Cost remains soft (mostly ongoing labor and fragility), but the before/after is legible. Orientation is crisp and single‑scene discipline is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean, and the accumulative drive coheres: anomaly → projection → tremor → transformed slide → redefined role. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a clear before/after in meaning. The cost at the end is more conceptual than felt, tempering impact. Still, the sequence holds without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.6)
    Orientation and drive are clear, likely under a Situational/Accumulative lens. Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she preserves the hush “for now” and reframes the fob as a weapon. The decisive beat (“she’d thwarted the thieves”) is told offstage, thinning causal satisfaction and visible cost. One tightening occurs (the group with the matching charm), but the resolution arrives without a concrete on-page turn.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal with a quiet, lyric surface—she follows the ring; therefore she reaches the convergence; therefore she’s told she’s chosen; therefore she accepts and proceeds. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (commitment to attend the election) with a Charged Poise image. Cost is muted and mostly conceptual, keeping the ceiling below the highest band. Orientation is clear and the single‑scene window is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The sequence (sanctuary as cage → glimmer → self‑portrait and note → decision to paint → declaration) coheres and ends with an on‑page Decisive Change. Cost is primarily internal—a renunciation of the former mode—and legible in the final image with the lock placed beside the painting. Orientation is clear early; single scene holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hybrid leaning Causal: workshop investigation → undercity discovery → revelation → inscription → water’s trickle creates an on‑page Decisive Change with a Conceptual Repricing of Verdania’s history. Orientation is crisp and the throughline holds, but access and resolution feel friction‑light (the chamber opens, the wall speaks, the plate “works” quickly). Cost is legible in the bitter truth and her leaves’ wilt under dishonesty, not in material sacrifice. Closure lands, if a touch convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: description and ritual build toward a charged poise as the sculpture spins, the bells answer, and she wraps the fragment to depart. Orientation is clean and single‑scene; set‑ups pay off in the final image. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise, but the on‑page cost is modest (accepting the fleetingness rather than losing something concrete). The sequence is coherent without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal throughline: pole shift intensifies inner noise → box is opened → chaos manifests → miniaturization → costed calm. Closure lands on the page with a felt price (nostalgia dulled), satisfying an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration under a causal lens. Orientation is firm by ~120 words (who/where/when, stakes). Minor compression in the combat with fears keeps it from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain under a Causal lens: locket discovery → mailbox incident → Mrs. Ellis’s lore → key in locket → opening → letter read → realization. Orientation is crisp, single-scene containment works, and closure lands with a conceptual repricing (listening as healing). The key hidden in the locket risks convenience and the on-page cost is light, tempering impact. Still, the decisive opening/read moment provides a real turn.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the causal chain—find humming chamber → decode journal through dance → mechanisms unlock—holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the lab awakens and the path forward opens. The cost, however, is soft; triumph arrives smoothly, so the before/after lacks a price beyond effort. The accumulative/lyric lens is steady, though the decisive turn borders on convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-scene arc is coherent with an accumulative/textural lens culminating in a conceptual repricing: memories aren’t erased but misplaced. Orientation is strong early (who/where/why), and the ritual sequence escalates plausibly to the doorway moment. Closure lands on-page, but the cost is light and more asserted than dramatized. Because/therefore linkage is soft but consistent for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is crisp and the sequence coheres toward a decisive act: she seals the prophecy (on‑page DC). Cost is present but conceptual—fragile balance and ongoing vigilance—rather than dramatized loss. The throughline holds, though stakes feel declared large and paid off small.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph (rooftop garden, meteor shower, two characters), and the scene stays contained. Under a causal lens: Elias appears → reframes objects/stakes → offers sugar → Clara acts next morning; the closure (she knocks) is on the page. The cost is implied (vulnerability, unsealing buried truths), not strongly dramatized. The turn is quiet but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is clear and the single-scene progression is clean: shell → resonance → figure → acceptance → return. Under an accumulative/textural lens, density and pattern (star, shell, garden) build toward a conceptual repricing of the garden as archive. Closure lands with a felt shift and a modest cost (absorbed radiance, new burden). Minor reliance on declarative guidance from the figure prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single‑scene structure with a clear before/after: the scroll goes from text to blank and her stance reconfigures. Under an accumulative/textural lens, cadence tightens around the act of erasure and the sanctuary’s drip patterning the moment. Closure lands on the page with a legible price (relinquishing the record and her bitterness). Orientation is clean and the throughline holds without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene tightens in steps: shell warms → archway → figure → pool → vision → repricing. Closure lands as a conceptual reweighting (understanding why some people echo), with a gentle felt price (relinquishing a purely sorrow-led stance). Orientation is clean, and the pattern of progressive disclosure is taught and honored. The cost is present but soft, keeping the ceiling just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: dreams accrue into a coherent story, and the final image (globe clearing, names spoken) delivers a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the pattern (object → dreams → assembly → charged final beat) holds. Cost is present but modest (spent candles, dawn, emotional expenditure). The single‑scene arc is coherent and contained.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the scene builds through motifs toward a quiet Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is early and clean; the single scene holds. Closure arrives as a reweighted understanding (patterns in the world and self), but the cost is soft and largely conceptual. The whistle echo serves the lone hinge, creating a mild internal deepening rather than a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under a causal lens, the sequence is coherent: anomaly → investigation → discovery (prison) → containment ritual → stabilized but costly outcome. Closure lands on page via a decisive act (pressing the diamond, chant) with cost (storms return, vigilance). The chant sourced from reassembled letters is a touch convenient but seeded early enough to avoid a causality break. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when) and held.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is clean: signal → weeks of decoding → storm-night activation → aftermath. The causal chain holds and closure arrives with the portico’s activation and a reconfigured role. Cost at the end is more retrospective than present-tense felt, keeping the decisive change from fully stinging. Orientation is solid from the opening, and the lens reads Causal with a light accumulative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate (loft beneath dunes at dawn; Elias, jars, music box) and the pattern of attempts → intensification → charged final image holds. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: after the box overwhelms him and a jar breaks, he reconceives redemption as remembering, crystallized by the shard‑to‑ear image. Cost is legible (loss of a jar, surrender to memory over control).

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clean causal chain: signal → retrieval → confrontation → vision test → reveal → harmonic counter. Single POV, contained scene, and a decisive repulsion close the arc. Closure lands, but the price is soft (no visible loss or lasting constraint beyond a vague ongoing threat). The inferred lens is Causal with a light Situational tint, held through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterning of moon/ice/viaduct builds toward a quiet realization, landing in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. Orientation is firm from the start; scope is coherent. The causal chain is light but legible: observation → pattern recognition → metaphor reweighted on the viaduct → change of stance. Cost is mostly conceptual, which keeps the turn modest.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal progression: lantern reveals unnatural scratches → hidden compartment → journal → symbol trail → concealed chamber → incriminating photo. Orientation is strong early and the throughline stays coherent under a causal lens. Closure arrives as a decisive internal shift backed by new evidence; however, the cost is mostly promised (“treacherous road ahead”) rather than felt in the scene. Still, the pattern of discoveries produces credible on‑page change.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure lands as a Charged Poise: the repaired ticking heart reweights Elias’s doubt into resolve, with a felt cost of responsibility for the coming “storm.” Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the scene holds to one location and POV. Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than enacted, so the cadence shift is meaningful but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the patterning of images → motif → bell coheres, and the on‑page ringing gives a clear closure beat (CR/RR). Orientation is clean early; who/where/when are anchored. Causality is straightforward (experimentation therefore discovery), though the price and narrowing of options are light. The world’s answer to the bell reweights meaning effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain: numbers → hidden folder → lockout → lie/bypass → transmission → decision. Orientation is solid from the outset, and the throughline stays single‑POV, single‑stake. Closure arrives as a decisive choice to expose the truth, with implied cost (job/company retaliation) though not concretely dramatized. The lens reads Causal and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Causal. The sequence—fragment → mirrors reveal blueprint → pedestal assembly → lighthouse placement—tracks cleanly and orients early. Closure is a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration with the crystal reconstituted and installed, but the cost is light and the assembly happens conveniently once she sets the fragment down. Stakes resolve smoothly without a tightening that bites.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: setting → listening → the man’s question → northern‑lights closure. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—“the sound of endings” becomes a felt, windlike solace—with an on‑page final image. Orientation is clean and the single‑scene frame holds. The price is implied rather than sharply dramatized, keeping it below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece tightens through image patterns (amber light, vines leaning) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early; single scene coherence is strong. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with light emotional cost. Lack of concrete obstacles keeps the causal chain soft, though consistent with the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as a single ritual scene culminating in the prophet’s arrival, with a quiet RR closure when the consecration is affirmed. Orientation is crisp and the ending provides a gentle before/after, but cost remains soft and escalation light. The because/therefore chain is secondary to atmospheric build, which the story sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure holds cleanly, anchored early in place and purpose. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the ruins’ vines reinterpreted as embrace and Elara departing lighter yet committed. The cost is implied—ongoing labor and grief management—but remains soft on the page. No major causal turns; pressure accrues via image and cadence rather than plot.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene accumulative build is clean: dawn studies → pattern coalesces → cost emerges → charged exit. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with visible price (the crystal’s energy fades as knowledge transfers). Orientation is strong early, and set-ups (echoes, method) pay off without contrivance. The escalation is gentle rather than incisive, but coherently causal for the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned marking → driftwood recovery → circle → hum. Closure lands on the page as a Charged Poise/RR with modest cost (he foregoes tools for the found sound). Orientation is clean early (who/where/goal) and the sequence avoids causality breaks. The tightening is gentle but coherent and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues from tremor → fixation on spinning hand → insight via leaf → overnight restructuring → harmonized final rhythm. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she doesn’t stop time but reframes it, with a tangible device on the page. Cost is modest (labor, renunciation of “repair” for “reimagine”), yet legible. Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. The because/therefore chain is clean—Elara recognizes the unfinished business, hums/plays, calls Claire, reunion occurs, final image reweights the vinyl shard. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (the impending death and years lost) even if resolution is smooth. The path feels low‑resistance—“within hours” compresses complications—but the closure unit remains legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    Causal links are clean: relearn runes → use key at noon → void absorbs shadows → answer achieved. Structure follows two shards (workshop, precipice) with a legible arc and on‑page closure. Cost is light; despite the isle straining, consequences remain largely conceptual. Still, the before/after is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under a causal lens, the because/therefore sequence is clean: tooth → maze → fountain → demand for an offering → the sacrifice → transformation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with an on‑page cost (giving up the childhood stone/certainty), reweighting options and self‑understanding. Orientation is solid and the scene holds to a single arc without stray threads. The cost could be pressed harder in the final beats, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single POV, coherent window, and a clean accumulative/textural build to a quiet RR (readiness to share the light). Orientation is crisp; the sea glass polishing advances toward the moon‑amplified glow and departure. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (trauma and vow), subtly rendered. The lens holds, though the on‑page price is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: a Charged Poise/RR as Elara accepts the notebook and shares the hush, reweighting her sanctuary from private to shared. Orientation is clean; single scene coheres. The cost—risking her sanctuary’s privacy post‑backlash—is present though understated. One meaningful tightening arrives with “I saw your confession” and the proffered notebook.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.1)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres via intensifying cameos and the shell’s glow culminating in the placement at the tree and the decision to write. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she redefines her role from collector to memorialist; the mist lifts. Cost is conceptual—accepting the burden of others’ pain—more implied than viscerally felt. Orientation is clear and pattern taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the singing → vine awakening → stories/orbs progression lands a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear from the outset, and the ending offers a tangible decisive change (the orbs exist). Cost is hinted (“work is far from over”) but not felt on the page, softening impact. The structure is coherent and contained to one scene with a clean cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: ritual density builds to the sealing and the crater’s “exhale.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the map pulses and the orchard hums. Cost is present (spending the safekept starlight), though it reads more conceptual than felt. Orientation and scene boundaries are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early), and the causal chain holds: study → insight at dusk → reverse-engineer → activation. Closure occurs on the page with the timer humming and echoes manifesting, a clear before/after. The cost proof is faint—years of labor and sleeplessness are stated, not tested in-scene. Still, the single-scene escalation is coherent under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is crisp early, and the piece holds an accumulative/textural lens to a clean RR/CR closure. The offer of choice and her pivot to self‑understanding provide the decisive cadence shift. Cost is present conceptually (crack in the calcified soul; potential renunciation of role) but not viscerally enacted. The single-scene pressure coheres and resolves without stray threads.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain, kettle, tools, and iterative carving accrue toward a charged final image. Closure arrives as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with the completed lion and a reweighted stance toward grief. Orientation is clean from the outset. The cost is primarily emotional and understated but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, objects and whispers accrete until the recorded voice reframes her aim—closure via conceptual repricing lands. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when). The wheel’s progression from hum to message to counsel provides a coherent arc. The cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, but present.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the patterning of air/light/sound coheres toward a Conceptual Repricing at dawn (the terminal will never reopen, yet he resurrects its pulse for a moment and internalizes its “maze”). Orientation is clean early, and the through‑line holds. The closure’s cost is present but soft—more elegiac than pressurized. Still, the before/after is legible and earned through on‑page actions.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from ambient hush → whispered prompt (“bear”) → decisive act (finishing the clock) → reweighted final word (“home”). Orientation is clean early and the single-scene structure holds. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with a visible conceptual cost (choosing to carry longing rather than depart). The cost is gentle rather than acute, keeping it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.7)
    Causal lens: she follows instinct → salvages → finds chest → confession triggers the sundial’s message → resolve. Orientation is crisp early, and the single-scene progression is coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise, but the cost remains light and the turn predictable. No broken setups, though escalation is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure holds cleanly: study → recognition → alignment with fulgurite → decoded meaning → charged final image. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration (charged poise): the rope’s meaning is reweighted and her role crystallizes. Cost is implied—responsibility and labor—rather than dramatized. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: presence, observation, writing, reading, exchange. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing—an obituary for the waiting self—and a resonant exchange of threads. Cost is felt in the woman’s silent weeping and the traveler relinquishing her notebook, though the price is quiet. Orientation is clear early and structure is clean within a single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: research → map → descent → egg/machine → assembly → projection → repricing → return with new stance. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise: he accepts that beauty cannot be forced and forecloses the fantasy of an instant fix. Cost is mostly conceptual and emotional, but it’s legible on the page (a betrayal felt in assembling; acceptance of patience/sacrifice). The machine’s explicit thesis line borders on didactic, slightly reducing subtlety but not breaking closure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds toward a charged poise: the planting completed as clouds peak and rain threatens, ending in a reweighted stance of quiet redemption. Orientation is crisp from the outset; linkage is coherent and lean. Closure lands with cost—the risk of failure, ongoing stigma, and a refusal of certainty—to form an earned stasis. One meaningful tightening (storm apex, “promise of renewal”) narrows options without needing a hard reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, breadcrumbs build a pattern that culminates in a clear on‑page reconfiguration (box completes, fountains flow). Orientation is crisp from the outset, and causality—though lightly coincidental—holds within the fable‑logic. Closure carries conceptual cost (renouncing mere skepticism to release memory) more than felt sacrifice. The sequence’s “because/therefore” is gentle, but the ending delivers a real before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: sonar pings intensify, the garden responds, and the gear reframes into a conduit, producing a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the outset (Elara, nebula garden, mission). Closure lands on the page with a before/after in capability and stance. Cost is conceptual rather than felt, limiting upper range.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, images and reflections build toward a conceptual repricing: grief as migration rather than a bounded carving. Orientation is clear early (greenhouse at dusk; Elara at work), and the ribbon/butterflies pattern tightens the frame. Closure lands with a felt cost—the mentor’s departure and the shift from monument to journey. The linkage is coherent and clean for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres from observation to stance shift to a charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Elias reframes his duty and assumes a broader guardianship. Cost is present but muted, mostly as ongoing labor and vulnerability rather than a sharp on‑page price. The middle weeks compress into summary, softening on‑page causality.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; pressure accrues via decoding and ambient time until a quiet realization. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what) and the throughline is coherent. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (“intentions endure”), but the cost is soft and largely implied. The chess clock and hours passing mark cadence but don’t enforce a decisive narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Hybrid with accumulative dominance: the scene builds to writing as the decisive act, and the world subtly shifts on the page (laughter, leaves, light). Closure lands, but cost is light and mostly projected into the future, reading as a conceptual repricing rather than a paid price. Orientation is strong and single-scene coherence holds. Stakes resolve to a charged poise more than a felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern intensifies from static to song to glow to resolve, culminating in a charged poise at dawn. Orientation is clear early and the single scene holds. Closure lands as a threshold reconfiguration, though the on‑page cost remains conceptual rather than biting. Causality is clean with no unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece builds toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure as the rocking chair slows and the ash settles. Orientation is clean early, and the final image reweights the premise with a felt cost. The throughline (enter → confront mask and memory → scatter → accept impermanence) coheres without causality breaks. The cost is emotional rather than decision‑shaped, but lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: sewer setup → Lira’s challenge → time passes → collapse → retrieval → reconfigured outlook. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration (threads of past/future can coexist) with a mild cost (leaving sanctuary, risking loss). Orientation and causality are clear; the because/therefore chain holds. The decisive stakes could tighten further, but the arc lands.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: a measured build from quiet rehearsal to performance culminates in a conceptual repricing where silence becomes victory. Causality is clean (decision → practice → growth → performance). Closure lands, but the visible price is soft, mostly conceptual rather than on‑page loss. Orientation is strong from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    Orientation is clean from the start; the scene progresses causally toward the dawn bite, with the alignment as a temporal engine. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she tastes collective memory and chooses to share. The cost is felt but light (labor, relinquishing fear), which trims some impact. Overall, the structure is coherent and purposeful within the length.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens: box → key → hidden panel → descent → orb → vision → resolve to reveal. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the single transition (surface to chamber) is clean. The closure is a conceptual repricing (understanding the drones’ sacrifice) with a stance shift; however, the felt cost at the ending is muted. Several conveniences (perfectly fitting key, immediate reveal) reduce friction but don’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: images and actions build toward a conceptual repricing where the shard reframes the world’s “quiet stories.” Orientation is swift and stable (quiet bay at dawn, Elias on shore, single scene). Closure lands on the page with the shard’s glow and the reweighted objects, though the cost remains mostly conceptual (accepting a burden of listening). The throughline is coherent and clean with one meaningful deepening at the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Drive lens: Causal—Liora warns; therefore Elara retests; therefore lives are saved. The on‑page closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Liora’s purpose clarified and the ampoule buried, with cost implied in delay and risk. Resolution occurs off‑stage, softening pressure but maintaining coherence. Orientation is clear early; two‑shard structure is tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through patterned imagery and a cadence shift at the loss of the chipped die. Orientation is clean early, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on‑page cost (cannot retrace). The staircase’s rule set (no return) coherently shapes options and the final stance. The through‑line holds without causality breaks, though some reflective exposition slightly front‑loads theme.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clean orientation and a single continuous scene; the accumulative/textural lens holds as density and luminosity build to a charged poise. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the painting as bridge and a reweighted self-concept at dawn. Cost is implied (an ongoing calling within a polluted world) but not strongly taxed on the page. Causality is soft but coherent within the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain: beekeeper’s honey → decision to bake initials → lens chime → public sharing → communal rekindling → museum placement. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the tradition revives and the lens’s role is reweighted. The window is contiguous and single-POV. The ending’s cost is implied rather than felt, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clean causal chain: desire → plan → alignment → eruption → altered world. Orientation is strong from the outset and the scene stays within one window. Closure is a decisive change with a legible price (irreversibility and island resistance), though the cost is more conceptual than dramatized. The inferred drive lens is causal and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: mirrors/notes/clocks build until the disclosure of her deepest fear shatters the space. Closure lands on the page with a conceptual and emotional cost (naming the fear, absorbing its gaze) and a visible world-shift (funhouse dissolves). Causality is soft but consistent with the taught pattern; no orientation debt. The advisor’s guidance veers toward convenience but doesn’t break the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates through density and pattern—notes provoke cloud responses, culminating in a charged final image. Orientation is clean (who/where/when) and the scene holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, but the cost is faint, more a release of tension than a trade‑off, which softens impact. Still, the cadence shift from blue hour to twilight provides a credible finish.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Causal. Beats link cleanly (whistle → crack → tunnel → deciphering → chamber → revelation → mission), and the closure lands as a conceptual repricing: watchers redefined, turtles’ peril reframes the initial quest. Cost is present as a conceptual burden and city‑scale risk; it’s legible though not bodily dramatized. Orientation is crisp early, and the closure unit holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under a causal lens, the beats link cleanly: letter → rumor → ledger riddle → key → archive → repricing at exit. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/earned stasis: she reframes “noble lies” with humane complexity and leaves with documents and a tempered peace. Cost is implied rather than felt—there’s no concrete sacrifice beyond the psychic recalibration. Orientation is strong from the opening; scope and single‑scene containment fit the length.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, discovery → restoration work → mosaic glow coheres and closes with a resonant reconfiguration. The journal materially deepens knowledge and justifies his ritual note, and the glowing mosaic reweights “absence” into charged presence. Cost is present but light; still, the on‑page final image functions as closure. Orientation is anchored immediately; the single scene holds.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orientation is crisp from the start, and the causal chain is intact: blackout → exploration → pattern recognition → map alignment → stamp activation → discovery. Closure lands on the page via a Decisive Change (the record revealed), with a conceptual reweighting of the library as gateway. The “key stamp opens passages” beat reads convenient but seeded; cost at the ending is implied rather than felt. As an accumulative/causal hybrid, it coheres, though pressure remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid leaning causal: Lira’s nudge → basilica visit → realization → renewed stance forms clean because/therefore linkage. Closure lands as an earned reconfiguration (he foregoes escape to honor grief), with the crane’s unfolding as the decisive act. Stakes stay singular and coherent. Cost is felt through the painful recognition of the “shadow” as his self‑built shield.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds image pressure toward a resonant reconfiguration: the geode’s inner light reframes Zara’s path and the circuit breakers’ return seals the stance shift. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the motif chain (ash → crystals → observatory silence → click‑on) coheres. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a modest but legible cost (embracing the unknown, foreclosing a prior identity as “just a survivor”). The causal links are intentionally light but consistent with the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: drone scan → alcove → tower → vault → assembly → holographic map. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing when the “frequency of belonging” reframes the quest. Cost is light—no meaningful obstacle or trade-off beyond traversal—so the ending feels earned but not hard-won. Orientation is strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with the dropped watch hand and his choice to cease lying. Orientation is clean from the terrace to the shore, and the single tightening beat occurs when he aligns the watch hand to the carved clock and recalls the erased heir. The cost—accepting irreversibility and relinquishing the talisman—is on the page. Minor softness: external consequences remain offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    Situational lens holds: a single negotiation scene in weather pressure culminates in a Charged Poise—agreement “to begin anew” with the drawer pull passed. Orientation is immediate and clean, and the closure unit lands on the page. The conceptual cost (pride, “I do not forgive lightly”) is present but modestly felt. Linkages are coherent, though escalation remains primarily rhetorical.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery and small acts accrete to a resonant reconfiguration at closure. Closure lands on the page when she tucks the compass away and rows past the poles—a before/after with felt cost. Orientation is clean, single scene, single POV. The cost is modest, but legible and causally grounded in the established pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: image density builds (ball → swim → carvings → repricing) toward a quiet but firm closure. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and the lake encounter tightens the frame into a single scene with one dominant stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (relinquishing the baseball; acceptance that he can’t “go back”). The chain is light on hard causal opposition but coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean and causal: fortune → scent → guardian test → conjuration → reconfiguration/realization. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—she seeks an external bond but claims an internal one—with modest on‑page cost. Orientation is prompt and stable; single‑scene focus holds. The lens reads Hybrid leaning Causal, coherent through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats stack cleanly: saucer crack as map → cards (Tower/Chariot) → shedding cloak → vision → resolve. Closure lands on the page via a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes the crack from wound to reminder and commits to presence. Cost is emotional (faced absence) and legible in the firefly‑like missed moments. Orientation is crisp from the outset with no causality slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the throughline is coherent: anomaly → Tear in the core → portal → stitching → awakening. Closure arrives with the “final stitch,” a resonant reconfiguration, though the cost is mostly conceptual/emotional. The beat-to-beat causality holds without teleports, but the price paid is light, softening impact. The single-scene scope is clean and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: hush → hidden cove → star alignment → message → release. Closure lands on-page via a resonant reconfiguration and visible cost (uncorking and losing the last possession with meaning). Orientation is solid from the first paragraph. The lens holds through the cadence shift at the archway without causal contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: blackout → sundial cipher → key → confrontation → activation → fort transformed. Orientation is crisp early, and the payoff is on the page with a visible change in world state. The cost at closure is light (Thorne’s silence implies future consequence rather than landing one now), which limits force. Still, the scene stays single‑POV and focused with one decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with a clear cadence shift as the ritual condenses and the aurora/eels synchronize. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing: the patterns reweight from local (eels/rocks) to total (everything), with a soft but present cost (risked sanity, lost prized eel, relinquishing mystery as dust goes inert). Orientation and scene unity are clean; the beats build coherently to the scattering choice. The new pattern at the end reframes the journey without breaking established logic.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the ticking timer, storm, and envelope converge into a cadence shift when the timer clicks to silence and Elara commits to writing. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/decisive change with conceptual cost—returning to an uncensored self by confronting mapped scars. Causality is clean within the lyric design; no teleporting props or resets. The price is more implied than enacted, which keeps it shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the patterned exchange builds toward a conceptual repricing: the overture as the asking itself. Orientation is crisp early; one scene, clean stakes, and a cadence shift at the end. The final cost is light—renouncing destination as telos—yet it’s on the page. Linkages are coherent, with the sundial as a repeating procedural anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, motifs (rust, letters, poems on walls, moon) thicken toward a rooftop Charged Poise: “Patching is how we rebuild,” and Elias choosing a self to keep. Orientation is crisp and the sceneing is coherent. The closure lands but the cost is soft—foreclosing ongoing molting is suggested rather than dramatized with consequence. Still, the coffee tin reprise and rooftop cadence create a legible before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence (decision → search → film immersion → return) coheres and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early, and objects/payoffs close loops (clock ticks; compasses still). Cost is felt more conceptually than materially but is legible in the final reweighting. The “finds reel quickly” convenience is acceptable within the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.1)
    Hybrid leaning causal: journey → guardian’s question → acquisition → planting → monsoon test. The closure (tree grown, memory secured) lands, but the cost is light and the trial feels low-friction. Orientation is clean and the structure holds with one transition. Stakes are declared early and resolved, but escalation is modest, edging into fable simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate, beats cohere (compass settles → trek → letters → tide dissolves → understanding), and closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a visible price (relinquishing tokens to the cove/ocean). The tightening is modest but clean; the ocean’s action on the letters charges the ending. No causality breaks or soft resets.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through observation and discovery. The closure unit—the butterfly's creation—is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration that lands on the page. However, the final sentence over-explains the thematic payoff, weakening the resonance. The felt cost is the acceptance of loss and transformation, which is legible but could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear causal chain under a Causal lens, and the closure is a valid Charged Poise that reconfigures the stakes. The plot progression is logical, moving from discovery to investigation to revelation. The convenience of finding the final ledger piece precisely at the site of the attack is a minor weakness, feeling slightly too neat for an otherwise grounded sequence of events.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story employs a strong Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and internal pressure toward a clear and resonant closure. The structure is elegant and efficient for its length, moving from stasis to a collaborative deepening of knowledge. The ending is a perfect Conceptual Repricing, where the meaning of "silence" is re-weighted with the felt cost of letting go of an old world. The causality is flawless under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a strong, clear causal chain under a Causal lens, moving from mystery to concrete action. The closure, a combination of Decisive Change (signal sent) and Resonant Reconfiguration (internal peace), lands effectively. The final image of the waters parting is symbolically powerful but introduces a magical element that slightly strains the story's previously established physical logic, representing a minor wobble in an otherwise excellent structure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens. The plot progresses logically: anonymous aid creates community curiosity, which the protagonist leverages for a public gathering, leading to a unified front. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the community's internal state shifts decisively even as external pressures remain. The structure is strong and effective for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal lens, where each discovery logically enables the next, leading to a decisive change at closure. The structure is clean for this length, and orientation is handled well. The cost—integrating a painful past failure—is legible, though the ease of the protagonist's journey makes the final resolution feel somewhat frictionless and preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear and logical causal chain (find object, enter maze, use object), leading to a Decisive Change. However, the closure lacks a meaningful felt cost; the fragment is consumed to give Elara exactly what she wanted, making the resolution feel more like a smooth transaction than an earned victory. This symmetric satisfaction, where the price paid is simply the key used to unlock the reward, softens the impact of the final change.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.5)
    The plot is mechanically sound with a clear causal sequence until the final beat. The closure is severely undermined by the magical, unearned disappearance of the chains ("the chains fell away, as if they had never been there"). This deus ex machina resolves a core physical constraint without cause, breaking the established logic of the world and weakening the protagonist's earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at its closure. The structure is elegant and efficient, with a legible on-page cost—the "resonant ache"—that feels earned by the preceding action. Orientation is immediate and causality, within the story's fantastical logic, is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    The plot adheres flawlessly to a Causal lens for its scope. The inciting incident (targeting the jar) leads directly to the complication (the floral trap), which in turn causes the confrontation and re-evaluation. The closure is a clear Decisive Change in Lira's identity, landing on the page with the felt cost of new responsibility, satisfying the rubric's requirements for a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building internal pressure toward a clear closure moment. The final action—placing the bookmark in the sphere—functions as a solid Resonant Reconfiguration, creating a legible before/after in Elara's stance. However, the felt cost is articulated with the slightly clichéd phrase “weighty lightness,” which softens the impact of an otherwise effective structural cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal structure is clear and functional (find cast, decrypt, find key, open door). The Causal lens holds. However, the closure, while decisive, lacks a clearly legible cost on the page. The shattering of false selves is framed entirely as a positive transformation, weakening the sense of a price paid for her newfound identity, which is a requirement for the highest scores.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly. The structure is a simple, elegant ritual that builds atmospheric density toward a clear closure point. The ending provides a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the oracle’s purpose is solidified at the cost of embracing an endless task, a cost made tangible by the vanishing of the final star.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a valid Conceptual Repricing (CR). The closure lands with a clear conceptual cost—the loss of a simple, mechanistic worldview. The primary weakness is that the core mechanism, the "looped timelines," is summarized in a single paragraph rather than dramatized, which lessens the impact of the journey to the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building emotional pressure that leads to a clear choice. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration that lands on the page. However, the resolution feels too convenient; Kian’s immediate and perfect understanding lacks friction, making the "Decisive Change" feel slightly unearned and softening the impact of the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building toward its conclusion through ritual and reflection. The closure unit is a clear Conceptual Repricing, where the meaning of imperfection is re-evaluated with a felt internal cost. The structure is sound for its chosen mode, with the final image providing a resonant, on-page sense of completion.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain under a Causal lens, moving from choice to consequence to resolution. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a well-executed Charged Poise, establishing a new, more complex status quo with a felt cost ("tempered by responsibility"), making the before/after state perfectly legible for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The plot progresses through a series of resonant images and discoveries, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration for the closure. The final image provides a tangible "after" state, with the cost—the dissolution of the program—felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly. The structure is a masterclass in economy for this length: a single, continuous scene builds atmospheric pressure that deepens with the wanderer's arrival. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "truth," is executed on the page with a clear final action and a palpable felt cost—the abandonment of certainty for process.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with a mechanically sound sequence of events leading to an on-page Decisive Change. However, the closure is weakened by an insufficient cost; Mara faces a momentary, abstract threat that is overcome too easily. This convenience undermines the narrative weight, making the final resolution feel unearned despite its structural correctness.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens. The inciting incident (swan unfolding) leads directly to the journey, climax (mirror), and resolution. The closure is a strong Decisive Change (DC) in Lira's internal state, with the cost being the loss of the physical refuge and her former, more fragile sense of peace. The structure is elegant and effective for this length, with clear orientation and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear and effective Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure is a single, continuous scene that builds atmosphere toward a quiet climax. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where Finn’s perspective shifts and the keepsake's meaning is repriced for Elara. The cost is legible in the image of the "telescope forgotten at his feet," representing a trade of a broken analytical view for an immediate, wondrous one.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.5)
    The plot follows a clean, logical causal chain of discovery, which is a strength. However, the progression relies on a series of convenient findings (diaries leading perfectly to scrolls with the full solution) that removes friction. The closure provides a Decisive Change, but the cost is negligible—a momentary "weight of centuries"—making the world-altering resolution feel unearned and low-stakes in its execution.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a single continuous scene with clear orientation. The closure, a moment of Charged Poise where Li Wei decides to act, is structurally valid. However, the causal chain leading to it is weak, relying on coincidence ("accidentally brushing") and a sudden magical realization. The plot advances through an accumulation of symbolic ideas rather than a sequence of events where actions have tangible consequences, making the final decision feel conceptually convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through thematic intensification rather than strict causality. The structure is sound, with clear orientation and a well-executed Conceptual Repricing for its closure, where the anchor's nature is fundamentally re-defined. The "different silence" at the end provides a legible "after" state, making the conceptual cost of the confrontation clear and earned within the story's abstract logic.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. Orientation is swift and clear, and the structure builds emotional density toward a single, decisive act. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands with a clear on-page cost as the writer collapses from exhaustion. The final image of the mirrored horizon reconfigures the meaning of the struggle, making the before/after state palpable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows a clear accumulative structure leading to a Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the closure critically fails the cost-proof test; Elara feels "lighter than she had in years" with no visible sacrifice, trade-off, or lingering consequence. This lack of a felt or conceptual price renders the central transformation unearned and dramatically inert.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive. The inciting incident (finding the needle) leads directly to a plan, execution, and a Decisive Change at the end. The closure lands with a clear felt cost ("raw, aching aliveness"). The process of change is somewhat compressed ("Hours turned to days"), but this is an acceptable economy for the story's length and focus.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    The causal structure is straightforward and the closure unit—a Decisive Change in purpose—lands with a clear conceptual cost (the loss of solitude). The plot's primary weakness is a significant lapse in credibility during the infiltration. Elias simply "slip[s] through unnoticed" past "armed guards," a convenience that deflates the tension and undermines the cause-and-effect chain at a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal structure under a Causal lens. The introduction of the vial serves as a strong inciting incident, leading directly to the protagonist's climactic choice. The closure is a clear Decisive Change (DC) on the page—Elias moves from avoidance to acceptance—and the cost is the emotional pain of confronting his loss, which makes the final peace feel earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through layered patterns rather than causal turns. The structure is tight, leading to a valid Conceptual Repricing at the end where Elias reframes his quest. The cost is made tangible and resonant by his on-page action of leaving the rope, foreclosing his old way of being. This is an excellent execution of a non-causal structure with a clear before/after state.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly. The structure builds pressure through atmosphere and internal reflection, leading to a strong on-page closure. The ending, a Conceptual Repricing where Elara redefines the hush from void to canvas, lands with a clear felt cost—the acceptance of loss and imperfection, symbolized by leaving the bowl behind. The before/after state is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean, single-scene structure under a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara reaffirms her professional stance—lands with a clear, felt cost ("Elara's heart ached faintly"). The plot is economical and purposeful, building atmospheric pressure toward an earned, resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear emotional and decisional causality after the inciting incident. However, the plot relies on a second major coincidence at the climax—the locket belonging to Clara’s grandmother—which strains credulity and feels overly sentimental. This convenience undermines the earnedness of the closure, making the resonant reconfiguration feel constructed rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building meaning through Lira's journey and culminating in a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR). The closure, where Echo's tag redefines Lira's actions as a successful act of weaving kinship, lands with a clear felt cost (the long, lonely search). The structure is clean and effective for the length, with a clear inciting incident and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural structure, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The closure lands with a legible, albeit minor, cost (she cannot stay). However, the progression is frictionless; the plot unfolds as a guided magical tour rather than a sequence of cause-and-effect challenges, which softens the overall narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean, satisfying causal structure. The discovery of the eyes leads logically to deciphering the mosaic, which leads to the journal, which recontextualizes the quest. The closure is a well-executed Charged Poise, landing on the page with a clear reconfiguration of the stakes and a felt, if future, cost implied by the mentor's warning. The Causal drive lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively. The structure is clean, with the search for fragments building thematic weight toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure lands firmly on the page, with the character's internal state altered and a new course of action chosen, all at the legible cost of their hidden sanctuary. The causality is sound for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure builds pressure through atmosphere and internal reflection, leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration for closure. The 'before' (caged by control) and 'after' (accepting transformation) states are legible, and the cost—the terror of uncertainty—is felt on the page, satisfying the rubric's requirements for a strong ending.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain under a Causal lens. The closure, a Decisive Change where Elara finds her purpose, is earned through on-page action and has a clear conceptual cost—the exchange of her restless searching for a new responsibility. The structure is tight and well-suited for the story's length, with no structural flaws impacting the final resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    The structure is a clean, linear progression suitable for the story's length, adhering to an Accumulative/Textural drive. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing where Elara's understanding of her gift is fundamentally reweighted. The "cost" is the forfeiture of her desire for predictive certainty, which is legible in the final paragraph, making the before/after state clear.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere effectively toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The final image powerfully reweights Elara's purpose, providing strong closure. However, the arrival of the mysterious woman to deliver exposition functions as a *dea ex machina*, which resolves the central uncertainty through telling rather than a choice Elara makes under pressure, softening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens. Orientation is established effectively, and the plot progresses logically from the inciting incident to the climax. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's internal state is decisively changed, with the felt cost of abandoning her old life of certainty. The structure is well-executed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural structure, moving from discovery to revelation effectively. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's worldview shifts. However, the cost of this change—the loss of her foundational skepticism—is framed purely as a gain, which softens the impact and makes the ending feel less like a trade-off and more like a simple upgrade.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal drive lens. The plot progresses logically from Elyr's boredom to his discovery, experimentation, and the resulting climax. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Elyr's internal state is re-contextualized with a new purpose born from chaos, and the cost (the destruction of the escondite and unknown future dangers) is made legible. The structure is perfectly scaled for the word count, delivering a complete and satisfying arc without any structural faults.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens within a single continuous scene. The closure is a clear Decisive Change with a felt cost—exchanging a fraudulent safe-harbor for an honest, uncertain future. The causality is slightly softened by the magical nature of the ink pot, which acts as a catalyst for the change, but it remains consistent within the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive lens beautifully. The structure builds from quiet process to a crescendo of discovery, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The final image of Elara descending, armed with a "real" memory instead of an "invented" one, reweights her entire purpose with a palpable cost, felt in her "trembling" hands and the new responsibility she carries.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot progresses not through causal turns but through a deepening density of discovery, moving from a single clue to a vast archive. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing, where the protagonist's quest is re-framed with a felt cost of perpetual duty, fully earned by the preceding discoveries. The orientation is immediate and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive perfectly for its length, building density toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where Mara redefines the 'compass' and her quest, lands with a legible, felt cost expressed in her "bittersweet" smile. The structure is simple, elegant, and effective, with a flawless link between the accumulated atmosphere and the final insight.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear and logical causal structure, from inciting incident to climax. Orientation is handled well. The closure is a form of Charged Poise, acknowledging the fight isn't over, which provides a resonant ending. However, the plot's progression feels slightly frictionless, particularly how Vorin's opposition "only fueled the fire," a convenient turn that lowers the narrative's overall pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    The plot is elegantly structured for an Accumulative/Textural drive. The discovery of the message serves as a perfect deepening of the stakes, and the approaching dawn creates a natural clock. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis, is resonant and lands with a clear emotional cost, fulfilling its function without a single wasted move.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story employs an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively. The structure is simple but sound, building atmospheric pressure rather than causal tension. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis, lands cleanly as Elara finds renewed purpose in her sanctuary, creating a resonant final image that contrasts with the departing ship. The cost is the quiet, sustained dedication her craft demands, which is felt rather than explicitly stated.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes a clean and effective Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot advances through a sequence of resonant images (falcon, condensation, mist) that build pressure toward the final discovery. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the lifelong quest is concluded with a felt, conceptual cost, making the before/after state legible on the page as she begins her "new journey."

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively. The structure is a simple, elegant progression from setup (the mission), through gradual intensification (the daily walks yielding subtle changes), to a clear payoff (the bell's chime). The closure is a well-earned Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Elias's new role as guardian represents a tangible, on-page cost for the town's revival. The fantastical causality is internally consistent and serves the story's core concept.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear causal sequence, and the closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing where Maya's purpose is reconfigured. However, the mechanism by which "unsnarling" the past causes the temple's physical walls to shift is unexplained magic, weakening the causal logic. The resolution of her physical peril (being trapped with limited oxygen) is hand-waved away, undermining the initial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain, with the journal discovery serving as a strong pivotal point that redefines the stakes. The closure unit—a Decisive Change in stance—is legible and executed on the page through the action of ascending and stepping outside. While the named cost of renouncing "hush" could be more viscerally felt, the plot structure is sound, logically coherent, and effectively propels the narrative to its conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building atmospheric and emotional density toward a clear closure. The final beat is a strong example of Charged Poise (RR), where the protagonist's stance shifts from passive haunting to active journeying, crystallizing the new, collective stakes. The cost—the burden of shared sorrow—is felt on the page, making the transformation legible and earned within this structural mode.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure is not causal but builds through the repetition and layering of Elara's actions, culminating in a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure, where the canyon "exhales" and glows, provides a legible before/after shift from ruin to reverence, with the cost being Elara's lifelong dedication and her own story merging with the place.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Following an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure successfully builds atmosphere towards a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. However, the plot's causality is soft; the roots "guiding her" and the sundial being a "perfect fit" for the tomb entrance feel more like convenient resolutions than earned discoveries, slightly undermining the sense of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear and logical causal chain (lead -> arcade -> chalk code -> mailbox -> letter), which is a strength. Orientation is handled well. The closure unit—obtaining the letter—is a decisive change in knowledge, but the associated cost is stated abstractly ("a sense of futuristic nostalgia") rather than felt on the page, which weakens the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, causal structure within its single scene. The orientation is immediate and effective, and the arrival of Lira provides a strong inciting incident that turns the plot. The closure, a Charged Poise where Elara accepts her new purpose, lands with a clear sense of felt cost—the loss of her peaceful isolation and the acceptance of a dangerous new role.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully. The structure is a purposeful journey toward a central revelation, with each step deepening the emotional stakes. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara confronts her own letter and feels "whole," lands with a clear felt cost—the shard's light is spent, becoming "dull but warm." The plot is tight, focused, and serves the internal arc flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive exceptionally well within the single-scene scope. Pressure builds through atmosphere and the steady reveal of information, leading to a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the end. The closure lands cleanly on the page, with the felt cost of Elara accepting her new role as "voice," making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, where a series of discoveries builds toward the climax. However, the causality feels weak, relying on convenience; the fog "seemed to shift, revealing a faint path" and later "seemed to guide her." The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of Lira's artistic purpose, lands clearly, but the path to it feels more like a scavenger hunt where each clue is conveniently placed rather than earned by overcoming a significant obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building a sequence of magical events that cohere effectively. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where Elara's certainty is revalued as a "cage," lands clearly with a conceptual cost. The plot's main weakness is the speed of Elara's decision, which makes the central turn feel convenient rather than causally inevitable, even within a fantasy context.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story demonstrates excellent causal logic and structural integrity. The plot progresses through a clean A-to-B-to-C sequence, with each discovery directly leading to the next beat. The closure is a well-executed Charged Poise (a form of Resonant Reconfiguration), crystallizing the stakes and the character's resolve on the page with a clear, felt cost of impending danger. The single-scene structure is handled flawlessly for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens successfully, building a lyrical state that deepens towards closure. The structure is simple but effective: an initial state of wandering, a commitment to a creative space, the accumulative act of creation, and a final Conceptual Repricing where the meaning of her work is understood. The closure lands with a felt cost—the passage of time and the decay of the postcard ("now little more than a memory")—making the final earned peace feel resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through atmosphere and sensory cues rather than strict causality. This structure is executed well, leading to a clear climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), lands effectively on the page with a legible cost—the shattered chime and the lingering regret—making the final state feel earned and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story establishes a clear situation and the closure provides a Decisive Change. I'm inferring an Accumulative/Textural lens, where Elara’s resolve builds to a magical climax. However, the resolution itself—Kael's sudden, magical appearance—functions as a deus ex machina that circumvents the tangible consequences of the inciting incident (the lost manuscript), creating a significant break in causality and weakening the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, and the structure is coherent with a Decisive Change for closure. However, the causal chain is built on convenience; Elias finds precisely the right clues (adhesive message, chain-poem) exactly when needed. The resolution's cost is negligible—a brief, stated "tremble"—which weakens the closure's impact, making the earned stasis feel too easily achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an effective Accumulative/Textural drive. The arrival of the letter provides a clear turning point that recontextualizes the dust motes, leading to a strong Conceptual Repricing at closure. The cost—abandoning the constructed safety of her lies—is felt, and the structure is clean and purposeful for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, which is appropriate for its reflective nature. The structure is sound, moving from setup to a memory-triggered climax and a clear closure. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing leading to Earned Stasis, lands on the page with a felt cost—relinquishing the logbook and accepting her father's absence. The causality is psychological rather than plot-driven, and it holds together effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara’s understanding of “belonging” changes. However, the inciting incident for the climax—the blaring alarms—feels arbitrary and externally imposed. It functions to force a decision but lacks the causal inevitability that would elevate the structure from merely functional to compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through internal attempts rather than external events. The closure is a well-executed Conceptual Repricing, where the protagonist's understanding of memory shifts fundamentally, representing a clear and felt cost (the release of a fixed goal). The structure is simple but perfectly scaled to the story's length, moving from a problem, through a failed attempt, to a transformative realization.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood and demonstrating a philosophy. The structure is simple and effective for the length, moving from observation to performance to a quiet reaffirmation. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing (CR) where Elias's role as an "antidote" to monotony is solidified; the cost is his solitary path, which is legible, if subtle. The plot is coherent and serves the story's aims without any causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, culminating in a strong moment of Charged Poise. The structure is sound and orientation is immediate. The primary weakness is the sentinel's abrupt departure, which feels unmotivated and convenient, softening the causal integrity of the resolution and slightly undermining the cost Lira just accepted by revealing herself.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building mood and interiority toward a single point of insight. Orientation is clear and the structure is coherent for its length. However, the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of purpose—lacks a visible or felt cost, which significantly undermines the weight of the character's final understanding and commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive perfectly. The structure is a single, continuous scene that builds pressure through reflection and symbolic interaction, not external events. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration on the page, where Elias's relationship to his pain is transformed with a felt cost ("The pain would never leave him"), and the final image of the re-weighted box lands with purpose. Causality is internal but rigorously maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds density through the protagonist's actions, leading to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where Elara accepts the transient nature of her patterns and redefines hope, lands with a felt conceptual cost—the forfeiture of her initial, logical methodology. The causality of this internal shift is earned and legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story executes a flawless Causal drive. Each discovery—the diaries, the true nature of the film strip—logically and inevitably propels the protagonist to the next action, culminating in the hidden chamber. The closure is a clean and resonant Conceptual Repricing, as the story's central question is re-framed with a palpable shift in the protagonist's purpose. The cost is felt in her acceptance of a new, lifelong responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, operating under a clear Accumulative/Textural lens. It establishes orientation efficiently and builds pressure toward a decisive climax. The closure is exceptional: a resonant reconfiguration where the mirrors are changed and the protagonist's state is altered with a definite, on-page cost ("her own heartbeat now fainter"), making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and internal fatigue, leading to a fittingly emotional climax. The closure, a Decisive Change (treaty signed) coupled with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara’s final moment of costly hope), is on-page and earned. The structure—terrace, valley, terrace—provides a tight, effective frame for the single, continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.3)
    The structure is flawless for its length, following a clean causal line (map -> location -> action) that builds toward a resonant accumulative closure. The final image of the rain beginning after her act serves as a perfect Conceptual Repricing, reconfiguring her role from destroyer to potential restorer. The felt cost—the hope of reclaiming a "fragment of her own lost humanity"—lands with precision and power.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere toward a clear climax. The structure is simple but sound for its length. The closure is excellent, delivering a Decisive Change (the city awakens), a Resonant Reconfiguration for Elara's role, and a Conceptual Repricing of the setting (snow carrying echoes), all with a clearly stated, albeit future, cost. The plot lands exactly as intended.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens: the argument leads to turmoil, which leads to reflection, which sparks an epiphany and a new plan. The closure is a Decisive Change in the protagonist's artistic purpose. However, the cost of this change—foreclosing his provocative, established method—is not felt on the page; the new path is presented as an unalloyed good, which softens the impact of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens successfully, building emotional density towards a quiet but effective closure. The ending, where Elara adds the monarch wing and accepts her work is done "for now," functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The felt cost is the monarchs' absence and the world's "interrupted cadence," which she now carries within her reaffirmed purpose. The structure is simple, elegant, and serves the story's aims perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building pressure through atmosphere and sustained effort toward a valid Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure lands with a felt cost (her years of regret, now redeemed) and redefines her purpose. While the magical causality linking a reconfigured rope to a punched card is purely symbolic, it remains coherent within the story's mythic framework and serves the chosen lens effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and focus toward a clear climax. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing (CR): the understanding of the directive shifts from a code to a map of "resonance." The cost is legible in the dissolution of the wafer seal—a key tool is sacrificed—and the realization that the quest is endless, providing a sense of both peace and new burden.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows a simple, linear A-to-B-to-C structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the causality is frictionless. Kael finds the tile almost immediately and deciphers it without any setbacks, which undermines the sense of a quest. The closure, a form of Charged Poise, lacks felt cost; Kael is simply "ready to seal the covenant" after a swift internal shift, with the required "devotion and sacrifice" remaining an un-dramatized abstraction. The plot progression feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with a single continuous scene, establishing orientation effectively. The closure is a Decisive Change that occurs on the page with a felt cost (Kael's vulnerability). However, the final turn feels compressed, making the 'therefore' link between Elara's final appeal and Kael's capitulation seem slightly too convenient for the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, effective structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure toward a clear climax. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), leaving Elara on a threshold where her options and understanding are transformed. The cost is legible in the fleetingness of the vision and the implied weight of her new potential ("her work was just beginning"), which feels earned and appropriately scaled for the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story establishes its accumulative/textural lens and delivers a clear Conceptual Repricing at closure, with the transformed vow and ribbon landing with felt cost. However, the causality leading to this closure is weak; the magical items from the bag function as convenient keys to symbolic locks. This sequence of "and then a magic item worked" undermines the sense of earned progression, feeling more like a ritualistic discovery than a plot driven by choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but its closure is critically weakened by a deus ex machina. The mysterious woman appears conveniently to explain the entire premise, resolving Elara’s confusion without any causal struggle on her part. This bypasses the need for earned discovery. The resulting closure, a Charged Poise, is on the page, but the lack of a discernible cost or trade-off makes the protagonist's transformation feel frictionless and dramatically inert.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, but its structure is critically weakened by summarizing the climax. The pivotal "renegotiation" with the guardian is told, not dramatized, which flattens the resolution and makes it feel unearned. While a Decisive Change occurs, the cost is merely stated ("it came with a price"), not demonstrated on the page, failing the cost-proof test for a high-impact ending.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and internal state toward a clear climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara re-frames her quest and steps into the garden, lands with a felt conceptual cost as the swatch card dissolves. The structure is simple but effective and fully executed within its own logic.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean and logical Causal lens from inciting incident to resolution. The closure—a Decisive Change where the door opens—is earned by the protagonist's direct actions. However, the cost is articulated abstractly ("her task was far from over") rather than felt on the page, and the final paragraph summarizes the resolution's meaning instead of letting the final image resonate on its own, which slightly softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain (Lens: Causal), and the closure (Decisive Change) lands on the page. However, the plot progression is linear to a fault, lacking any significant reversal or complication. The dormant seed presents a minor obstacle that is resolved immediately with the same method used before, which deflates the tension. The on-page cost is minimal ("body weary"), weakening the impact of the earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean, causal progression under a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens, with a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration for closure. The cost of the final change—Elara's memories—is explicit and paid on the page. The plot mechanics are slightly weakened by the convenient, off-page discovery of the memory sacrifice ritual in the "ancient texts."

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural structure, moving from observation to a potent sensory climax. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Elara's role is deepened with a felt emotional cost ("deepening hush"). Causality holds perfectly under this lens, creating a coherent and satisfying arc.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional pressure through a sequence of symbolic actions. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming the fortress from a place of despair to a beacon. The felt cost—the temporary nature of the fix and Lira's departure—is subtle but legible, earning the hopeful final image.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure excels under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The story builds from a state of quiet contemplation to a moment of revelation, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure, Elara's decision to return to Kael with a new understanding, carries the felt cost of transforming their relationship and her role. The narrative progression is seamless and purposeful for this type of internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure toward a single release. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; Elara's internal state is irrevocably altered with the felt cost of having to return to the bunker. The causal link between the oppressive setting and her decisive action during the limited window of opportunity is seamless and holds perfectly for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, building a sequence of quiet moments that lead to the resolution. Orientation is excellent and the structure is sound for its length. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira's emotional state has visibly shifted, with the felt cost being her confrontation with her own anxiety, making for an effective, if gentle, arc.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean, logical causal chain from one discovery to the next, fulfilling the requirements for a Causal drive lens. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where the throne's meaning is redefined, is a valid and satisfying way to conclude the narrative arc. However, the structure feels somewhat frictionless and predictable, like a sequence of solved puzzles, which prevents it from reaching the highest tier of structural ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain under the Causal lens. Orientation is swift, the inciting incident is clear, and the climax leads directly to a Decisive Change with a legible cost (the severed scar). The resulting Earned Stasis—a vigil renewed by loss—provides a powerful and resonant closure that is fully executed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clean, causal structure with a clear orientation and a valid closure unit (Conceptual Repricing). However, the plot lacks a legible on-page cost; Elara's success is achieved without significant risk, sacrifice, or a difficult choice. This frictionless resolution undermines the earnedness of the final change, making the victory feel too convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain and achieves a legible Conceptual Repricing at its closure. The central flaw is the resolution's convenience; the conflict is solved not by overcoming an obstacle but by a mysterious figure literally handing Eleanor the answer. This deus ex machina in the form of the journal-wielding figure severely undermines the sense of an earned discovery, making the plot feel too frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. Orientation is immediate and clear, and the structure builds pressure through sensory and atmospheric details, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration for the character. The closure lands with a distinct, felt cost (the loss of the program, the shedding of the gauntlet) that is fully legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building meaning through the accretion of connected details. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elara's internal state and perception of the room are altered with a clear, felt cost tied to her own past. The structure is sound and purposeful for the chosen mode, landing its emotional shift effectively on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean, Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages from the map to the key to the archive. The closure is a well-executed Charged Poise, reconfiguring the stakes with the felt cost of Mara's now-threatened survival. The structure is efficient and effective for the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly. The structure builds pressure through intensifying atmospheric details rather than causal turns, leading to a clear Decisive Change (prophecy dissolved) and an Earned Stasis (tranquility restored). The closure lands cleanly on the page with a felt cost of effort, making the magical causality feel earned within its own rules.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). However, the central turn—where the leaves reveal the speck's purpose—relies on a passive reception of information rather than character agency. This softens the causal chain, making the plot feel more like a gentle unfolding than a structured progression driven by Elara's choices against opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, where the structure coheres around a symbolic journey rather than strict causality. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of the tinkerer's purpose, is legible and occurs on the page. The cost—the abandonment of his former craft—is clear, making the final transformation feel significant within the story's fable-like logic.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a strong Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere to a single, decisive intensification. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "names," is anchored by the tangible change in the coin and the felt cost of processing her regret into resolve. The mystical causality is handled with consistency and purpose, making the structure feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal-drive structure: pursuit, encounter, action (music), confession, and resolution. Orientation is established immediately, and the closure—a Decisive Change for the soul and a Resonant Reconfiguration for Elara and her harp—lands cleanly on the page. The felt cost is legible in the spent tooth and Elara's recurring "ache," making the resolution earned and satisfying for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmospheric pressure toward a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The closure lands cleanly with a visible cost—the release of the strap. The structure is simple but perfectly suited to the internal, reflective nature of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal drive (fragment -> painting -> map -> tower). The structure is logical, orientation is immediate, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the stories are reclaimed and the fragment's purpose is fulfilled—lands with a clear, albeit subtle, cost. The plot feels slightly convenient in its discoveries but is impeccably executed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, with each discovery logically prompting the next action. The structure is a tight, single continuous scene, perfectly suited for the length. The closure, a Decisive Change where the clock is fixed and ghosts appeased, lands effectively, and the final line provides the necessary conceptual cost by reframing his "closure" as merely a temporary pause in an ongoing duty.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through a sequence of evocative discoveries. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where Elara's understanding of her world and purpose is fundamentally reconfigured with a clear before/after state. The cost—the loss of her orderly, predictable worldview—is legible in this final reconfiguration, making the structure highly effective for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the causal logic is sound and closure is achieved with cost, the story's structure is deeply flawed. Over half the narrative is dedicated to backstory and setup, leaving the climax feeling rushed and more like a synopsis of events than a dramatized scene. This extreme imbalance violates the Backstory/Reflection Policy and cripples the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, with each discovery propelling the next action. The structure is a highly compressed quest narrative, which works for the length but makes the journey feel summarized rather than experienced. The closure is strong: the decisive change (tether snapping) happens on the page with a legible cost (the chip's magic is spent), providing a satisfying resolution to the central problem.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an effective Accumulative/Textural drive, building mystery toward a strong Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where Elara accepts the unknown and relinquishes the compass, lands with a clear and resonant cost. The causal chain is primarily atmospheric and thematic, which suits the lens, and the structure is clean and purposeful, guiding the reader from a mundane exterior to a sublime interior without a single misstep.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.5)
    The plot follows a clear causal chain from the inciting incident (finding the slide) to the resolution (the revelation in the chamber). The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where Mara accepts a new purpose, is legible. However, the progression is overly convenient; the storm stills, the slide provides perfect guidance, and the secret passage opens without any real obstacle or setback. This frictionless journey undermines the sense of earned discovery, making the structure functional but dramatically inert.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story structure is excellent for its length, following a clean two-shard design (studio -> cathedral -> studio) that serves the accumulative/textural drive. The plot advances through a deepening of understanding, not external events. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where the goal of recreating a dream is re-weighted as a personal act of acceptance and peace, with a clear felt cost. The causal logic of this internal journey is sound and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear and effective structure for its length, moving from setup to a decisive confrontation. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens is well-supported, culminating in a resonant Charged Poise closure. The final image of the sands holding their breath successfully reconfigures the emotional stakes, and the cost—that the journey is far from over—is clearly felt, making the ending earned and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clean Causal lens from inciting incident to a Decisive Change at the end. However, the closure's cost is weak; Elara's departure is framed as her purpose, not a sacrifice. The sudden introduction of "the last wish had been granted" near the end introduces a new, unearned magical logic that slightly undermines the established alchemical premise, creating a minor causality wobble right before the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal structure is clear and the story achieves a resonant closure. However, the plot relies heavily on the convenience of the third-grade memory, which feels like an overly neat key for a lock. This contrivance weakens the sense of earned discovery, making the causal chain feel more directed than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clean, Causal lens: a goal is set, a key action is taken, and a result follows, leading to a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The structure is sound and passes the Orientation Test. However, the progression is frictionless; the key works on the first try without complication or cost, which makes the resolution feel too easy. The closure lands, but its foundation lacks the pressure of a genuine obstacle overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural to Causal structure, culminating in an on-page closure (a Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing). The primary weakness is the legibility of cost. The transformation into a "keeper of secrets" is framed as a pure apotheosis, lacking a felt price or the foreclosure of a genuinely desired alternative path, which softens the impact of the "zero hour" threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively, building pressure through a sequence of mystical intensifications. The structure is coherent, with a clear setup, development, and resolution. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration on the page, where the lantern's power is transferred to Lira, signifying an earned internal stasis with the legible cost of the object's purpose being fulfilled.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural structure, moving from discovery to accumulation to final ritual. The closure, a Decisive Change for the land, is on the page. However, the causal links are soft, relying on conveniences like "he understood through contextual clues" and "whispers in the wind that seemed to guide him," which weakens the plot's integrity and makes the protagonist's progress feel passive and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot progresses logically but relies on a significant coincidence for its resolution: the one person with all the answers happens to visit the garage sale and immediately spots the key item. This convenience undermines the Causal lens. The structure feels more like a summary of events than a series of dramatized scenes. Closure is a Decisive Change (activating the device), but the cost is negligible; the solution is presented without a meaningful struggle, weakening the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clear, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The inciting incident (the falling kite) is a coincidence that enables the resolution, which is acceptable for this mode. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands with a tangible cost (the poet gives away her talisman feather). However, the causal chain of emotional healing feels too frictionless and linear, lacking the micro-turns or setbacks that would make the final harmony feel more deeply earned.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building toward a resonant closure of Earned Stasis. The structure is coherent, with the discovery of the carvings providing a logical deepening of purpose. The final on-page action and image land with the clear, felt cost of Elias's impending death, which has framed the narrative from the beginning.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story effectively uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and imagery toward a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the climax. The structure is a simple, elegant ascent that serves the internal journey well. The closure lands on the page as Elara redefines "homecoming" and completes the circuit with her amber, with the cost being the forfeiture of her professional skepticism, which is a legible reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure is an elegant, single-scene arc of arrival, action, and departure that builds to a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis, lands with a clear felt cost—the weight of centuries and memory—and the final image of the blooming jetty reconfigures the initial desolation into a space of charged potential.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, but the closure, a Conceptual Repricing, is weakened by a vague causal link. The revelation is summarized ("images...voices...motif") rather than dramatized, making the epiphany feel unearned. While the final image provides a clear "after" state, the lack of a legible on-page cost for Elias's transformation softens its impact significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, coherently building toward its closure. The final moment is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Elara's stance shifts from confused outcast to purposeful guide. The cost is the acceptance of her lonely, burdensome calling, which is felt in her "quiet resolve." The structure is simple but effective for this length and mode, with no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean, Causal structure with clear orientation and a decisive change at its conclusion. The final turn—the lid being a key, not a tool—is effective. However, the mechanism of the climax relies on a vague "surge of energy" and "ancient magic," softening the causal link between the chess game's "secret" and the actual resolution. The cost is felt, but the final linkage is more symbolic than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive exceptionally well. The structure builds coherently from symbolic observation (chessboard) to a climactic ritual (walking the words), leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration for the protagonist. The closure lands cleanly on the page with a felt cost—the re-evaluation of her past identity—making the before/after state legible and earned within this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building internal pressure toward a Conceptual Repricing of "home." The closure lands on the page, and the cost (enduring past pain) is legible. However, the inciting incident—finding the one-of-a-kind stone just as she needs it—relies on convenience, slightly weakening the causal chain leading to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural structure. The progression from the village to the labyrinth’s core builds a coherent symbolic pressure. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "forgiveness," lands with a clear, felt cost—the acceptance of an ongoing journey, not an end state. The plot is slightly weakened by the literal message at the climax, which feels less earned than a purely symbolic or imagistic revelation would have been.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through layered imagery and atmospheric response rather than strict causal turns. The structure is sound for its length, moving from approach to intensification to a clear climax. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the meaning of forgiveness is re-framed, and the cost—surrendering a "shard of her heart"—is made explicit and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building symbolic weight that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The structure is coherent: a problem is investigated, a trigger is activated, a crisis occurs, and an internal shift resolves it. The final image of the workshop steadying in response to her words provides a clean, if symbolic, closure with the felt cost of accepting a fragile, imperfect existence.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story's structure is elegant and effective for its length, adhering to a clear Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The 'wrong turn' is a well-handled coincidence that enables, rather than resolves, the plot. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara’s internal state shifts, is earned on the page with a clear 'before and after' demonstrated by her interaction with the public, and the cost is the release of her isolating perfectionism.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building mood effectively toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the closure is critically weakened by the appearance of the woman, a deus ex machina who resolves the central question by literally voicing the theme. Coincidence is used to solve the core problem, not merely complicate it, which undermines the protagonist's agency in achieving his own epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and compelling causal chain from inciting incident to resolution. The ending lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), establishing Mara's new, ongoing role with a clear, felt cost—the relentless, cyclical nature of her task. The structure is efficient and the closure is strong, making this a high-performing category.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens. The plot progresses logically from inciting incident to resolution without any breaks in causality. The closure, a Decisive Change combined with a Conceptual Repricing, is executed on the page with a clear, felt cost—the renunciation of the relic and the burden of a new understanding. The structure is simple but perfectly suited to the story's length and scope.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building pressure through atmosphere and discovery rather than direct causal events. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure, a form of Conceptual Repricing where Elias accepts the stranger's memories, is rendered on the page with a clear, felt cost—the burden of carrying another's story. The entire structure is elegant, coherent, and serves the quiet nature of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story fails structurally, functioning as a plot summary over several months rather than a pressurized, self-contained narrative. Causality relies on a linear sequence of convenient discoveries ("and then..."), not character agency. The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, but its impact is severely diluted by the summary-style ending that tells the reader the outcome instead of dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal lens structure for its length, with a defined inciting incident and a clear closure unit (Decisive Change). The primary weakness is that the climactic turn is delivered via exposition from the starlight entity, which resolves the core mystery through explanation rather than a choice made under pressure, softening the impact of the final change.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmospheric density toward a clear climax and resolution. The structure is sound for its length, and orientation is handled well. However, the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of "presence"—lacks a visible or deeply felt cost. The experience is framed entirely as a "gift," which diminishes the stakes of the transformation and makes the ending feel emotionally frictionless, a significant flaw for this literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building internal pressure toward a clear climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, is achieved on the page as Elara's perspective shifts from envy to gratitude, foreclosing her prior self-destructive path. The cost is the shedding of this "feral nostalgia," a felt emotional price that enables her to write again, making the before/after state legible.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, building emotional weight around the central object. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing (CR) that recontextualizes Elara's loss with a felt cost. The structure is sound and effective for this length, with a clear before-and-after in Elara's understanding of her own condition.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) lens. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, is legible and earned when Elara achieves calm. The cost—confronting past fears—is felt, and the final image of the smooth quill provides a decisive 'after' state. The causal chain is tight and appropriate for the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. It builds pressure through atmosphere and memory, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration for the protagonist. The closure lands with a clear felt cost—the orchard will still be lost, but its meaning is preserved—making the internal shift earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building a mood toward a final insight. The structure is a simple, linear journey. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the witness's role is redefined from observer to participant. However, the causal links are weak and mystical; the resolution happens *to* the witness through magical realignments rather than as a result of earned choices under pressure. The cost is purely conceptual, lacking a visceral or tangible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens that shifts to Causal for the resolution. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing (CR), re-framing Elias's purpose. However, the inciting incident for this closure—dropping the key and noticing the notch for the first time—is a coincidence that resolves the central problem, which significantly weakens the causal chain and sense of earnedness.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere to a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The single-scene structure is clean and orientation is strong. The main weakness is in the causality of the climax; the stranger's arrival and dialogue feel more like a convenient thematic delivery system than an inevitable development, softening the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through reflection and atmosphere. The structure is coherent, and orientation is established immediately. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), lands effectively as Elara's internal state shifts to one of quiet resolve, with the felt cost being the emotional burden of the quest she accepts. The final image of the blank notebook as a canvas is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural drive lens to great effect, building pressure through repetition rather than strict causality. The structure is flawless for its length, delivering an on‑page Decisive Change (Eli’s final phone call) that carries the felt cost of abandoning his self‑protective isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts her role. However, the plot is a frictionless information quest; the path from the locket to the complete story via Mara is overly convenient, lacking any meaningful complication. The closure lands, but its conceptual cost—the "weight" of the covenant—is asserted rather than made palpable through a demonstrated sacrifice or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmosphere toward a single transformative event. The final Conceptual Repricing, where loneliness is reframed as something to be actively mended, provides a clear before/after closure. The plot's main weakness is that the resolution is delivered to the protagonist rather than achieved through a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, single-shard structure that perfectly fits its length. The plot advances via an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory details. The closure is an excellent example of Conceptual Repricing: the final realization at the stillpoint redefines the entire journey as internal, landing with the felt cost of the compass ring's permanent stasis, which serves as a powerful final image.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with a decisive change at its closure. The structure is sound for its length, and orientation is handled well. However, the resolution lacks a clearly legible cost; Elara solves the problem, gains peace and comfort, and loses nothing of consequence, which softens the impact of the climax and makes the victory feel less earned.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story operates successfully under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building mood toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where Elara finds her "voice" in the camera's silent capture, lands with a felt cost of solitude. However, the inciting incident for this closure—the camera clicking on its own—is an external magical event that resolves an internal struggle, which slightly softens the earnedness of the climax and feels more convenient than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.5)
    The plot follows a clear and logical causal chain (clue A leads to clue B), and orientation is handled well. However, the structure lacks any meaningful turns or reversals, proceeding as a linear sequence of successes. The closure, a Decisive Change in finding the scroll, is weakened by a lack of tangible cost; the final emotional release feels asserted rather than earned through on-page sacrifice or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. It builds pressure through atmosphere and sensory detail, culminating in a resonant cadence shift when the lagoon hums. The closure is a clear Decisive Change in Elara's internal state and purpose, with the cost felt in the transformation of her sorrow into something purifying. The structure is tight, orienting the reader quickly and using its single scene to maximum effect.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    The plot advances through a sequence of conveniently found magical objects (coin, map, key), culminating in Mira coincidentally possessing the matching lock. While this weakens the causal chain, the closure itself—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the labyrinth is reframed as a test of will—lands effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure successfully builds atmospheric pressure toward this final image, but the reliance on coincidence prevents it from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and quiet pressure that leads to a resonant conclusion. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of the stranger's emotional state, is earned on the page and has a felt cost (the painful confession). The structure is simple but elegant, with each element—the setting, the mirror, the shutters—contributing to the final, cathartic image. The narrative logic is sound and effective for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the structure is a simple, linear summary of intent-to-execution. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, feels unearned as it arrives without any on-page struggle, complication, or opposition. The cost of Elias's "tireless work" is told, not felt, which significantly weakens the final payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, where events intensify an internal state rather than causing each other directly. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, is on the page with the felt cost of letting go. However, the magical appearance of the island and the barrier's dissolution feel somewhat convenient, making the structure feel preordained rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered imagery and atmosphere rather than external plot events. The structure is a single, coherent scene that effectively tracks an internal shift. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis where Elara's resolve hardens, is a resonant and earned reconfiguration with a clear, felt cost represented by the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is executed flawlessly. The story establishes its anchors early and builds atmospheric pressure with rhythmic intensity. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, where the poet's identity is rewritten with the felt cost of surrender ("dissolve," "let go"). The final image of carrying the colonnade's song within them makes the change legible and lasting, fulfilling the demands of this narrative mode with elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a mood that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration. The structure is sound for its length. However, the closure is weakened because the cost—accepting his limitation—is conceptual and lacks a palpable on-page price, and the final beat dissolves into thematic summary instead of landing on a charged, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean and effective for this length, operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The story orients the reader efficiently, and the progression from inciting incident (noticing the lens) to the series of revelations is logical. The closure is a well-executed Conceptual Repricing, where Elara’s mission is reweighted by a new understanding, with the cost of her exhaustion and the burden of a more complex purpose made legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, where Elara's rituals build pressure for a magical event. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, provides a clear before/after state. However, the resolution lacks a legible cost; her renewal is granted by the observatory without any sacrifice or trade-off, softening the impact of the change and making the magical causality feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens from the inciting incident (Mira's arrival) to its conclusion. The structure is sound and effective for its length. The closure is a well-executed Charged Poise, reconfiguring the characters' situation from observers to participants, with the immense cost of the societal collapse framing their newfound, dangerous knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is exemplary for its length, holding a single, continuous scene with perfect focus. The narrative logic is tight, hinging on a clever and earned turn: the protagonist's rule to "avoid patterns" leads her to recognize a deliberately *erased* pattern. This launches a clean Conceptual Repricing at the end, where the pagoda's function is re-contextualized with a clear, felt cost (the end of innocence), fully satisfying the closure requirement under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is very effective. It builds atmosphere and deepens the central mystery, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the shadow's nature is revealed and re-contextualized. The closure lands with a clear felt cost ("a surge of luminous regret, a sorrow so profound"). The discovery of the key vial feels slightly convenient, but it serves as a catalyst in a way that fits the story's lyrical, non-causal focus.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) for its closure. The final action—placing the chameleon's tail tip on a shelf—makes the internal shift tangible, creating a legible before/after state. The cost is the articulated loss of naivety, which lands with sufficient weight for this structure, though its emotional texture could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clear Hybrid (Accumulative-to-Causal) structure, which is well-suited for its length. The plot progression is logical, moving from a static puzzle to a decisive action. The closure, a Decisive Change where reuniting the hourglasses heals Elara, is on-page and legible, with the emotional cost paid during the journey through the tunnel. The structure is a significant strength.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively. The structure is clean: setup, discovery, and closure. The final beat provides a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Elara's purpose shifts from seeking to acting, with the felt cost of this new responsibility. The plot is conceptually driven and the causality of discovery is sound, making the ending feel both inevitable and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. It establishes a state, deepens it through reflection and ritual, and resolves into a Charged Poise. The closure, where Lira is ready to begin her journey, lands on the page with a clear felt cost—the "fear" and the commitment to a "fraught" path. Orientation is excellent and the structure is coherent and effective for the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear and coherent causal chain, adhering to the Causal lens. Orientation is handled well, and the closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing, which is a valid form. The primary weakness is the frictionless plot progression; the clock is precisely the key needed, and the solution arrives without significant struggle or complication, slightly undermining the earnedness of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a series of strange experiences that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The closure is clear—Eamon's purpose is reconfigured. However, the inciting mechanism for the climax—the small gear fitting perfectly into the colossal machine—relies on coincidence, which softens the causal integrity even for an accumulative structure. The plot feels more discovered than driven by choice.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural drive, building meaning through its journey. The structure is a clean, effective two-shard sequence (crossing and ascent) leading to a well-executed Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the close. The moment Mara realizes the star has been transferred to her provides a legible before/after with a felt cost—the life she renounced. The logic is internally consistent, and the ferryman's reappearance provides satisfying, if surreal, narrative closure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The plot follows a clean and effective causal chain under a Causal lens, moving from discovery (the stain) to a consequential climax. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "silence" and "safety," lands on the page with the felt cost of knowledge ("heavy with knowledge"). While the magical bolt as a revelatory device is somewhat convenient, it functions within the established speculative tone and delivers a solid structural payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story demonstrates a strong, clean causal structure under a Causal lens. The plot escalates logically from Elara's initial move to the pretender's response, and then to the final confrontation. The closure is a decisive change with a visible cost—the pretender's public failure—that lands cleanly on the page and resolves the central conflict. The time compression is handled effectively for a fable-like narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building pressure through observation and reflection toward a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR). The closure, where the page is re-contextualized as a preserved warning, lands with palpable conceptual cost. The structure is simple, elegant, and perfectly suited to the story's length and ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively, building to its climax. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Lira's purpose is crystallized with a felt cost—the acceptance of a new burden. The plot mechanism (magic glasses + magic rocks) is simple but structurally sound for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is clear until the climax, but the plot is critically weakened by the guard's unexplained disappearance. This convenient removal of the primary obstacle feels unearned and deflates the tension right before the unsealing. The closure, while present, is built on a foundation of undermined causality, lessening its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean, simple structure (setup, inciting incident, climax, resolution) appropriate for its length. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the causal link for the central emotional turn is weak; the leap from near-death terror to a profound, articulated realization ("a pearl of stillness amidst the storm") feels psychologically abrupt and unmotivated, softening the impact of the otherwise solid structure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens beautifully. The structure is a single, coherent scene that builds psychological pressure toward a clear closure moment. The ending is an effective Conceptual Repricing, where the meaning of darkness and light is re-evaluated with a tangible felt cost (the acceptance of the ache). The internal causality is strong and the final ascent feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is exemplary for its length, following a clear causal chain that leads to a potent climax. The closure is a successful Conceptual Repricing: the ink is redefined from a tool of control to a mirror for understanding, with the cost being Elara's acceptance of her grief. The plot adheres perfectly to the single-scene scope, delivering a complete and resonant arc without waste.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean, compelling causal chain from inciting incident to climax. Orientation is immediate and effective. The closure is a well-executed Charged Poise, landing on the page with a clearly felt cost as Elara faces the consequences of her actions, making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear causal structure (threat appears -> protagonist must choose) and lands on a valid closure of Earned Stasis. The primary weakness is the use of summary in the penultimate paragraph ("As the days passed..."). This condenses the crucial process of adaptation and fortification into telling, which lessens the impact of the final image by skipping the causal steps that would make her new state feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural structure. The pressure builds through atmosphere and Kael's focused action, leading to a climax that feels earned within the story's lyric logic. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the garden's harmony is restored at the cost of the goddess's departure, and Kael's understanding is reconfigured. The before/after state is legible and carries a felt, if subtle, price.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean Causal lens from the call to the final intervention, and the closure is a clear Decisive Change (recalibrating the telescope). However, the structure is weakened by summarizing a key confrontational beat—the meeting with the director. This flattens the rising action and reduces the feeling of direct pressure, making the final choice feel less costly and consequential on the page than it is in concept.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story uses an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and memory until the letters trigger the final turn. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the lab's silence mirrors Elara's inner peace, lands cleanly with a felt cost. The convenient discovery of the exact right letters is the only minor strain on causality.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a strong Accumulative/Textural drive. It builds pressure through intensifying atmosphere and imagery rather than plot turns, which is a perfect fit for the lens. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Elara accepts the unease as a permanent guide. The cost is felt in this acceptance, and the structure is lean and effective for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Adopting an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story's structure is coherent and effective. It builds from observation to reflection to a culminating symbolic act. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), lands cleanly with the transformed mosaic representing a new potential. The cost is the implied future struggle, which is legible in the final image of a first step taken against an overwhelming reality.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, Causal structure appropriate for its length, moving from setup to a clear climax and resolution. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara reaffirms her cyclical purpose, is effective and lands on the page. The magical causality is internally consistent, though the cost to Mara—endless encores—could be felt more sharply in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, moving effectively from unease to a final state of Charged Poise. The structure is coherent for this mode, and the closure lands with a clear, resonant image. However, the causal link for the story's main turn—how she forms her plan—is weak, relying on the un-dramatized "somatic markers" as a black box, which slightly undermines the earnedness of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building a sequence of discoveries that lead to a coherent climax. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing, successfully re-framing Elara's work and future. However, the plot relies on a "follow the magic" structure where causality is external and convenient. The final sense of purpose reads as a pure gain, making the felt cost of this transformation too faint for the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story effectively uses an Accumulative/Textural drive, building toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at its closure. The structure is clean and orientation is solid. However, the closure lacks a sufficiently legible cost; Elara gains wisdom and purpose, and the stated burden of this knowledge ("her work was far from over") feels more like a sequel hook than a price paid on the page, softening the final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building mood effectively toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at the close. However, the plot's central turn—the discovery of the letter—relies on a convenient coincidence. The "codes in the snow" lead her to a perfectly preserved letter from a "thought lost" person, which functions as an external solution to her internal problem, weakening the causal chain leading to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere until the central beat. The arrival of the figure provides a clear tightening point, shifting the coachman's understanding. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the "promise" is re-defined, and the cost is the loss of a simple quest for a more complex "way of seeing," which is legible and earned within the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building discoveries until a final realization. The structure is coherent and orientation is solid. However, the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the oasis begins to heal—lacks a visible or felt cost. Elara achieves peace and community restoration without any trade-off, which significantly lessens the impact of the ending and makes the resolution feel too easy.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere rather than strict causality. Orientation is clear, and the structure is sound for its length, moving from observation to interaction seamlessly. The closure is a well-executed Charged Poise, landing on a resonant final image, with the cost being a shift from solitude to a shared vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    The plot structure is simple, clear, and effective for the story's length, adhering to an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. Orientation is established immediately, and the progression from the library's edge to its core is logical. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration, with Elena’s state definitively changed on the page, and the conceptual cost of her old self being shed is legible. The causal link between the sundial key and the door provides a satisfying, if conventional, set-up and payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmospheric details towards a resonant final image. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, lands with a felt cost (leaving the talisman). However, the plot relies on the convenience of the twig fitting "perfectly into a small groove," which slightly undermines the earned nature of the discovery and feels like a soft resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a strong causal lens, with each discovery logically leading to the next action. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis, is executed effectively; Elara's tactical victory comes at the cost of accepting a perpetual, lonely struggle, which lands with resonance. The plot's only minor weakness is the convenient speed with which she identifies the subsonic frequencies and devises a perfect countermeasure, slightly compressing the central struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through atmosphere and internal state toward a legible closure. The final beat provides a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's perception of her environment and self is transformed. The felt cost is present in the "wistful rebellion," but it could have been slightly more tangible to elevate the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and internal reflection. The structure is efficient for its length, with the appearance of the figure providing a sharp mid-point turn. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist's internal state shifts with a legible cost—the case remains unsolved, but her approach to it has been transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a strong, clear Causal lens from discovery to climax. The closure is a Decisive Change, resulting in the station's return to normal. However, the cost of this change is conceptually vague; the binary choice between "restore or to protect" is presented without enough context, which slightly softens the impact and legibility of the price paid in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear causal A-to-B-to-C structure, and the closure (finding the sanctuary) provides a resolution to the central mystery. However, the plot's key turns rely on convenience, particularly when the "once abstract" images on the glass flake suddenly align with the landscape. The conceptual repricing of "amnesty" lands, but the felt cost of the journey is negligible, weakening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural structure, where Elias gathers clues that build to a final realization. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of his father's maxim, is valid and ties the narrative threads together. However, the felt cost of this resolution is muted; the "heart at peace" ending softens the emotional weight of the father's failure, slightly undermining the price of the newfound understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes an effective Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is swift, and the progression from observation to insight is logical. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of Elara's role and pain, lands cleanly with a felt cost—the acceptance of her own vulnerability. The plot is simple but structurally sound and well-suited to the story's length and aims.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal lens, where each action logically propels the narrative toward its conclusion. The structure is simple but robust for its length, with a clear setup, escalation, and climax. The closure is a strong on-page Decisive Change (the confession) leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration of Eira's state, with the cost of confronting her past failure being both visible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    The plot is a clear and functional causal chain (find key, enter maze, solve maze), and the closure is a Decisive Change. However, it falters on the "cost proof test." The mending of the covenant is achieved without any immediate, on-page price; the scars are a historical cost, not a price paid in the climax, which makes the resolution feel too frictionless for a high-tier story.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot advances through an intensification of atmosphere and internal pressure, culminating in a well-defined closure unit. The final beat provides a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Elara reaffirms her choice, with the cost—her forfeited life—made tangible and explicitly accepted. The causality is psychological and coherent within its established lens.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building an internal state that leads to a clear on-page Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure, where Elias reframes the scrap as a "bridge to his future," is effective and carries the felt cost of abandoning a passive search for an active, more difficult creation of purpose. The structure is tight, well-oriented, and perfectly suited to the story's length and scope.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, with each step logically building to the next. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, as the "physics of transition" is re-evaluated as a lived experience, not just a theory. This final realization lands with a clear felt cost—the transformation of her haunting ambition into earned peace—making the structure highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear, single-scene structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural) lens, resolving with a Conceptual Repricing. However, the closure is weakened by a *deus ex machina*; the whisper "By accepting contradictions, you will find clarity" provides the thematic key without Elara having to earn it through action or failure. This external intervention softens the causality of her internal resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain of discovery, and the plot is well-structured for its length. The closure is a classic Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), establishing Elara's new purpose and the journey ahead. The primary weakness is the legibility of the cost; it's presented as a future burden rather than a price paid or felt viscerally in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is simple and potent, building atmosphere and internal pressure toward a quiet but decisive closure. The ending achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elara's understanding of her quest shifts. The cost—the acceptance of ongoing pain as part of the journey—is felt in the final image of “raw solace,” making the closure earned and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is clean and effective for this length, following an Accumulative/Textural lens where atmosphere and discovery build toward a re-evaluation of purpose. The closure, a Charged Poise, lands perfectly; the protagonist leaves with a new mission, having paid the price of gaining a heavy responsibility. The plot causality is magical and internal, which the story teaches and maintains consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal lens, moving from setup to a decisive action with legible stakes. The closure unit is a strong combination of a Decisive Change (the violin is spent) and Charged Poise (the threat remains, but a temporary victory is won). The cost is made tangible and felt on the page ("opaque and lifeless," the lingering ache), fulfilling the rubric's requirements for a high-quality ending.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows a clear, single-scene structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing of "stillness." The closure is on the page, but its causality is weakened by the traveler's convenient appearance and disappearance, which functions as a thematic delivery system rather than an organic development. The cost—abandoning her old worldview—is legible but its emotional weight is undercut by the speed of her acceptance, softening the impact of the before/after change.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    Following a Hybrid (Accumulative dominant) lens, the structure is sound. The plot progresses from one magical discovery to the next, which is acceptable for this mode. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing that lands on the page. However, the cost—processing lifetimes of experience—is summarized in a single sentence ("Visions flooded her mind..."), which lessens its impact and feels expedient.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood and symbolic weight toward a quiet resolution. Orientation is handled well. The closure, an act of Charged Poise where Elias completes his task and dispatches the potential solution to Mara, is on thepage and provides a sense of finality to his involvement. The causal chain is symbolic (chimes inform letter) but consistent with the story's internal logic, making the structure effective for its length and aims.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens for its single, continuous scene. The structure (meditation -> confrontation -> decision -> action) is logical and propels the narrative forward. The closure is a clear Decisive Change, and the cost is felt in the final line ("heavy but unburdened"), successfully creating a legible before/after state for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure is simple but potent: a build-up of atmosphere that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The closure lands with a clear conceptual cost—the renunciation of external seeking for internal presence—and is entirely consistent with the story's established logic. Orientation and causality are handled with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Causal structure is straightforward and functional, and the closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing. However, the plot is weakened by the convenient success of the mist walking harness. While foreshadowed, its perfect operation for a character defined by failure feels like a soft resolution, weakening the causal link between struggle and victory and making the cost feel abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story uses a clean two-shard structure, and the Accumulative/Textural drive lens is held consistently. The magical causality (key pulsing, light appearing) is appropriate for the genre. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where the final image of the sky lanterns reweights the entire narrative with a felt cost—the beginning of a long journey. The plot moves with a dreamlike logic that feels intentional and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, where each action logically enables the next, culminating in a powerful closure. The ending is a perfect example of a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), shifting Lira from a state of doubt to one of clear, purposeful action. The conceptual cost—the immense weight of navigating the universe's rebirth—is made palpable in the final moments, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and internal weight toward a clear closure moment. The ending achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration, as Elara's purpose is transformed, not merely restored. The cost is felt on the page through the "weight of their choices," making the before/after state potent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, where patient, rhythmic actions build toward a cadence shift. The plot is simple but effective, with clear orientation and a well-executed closure. The final image—a single wave breaking the ocean’s silence—serves as an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting the world's state with a felt cost of the immense task still ahead. The mystical causality holds consistently within this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a clear two-act structure, but the inciting incident relies on the high coincidence of a "trail of photographs" conveniently leading to the story's core object. While the final change in the town is causally linked to Elias's actions, the resolution lacks a palpable cost. The conflict is resolved too neatly, which undermines the narrative's structural integrity and emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building a sequence of evocative moments that lead to a Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the closure fails the rubric’s strict cost requirement. The transformation is presented as an unalloyed gain without a visible or felt price on the page; she simply sheds her old conflict. Without a legible cost foreclosing a prior path, the change lacks the weight required for a top-tier rating.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure builds effectively from observation and reflection to an internal climax and resolution. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the mission is complete, but the "watcher's burden" remains, a felt cost that recharges the final image. The plot is internal and slight, but it is coherent and complete for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens, culminating in a strong Decisive Change closure unit on the page. The symbolic causality—the duel leading to integration—is internally consistent and well-motivated by the setup. The final shattering of the jar and merging of essence provides a legible before/after state, with the cost being the final forfeiture of the separate 'duplicate' identity. The structure is simple but effective for the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal lens and delivers a valid closure unit (Charged Poise) that reconfigures the protagonist's purpose with a felt cost. The structure is sound and orientation is handled well. The primary weakness is the central causal link at the climax; the decision to drop the key in the brook is motivated by a vague "strange pull," which feels convenient rather than earned after his days of systematic study.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The plot is a single, continuous intensification of an action, leading to a Decisive Change—the return of laughter. The closure is earned on the page, with the cost of Eli's exhaustion ("chest heaving") making the resolution feel paid for and resonant. The structure is simple but perfectly suited to the story's mythic scope.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot progresses from atmospheric wandering to a decisive confrontation that clarifies the central choice. The closure is a strong example of Earned Stasis, where Elara’s refusal to use the pendant forecloses the path home at a clear, felt cost—the continuation of her homesickness in exchange for the library's safety. The mechanics of the ending are flawless for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.5)
    The Causal lens holds, and the story delivers a clean Decisive Change with a felt cost at the end. However, the central turn is driven by a convenient, off-page-feeling realization rather than being forced by escalating scene pressure, which slightly softens the causal chain leading to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative follows a clear causal sequence under a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens. However, the closure—a Decisive Change where the city is reborn—lacks a legible cost. Elara gives up old beliefs, but this is presented as a pure, frictionless gain, weakening the story's structural integrity. The cost-proof test reveals this critical gap in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a linear causal structure, but the resolution relies on a late-breaking rule change that harms causality. The empty hourglass, defined by its lack of sand, is suddenly able to channel energy and reset time, a capability not foreshadowed. This *deus ex machina* at the climax undermines the logical integrity of the closure, making the Decisive Change feel convenient rather than earned through established mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through imagery and internal shifts rather than plot mechanics. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where Elara's understanding is reweighted with a felt cost, visualized in the "tangled mess" of thread. The structure is clean and effective for the chosen lens and length.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clean causal chain under a Hybrid (dominant Causal) lens. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), lands effectively in the final paragraph, reweighting the initial tension. The final image of Elara feeling the "strange resonance" provides a strong sense of earned understanding with a legible cost—the successful navigation of collective uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain (summons -> search -> discovery -> resolution) that is effective for its length. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Elara accepts her new mission, creating a clear "after" state with a felt cost—the responsibility she now carries. The plot structure is simple but flawless in its execution and adherence to its own logic.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal structure is very strong and fits the length perfectly. The inciting incident (the need for the codex) leads directly to the climax (the phase transition) and a clear closure (a Resonant Reconfiguration where her relationship to fear and the unknown is altered). The drive lens is Causal and holds without fault, and the final state has a clear, conceptual cost—accepting mystery over control.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clear and effective causal chain under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens. The progression from the certificate to the shard, to the inkblot-as-data, to the defragmentation is logical within its speculative premise. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), landing on the page with a clear emotional after-state and a felt cost of confronting a lost timeline, making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story follows a clean, Causal structure that is highly effective for its length. The closure is a Decisive Change—the language is saved—achieved at a clear, on-page cost: the shattering of the diamond and Lira’s physical exhaustion. All setups, from the cursed diamond to the echoing tunnel, are paid off in a well-executed climax.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural logic, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration for the protagonist. While the closure lands, the inciting incident for the climax—the phone call—feels like a convenient external trigger rather than a direct consequence of Lena’s actions. This deus ex machina weakens the causal chain, making the metamorphosis feel imposed upon the character rather than catalyzed by her.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens with a clear setup, escalation, and a Decisive Change for closure (orchard restored, statues destroyed). The primary weakness is the convenience of the solution; the method of "synchronizing her own heartbeat with the orchard's" arrives as a sudden epiphany, which feels less earned than a solution discovered through struggle or experimentation. The cost—the locust shell becoming inert—is clearly marked on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal structure is flawless and efficient for the story's length, moving from setup to escalation to climax with clean logic. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), lands with palpable cost—the peace is temporary, the personal wound unhealed. The frozen clock as a persistent constraint beautifully charges the final image of fleeting change, demonstrating a high level of structural control.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building atmosphere and gathering narrative elements toward its climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, provides a legible before/after state for the protagonist. However, the inciting incident relies on a convenient "wrong turn," a minor weakness in causality, and the final paragraph's explicit thematic summary slightly undermines the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive lens with precision. The plot progresses through a clear, three-stage ritual, building atmospheric pressure rather than conventional causal conflict. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara returns to a physically unchanged library but is now bound to a new role as guardian, a cost made tangible by the restored scarf. The metaphysical logic is consistent and the final state change is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmospheric pressure toward a decisive moment. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the goal shifts from recovering a lost dream to creating a new one. However, the closure lacks a clearly legible cost; the resolution is presented as a pure gain, a happy smile, which undercuts the feeling of a significant, priced transformation. The magical element feels slightly convenient in delivering this cost-free epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the story follows a linear A-to-B-to-C causal structure, it fails critically at closure. The resolution—"everything around her felt different"—is vague and lacks the required on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The setup of the world-altering stakes and the difficult, shifting vault is deflated by a simple, immediate solution, rendering the plot structurally unsatisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story demonstrates a strong, clean causal chain: mushrooms lead to the missing space, which leads to the locket, which leads to the connection with the journal and stars. The inferred Causal lens holds perfectly through the ending, which lands as a well-earned Charged Poise—the path forward is clear, reconfiguring decades of loss into purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmospheric pressure toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure lands effectively on the page as the mirror transforms from a "prison" to a "portal," reconfiguring Elara's stance with a felt cost of intense emotional effort. The causality, within its chosen mode, is sound.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building atmosphere toward a single action. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, establishing a new state of preserved hope. However, the cost is entirely abstract—the implied weight of her life's work—lacking a sharp, undeniable on-page price, which softens the impact of the final change.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Pressure builds not through a chain of causal events, but through the increasing density of the "accumulated silence" and the intensity of the spirits' whispers. The closure, an Earned Stasis, lands with a clear on-page cost (a "heavy but at ease" heart) and a resonant final image that reconfigures her emotional state, making the before/after shift perfectly legible under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal drive lens. The plot progresses logically from observation to hypothesis to action, culminating in a Decisive Change (the discovery of the chapel). The closure lands with a conceptual cost, shifting Elara from seeker to guardian, which is well-established in the final paragraph. The structure is strong and fulfills the requirements for this length, though the path to discovery feels a bit too frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, effective Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) drive. The causal chain of discovery (journal to map to box to letter) provides a strong narrative spine, while the accumulative atmosphere builds toward a resonant Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands with a clear, felt cost—leaving the globe—and the final image of the library as a “lullaby” makes the before/after state perfectly legible, fulfilling the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    Holding a Causal lens, the plot is structurally sound and follows a clear A-to-B-to-C progression. The closure, a Decisive Change where the ghost is freed, lands on the page. However, the causality feels convenient at points, particularly the sudden realization that the bolt plate is the key. The primary weakness is the lack of a meaningful, felt cost; the ghost's departure is framed as a clean success, which lessens the impact of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear, logical structure. The floor-by-floor ascent provides a strong scaffold, and the final Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly. However, the progression is entirely linear and predictable, lacking any turns or meaningful setbacks that would test the protagonist's resolve. Causality is sound, but the plot unfolds like a checklist, which keeps it from achieving a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story establishes a compelling situation and escalates pressure effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens. However, the closure suffers from a significant causality break. The magical fixing of the gondola ("the broken string had been replaced") constitutes a soft reset that negates the initial physical stakes, thereby reducing the felt cost of the climax to a purely internal, dream-like experience without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens beautifully, building pressure through atmosphere rather than a strict causal chain. The structure is clean, with a clear beginning, middle, and end contained within a single scene. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the meaning of the "stillness" is re-priced by the story's events, landing with a clear, felt cost (the loss of the library).

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean and logical causal chain from puzzle to discovery, with excellent orientation. A valid closure (Charged Poise) is achieved. However, the plot unfolds with minimal friction or meaningful tightening of stakes; it reads as a smooth, linear progression rather than a struggle, and the final emotional cost is framed so positively it loses its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, where each discovery logically enables the next. The structure is well-paced for its length, moving from a broad search to a specific, consequential encounter. The closure is a successful Resonant Reconfiguration, establishing a clear before/after state (uncertainty to harmony) with a felt, psychological cost in the hall of mirrors, making the final state feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain, but the progression relies on convenience rather than earned success. Key solutions, like Jorin remembering the clapper's design, feel contrived. While the closure provides a Decisive Change (the nebula returns), it lacks a legible cost; Elara's fading is presented as a peaceful fulfillment, which undermines the stakes and renders the victory emotionally inert.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. It establishes its core elements early and escalates pressure through atmospheric shifts and internal doubt rather than external events. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), lands perfectly on the page with a clear, felt cost—the knowledge that the fix is temporary—making the final moment both earned and poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal drive. The plot structure is flawless for this length, moving from discovery to test to consequence without any wasted motion. The closure, a Decisive Change in the form of the first bud, is earned directly by the protagonist's actions and lands with a clear, felt cost—the fight is not over, merely begun.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clear Accumulative/Textural structure. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration where Elena's understanding of separation is re-weighted, and her stance shifts from isolation to readiness. The cost is the acceptance of grief as an integrated part of her life, legible in the final paragraph. The causal chain is internal and psychological, fitting the lens perfectly and resulting in a legible before/after state.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens. The inciting incident (the pulsating vial) leads directly to the ascent, which presents obstacles that are overcome by the protagonist's specific skill, resulting in a Decisive Change (the library's integration). The closure lands with a clear "before/after" state, and the expenditure of the vial's light serves as the felt cost. It's a structurally flawless execution for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.0)
    The plot follows a clear Causal lens, with each step logically following the last. The closure, a Decisive Change where the pavilion dissolves, is on the page. However, the cost of this closure—confronting her own trauma—is summarized rather than dramatized. The sentence "Tears welled in her eyes as she subsumed it all" is the entirety of the climactic struggle, which significantly dampens the impact and felt price of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere effectively toward a single Decisive Change on the page. The structure is clean and the closure lands. However, the central causal link—singing fixing a mechanical clock and a community simultaneously—operates on pure fable logic, which, while consistent, feels frictionless and lacks a compelling sense of earnedness or cost beyond tears of joy.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Elara's internal state crystallizes into a new purpose. The cost is the future burden she accepts ("no matter the cost"), which feels appropriately scaled and legible in her final vow, making the before/after state clear.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain under the Causal lens. Orientation is established well, and the plot progresses logically from the doodle to the gravity inversion to the final chamber. The closure is a clear Decisive Change (obtaining the seed), with the cost being a new responsibility, which is legible on the page. The structure is well-suited to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure is simple but elegant: setup, process, and a resonant conclusion. The closure is a valid Resonant Reconfiguration, where the grove's state shifts from silent potential to quiet resonance, with the cost legible in Elara's trembling hands. The plot is not causal, but the atmospheric and thematic progression is purposeful and lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, where the nexus's energy builds pressure, leading to a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The closure lands on the page with the decisive act of toppling the king, symbolizing her reinterpretation of her past. The cost is letting go of her old grievance, made legible by the knight's sacrifice, and the structure is a tight, effective single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, which is well-suited to the material. The closure lands as a clear Conceptual Repricing, where the goal shifts from a finite task to an ongoing commitment, implying a felt cost. The causal mechanism for opening the lock—harmonizing frequencies—is soft, but it's consistent with the story's internal logic and serves the atmospheric build effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story successfully uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and waiting rather than a causal chain of events. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, is on the page and provides a clear before/after state. However, the trigger for the final insight—a single sniff from a tiny sprout—feels mechanically slight for the profound, life-altering wisdom it imparts, slightly weakening the story's core linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens with a clear beginning, middle, and a Decisive Change at the end. The plot mechanics are sound, and orientation is handled well. The primary weakness is the shallow cost of the closure; accepting a noble purpose ("her journey was far from over") reads more as a reward than a tangible price paid, which softens the impact of an otherwise solid structure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a strong, legible Causal lens from the initial clue (the patch) to the final discovery (the wreckage). The closure is an effective Conceptual Repricing, where the meaning of "foresight" is re-evaluated with the felt cost of the town's silence. The plot structure is clean, well-paced for its length, and the ending lands with thematic weight, fulfilling all requirements for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building to a clear Decisive Change. However, the closure fails the cost-proof test; the ending is a pure triumph with no on-page trade-off, sacrifice, or lingering price paid in the climactic moment. The cost is all in the backstory, which weakens the impact of the achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain, culminating in a well-executed closure. The ending is a form of Charged Poise, where the immediate goal is met but the stakes are reconfigured and heightened for the future. The cost of her past failure is made tangible and frames this new beginning, making the final moment resonate effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story effectively uses an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is a tight, single scene that builds pressure toward a clear closure moment—a Conceptual Repricing of "empathy." The cost of this insight, his psychological disorientation, is demonstrated on the page, making the before/after state legible and earned within this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly, building atmospheric and emotional pressure toward a clear closure. The ending delivers a potent Conceptual Repricing (CR), where Elara's role and future are fundamentally re-evaluated with the felt cost of embracing an unknown destiny. The structure is elegant and economical, perfectly suited to the story's length and successfully landing its final, resonant change on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and internal pressure toward a clear closure. The ending is an effective Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the protagonist's understanding of her work and the world is fundamentally reweighted. The cost is legible—the shift from intellectual curiosity to the burden of empathy—and anchored in the final image of the arbor feeling heavier.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly. The plot progresses through a series of discoveries that build thematic density rather than strict causality. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where Elara becomes the message, is earned, on-page, and lands with a legible cost ("the weight of her sacrifice"), providing a resonant and definitive 'after' state.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, but the structure is weakened by a significant convenience. After the climax, Eli is instantly back on the surface without explanation, bypassing the logical consequences and tension of a return journey through the unstable mines. The cost of his bargain—his "awakening"—is conceptually present but lacks a tangible, felt price on the page, making the closure feel somewhat soft and intellectually abstract rather than emotionally resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, but the plot's central turn relies on a deus ex machina. The mysterious woman appears conveniently to provide a complete exposition and the necessary tool for resolution, which undermines Elara’s agency. While the story achieves a Conceptual Repricing at closure, the lack of an earned struggle makes the final moment feel more like an elegant summary than a hard-won conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a Causal lens, but a crucial link is broken. The solution to the stone puzzle ("he rearranged the stones—2-3-1") is an unmotivated guess, a moment of pure convenience that unlocks the climax. This significantly undermines the plot's integrity. While the story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration for closure, the lack of a strongly felt cost and the convenient puzzle-solving weaken its foundation.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a strong, clear Causal drive. The inciting incident (the beam going out of control) flows logically into the climax and resolution. The closure is a definitive Decisive Change on the page—the gateway is opened, and the Herald's purpose is transformed—with a legible conceptual cost in the shift from a known routine to a vast new responsibility. The structure is simple but flawlessly executed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional weight toward a clear closure moment. The ending provides a Resonant Reconfiguration, as Kael’s vague quest is crystallized into a specific purpose. This shift forecloses his initial uncertainty with the felt cost of an ongoing, difficult journey, which lands effectively in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure. The lens is established early and holds through the ending. The closure is a successful Conceptual Repricing (CR), where Elias's understanding of the labyrinth, sorrow, and resilience is fundamentally reweighted. The "before/after" is legible, and the cost is the felt weight of existence, making the closure earned within its own lyrical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, with the gathering of song fragments building toward a Decisive Change at the end. The structure is coherent and the closure is unambiguous. The primary weakness is the legibility of the cost; while her struggle is mentioned, its price isn't deeply felt on the page, which keeps the otherwise solid plot from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear, single-scene causal structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative-Causal) lens. The inciting incident (invitation) leads to investigation and a climax that delivers a Conceptual Repricing (the blank book), which in turn causes a Decisive Change (Elara leaves). The closure lands on the page with a felt cost—leaving her sanctuary. The plot is functional and well-scoped, though the causality is straightforward rather than complex.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The closure lands, and the cost—the fragility of her peace—is felt. However, the plot's central turn, the discovery of the plaque, relies on a significant coincidence that neatly affirms her quest rather than emerging from a chain of pressure and choice, softening the structure's overall integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building to a strong closure. The structure is economical and effective, moving from routine to revelation. The ending is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elara's purpose is crystallized with a clear, felt cost—the weight of her new mission.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean, causal line and establishes its stakes and setting effectively (Drive Lens: Causal). The ending, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lila accepts her new role, is conceptually sound. The primary weakness is in the climax's resolution; the story tells us she "thwarted the thieves" with "words and wit," but we don't see the final turn that secures this victory. The confrontation ends with her walking away, which feels more like a pause than a decisive, earned conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain and achieves a valid Charged Poise closure, where Elara accepts her new path. However, the plot's central turn relies entirely on an exposition dump from the cloaked figure. This method of revelation is functional but lacks dramatic tension; the answer is given rather than discovered, which lessens the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration for its closure. The final image redefines Elara’s relationship to her art with the felt cost of past suppression. The structure is nearly flawless for its length, held back only by the slight convenience of the painting's discovery, which reads more as a fortunate find than a direct causal result of a prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, with a strong because/therefore structure leading to a clear Decisive Change closure. The discovery of the plate leads to the chamber, which leads to the truth, which leads to the action of inscription, which in turn causes the trickle of water. The on-page cost is the acceptance of a "bitter" truth, which is legible and sets up the final emotional state. The structure is exemplary for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot builds from quiet setup to a resonant climax and concludes with a well-earned Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The cost—the fleeting nature of the created wonder—is explicitly legible on the page. The structure is simple but perfectly suited to the story's length and ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain under a Causal lens. The inciting incident leads directly to the central choice, which culminates in a decisive change. The closure is excellent, landing on the page with a clear, resonant cost—the loss of nostalgic memories—that is a direct consequence of the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.2)
    The plot progression is clear but relies on a significant coincidence that undermines its structural integrity: the key is conveniently hidden within the locket Clara happens to find. This removes any real obstacle or struggle from the central mystery, making the resolution feel pre-ordained and easy. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, is present but its emotional cost is minimal, blunted by the convenience of the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens successfully, building atmosphere toward a single, decisive turn. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the lab is awakened, and Elara’s mission is reconfigured with new purpose, a legible before/after state. The cost is the felt weight of her ongoing guardianship, which, while not a tangible loss, is sufficient for this story's lyrical mode and length.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is excellent. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where Eli understands memories are misplaced, lands clearly on the page. However, the cost is entirely retrospective (past suffering) rather than being felt or paid in the final beat, which slightly softens the impact of the otherwise effective closure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean, effective Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is swift, and the single scene escalates logically to a clear climax. The closure is a well-executed Charged Poise; Elara succeeds, but the final lines establish the ongoing threat and the cost of her vigilance, reconfiguring her situation from a completed task to a perpetual duty. The causality of the magical process is coherent within its own terms.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure is a single, perfectly paced scene that builds pressure through conceptual layering rather than causal turns. The ending is a clean example of Charged Poise: Clara's decision to knock on the door is a decisive change in stance, reconfiguring her future options with the felt cost of leaving her sanctuary for the unknown. The closure is earned and lands with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmosphere and internal pressure toward a distinct Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The closure lands on the page as Elara understands the garden's true purpose, with the cost symbolized by the dimmed orchid. However, the central turn—the encounter with the figure—feels more like a direct information transfer than a causally earned climax, softening the structure's overall impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara achieves a new emotional state (Earned Stasis from her grief), lands with a clearly felt cost—the release of a familiar identity built on pain. The causality is entirely internal and emotional, which is coherent and effective for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a simple, linear quest structure. The inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds through the setup, and the closure is a clear Conceptual Repricing (the nature of echoes is redefined). However, the central turn relies on a magical info-dump from a guiding figure and a vision pool. This 'deus ex machina' style resolution, where the answer is given rather than earned through the protagonist's actions, weakens the causal integrity of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building its narrative through discovered fragments. The structure is sound, with clear orientation and a well-defined process leading to the closure. The final Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elara completes her work, provides a satisfying cadence, though the globe momentarily clearing feels like a slightly too-convenient magical grace note.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the closure—the realization that patterns are "within herself"—feels asserted and lacks a tangible, on-page cost. The structure is a simple, linear accumulation of thoughts without a meaningful turn, deepening, or cadence shift that reweights the stakes; it is a description of a thought process rather than a dramatized journey.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story follows a Causal drive lens and achieves a Decisive Change with a clear, felt cost in its closure. However, the causal chain leading to the climax is weak; the critical discovery that the stillpoint is a prison relies on the letters magically rearranging when the diamond is touched. This leap feels convenient and unearned, undermining the protagonist's investigative agency at a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain from the inciting incident (the new frequency) to the climax (activating the portico) and a clear closure (Decisive Change). The structure is effective for the length, and the final image of the new dawn provides a resonant resolution with a felt cost. The plot is self-contained and fulfills its promises without any logical breaks or unearned solutions.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    Drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds perfectly. The structure is elegant and effective for the length, building from silence to a single note to an overwhelming melody. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, with the shattered jar providing a visible cost and the final image with the glass shard reweighting Elias’s purpose. Causality is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with a strong, continuous scene structure. The closure, a Decisive Change solidifying into Earned Stasis, lands with a legible cost of confirmed threat and continued isolation. The plot is slightly weakened by the climax's resolution, where the key conveniently glows to reveal the villain's nature, bordering on a deus ex machina that softens the causality of Elara's crucial realization.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara achieves a new state of being. However, the cost of this change is abstractly stated ("unyoke herself from the urgencies") rather than felt on the page. The plot progresses through summary and epiphany, lacking the causal "because/therefore" linkages that would give the transformation weight and inevitability. The structure is sound, but its execution lacks dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens with a logical sequence of discoveries leading to a clear Decisive Change at the end. The closure is effective, with the cost of future danger explicitly noted. However, the plot progression is somewhat convenient, with each clue leading directly to the next in a linear fashion that reduces tension and feels more like a procedural checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through atmosphere and dialogue to produce a change in Elias's internal state. The structure is a simple, effective container for this shift. The ending achieves a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Elias’s new resolve and the coming “storm” represent a reconfigured state with a clear, felt cost. The causality is associative rather than strictly linear, which perfectly suits the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The plot builds through an intensification of detail and effort, culminating in a resonant climax. The closure is a superb example of Charged Poise: the bell's ringing doesn't solve a problem but reconfigures the world's stakes and Lira's role within it, with the cost being the introduction of a vast, powerful unknown. The structure is tight, and causality holds perfectly within its chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain is tight and propulsive, with each discovery logically leading to the next. The structure is clean, orienting the reader efficiently and building toward a clear climax. The closure is a strong "Charged Poise," where Elara's decision reconfigures the stakes with a clear, felt cost ("no matter the cost"), making the ending resonant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural structure, where each mirror scene adds knowledge and resolve, leading to a Decisive Change at the end. The closure lands cleanly. However, the cost is significantly underdeveloped; the struggle is described as "not easy," but the process on the page appears frictionless, which undermines the weight of the final resolution. A more tangible or deeply felt price for her self-discovery was needed.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional and thematic pressure toward a clear resolution. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR), where Elara's understanding of "endings" is fundamentally reweighted. This change is catalyzed on the page through her interactions and finalized in the resonant image of the northern lights, with a clear felt cost—the shedding of her old, detached worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through reflection toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands on the page as Elara reframes her understanding of love. The cost is the remembered pain of the past loss, which is accepted rather than a new price paid at the end, making its felt impact slightly soft but still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood that culminates in a resonant final image. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where Elara's personal mark is erased while her work endures, is effective. However, the plot is a simple, linear sequence of events without causal friction; the prophet's arrival feels convenient, serving as validation rather than the result of a narrative struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is a simple, effective container for the mood: arrive, work, reflect, depart. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elara's internal state shifts from burdened to hopeful, a form of Earned Stasis in her ongoing process. The cost is her remembered grief, which makes the final "quiet hope" feel earned within this reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. Orientation is immediate and effective. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—is potent: Elias possesses the pattern for the future, but the crystal is spent, creating a clear before/after with a tangible cost. This final image of holding a "seed for the future" at the price of its source is both earned and resonant, fulfilling the structural requirements with literary grace.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building pressure through atmosphere and internal reflection rather than causal turns. The structure is a purposeful wander that culminates in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure lands beautifully as Elias lets the chalk fall, a tangible cost representing his shift from needing to capture the sound to simply experiencing it, which reweights the entire journey.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and internal feeling toward a resolution. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara harmonizes with time instead of conquering it, is executed clearly on the page. The conceptual cost—giving up control for collaboration—is legible, but the causal link between the falling leaf and the specific solution to "restructure time" is a significant logical leap, weakening the story's core mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear and effective causal structure for its length, with a setup, action, and on-page resolution. The closure, a Decisive Change in the mother-daughter relationship, lands with a felt cost of impending loss. However, the plot's primary turn—Claire's immediate arrival after a single "brief" call—feels overly convenient, smoothing over the central conflict so quickly that it lacks significant narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear and effective causal structure, moving logically from problem to solution. The closure, a combination of a Decisive Change (solving the mystery) and Charged Poise (readiness for what's next), is legible. The plot feels somewhat frictionless, as Elara's plan succeeds without any significant setbacks or forced trade-offs, which softens the overall impact.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal structure: key (tooth) leads to threshold (maze), which leads to trial (fountain), culminating in a Decisive Change with a felt cost (giving up certainty/stone). The progression is logical and fits the short form well. The only minor structural weakness is introducing the key motivating backstory about the friend very late, which slightly lessens its impact on the initial stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through memory and atmosphere rather than causal plot turns. The structure is clean and effective for a character-focused piece. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira achieves an Earned Stasis, is clear and lands with the felt cost of confronting her past, making the final image of her leaving the grotto powerful and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building pressure through atmosphere and emotional deepening rather than plot mechanics. The structure is elegant, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where a refuge becomes a beginning—lands with a palpable, earned cost (risking vulnerability). The pendant serves as a persistent object that shapes Elara's micro-choices, fulfilling the 9+ criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Accumulative/Textural structure is executed cleanly, moving from the shore to the nexus's heart with a clear progression of intensity. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis, lands effectively on the page with a legible felt cost as Elara accepts the weight of the stories she must now carry.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear and functional Causal lens, with a direct line from action to resolution. The closure, a Decisive Change where remedies appear as orbs, is legible. However, the resolution lacks a meaningful on-page cost; the stated future obligation ("her work was far from over") is an intellectual postscript, not a price paid in the climax. This ease of success, where the solution arrives without sacrifice or setback, lessens the impact of the final change.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates under a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building density and atmosphere toward a defined ritualistic climax. The closure is an effective Resonant Reconfiguration, as the completed map transforms the orchard's energy, creating an Earned Stasis for the character. The cost is the expenditure of the rare "safekept starlight," which lands with sufficient weight for this story's length and scope.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens beautifully. The structure is clean, with clear orientation and a logical progression from problem to resolution. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands effectively as the timer activates, providing a felt sense of accomplishment. The cost is the time and devotion across the "wounded season," which is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) lens. The arrival of the figure provides the pressure that leads to a Resonant Reconfiguration of Elara's purpose. This closure lands cleanly on the page with a felt cost—the fracturing of her old identity—fulfilling the requirements for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. There is no external plot, but the accumulation of internal actions and reflections leads to a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure lands on the page with a clearly felt cost—the emotional labor of confronting memory—making the final moment of peace impactful and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through collected fragments rather than a strict causal chain. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration, where Mara's perspective shifts with a felt cost. The plot's only minor softness is the magical convenience of the camera's recorded message, which acts as the primary catalyst for the change.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building towards a clear Conceptual Repricing at closure. The terminal's "resurrection" as an illusion, and Eli's subsequent internal shift, lands with a legible conceptual cost. However, the causal link between finding the sextant and the specific engineering actions is more symbolic than necessary, slightly weakening the inciting incident's propulsive force.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and memory to a decisive internal shift. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, is strong; Elara’s final action redefines her relationship with her home, and the cost (accepting the form her life has taken) is palpable. The structure is simple, elegant, and effective for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a single discovery. Orientation is handled well, and the causal chain is simple but unbroken. The closure, a form of Conceptual Repricing where the canal shifts from decay to possibility, lands on the page with a felt emotional cost ("the weight of his words"). However, the key discovery hinges on a moment of pure instinct ("This was the place, she knew it instinctively"), which feels slightly convenient rather than a choice born from escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a potent atmosphere toward a moment of insight. The closure, a Decisive Change in knowledge, is clearly on thepage. However, it lacks a felt or conceptual cost *at the moment of resolution*. The fulgurite glass acts as a convenient key, and the final knot yields its meaning without a final, costly trade-off, which softens the impact of the discovery and makes the ending feel less earned and more frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure is simple but elegant, moving from atmospheric setup to a quiet, resonant climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, is achieved on the page as the exchange of threads reframes the traveler's journey and provides catharsis for the woman. The felt cost is legible in the woman's tears and the finality of her gift, creating a satisfying and earned conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain under a Causal lens (research -> map -> discovery -> action -> revelation). The structure is tight and well-suited for the length. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where Kael's understanding of his quest is fundamentally altered, and the cost—the loss of a simple solution in favor of a long, difficult path—is clearly felt in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is swift and clear, and the single scene builds pressure effectively toward its conclusion. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the act of grafting redefines Elara’s internal state with a clear, felt cost—the uncertainty of the future versus a newfound peace.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, with each breadcrumb adding a layer of meaning that builds to the climax. The structure is sound and serves the narrative well. The closure is a strong Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration on the page—the fountain flows—with a clear conceptual cost: the end of Elara's identity as a skeptic. It's effective, legible, and holds to its internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The plot progresses through a deepening of sensory and conceptual experience—the pings, the glowing blooms, the humming gear—leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The final image provides closure, but the "cost" is abstract ("the weight of her purpose"), which slightly softens the impact of the earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds associative pressure through memory and imagery, leading to a strong Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where Elara's understanding of grief is re-weighted, lands with a clear conceptual cost—abandoning the goal of closure for the act of carrying—and is earned entirely within the scene's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and meaning toward a legible closure. The final beat, where Elias's role is conceptually repriced, lands effectively. However, the causal chain in the middle is weak; the montage of "days turned into weeks" where he heals the town is summarized rather than dramatized, softening the story's structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building to a quiet Conceptual Repricing at the end, which lands with a legible, if subtle, cost. The structure is sound and the orientation is clear. However, the central causal sequence—the act of decoding—is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening the "earned" quality of the final realization. The plot progresses as a frictionless sequence of events rather than a chain of choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear causal structure (task -> tool -> action -> result), and the closure is a Decisive Change. However, the resolution lacks a tangible, on-page cost, which undermines its power; the future struggle with "doubters" is a promissory note, not a price paid. The climax relies on the quill having "a mind of its own," which functions as a near deus ex machina, weakening the protagonist's agency and making the victory feel less earned.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building atmospheric pressure toward a clear and resonant closure. The ending, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), effectively re-frames the protagonist's mission with a new, specific focus. The cost—embracing an unknown and mysterious path—is felt, making the final moment of determination earned and impactful within the story's scope.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive effectively. The structure is a clean, single scene that builds pressure through atmosphere and observation toward a central ritual. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the final image of accepting a "mirage-like" safety provides a conceptual repricing of the story's core ideas with a felt cost—the acceptance of universal impermanence. The progression is seamless and the ending lands with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with a logical sequence of events. However, the closure—a Conceptual Repricing—feels unearned and lacks a sufficiently legible cost. The final epiphany ("perhaps... there was room for both") is an intellectual summary that sidesteps the emotional and tangible price of his decision, weakening the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional resonance toward a strong closure. The final moment is a clear Conceptual Repricing, where the rosette's meaning shifts from loss to hope, landing with a felt conceptual cost. The structure is simple and effective for this length, moving from stasis to action to a new, earned stasis. The time jump ("Weeks passed") is handled efficiently without disrupting momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear causal chain and establishes its setting and stakes efficiently. However, the closure—a Decisive Change—lacks a meaningful, on-page cost. Elara's success is total and uncomplicated, which undermines the narrative tension and makes the resolution feel too easy for the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Causal drive lens is clear and consistent, but the plot progression is too linear and convenient. Each discovery (box, key, panel, orb) leads directly to the next without complication, feeling less like an earned struggle and more like following a pre-set map. The closure is a Decisive Change in knowledge, but the on-page cost is a bit soft—the abstract burden of revelation rather than a concrete sacrifice or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building pressure through collected objects and deepening atmosphere. The structure is simple but effective, moving from discovery to ritual to a final Conceptual Repricing where Elias’s worldview is reconfigured. The closure lands cleanly with a felt, albeit subtle, cost—the acceptance of his unique calling—making the before/after state perfectly legible and earned within the story's quiet logic.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens. The inciting incident (Elara's arrival) leads directly to the core turn (Liora's warning), which causes the resolution. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of Liora’s purpose from passive observer to active guardian, is earned and lands with a clear conceptual cost—the end of its static existence.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for an Accumulative/Textural piece. The lens is held consistently, and the closure—a Conceptual Repricing—lands on the page with a clear trigger (dropping the die) and a legible, permanent cost (the irretrievable loss). The plot moves from a state of determined obsession to one of acceptance via a single, decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building pressure through atmosphere and internal realization rather than external events. The closure is a superb example of Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise); Elara's purpose is crystallized, reweighting her future. The felt cost is the exchange of her quiet, contained suffering for a vast, unknown responsibility, made legible in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with a logical sequence of events. The structure is sound for its length, and orientation is handled well. The primary failure is in the closure, which presents a Decisive Change (the tradition is revived) but lacks a legible cost; the "weight of her mission" is a continuation of her purpose, not a price paid. The resolution feels convenient, relying on magical elements that work perfectly without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Causal drive lens within its single-scene structure. Orientation is immediate and effective, and the plot progresses via a tight because/therefore chain leading to a powerful close. The closure is a clear Decisive Change (the lighthouse is altered) that also functions as Charged Poise, with the felt cost of "unease" and unpredictable consequences landing perfectly on the page. The structure is an exemplar of economy and impact for this word count.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) drive lens, leading to a Decisive Change at the climax. The closure, where Clara confronts her fear and the funhouse fades, is on-page and legible. The cost is the psychological pain of the confrontation, which earns her freedom, providing a solid before/after state. The structure is effective and well-paced for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure in a single, well-oriented scene. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where inner dissonance becomes harmony, is achieved on the page. However, the resolution lacks a legible cost; Leeward performs his function, the cosmos responds perfectly, and peace is achieved without any sacrifice, struggle, or trade-off, which softens the impact of the final stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates on a flawless Causal lens, where each action logically propels the narrative forward. The structure is tight and purposeful for its length. The closure unit is a powerful Decisive Change in knowledge that reconfigures the protagonist's goal into a new Charged Poise, with the cost—the fate of Valtara—made explicitly clear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clear, Causal-lens structure from arrival to discovery, and the closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing. However, the plot's central turn relies on convenience; the leap from the cryptic riddle "The truth is a seed" directly to finding a loose floorboard lacks a connecting step, making the discovery feel too easy and reducing the sense of earned success.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and significance toward a clear closure. The ending, where Elias’s identity is reconfigured, is an effective Conceptual Repricing (CR) that lands with the felt cost of a new, heavier purpose. The structure is simple but elegant for its length, with each discovery (journal, mosaic) logically deepening the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, where each discovery logically enables the next. The structure is sound, with a clear beginning, middle, and a Decisive Change at the end when Elara uncovers the truth. The primary weakness is the legibility of the cost; the ending ("her journey was just beginning") gestures toward future conflict rather than landing a price on the page, which slightly softens the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain under a Causal lens: Lira's counsel prompts Kael's visit to the basilica, which leads directly to his climactic realization. The closure, a Decisive Change in his internal stance, happens on the page with a clear felt cost as he unfolds the crane and confronts his memories. The structure is simple but perfectly suited to the story's length and emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, moving from grief to a new resolve. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of Zara's identity from survivor to seeker, lands on the page with the felt cost of her trauma established upfront. The narrative is cohesive and well-paced for its length, delivering its intended shift without structural flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean and logical causal structure, with each discovery leading directly to the next step. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where the quest's meaning is transformed, is present and legible. However, the progression feels like a linear sequence of solved puzzles rather than a narrative arc with rising tension, as Kael encounters no significant setbacks or complications along the way.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and imagery toward a resonant closure. The final moment of Charged Poise, where Elias accepts his burden, lands with a clear and felt cost. The primary weakness lies in the causal link at the climax; the memory surfacing from placing a watch hand on a driftwood clock feels more like a convenient symbolic device than an earned psychological breakthrough, slightly undermining the otherwise strong structure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively, building pressure through atmosphere and symbolic argument rather than plot mechanics. The structure is clean and fits the scope. The closure is a well-executed Charged Poise, reconfiguring the relationship with a clear, felt cost articulated in the final exchange ("I do not forgive lightly... a path walked"), making the fragile new beginning palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration. The structure is simple but sound, moving from stasis to action. The closure, where Mara paddles away, is an earned shift in stance with a felt cost—the acceptance of her changed identity—making the before/after state perfectly legible without a dramatic plot turn.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, leading to a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands with a felt cost—the loss of the baseball and the abandonment of the "clean slate" ideal. However, the causal link between the character's actions (swimming, seeing symbols) and his profound realization is tenuous, relying more on symbolic resonance than on a dramatized, causal progression.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal structure is sound, and the story achieves a valid Conceptual Repricing at closure with a legible, felt cost. The plot progression, however, relies on convenient mechanisms like the fortune cookie falling directly into her palm, which slightly softens the earnedness of the journey. The structure holds, but lacks inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly for its length. It builds pressure through a sequence of resonant images—the cracked saucer, the Tower card, the vision of fireflies—rather than causal plot turns. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elara's perspective shifts decisively, and the cost (the painful confrontation with her missed moments) is paid on the page, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Elara's role is redefined. However, the progression lacks friction; the inciting anomaly is mentioned but never materializes as an obstacle, and the portal opens with minimal resistance. While the cost of "shadow work" is stated, its price is not made legible or felt in the climactic scene, making the resolution feel somewhat unearned and preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story effectively uses an Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmosphere toward a clear closure moment. The final Conceptual Repricing, where Elara's understanding of transformation shifts, lands on the page with a tangible cost—the release of her cherished possession. However, the climax is weakened by having the universe deliver its message as direct, italicized text, which feels overly convenient and lessens the impact of an earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot is exceptionally well-structured with a clean, causal drive. Orientation is immediate and clear. The story builds to a potent closure in the form of a Charged Poise, where the activation of the cradle reconfigures the political landscape, leaving Elara's future and Thorne's allegiance in a tense, unresolved state. The cost of her action is palpable and perfectly suited to the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. It builds pressure through a single, continuous scene, layering atmospheric details that intensify toward a clear climax. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where Kael’s quest is reconfigured rather than ended, is earned and resonant, with the cost being the loss of his singular focus for an eternal journey. The structure is elegant and effective for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure is tight, with the timer, storm, and map accumulating symbolic weight that logically culminates in a Decisive Change. The on-page closure, where Elara begins to write, is earned and carries the clear conceptual cost of confronting a painful past, fulfilling the rubric's highest standards for this length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, causal structure driven by the dialogue-duel. The ending provides a strong Conceptual Repricing, reframing the central conflict and the protagonist's goal. The cost is the abandonment of Elias's initial quest for "certainty," which is a legible and thematically resonant price. The structure is tight and perfectly suited for the story's length and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building thematic weight toward a resonant final image. The structure is a clean two-shard design suitable for the length. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Elias and Clara's shared purpose is crystallized on the rooftop, reconfiguring their future paths with the felt cost of perpetual struggle. Causality is textural rather than strictly linear, which aligns perfectly with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean Causal lens leading to a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure is excellent and lands entirely on the page: the broken clock starts ticking, the wild compasses still, and Elara’s music transforms. The cost—giving up the fight to change the past in favor of integrating it—is poignantly felt, fulfilling the rubric's highest standards for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with a linear quest structure. However, the closure, a Decisive Change, is weakened by a near-total absence of felt cost. The guardian presents a challenge about the "burden" of memory, but this is resolved with a simple affirmation from Elara. The plot progresses smoothly but lacks a meaningful complication or reversal; the resolution feels preordained and frictionless, undermining the stakes established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates under a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through symbolic objects and atmosphere rather than direct causal events. The structure is sound, moving from mystery to discovery to a well-defined climax. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where the goal itself is redefined, and the cost is legible in the act of leaving the compass and lace pattern behind, foreclosing the path of tangible grief-holding.

Structure fits defaults with one continuous scene across sub-locations and a single transition to the vault. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with the holographic map reweighting belonging, though the conceptual cost feels oblique without a stronger felt price in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through patterned imagery and cadence shifts, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where Elias accepts carrying the truth, with felt cost in the slipping watch hand and tempered regret; orientation anchors early with the terrace at dusk. Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise, reweighting his morality without decisive physical act, but persistent constraint of the watch shapes tactics effectively. Weakness: minor redundancy in reflective beats slightly softens causality, though it doesn't touch the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the single-scene structure builds through layered atmosphere and symbolic exchanges to a Charged Poise closure where the drawer pull's passing reconfigures mistrust into promise, with conceptual cost of untethering from blame legible in the final image. Orientation anchors who (Elara, Kael), where (parapet), and when (waning moon night) by ~50 words, serving the mist-shrouded tension. One meaningful deepening occurs as Elara's words synchronize with the storm, tightening toward agreement without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds, with density building through reflective patterns and a cadence shift at launch, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise as Mara paddles with hope, reweighting regrets' cost legibly in the final smile. Orientation anchors early in dawn at the coastal launch, avoiding penalties. Structure fits scope as one continuous scene with meaningful deepening in her adaptation from compass to poles. Causality is textural rather than linear, but the ending's conceptual cost feels oblique without a sharper before/after reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elias reweights empathy as something to carry, with felt cost in accepting his past's weight, evident in the final climb-out. Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first paragraph without debt. Causality is loose, with the baseball drop as a micro-turn deepening knowledge, but the ending's reconfiguration lands on-page; however, some ellipsis feels unmotivated, like the sudden pull to swim.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Inferred lens is Causal, with because/therefore linkages from fortune cookie to scent-following to guardian encounter holding through closure; structure is a single continuous scene in the orchard with clear orientation by the first paragraph. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where Elara reweights the bond as self-connection, with legible cost in letting go of centuries' weight, evident in her smile and steady steps. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, though ellipsis between conjuring and transformation is motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images and reflections to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the saucer's crack reprices time's fragility with undeniable conceptual cost in the final promise. Orientation anchors immediately in the midnight glade with Elara kneeling. Closure lands on-page with the saucer as a reminder, charging the ending image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through reflective shards toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where the dimension awakens with a felt cost of transformed grief; orientation anchors early with the spaceship and anomaly, but causality feels elliptical in the stitching sequence, lacking a tighter because/therefore linkage to the final resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned whispers and celestial alignments to a resonant reconfiguration in the release of the bugs, with conceptual cost legible in her renewed spirit and sacrificed possession. Orientation anchors early on the black sand beach, and causality holds via textural density shifts. The ending's conceptual repricing reweights her role as a bridge, though the detour feels slightly elliptical without stronger causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under the causal lens, the plot advances through motivated linkages from blackout to sundial discovery to confrontation and activation, with a decisive change in the cradle's ignition reconfiguring the fort's state. Orientation anchors early in the luminous fort at twilight with Elara's post, no disorientation debt. Closure lands on-page with visible cost in Thorne's silence and the revolution's risk, but the key's convenient reveal feels like a soft ellipsis. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, holding the lens without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through patterned elisions and intensifying auroral imagery to a Conceptual Repricing closure with felt cost in Kael's edged sanity; orientation anchors early in the tidal bluff setting, and the epiphany reweights prior fragments legibly.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, structure builds through layered imagery and reflection toward a Charged Poise closure where Elara finds clarity and begins writing, with conceptual cost legible in confronting scars and past self. Orientation anchors who (Elara), where (observatory), and when (stormy night) by ~50 words, serving the introspective mode without penalty. Causality is textural via timer, storm, and envelope accumulating pressure; one meaningful deepening at unfolding the map reweights knowledge effectively. Closure lands on-page with resonant reconfiguration, charging the final image of pen stroke and thunderclap.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned philosophical exchanges with density increasing toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where the overture is realized as internal, carrying undeniable conceptual cost in reweighting questions as answers; orientation anchors early in the atrium beside the brook. One meaningful cadence shift suffices at this length, with the final realization reconfiguring options legibly. Minor weakness in limited causal linkages, but the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through layered images of decay and hope to a Resonant Reconfiguration on the rooftop, where Elias's permanence reweights his molting with conceptual cost, but causality feels loose with the sudden prison library detail disrupting orientation mid-story. Orientation anchors early in the forgotten city and rusted library, but the prison shift past 120 words doesn't serve closure and triggers a -0.3 penalty. Closure lands with a charged final image, though the transition from meeting to rebuilding lacks motivated ellipsis.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds density through reflective images and motifs like the clock and compasses, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara embraces fate with a conceptual cost legible in the ticking clock and new melody. Orientation anchors who, where, and when early in the tidal arbor. Causality holds via motivated ellipsis, with the film reel experience tightening knowledge, though the sudden color shift feels like a minor unearned leap.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under a Causal lens, the structure follows a clear because/therefore chain from dream clue to seed retrieval and planting, with orientation anchored early in the ridge setting. Closure lands as a Decisive Change when Elara plants the seed, preserving memory against the monsoon with a conceptual cost of carrying light and darkness. However, the linear quest lacks a meaningful tightening beyond the riddle, and the guardian encounter resolves too neatly without compounding complications.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds through patterned images of tides and memories to a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elias reweights regret as release, with undeniable conceptual cost in forgiving and letting go, evident in the final sanctuary image. Orientation anchors early in the quiet hours on the breezy islet, with no disorientation debt. One meaningful cadence shift occurs as the compass settles and leads to the cove discovery, sufficient for length. Strength in resonant reconfiguration at the shore reading, where cost is felt through dissolved letters; no causality breaks.


== Grader: Kimi K2 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the butterfly’s appearance reconfigures meaning (Charged Poise) under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is implied rather than explicit—dust “remembers” without dramatized mechanism—yet the before/after is legible and the greenhouse becomes a charged canvas.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is causal: because she finds the strip, therefore she retraces the route, therefore she learns the truth. Orientation is clear by line 4. Closure lands with a decisive change—she now knows where the apprentice is held and commits to action—though the cost is more asserted than dramatized. One clean transition (campfire → canyon trek) fits the 600-800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: silence reweighted from void to canvas. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern discovery and color-melody deepen until the final image reconfigures meaning. Causality is intact; no orientation debt. Cost is legible in Elara’s relinquishing of sound itself.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lens’s glow reconfigures the city’s fate and Elias’s burden. Causal chain (package → lens hunt → reassembly → signal) holds; one minor ellipsis—how Elias breathes or moves underwater—doesn’t break the lens. Cost is legible in the final image: “the water above began to part.”

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.7)
    Causal lens holds: every beat links because/therefore from anonymous provisions → rumour → public gathering → communal contract. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—bell–charged “amplified quiet” crystallizes unity with forefelt cost (loss of perfect anonymity). Orientation is clear by line 40. One prior expositional paragraph (~140 words backstory) escapes the BRR limit.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: placing the pendant reconfigures memory into usable love (Resonant Reconfiguration). Causal chain is intact—dream → viaduct → pendant → alcove. Orientation is swift; the twilight viaduct is anchored by ~50 words. One transition (viaduct → alcove) is legible and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the maze’s geometry stabilizes and Elara’s ancestral memories are restored, with the cost of the fragment’s loss. Causal chain is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat layers sensory density until the final swirl reweights the stake. One minor ellipsis: how the maze “tests her resolve” is asserted, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands: chains falling away equals Earned Stasis with conceptual cost—future labor now foreclosed to the liberator’s own endurance. Chain linkage across beats because/therefore, yet early orientation soft (who controls vault, who built wall not legible) and ladder snag moment is off-stage micro-blip rather than on-page setback.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the forge’s resonant ache reweights the premise, and the aurora’s fade crystallizes the cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each collected absence layers density until the final cadence shift. One minor ellipsis: the leap from “collecting” to “understanding” is compressed rather than causally shown.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s stance shifts from thief to seeker under moonlight, with visible cost in the relinquished trap and Elara’s relinquished soul-fragment. Causal chain holds; lens is Accumulative/Textural, pattern taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene, single-POV structure holds; the causal lens is clear (because she fears silence, therefore she crafts spheres). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—bookmark inside sphere crystallizes her stance—but the cost is more conceptual than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise in the mirror room: a momentary reconfiguration where “versions of herself” collapse into active choice (“You are what you choose to be”). Causal chain is thin—key discoveries (cast → key → mirrors) arrive via spatial teleportation rather than earned deduction—but the final image clearly reweights identity with an on-page, felt cost. Drive lens is broadly situational rather than strictly causal, yet holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the map of night crystallizes in the oracle’s mind as the last star dies, reweighting the premise with undeniable conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each silence-layer tightens the pattern—yet the cost is more atmospheric than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the violin’s final pulse reweights the premise that thoughts arise from code. Accumulative lens holds—each looped memory adds density until the cadence shift in the climax dissolves the courtyard. Cost is legible in the line “everything felt different,” though the price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cracked lens reframes their shared history and future stance. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory return of the crystals, ticket, and lens thickens the pattern until the final crystallized moment. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in Kian’s soft “It’s beautiful” and Elara’s unspoken risk.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s placement of the final marble crystallizes his stance with visible cost (“garden had finally acknowledged his presence”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of marbles and garden response reweights the stake—but the causality between polishing and garden’s “whisper” is lyrical rather than strictly because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each beat—activation, overload, sprint, stabilisation—tightens because/therefore linkages. Closure delivers a crystallised ‘time ripple’ and abandoned safety path, cost stamped on rebooting systems; the ripple fulfils Q2’s test while no gate failures arise.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative arcs cleanly: discovery → decipher → call → disappearance.  Causality threads via the program’s water damage patterns which literally form emerging notation, so “therefore” is earned each step.  Charged closure lands at the last chord: the ghost vanishes, the program dissolves, silence is filled, with Clara left holding the intangible result—an unmistakable Resonant Reconfiguration.  Time-anchor, place-anchor, and chain of acts track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: density of the botanical motif and weather station hum tighten until the smudged flower image commands a Resonant Reconfiguration. Q2 oversees closure; Elara’s earned stance (occupying the margins forever) is on-page and conceptually priced, satisfying the closure gate.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-scene causality is clear: because she enters the tunnel, she finds the wheel, which releases the ghosts. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act and audible sighs, satisfying the causal lens. However, the father’s radio clues are back-loaded exposition rather than planted constraints that shape tactics. No orientation debt; anchors arrive within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s peace is reweighted from burden to vocation. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of decay/rebirth rather than causal chain. One transition (library → refuge → library) is clean and within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the curl’s re-purposing from private relic to shared talisman reweights meaning with quiet cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of soft intensification rather than causal chain. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. One meaningful cadence shift at totality suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (world dreams again), but the cost is asserted, not dramatized—no visible price is paid by Elara. Causal chain is thin: tapestry → scrolls → ritual succeeds without setback or constraint. Orientation is clear; single-scene default met. Lens holds (Causal) but escalation is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: Li Wei sets out to claim destiny, reconfiguring options. Yet the causal chain from microdot specs → decoded dream → lighthouse journey is sketched rather than demonstrated; the “accidental brush” feels like a deus-ex-machina activation rather than earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the possession dissolves when assumptions are exposed. Causality is thematic rather than sequential—each rhetorical question weakens the foe—so Accumulative/Textural lens holds. Cost is conceptual (loss of unquestioned reality) but not dramatized as personal loss to the priest, keeping it below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the harp’s resonance crystallizes the mirrored horizon with undeniable conceptual cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, though orientation is soft until ~150 words.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the viaduct re-integrates and the tablet fades, reconfiguring her stance toward the labyrinth. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; however, the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the drumstick tap crystallizes new, precarious liveness. Causal beats (needle→method→tear→tap) follow a clear because/therefore without skips. Season rustle anchors early orientation; cavern torchlight remains spatially stable. Cost felt through tear and loss of protective silence. No teleporting props or retro-patches.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as a soft Earned Stasis—Elias leaves with “new purpose”—but the causal chain from message tube to decision is thin: he slips past guards via an off-stage “intuit,” then receives an info-dump that resolves the mystery. The rogue zone’s stakes are declared, not tested; the ending lacks a visible or conceptual price. Orientation is clear, yet the drive lens drifts between situational pressure and causal linkage without tightening either.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s uncorking reweights his stance toward grief with visible cost (the shop’s shadows soften). Causal chain is intact—vial offered → resisted → used → reconfiguration. One minor ellipsis: why the woman’s urgency vanishes. Orientation is clean; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands in an Earned Stasis: Elias sets aside the rope, accepting perpetual re-writing of the poem as price. Causal linkage holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens – each pattern recurrence raises density until the decision is the only path left.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the hush is reconfigured from void to canvas, with the bowl left as guardian. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each musical phrase thickens the texture until silence itself flips meaning. Orientation is clear by line 4. Cost is felt but abstract; a hairline slip from full embodiment keeps it under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the petal’s dissolution reweights the half-truth premise, leaving Elara with “quiet satisfaction” and a lingering ache. Causal chain holds—petal → memory → crafted emotion → transience acknowledged. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of scent, light, and static builds to the cadence shift. No orientation debt; amber grotto anchors by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure lands as a soft Resonant Reconfiguration (friendship forged), but the causal chain is loose: the envelope detour feels like authorial contrivance rather than earned inevitability. Orientation is clear, yet the single transition from concert hall to library is under-motivated. No persistent constraint or price shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration—Echo’s tag on Lira’s sculpture reweights her outsider status to belonging—yet the causal trail from tag-hunt to communal acceptance is compressed into montage, leaving the cost lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the canal labyrinth, glowing gate, and still pool layer density until the final image reweights “time as tapestry.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her sketchbook feels lighter, life now a “symphony”—but the cost is more conceptual than visceral. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s realization that harmony, not control, heals ambiguous loss reweights the premise with conceptual cost. The causal chain (eyes → mosaic → journal → breakthrough) is tight, though the mentor’s vanishing is off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tape reel's voice crystallizes the dweller's purpose, reconfiguring their stance toward visibility. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each fragment adds density until the final hum. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. The only flaw is the soft cost—no tangible forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dissolved leaf and rearranged pots crystallize a before/after stance with felt cost (loss of control). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—storm density and leaf pulse tighten until the cadence shift in the sunlight image. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the exchange of brooch for book crystallizes Elara’s new vocation with visible cost (she gives up the relic). Causal chain is clean—rain trails → ruin → map → cove—yet the old woman’s arrival edges on situational coincidence rather than earned inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s consciousness fuses with the cave, reweighting her identity and purpose. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each crystalline note layers density until the final chorus crystallizes possibility. Cost is legible: she forfeits ordinary human perception for guardianship. One micro-drag: the transition into the pearl could be one sentence tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the harbor’s “absences filling with something tangible” crystallizes Elara’s new stance. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory discovery layers density until the trumpet’s note reweights the world. The keeper’s exit is slightly convenient, but the final image carries undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens: punch appears → midnight arrives → arrows form → gates open → ticket punched. Closure lands with a Decisive Change (embracing the unknown) and a felt cost (abandoning mapped safety). Orientation is clean; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elara’s transcription dissolves the pattern into starlight, a Charged Poise that reconfigures her stance from skeptic to listener. Causality holds—tile warmth and dream compel the climb, tower pedestal triggers the vision. Orientation is anchored by line 4 (“quiet village of Eldermere”) and reinforced at the tower ascent. One transition (shore → cottage → tower) stays within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    Causal lens holds; each beat builds “because” links from curiosity → manipulation → rupture. The decisive change is cleanly legible: Escondite mutiny occurs on-page, dimensions tear, Elyr “felt everything.” Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—new purpose, foreclosed old indifference—framed in a crystallized final sentence. Cost (chaos unleashed, reality wounded) is present though slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal lens: each beat links because/therefore (ink pot → breach → refusal → tentative hand). Closure is Earned Stasis: Clara forecloses flight with visible cost in the father’s grip. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props. Minor ellipsis around the asylum deal is acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer thickens until the dawn cadence reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—the forest’s approval crystallizes her stance—yet the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of salvaged fragments tightens toward the archive discovery, then reweights via the letter. Closure is a Charged Poise—guardianship stance crystallizes with felt conceptual cost (“voice for the silenced”). Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    “Ephemeral compass as state of being” lands as closure (Conceptual Repricing) with felt knowledge shift; causal chain from cello vibration to seashell glow forces cost-based renunciation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the stone at the festival center reconfigures community stance with visible social cost. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; one transition (evening→next morning) is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: she stays to finish the documentation, accepting the risk of being late. The causal chain (mentor’s timed message → her decision to remain) is coherent under a Causal lens, and the cost—possible confrontation with terraforming crews—is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story is framed in Accumulative/Textural mode: each sensory layer thickens until the final image crystallizes. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara’s restored drone and the departing ship reweight “trust between humans and technology,” the price being the anchorless moment of a world in motion. Orientation anchors are clear by ~110 words, and lens stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bell rings, balance restored. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of footsteps thickens until cadence shift. No felt cost is shown; Elias simply smiles. Orientation is clear within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.0)
    The Causal lens is followed cleanly—trap/vision/decrypt/passage—yet the decisive moment of override is delivered in summarizing cadence, blunting the Decisive Change. Orientation is stable, and closure lands, but the cost (oxygen burn, future risk) stays abstract, curtailing RR/CR intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure beats hit the lattice-light repricing (before/after of guilt vs. truth) with tangible cost on the page; causal arc stays tight under Accumulative lens, though motivation for final ascension could carry one more concrete beat of pressure to cross the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bead’s glow reconfigures her stance toward collective debt with felt cost. Causal chain is thin—why the bead awakens now is unexplained—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds via cadence shift and image echo.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the canyon glows with embedded stories, reconfiguring the ruined space into reverence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sewn image layers density until the final cadence shift. Cost is implied in lifelong dedication, but not dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sundial base clicks into place and the mural reframes her exile as cyclical return. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each unearthed shard thickens pattern until the final image reweights it—but the cost is only implied, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise: dawn light arrives while Lyra holds the letter; the “futuristic nostalgia” image re-configures her path. Causality holds with one transition (arcade → mailbox) and no gaps; constraints (mailbox flag, dawn deadline) shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the completed chart crystallizes new purpose under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the observatory’s hum and dawn-light reweighting earlier silence. Causality holds—flame pulses chart shifts Lira arrives synchronized stitching—but the mentor’s disappearance is exposited rather than dramatized, a minor ellipsis. Orientation is swift and spatial anchors remain stable.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard’s dull warmth and the letter’s release reweight the entire journey. Causal linkage holds—each beat (shard hum → condensation map → pedestal letter) tightens options. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. The final image carries undeniable emotional cost without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens each new decrypted line densifies meaning until the final image reweights Elara’s purpose; pacing breathes without gaps. One smooth transition—anesthetic wears off / mist deepens—keeps causality intact. Closure lands in a crystallized, costed resolve: “Tell them the ocean still sings” redefines future options; felt cost visible.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the fog-canvas reweights her understanding of art from pigment to memory-preservation, with the felt cost of years lost. Causal chain (fresco → film → network → painting) is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens; however, the knowledge network’s sudden availability edges toward convenience, slightly blunting the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-scene structure holds; the mural’s harmonic activation is a clear Decisive Change with conceptual cost (loss of certainty). Causal linkage is light—why the coin awakens now is unexplained—but the closure image reconfigures stakes cleanly under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias steps into the night with the seed and a crystallized stance—“tonight, they would stand together.” The causal chain (seed → coordinates → meeting → fight) is legible, and the cost is implied by the encroaching dusk and the word “hunted.” One transition (greenhouse to dusk) is clean. Lens is Causal; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shell “exhales” and the poet steps out, a resonant image. However, the causal chain is thin—weeks of singing produce no intermediate reversals or tightening; pressure remains flat. Orientation is clear early, but the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens is asserted more than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story layers sensory echoes (chime hum → forgotten song → Vessel chorus) until the final image reweights the premise. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance crystallizes into “quiet triumph” while the cost (broken chime, irreversible integration with the museum) is legible. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing parchment reweights the broken trust and visibly costs Elara her prior recklessness. Causal chain is intact—promise → inkwell → symphony → rapprochement. Orientation is swift; no disorientation exploited at closure, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain holds: adhesive clue → poem on chain → compromise blueprint. Closure lands on-page with the dawn presentation and the volcano’s “symbol of unity,” a Resonant Reconfiguration with social cost. The lens is clearly Causal; each beat narrows options until only the floodgate solution remains. Minor ellipsis in how the scholars and villagers instantly accept the plan keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns, meteorite weight, and pigeon wings layer until the final image reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara’s closed-eye listening crystallizes a new stance with felt cost (“she had preserved herself”). Orientation is swift; no causal gaps. One minor slip: the anonymous letter arrives with no prior constraint on pigeon precision, a light coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elara leaves the logbook behind, a Charged Poise that reweights the past and forecloses further search. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each prism flash and code fragment layers density until the final image crystallizes cost. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the escape-pod threshold crystallizes her new stance—belonging as rhythm carried forward—while the cracked domes and sunrise make the cost legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of light intensifies, cadence shifts from solitary to symphonic, and the final image reweights earlier motifs. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. Minor deduction for the abrupt alarm intrusion that feels less “therefore” than “and-then.”

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the image of the flickering path crystallizes the new stance that loss is part of recollection. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each seed and glass glow adds density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the beam of starlight on the bishop offers a resonant image, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt—Elias loses nothing and gains no new constraint. Causality is decorative; the mirrored movements never tighten options or force a choice. Orientation is clear early. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds but lacks decisive intensification that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sentinel’s retreat reconfigures the garden’s silence and Lira’s resolve, with the verse glowing as both shield and sword; causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One transition (twilight → full night) is legible; orientation is anchored by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dawn mist lifts, prism light layers, rings widen, atrium hum crests. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elias’s resolve to “share his reckonings” crystallizes options with felt social risk—yet the cost is more asserted than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the moonlight, box, and feather layer density until the final image crystallizes “purpose heavier than guilt.” Closure lands as Charged Poise; the cost is felt in the relinquishing of the box, though the beat could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the gauge’s purpose is re-weighted from measurement to memory, and the act of creation-over-erasure crystallizes her stance. Accumulative lens holds—each wave deepens pattern and meaning—though the parallel-timeline frame remains ornamental rather than causally active.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure gives a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: final image of walls choosing her re-prices the premise from “map dreams” to “honor memory.” Under Accumulative lens, pattern builds mirror → film negative → diaries → mirror payoff. Cost is on-page: film left on pedestal symbolizes forfeiture of earlier goals.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: each lullaby note layers density until the final cadence shift reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—mirrors stabilize into visions, Elara’s stance crystallizes in shadow, cost legible in her trembling hands. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the signed treaty reconfigures the valley’s future while Elara stands on the terrace, cost legible in her loosened grip and dawn fatigue. Causal linkage is clean—each beat flows from descent to negotiation to signature—yet the ritual mechanics of the terrace remain ornamental rather than causally active.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s release of the egg forecloses her prior path of exploitation with a visible, felt cost—her empire and reputation now at risk. Causal lens holds: drought she caused → guilt → quest → release → rain as possible but uncertain redemption. Orientation is anchored early; no disorientation. One meaningful tightening when the cracks align and she commits.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s awakening is legible and irreversible, charged by the released echoes. Causal chain holds—untangling threads → door opens → dance releases voices—though the “how” of thread-magic remains lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elias resolves to “rebuild” with puppets; cost is implied but not felt on the page. Causality is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of reflection → idea → new plan. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One transition (dawn) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spiral with monarch wing crystallizes Elara’s stance, reconfiguring the stake of remembrance with felt cost (“their message would linger”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of building-then-departing structures tightens once. Orientation anchors by line 3; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the melody of forgotten names returns, re-weighting the premise with felt cost (“she found her own name among the forgotten”). Causality is Accumulative/Textural; the rope’s glow and song arrive as pattern culmination rather than linear trigger, but the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the wafer dissolves, reweighting the premise that resonance, not fate, governs paths. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density increases until the final image reconfigures meaning. One minor causality slip: the directive’s mechanics are never shown to constrain tactics, only interpreted after the fact.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.4)
    The closure image—Kael lifting the tile toward the stars—offers a Charged Poise, but the causality chain is thin: the schematic on the floor instantly reveals the compartment, then the tile instantly reveals the covenant. No intermediate tightening or cost is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene causal arc: broken pin → memory prompt → Kael’s “How do I start?” lands a Decisive Change with felt cost (loss of hardened stance). Orientation is immediate; closure is on-page and coherent under Causal lens. One minor slack: the sanctuary’s reappearance rule is told, not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s fog boundary dissolves, reweighting Elara’s stance from containment to crossing. Causal chain (broken sextant → restoration → boundary erasure) is legible under a Causal lens, though the “synchronized breathing” mechanic appears late and functions more as ritual flourish than constraint. Orientation is clear by ~80 words; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the transformed vow, ribbon woven into the glowing tree, reconfigures meaning with visible cost. Causal chain is intact—key unlocks scroll, petals bloom tree, compass points to ribbon—though the breach itself is backstory exposition rather than on-page event.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance crystallizes with the cameo warming her palm—but the causal chain from finding the object to accepting legacy is compressed; the woman’s exposition resolves tension rather than tightening it.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.1)
    Causal chain holds: diary → chrono-blossom → doorway → bargain. Closure is a clear Decisive Change with conceptual cost (balance of time). However, the mountain’s “shifting walls” behave inconsistently and the diary’s riddles are solved off-stage, softening causality.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each artifact-diary thickens pattern until the mist-door crystallizes. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara accepts unkindled solace and crosses—whose cost is the card’s loss and the implicit forfeiture of any return. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. A slightly tighter causal hinge between reading the threads and the door’s appearance would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the reconfigured rope opens the hidden door, reweighting the tower’s purpose. Causal chain (seal → braid pattern → door) holds, though the cost is conceptual rather than visceral; one tightening suffices for 600–800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the closure lands an Earned Stasis—the shift from “a storm of light and sound” to “gentle lullaby” re-configures the sonic world with visible, felt calm. Causality holds through the because/therefore path cracked-ice→path→bloom→silence. One trivial artifact: “the energy beings’ arrival” is only stated, not delivered through on-page cues, but this does not break pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    The inferred lens is Causal—every choice is a because/therefore toward reassembly. Closure arrives with a Decisive Change and visible cost (permanent memory loss), but the ritual’s mechanics are only asserted, not dramatized in the present frame. We’re asked to accept that memories are siphoned rather than shown how; the link feels assumed rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fog-wall vision reconfigures Elara’s stance from observer to conduit, and the cost—she will answer the call again—is felt in the final hush. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each artifact and shadow adds density until the crystalline forecourt reweights the premise. Orientation is clear by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mosaic + flame tableau crystallizes hope with undeniable conceptual cost—the fortress is changed, Lira departs. Causal chain is light but coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens; one deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is an earned stasis—Elara foregoes linear proving to merge with the tapestry; the causality bridge loops neatly from mentor dispute → scary specific gift → revalued gift in final image, satisfying Accumulative/Textural linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the inversion ends, the bunker’s hush is now intolerable, and the cost is the irreversible knowledge of true silence. Causal chain is tight—training → climb → taste → return—though the gravity rule is introduced late and accepted on faith.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers silence’s texture until the final Charged Poise reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; closure lands on-page with felt cost (“her steps lighter”). One micro-turn—vial clearing—suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: murals → mechanism → stairway → throne → renunciation. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (“throne not meant for one”) with visible cost in forfeited power. Orientation is swift; no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a clear Earned Stasis: Lira seals the threshold by burning one of her own scars, a visible sacrifice that reconfigures her future guardianship. Causal chain holds under a Causal lens; only minor ellipsis between ring-press and collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure lands as a feel-good return with diamonds and hope, but no on-page cost or irreversible change is shown; the portal exit is consequence-free. Causality is loose: the bolt fits “perfectly” because the text says so, and the future-self reveal arrives without prior setup. Orientation is adequate, yet the mosaic leap to the concept-world is summary, not scene. The inferred lens is Causal, but linkage weakens after midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: Eleanor’s choice to accept the role of keeper rather than restorer reweights the dynasty stake with felt resignation. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of sound → vision → acceptance tightens once. No orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory pulse and vine pattern thickens atmosphere until the final image reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—the marionette without strings—whose cost is felt in the vanished program and the knight’s new, uncertain stance.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara decides to “draft a narrative,” foreclosing passive archive caretaking for active stewardship of lost stories. Dust-footprint mechanic serves as pattern link, but the emotional cost is more stated than dramatized; “she smiled, her heart lighter” asserts rather than renders the price of stepping toward the unhealed past.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (wading, unlocking, transmitting) tightens options until the broadcast forecloses capture. Closure is a decisive change—Mara’s disappearance after mass transmission—with the cost of permanent exile legible in “ghost in their machine.”

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each intensification of light and mist reweights the prophecy’s threat. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the grotto’s hush is restored with palpable release—though the prophecy’s “code” is more asserted than decoded on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance crystallizes with the moonstone speck charging the final image—but the causal linkage between the speck’s glow and her irrevocable commitment is slightly under-cooked, muting the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: he forecloses the path of clock-repair perfectionism by crafting a device that celebrates mystery. Causal chain (compass → greenhouse → cavern → map → renunciation) holds under a Situational lens; pressure crystallizes stance. Cost is felt in the quiet loss of his former identity. Orientation is clear by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elara’s stepping into the furnace is a Decisive Change that reconfigures her stance toward the coin and her own name. Causal chain holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the foundry’s shift from rain-washed to aflame is the tightening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the father dissolves, tooth spent, gorge now echoing laughter—cost is felt. Causal chain holds: pursuit → confession → release. Orientation is swift; “hidden sunrise” and “Echo Gorge” anchor by line 3. One transition (descent/ascent) is clean. No lens ambiguity; causal logic dominates.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the strap’s fall into the stream is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights her past and future. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer intensifies until the final image crystallizes—but the causality between “remembering trauma responses” and the insight about mercy is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lens fragment’s glow fades, marking the cost of completed duty. Causal chain is clear—fragment → symbol → map → tower → narrative reclaimed—though the middle jump from market to ruins is elided without felt friction. Orientation is anchored early; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock’s restart heals the building and frees the ghosts, with Marcus left holding the cost of perpetual vigilance (“cracks always reappeared”). Causal chain—barrel → clock → release—holds cleanly. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words. Minor lens wobble early (textural vs causal) but settles on causal by midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rupture → discovery → descent → re-visioning of the library. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the library pulses alive and Elara’s role crystallizes with felt awe. One minor drift: the bottled whisper’s agency is asserted rather than demonstrated, softening causality. Orientation is clear by ~120 words; no caps triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the holographic record reweights the premise and forces Empiricist concession. Causal chain holds—storm → shard → visions → evidence—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. One minor ellipsis: how she breaches the sealed Hall is elided, but the gap doesn’t rupture closure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: stranger’s arrival → discovery of tether → journey → freeing act. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the light returns and the covenant’s rust recedes. Cost is implied but not viscerally felt on the page. One minor ellipsis (how the map translates to travel) is gracefully elided.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: compass lost, mystery embraced, with visible forfeiture. Causal chain holds—compass leads, psychometry confirms, compass surrendered—though the hinge between worlds is declared rather than tested in action.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.2)
    Causal chain is clear—slide pulses → Mara steps inside, discovers chamber → new map redefines art and future. Yet the final shift feels more thematic announcement than culminating beat, lacking decisive stakes narrowed on-page under the Situational strain.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (postcards, dream, pavilion) and held to closure, but the pattern never tightens; each shard adds texture without narrowing options or raising stakes. The cathedral visit is summarized rather than rendered as a scene, so the “dawning hush” never becomes a concrete pivot that reweights the mural task. Closure lands as a soft epiphany (“she realized then…”) rather than an on-page reconfiguration with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lagoon’s acceptance reconfigures Elara’s options and the cost—an open-ended guardianship—hovers in the stilling water. Causal chain is clean (diary → messages → apparition), but the apparition’s instant assent feels slightly convenient, muting the earned price.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the cove lives, Elara walks away, lanterns persist—cost is conceptual (she can’t stay) and felt. Causal linkage is thin: the bottle responds to thought, but the leap from memory to material revival is ellipsis, not dramatized beat. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the pattern holds; the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is clear by word 60; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s sigh and warmer air mark a before/after shift. Causal chain (silent foghorn → phonograph → deciphering symbols) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens, though the garden’s response is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara steps through the vortex with “unwavering resolve,” reconfiguring her mission from preservation to active restoration. Causality, however, is loose—entropy reversal is asserted, not dramatized; the acorn cap unlocks the gate without prior constraint or price. Orientation is swift, yet the vortex’s rules are taught only at the exit beat, blurring the lens. Cost is conceptual (“responsibility”) but not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bell rope’s use as a tactile dial-up to the world’s heartbeat ties micro-climate tracking to mythic ambience, creating one decisive linkage (because-of/therefore) toward the zero-hour threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern’s dimming transfers its “strength” to Lira, reweighting her stance toward stillness. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of stars, lantern pulses, cleaning beats—but the causal linkage between lantern and constellation could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-scene default met; orientation is clear by ~120 words. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (awakening oasis) with conceptual cost (lifelong guardianship accepted). Causal chain is thin—box opens itself, ritual succeeds without setback—so escalation is more accumulative than driven. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the chronometer stabilizes and Elara claims a “profound sense of purpose,” a Charged Poise that reconfigures her stance. Causality is causal-lite—each beat follows plausibly—but the middle garage-sale sequence is an accumulative montage rather than a tightening chain of because/therefore. Still, no retroactive patches or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-scene causal arc: kite falls → repair → release. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (shared rekindled belief) with gentle felt cost—loss of talisman. Orientation is clear by line 40; no lens ambiguity. Minor causality gap: why the kite’s words glow is unexplained, but doesn’t break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias’s final diary entry crystallizes the orchard’s new purpose with felt legacy-cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of copper wire, diary pages, and stone carvings tighten toward the last image. Orientation is clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the amber map reweights “homecoming” from formula to felt experience. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ascending footprints, layered amber pieces, and final light-merge tighten the stake. Cost is felt—her skepticism is conceptually foreclosed—but the price could be sharper had she relinquished a concrete token.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a quiet Charged Poise: coachman drives off leaving a living promise; the image reweights the jetty from loss to hope with conceptual cost (time, solitude). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of seed, bird-call, twilight deepens until final cadence shift. Orientation anchored early; no causality breaks. Closure cost could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the leaf redefines “distance” into “closeness” with a felt social cost—Elias renounces solitude. Causality is light but coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density around the leaf tightens until meaning flips. One transition (cabin → factory) is clean. Orientation is secure by 120 words. No causality break, but the cost is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sketch stroke layers density until the dawn image reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara’s resolve reconfigures her pariah status into calling—yet the causal chain from shutdown to this moment is more asserted than shown, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: each chess move tightens options until the final swap reveals the lid’s true function. Closure lands with a visible sky-change and implied personal cost, satisfying the Decisive Change test.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the walking pattern crystallizes Elara’s new stance with felt cost (“no longer echoes of the past, but promises”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and cadence shift reweight the stake. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causal leaps. One transition (shadow → etched floor) is seamless. Closure cost is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the language-stone mirrors fragmented self into harmonious “state of home,” a Charged Poise that reconfigures future identity under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds and the bookstore reshapes as direct consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the labyrinth’s message reframes forgiveness as ongoing journey, with the chess piece now a talisman of that stance. Causal chain holds—tapestry insight → labyrinth entry → thread pull → reconfiguration—though the king parable arrives late and externally.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: lyric refrains accumulate, mist thickens, light refracts into shadow-figures, each layer tightening moral stakes without traditional causal twists. Closure lands via Earned Stasis: Lira’s renunciation—surrender of a heart-shard to carry a refracted truth—reads as decisive, with cosmic weight signaled by the dissolving shadows. Orientation is clear within 120 words; one transition between tower interior and spire surface is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the statue’s glow quilts memories into a charged poise of hope, with the workshop’s steadiness as felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern recognition and density increase reweight meaning. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. Minor slack: the acid-sea threat never truly narrows options, so escalation is more atmospheric than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal arc—“wrong turn forces detour leads to discovery leads to canvas”—is clean, linear, legible. Closure lands as earned stasis: she returns lighter but the path hasn’t actually changed; the cost is her newly claimed public exposure more than a measurable forfeiture. No teleporting props; geography tracks.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stance crystallizes when he raises his hand to the beckoning figure, accepting that quiet intent outreaches noise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of scent, vibration, and dawn light tightens until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. Cost is felt in the ache of “screaming tenderness” and the relinquishing of louder self-proof.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain (calls → build → beacon → arrivals) is legible and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the station becomes refuge, Mara’s isolation ends. Closure is on-page and carries felt cost—the censer foot dims, reminding her the cycle is endless—yet the first traveler’s appearance feels slightly convenient rather than earned by prior mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds: eye found → truth compulsion → ritual return → restored safety. Closure (returning the eye at dawn with recitation) is on-page, decisive, and costs Elias his involuntary honesty. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the mist thickens, the boot-print appears, the journal surfaces, each beat layering density until the final beam cuts through. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elias’s stance crystallizes with felt cost, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    The plot follows a tidy portal-fantasy arc: discovery → passage → revelation → return. Causality is smooth but low-torque; the matrix chip simply works, the wall opens without resistance, and the cloaked figure delivers exposition. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias embraces guardianship—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt; no prior option is visibly foreclosed. Orientation is clear, yet the drive lens feels more Accumulative/Textural than Causal because choices don’t tighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal lens adopted: the grotto demands ascent, the voice confronts her with world-level price, and her explicit vow to restore balance forecloses a return to mere rule; the cascade of starlight and the softening glow provide on-page closure with felt cost. Occasional summary ascent beats—“each step a deliberate act”—slightly dilute link-by-link tension, but every consequential turn stems from her choice to climb deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing shell crystallizes the shared instant, reweighting time itself. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of presence thickens through sensory layering and chant cadence. Orientation is swift; causality is lyric rather than linear, taught early and paid off. Cost is implied but not viscerally enacted, keeping it just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly with a Resonant Reconfiguration: the scroll’s final sentence crystallizes meaning and the cabin hums approval. Causal linkage is lyric rather than plot-driven; the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, though the grave visit is off-stage and the scroll’s agency is more metaphorical than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elara’s conceptual repricing—her redefinition of “ordinary miracles” via the warm screw—reweights premise (loss ≠ deficit but new lens). Causality follows Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern builds from gear work → object handling → final perception shift; cost is the irretrievable past she now refuses.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the archive glows, the bottle lightens, the orchard sighs—an earned shift in emotional weight. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (scent, hum, glowing scores) deepens the pattern until the final image reweights memory. Cost is felt in the irrevocable loss of the orchard, acknowledged but not reversed.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dictionary merges with the mural, reweighting the premise. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned imagery and hush deepen until the final resonance. One transition (chamber to chamber) is legible; orientation holds. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the parchment reweights the premise that time is gaps, not seconds. Causal chain is tight—key slip → notch → scroll → redefinition—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible: Elias’s prior certainty is foreclosed, though the price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clear: trace → figure → verbal catalyst → acceptance. Closure lands in Charged Poise—“not just an intrusion detection specialist”—with the farm’s glow reweighted. The only drag is the overt expository summary of father’s physics lessons, a minor retro-fit that does not break the linkage. Cost is legible in the renunciation of defensive posture.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara crystallizes her stance to keep searching, with the lantern’s glow as charged poise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned subway scrawls and refracted light reweight meaning—but the causal bridge between “lucid contradictions” and the final resolve could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Eli’s phone call crystallizes his new stance—but the causal chain between hearing the melody and deciding to dial is slightly telescoped; one more on-page micro-choice would have tightened the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise: Elara begins to document, the covenant now hers to carry. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of memory layers tightens until the final image of fading light and blooming jetty reweights the stake. Cost is felt in the phrase “her work was not just about the past—it was about the promise,” but the causality from listening to Mara to this vow could be crisper.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—station reverts, Elara’s stance toward connection changes—but the causal chain is thin: touching the clock triggers a vision whose cost is only asserted (“her heart no longer heavy”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early but escalation is more tableau than tightening. Orientation is clear by 120 words, so no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the compass needle stills at the stillpoint, crystallizing her stance with felt cost. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; only a whisper of orientation drift in the forest’s spatial cues keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the pen’s glow fades as the anomaly stabilizes, a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Causal chain holds—seed → anomaly → pen → unbending—though the middle transition (“she began to write, her hand moving of its own accord”) leans on convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative lens holds: scene deepens density of gestures until pattern break—the camera “click” reverberates. Closure image (glowing lens in hand) is earned reconfiguration with felt cost: her energy gone, legacy crystallized. One soft ripple: causality of why the mute world suddenly “listens” left partly to inference, not on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    Smooth cause-and-and linkage moves from portrait to mural to scroll, but the promised act of actually taking—burning, saving, or delivering—never materializes. Closure is an epiphany rather than a decisive, costed reconfiguration; the promise is "rescued" via interpretation, removing physical jeopardy and the stakes leak away.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the garden’s harmonic density builds until the lagoon’s hum reconfigures Elara’s stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—her tear-mix with “auroral sorrow” crystallizes cost without solving everything. One smooth transition from garden path to stone perch keeps scope tight; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the key-turn reweights the premise that “whispers hold power,” with the labyrinth’s groan as felt cost. Causal chain holds: coin → map → key → lock. One minor causality wobble: the map’s “shifting ink” is never exploited after introduction. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: shutter-weaving pattern builds density toward a Charged Poise closure. Anchors clear by 80 words; final image reweights the premise with felt cost as stranger leaves lighter. One micro-turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise (town pausing at displays), but the cost is asserted, not dramatized. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, yet the final image lacks a felt forfeiture. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality break, but escalation is gentle rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the island fades and Elara rows away changed. Causal chain (scrimshaw summons island → detachment dissolves barrier) is legible, but the whale’s mechanics are soft; cost is felt yet diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene structure holds; the Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early via turbine drone and whittling rhythm, culminating in Charged Poise at the window. Closure reweights the bouquet and heart, but the causality of “lightness in grief” remains more asserted than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the poet’s surrender to the quartz song dissolves self-boundaries and reweights the world. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift carry the arc. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the concertina’s song reconfigures Elias’s stance toward beauty, with the glassblower’s spoken validation sealing the cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of barter → music → image—but the final beat leans on dialogue rather than embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a soft CR (re-weighting progress via lens image) but the causal chain is loose: the lens refracts sounds, Elara “feels” enlightenment, but no decisive act or irreversible cost seals the pilgrimage. Mosaic shards (lab, past recordings) are legible, yet transitions float free of tightening pressure. Orientation is clear, but lens ambiguity persists.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure image (vine inked onto her arm, soft golden light) offers a Resonant Reconfiguration—grief re-blooms into resolved work—but stakes remain muted because external risk never rises beyond personal epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: Mira’s knock → data reveal → Tower re-weighting forms a clear because/therefore chain. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance crystallizes into “patterns can be reversed,” with the measuring tape’s inches now standing for millions lost. Cost is legible in the dawn light and their exhausted vigil. Minor ellipsis in how the tape’s units translate to blockchain timestamps keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pagoda’s light reweights the premise from “unlock lost truth” to “mirror inner memory,” costing her innocence. Pattern is taught early (avoid patterns) and paid off when she reads the erased floor tiles. One transition (twilight deepening) is clean. Causality holds under the lyric weave; cost is unmistakable in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sculpture of light/darkness crystallizes the stake and carries felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of archival obsession → vial discovery → transformation—held cleanly to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the story deepens through sensory density and pattern break (muted tail → charged talisman) rather than causal turns. Closure is a Charged Poise: the shelf placement reconfigures meaning with quiet but legible cost—she steps into a future where trust must be re-earned. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the merged hourglasses visibly reconfigure meaning and the cost is felt in the fading scars—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by 120 words; however, the tunnel sequence relies on dream-logic coincidence rather than tightening causality.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the film strip’s letters accumulate emotional density until the projector dies, reweighting the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—Elara’s decision to take the strip crystallizes options with felt cost (“for the first time… purpose”). Orientation anchored by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lyrical layering of aurora, astrolabe, stardust. Yet no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration lands; the piece ends in poised anticipation rather than closure with cost. Orientation is clear by 120 words, but causality stalls—no “because/therefore” tightening. Feels like an exquisite opening chapter, not a complete 600-800 word unit.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ticking clock re-ignites the archive and reweights Mara’s role from cultivator to guardian of divergence. Causal chain holds—charm descent → archive revival → new jars—though the archive’s “dying” stakes are asserted more than dramatized. One transition (dune to cavern) is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the machine’s light reweights the rainforest as metaphor for mind, with conceptual cost (“he was its explorer, its guardian”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of discoveries thickens until the final cadence shift. However, the gear’s insertion feels slightly convenient because its prior beats never narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the blank ticket and air-punch reconfigure meaning with visible cost—the star now inside her. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the ridgeway’s mist and indirect route tighten the cadence toward this crystallized moment without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s first piano notes transform silence into “frostbitten hope,” foreclosing his prior role. Causal chain is tight—stain → door → bolt → knowledge → play—though the bolt’s agency could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain from first cryptic note to final unmasking is legible; each marked book tightens the noose. Closure lands with the pellet drop—a decisive reconfiguration that costs the pretender their mask. One minor ellipsis: how the messages physically reach the throne room.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative lens holds: each beat layers pattern (tapping, atlas, data ritual) until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a quiet CR that re-prices the coastline’s absence, though the causal chain to that image could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: “a spark ready to reignite the flame,” charged with the felt cost of abandoning armed glory for subtle stewardship. Micro tension tightens from lull (scattered rebels) to reconfiguration once the hum reweights her identity—no causality breaks. Orientation is clean by paragraph 2; spaceport, dusk, single POV established. One hairline artifact: “vibrant, living constellations” introduces mild symbolic inflation at the climactic beat, but it remains character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the embryo cracks open, reweighting the Reconstruction’s meaning from suppression to rebirth. Causal chain holds—kite script → embryo alignment → eruption of light—though the guard’s vanishing is a soft ellipsis rather than earned consequence. Orientation is swift: volcanic hot springs, steam, Mara alone, all anchored within 120 words. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of plant whispers, embryo pulse, and script shimmer tighten until the final image crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the redesigned card pattern reweights meaning, cost felt in the ache that becomes “guide, muse, truth.” Causal lens holds—each beat is “because therefore” linked to Elara’s sorting of cards. Orientation is clear by line 4; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the ink’s revelation reweights the premise from “control time” to “accept memory,” with Elara’s lighter heart as felt cost. Causal chain is intact—drone leads, ink shows, stance shifts—though the ink’s rules are revealed rather than tested earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: letter → descent → breach → copy → exit. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost: “her world would never be the same.” One minor causality wobble: the “blink that follows surprise” is declared but not timed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a quiet Charged Poise (she stands with blade sheathed, life blooming behind her), but the lens drifts from Causal to Accumulative/Textural without teaching the shift; the warning from Kael sets up stakes that are never tested on the page, so the “before/after” is more mood than consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden is “whole again,” the constellations resume purposeful paths, and the rail spike becomes a “tether.” The lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and pattern shift reweight meaning. However, the causality between Kael’s zigzag walk and the goddess’s appearance is more lyrical than driven, so the tightening feels lightly earned rather than compelled.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: each discovery tightens the noose (misaligned scopes → notes → vanished journalist). Closure lands with the telescope re-aimed at stars—an Earned Stasis that visibly costs her safety and severs her old life.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the firmware’s melody turns mournful-soothing, the lab falls silent, and Elara’s stance crystallizes with felt cost. Causal chain (letters → response → firmware shift) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One micro-turn suffices; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mandala dissolves, flake fades, and Elara’s stance crystallizes with cost (“lilac unease remained…a guide”). Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds; pattern taught early via tile flake and mandala, final image reweights silence.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.1)
    Closure is a soft uplift (“plaza… beacon of hope”) rather than a legible Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing; no on-page cost is felt. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the cadence shift is muted—patterned description repeats without deepening. Orientation is clear early, yet causality slackens: the mosaic responds to touch (“seemed to shift”) but never alters real options. Final image lacks the charge required for 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s timeline visibly knits, the coin’s glow transfers, and Mara’s encore continues with bittersweet cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each echo layers density until the final image reweights possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of light, shimmer, static builds density toward a resonant final image. Closure is a Charged Poise (“willowglass hope”) but the cost is asserted, not dramatized—no exhaustion, no ruined film, no bodily price. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality break, yet the tightening is more mood than irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s role shifts from map-maker to storyteller with conceptual cost. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens, though the fossil’s agency floats close to coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the silent jar and the pouch of bone button crystallize a new stance—guardianship of shared wisdom—without resolving the prophecy. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of buttons → echo → insight tightens once, reweighting possibility. Orientation is immediate; no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each snow-code and pillbox touch layers density until the hollow-tree letter reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Charged Poise—dawn path, mist lifting—with felt cost (renouncing the pill) legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lens lands as Accumulative/Textural: fog density and yarn needle come back into the final image, the ticking gutter spell runs out to trigger a cadence shift. Yet causal impetus for the mentor’s appearance is missing; nothing in prior texture seeds that beat, costing 0.4 under lens ambiguity rule.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s understanding reframes the oasis and her role—yet the causal chain from lantern-glass visions to village mobilization is elided, softening the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shared tooth crystallizes a new connection, reconfiguring both characters’ isolation. Causality is mostly situational—coincidence brings them together—but the moment is legible and the cost (vulnerability, foreclosed solitude) is felt. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena becomes the library’s living bridge, the orb’s pulse syncing with her heartbeat. Causal chain holds—sundial unlocks door, orb rewrites self—yet the price (loss of prior identity) is implied rather than shown on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure meets Accumulatl/Textural lens: nest inserted → installation “Rejoin” blooms → images knit a universal web. The sequence is a cadence deepening rather than a because/therefore chain, so lens stays coherent under the lyric build-up. Orientation clear by line 5; no ambiguity debt. Penultimate line’s felt “profound sense of peace” delivers necessary cost (non-return of nest, irrevocable offering) without exposition clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: signal → decode → counter-frequency → distortion → community fracture → vigilance. Closure is Earned Stasis: she forecloses the option to leave, accepting perpetual watch. Cost is legible in the final solitude and the station’s hum. One transition (Hank’s entrance) is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chamber’s expansion and the compass pointing outward crystallize a new stance with felt cost (claustrophobia faced). Causal linkage holds—compass guides, shard reconfigures space—though the spatial-mutiny rule is asserted more than demonstrated in mid-story beats.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the portrait of the quarry crystallizes Elara’s stance and reweights the cold case from puzzle to empathic bridge. Causality is mostly Accumulative/Textural; the ribbon fragments and mist build density rather than drive because/therefore turns. One tightening beat—the figure’s appearance—complicates but does not foreclose options; the ending drifts rather than decisively alters the path.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands via magical reversal, not protagonist causation: the copper nail depresses itself, the map glows, ancestors appear, and Elara’s “choice” is stated rather than performed on the page. The jet-stream shift is treated as lore, not an ongoing constraint shaping tactics right up to the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the glass flake resolves into a sanctuary map, reweighting the premise. Causality is light—discovery feels guided by landscape coincidence rather than driven choice—but the ending image reconfigures meaning with visible cost (the vanished hitchhiker).

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias reweights the train and money into a lesson, with the cost being the acceptance of circular fate. Causal chain is light—journal discovery is convenient—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through pattern and cadence shift. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dawn image crystallizes her stance—“no longer alone”—with felt cost in the relinquished silence. Causal chain is light (stars → pattern → insight) but coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation is swift and stable. One minor ellipsis: how the telegram’s message links to temple symbols is intuited rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the plant stabilizes the vortex and Eira’s self-image simultaneously, cost paid in the whispered confession. Causal lens holds—each circle tightens because the vortex demands surrender. Orientation is clear by line 5; no teleporting props. One transition (stepping into vortex) is within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant mends with visible light-ripple and Elara’s earned poise. Causal chain holds (clipping → scars → pedestal), but the maze’s logic feels lightly situational rather than strictly causal.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: Elara accepts her trammel with felt cost (“I’ll stay… until there’s nothing left of me”). Causal chain holds—tarot warning → confrontation → choice—under a Causal lens. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props or retro patches.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal through-line holds: every beat is motivated (appraisal failure → quarry retreat → grille reckoning) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration—confidence recast as hope—delivered on the last line with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Eliara’s new understanding bridges ambition and present reality—but the cost is only implied (“felt lighter”). Causal chain is smooth: seed planted → visions → tree → fruit → insight. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the runes settle, identities stabilize in new forms, and Elara’s acceptance reconfigures her task. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned imagery and cadence shift reweight the premise. However, the inciting anomaly (moon-gone-rogue) is off-stage; causality between lunar chaos and Elara’s ritual is asserted, not shown, blunting the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the crown’s activation reweights the premise from inspection to stewardship. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the felt cost is asserted rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s self-charted map becomes the new compass, foreclosing the medicated haze forever. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory layer (ivy light, graffiti echo, taped leather) tightens the emotional vise until the final image reweights the premise. The cost is legible in the raw ache she accepts as the price of clarity. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal drive (Situational → Causal hybrid) holds: each move from mist gate → cipher shelf → quill moment tightens options toward the staged revelation. Closure lands with visible cost—her shifting stance becomes charged poise under library light. Orientation clean.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands hard: the violin’s song reconfigures space and stakes, with felt cost as Dominion scouts falter; causal link between coffee-stain augury and choice is present though lightly dramatized under lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s embrace of stillness reweights her goal under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the emerald’s fade and the traveler’s disappearance supply felt cost, though the traveler’s agency edges toward coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the hairpin’s glow and her newfound “practice” of contentment reweight the premise with felt cost. Causal chain holds—hairpin drop → map → shell → lake → return—though the shell’s agency is slightly convenient. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural; pattern of ascent and descent tightens cadence effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the letter-plus-shard constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration that reframes Mara’s doubt as generative. Causal chain is light—wind-chime “code” is asserted rather than demonstrated—but the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of chimes → reflection → letter builds density toward the final image. No orientation debt; lighthouse, dawn, and salt air are anchored early. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of uncertainty) and legible in the shard’s inclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s public confession reweights her prior silences. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of stone/ripple/truth culminates in a cadence shift. Cost is legible in the grotto’s hush and her unburdened heaviness, though the price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Kael’s realization reframes the arrowhead from weapon to compass, crystallizing stillness as the new stance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern recognition in the birds’ flight tightens meaning rather than causality. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props or causality breaks. The only minor drag is a reflective block that slightly dilutes momentum before the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal spine holds: Eli’s inability to conform → rejects automated spells → seeks keystone → chooses manual harness+ mist walking. Closure lands with visible felt cost (he forecloses peer approval path).

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the blank page fills with light, crystallizing Elias’s commitment under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is thin—why this library, why now?—but the pattern of accumulating luminous vows tightens stakes by reweighting the key’s meaning. Orientation is secure by 120 words. The cost is conceptual (a life redirected) rather than viscerally felt on the page, keeping it shy of 9-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the observatory becomes a bridge, Lira’s stance crystallizes, and the cost is the open-ended responsibility of rebirth. Causal lens holds—each coin submersion tightens her path. Orientation is clear by line 3. One micro-turn: static bursts distilled into usable prophecy. No teleporting props; the coins and apparatus remain tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the naming ritual crystallizes the monsters and re-weights Elara’s purpose. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each echo of sacrifice layers density until the final image reconfigures her stance. Cost is legible in the fading crystalline forms and her acceptance of perpetual heartbreak.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.1)
    The causal arc is clear—collecting, analysing, ringing—but the “because therefore” turns could be more compressed under 800 words. Closure lands with visible poetic reconfiguration (bitter ring bringing the first wave) under a lyrical lens.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the town’s emotional resurfacing is legible and carries social cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each photograph layers density until the sapphire label reweights meaning. One transition (night walk → morning square) is clean. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the crystal on the altar reconfigures her stance, fusing logic and intuition with visible shimmer and starling-symphony. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern density (starlings, flame, orchard hum) tightens toward the resonant reconfiguration. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pattern’s revelation reweights the premise and the arbor’s glow confirms the cost of trust preserved. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and cadence shift escalate stakes; orientation is clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s decisive strike dissolves the jar and the numbness, reconfiguring identity with visible cost (the lost separateness of the duplicate). Causal linkage holds—each sword strike is a question answered by the brain’s mirrored response—though the “history rewrites itself” frame remains ornamental. Orientation is clean by 120 words; the floating dojo and void are anchored through Kael’s bodily focus.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain—seed → key → door—lands cleanly with a decisive change (discovery of chamber), yet the cost is conceptual rather than felt; the lens holds but closure lacks palpable price.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: tentative laughter returns, reweighting the premise. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of sound and echo increases until the tunnel “exhales.” Cost is felt in Eli’s exhaustion, though the causality between lullaby and laughter remains lightly magical rather than rigorously earned.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s “I will wait” forecloses immediate return, cost framed by “the garden will fade.” Causal chain—pendant appears → keeper warns → choice made—holds under Situational lens. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.7)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: each beat is because/therefore linked—“failed vivifying,” therefore “pivot to creative destruction,” therefore “charge the soil.” Closure qualifies as Earned Stasis—Elara renounces resurrection for rebirth, carrying visible cost in ash and sapling. Orientation held past 120 words. No telegraphed exposition post-resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the shard’s release reconfigures the city from ruin to rebirth under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The moon’s perigee and the shard’s hum tighten the pattern toward a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost—the city’s glow and Elara’s relinquishment of control.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens reads Causal: every beat connects Mara’s attempts to their consequences (“channeling energy into its empty chambers,” ferry re-emerges). Closure delivers a decisive change: timelines merged and ferry restored, final image—“hourglass now filled with glowing sand”—supplies Charged Poise, cost legible in her collapsed body and “forever changed.” One micro turn fulfills single-cycle structure; causal linkage stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the gallery dissolves, the thread tangles, and the world outside feels “sharper,” reconfiguring perception with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density increases until reality re-weights itself—though the causality between weaving and memory fracture could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the towers remain, now hybrid star-and-abyss charts, with a felt cultural cost (Council’s fear). Causal chain holds: Elara’s ritual persuades city and aliens; no teleporting props. One minor ellipsis: how the Council reverses remains off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    The closure beat—slipping the warm photograph into her satchel—qualifies as Charged Poise (earned), but arrival feels foreshortened: pulses never tighten or obstruct her path; only one micro-choice (“she nodded”) stands between discovery and finish.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure delivers a resonant reconfiguration—the shimmering realm dissolves back into a charged poise: Elena now accepts the hidden ("that was okay") with codex in hand and mentor glimpsed, the price being the inability to reclaim Dr. Voss. Causal linkage holds from beat to beat; only a smidgen of late summary tempers perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene structure holds; the inkblot data → defragment → ghost reveal chain is legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard’s glow and dawn light crystallize her new stance with felt cost (“tears welled”). Orientation is clear by 120 words. Minor drift: the ghost’s causal weight is more tonal than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s renunciation of safety saves the language but shatters the diamond and nearly herself, cost paid in body and artifact. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—each echo layers texture until the pattern breaks with felt consequence. One minor lag: the “tunnel of echoes” anchor could arrive ~40 wds sooner, causing a −0.3 orientation slip, balanced by strong image payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single-scene causal arc holds: search → find → metamorphose → release. Orientation is swift; the cordless call triggers the garden shift with clear before/after. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) but cost is more atmospheric than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single continuous scene, causal lens: music → statues freeze → roots rise. Closure is a clear Decisive Change with visible cost (orchard reborn, statues gone). Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. Minor slack: the heartbeat “signal” rule is asserted late, not seeded early, so causality feels slightly retrofitted.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal lens holds: because Elias carries the storm, therefore he must evade patrol drones; because he succeeds, the sky mends. Closure is a Charged Poise—truce glows, but he turns away, cost legible in “half-full satchel.” Orientation is clear by line 4. Minor causality wobble: patrol drone chase resolves via “narrow crevice” without prior setup, a convenience rather than earned constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored carousel crystallizes the new possibility born from silence. Causal chain is thin—fragment summons song, song awakens carousel—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds via pattern of hush → chime → song → light. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s living nature is revealed and Elara’s role crystallizes with the scarf restored. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density increases until the kaleidoscope doorway—yet the cost (loss of the secret realm’s vibrancy) is implied more than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara chooses creation over retrieval, and the cost is the acceptance that the dream itself must be remade. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of light and pigment layers until meaning reweights. Orientation is clear by line 4. One minor drift: the “cipher” is never decoded on the page, only accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is present—orb shatters, idea freed—but the cost is abstract (“everything felt different”) rather than concrete or felt. Causal chain is smooth until the vault’s living locks, which shift without consequence; the phrase her mother taught her resolves the mechanism too easily. Orientation is clear within 120 words, but the vault’s rules remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the broken constellation aligns with the fairy ring, reconfiguring Elara’s options with felt anticipation. Causal chain holds—mushroom gap → locket → sky pattern—though the final beat could sharpen the cost beyond breath-held awe.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard-mirror shifts from prison to portal, reweighting the premise with felt conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of tea-leaf patterns and shadow geometry tightens once, then crystallizes. Orientation is clear by ~80 words; no causality breaks. One minor ellipsis (how the shadow actually “responds”) is tolerated under lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causal turns hinge on planting the seed and the radiance that locks in restoration, both shown on page. Orientation is gentle: who/where anchored early, waterfall serves as running meter. Closure earns a charged hush but slightly generalized; one sharper beat of consequence could have tightened the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each loosened knot increases narrative density until the hush lifts. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the stillness after the last whisper—felt as earned cost, though the causal jump from “plea” to instant release is slightly abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the discovery of the chapel reweights the henge from relic to testament, and Elara’s stance crystallizes into guardian-of-silence with felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned layering of video frames, rain-scoured stone, and silence builds to a cadence shift. Orientation is clear by 120 words. One minor causality wobble: the footage discrepancy alone does not clearly force the dig; empathy supplies the missing push.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of unfinished narratives tightens toward the letter’s release imperative. Closure—placing the globe and swimming away—earns Earned Stasis with felt conceptual cost (“lullaby” reweights silence). No orientation drift; causality intact under lyric pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the ghost steps into wholeness and dissolves, a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost—Elara’s solitude after the touch. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of lightning–thunder intervals, graffiti shifts, and bolt-plate hums tighten the weave. One causal link is weak: why the bolt plate is the “key” is asserted rather than earned. Orientation is swift; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands cleanly with the diary’s decrypted line reweighting the quest, but the ascent is an and-then sequence of set pieces rather than because/therefore causality. Each floor yields a clue without raising stakes or foreclosing options. The final beat satisfies the lens (Accumulative/Textural) yet lacks a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the gondola is repaired and Elara’s theory is affirmed, but the cost is only implied (“quiet explosion of gratitude”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of sky-memory deepens—yet the causal trigger for the gondola’s sudden restoration is elided, blurring the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands: sky mirrored inside the book safe, paid for by imminent collapse. Causal linkage holds under an accumulative-textural lens; quiet final poise reconfigures the infinite within the finite.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the map reweights the premise, and “Persevera” crystallizes the new stance. Causal chain is clean—hopscotch board → beam → hatch → map—though the vanishing Captain is an off-stage convenience that slightly dilutes motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the hall of mirrors reweights her purpose and the ticking clock ratifies it. Causal chain is thin—symbols align rather than force choices—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds and the final image carries conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly with the bell’s ring and nebula’s return—a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the garden and the planet. Causality is causal-lite: because they fix the bell, the nebula revives; the link is legible but not deeply pressured. No orientation debt; the drive lens (Causal) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—nested patterns accumulate density until the final cadence shift. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: the mended puppet and steadying beam crystallize stakes without resolving them; cost is the blood and exhaustion on the page. Orientation is swift; no causal leaps. One transition (dusk → night) handled by light change.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: nut-impression → map → rescue → bud. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—curse weakened, role redefined—paid for by the risk taken under circling birds. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-scene, single-POV default met; closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost—“ready to walk” implies forfeiture of safe isolation. Causal chain is thin: river insight triggers change rather than forcing it, but lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library re-orders itself and Elara’s empty vial signals spent resource. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of fragmentation → integration—but the causal “because” between incising glass and universal re-alignment is more poetic than mechanical, softening the cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pavilion dissolves and Elara’s sorrow is lightened, with felt cost in the tear-filled subsuming of the shard. Causal chain holds—tidal-pool reading leads to pavilion, each memory touched refines the next—but a slight ellipsis in how the shard’s dissolution alters her future choices keeps it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock’s first chime in decades crystallizes the community’s shift from silos to chorus. Causal chain holds—song turns gears, gears summon townsfolk, townsfolk complete the chord—though the cost is collective rather than personal to Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-scene causal arc holds: broken mirror → modification → portal vision → vow. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost (“no matter the cost”), but the price remains abstract; lens is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed in hand crystallizes new guardianship with felt weight; causality holds under a Situational lens—gravity’s inversion forces stance crystallization without tidy payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.9)
    Non-linear lyric design; closure is Earned Stasis via the hedgehog’s re-curl, but its symbolic link is slightly forced after late introduction. Orientation stays clear via sensory anchors, yet causality slips when the porcelain insulator leaps to “conduit-turned-amplifier” without earlier rule seed.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: toppling the king crystallizes her shift from exile to guide. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each chess move thickens the pattern until the final image reweights the covenant. Cost is legible in the sacrifice of the knight and the dented stone.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single continuous scene, single POV, clear orientation by ~120 words. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): diary opened, silence honored, fireworks erupt—cost is felt as inherited responsibility rather than forfeiture. Causal linkage is light (frequency tuning → clasp yields) but coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens. No teleporting props or outline drift.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure is a soft epiphany—“profound understanding” delivered via aroma—without a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration that forecloses a path. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the cadence shift is more mood modulation than tightening. Orientation is adequate, yet causality between seed, tide, and insight remains metaphorical rather than operational.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arrow tip’s restoration crystallizes Elara’s new purpose under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds, yet the cost is only implied (“journey far from over”) rather than felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.7)
    Elected lens: Causal—because her documentation yields knowledge that forecloses the path. Closure meets criteria: her realization reweights the mission from investigation to mission-bound vigil, carrying conceptual cost. Orientation is early and spatial anchors hold; causality from storm amplification to crash landing is explicit. However, the DC is narrated (not dramatized on page), slightly muting the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the living hush redefines silence from absence to possibility, with aurora colors charging the final image. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each bell stroke layers color until the hush coheres—yet the sculptor’s chisel remains off-stage, a coincidental trigger rather than a causal constraint. Cost is felt conceptually but not dramatized on Elara’s body or future.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands: the decisive note dissolves worlds with conceptual cost. Earlier driftwood markers signal causal breadcrumbs under an accumulative lens, but two beats resolve via happenstance rather than because/therefore linkage—minor slippage in the final corridor. Orientation clear by p3.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stance toward empathy crystallizes with felt cost (“he carried with him the faint glow”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of merging voices tightens to a single charged image. Orientation is secure by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendant’s attunement reweights Elara’s identity from courier to chosen vessel, with the aurora-lit ridgeway now calling her back—a legible before/after under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is lightly sketched but coherent; the relic’s hum escalates pattern rather than plot. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism’s sorrow reframes Elara’s theory into lived responsibility. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each beat layers density until the mist lifts and the air itself feels heavier. One minor drift: the frost-on-window method is named late and never integrated into the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara becomes the message, the silence rewoven. Causality is soft—Accumulative/Textural lens—but the final image reweights prior motifs. One transition (orchard → clearing) is legible; orientation holds. Cost is conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: because Eli accepts the bargain, therefore he descends and weaves the silk, therefore the planet heals. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he returns changed but cannot name the loss—yet the on-page sentence “caught between understanding and confusion” is too coy to let the cost fully register.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the orb reweights her identity and duty with visible cost (“weight of her responsibility”). Causal linkage is present—shard → transport → revelation—but the woman’s speech is a bald info-dump that softens the tightening. Lens holds as Causal.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lamp relit, Elias’s new guardianship acknowledged. Causal linkage holds—stone code → compartment → letters → resolve—but the cost is implied rather than dramatized, softening the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the green dawn reweights the entire premise, cost is felt in the Herald’s unending duty. Causal chain holds under a Hybrid lens—ritual causality plus pattern intensification—though the fog’s agency is slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael steps into the mist “knowing his journey was far from over,” reconfiguring his purpose from passive observer to active illuminator. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory layer tightens the stake until the final image crystallizes. Cost is implied but not viscerally felt; the woman’s release is hers, not his.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the healed sextant and lighter labyrinth reweight sorrow into resilience under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is associative, not tight because/therefore, but the pattern holds. The pin-drop echo bookends the arc with a cadence shift that carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara’s final song rekindles the realm at the price of surrendering her remaining personal memories, a cost legible in the line “light clinging to her like a second skin.” Causal chain holds—each recovered song tightens options until only the lullaby remains.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance crystallizes with visible cost (“she would carry the conclave’s legacy forward”)—and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds; however, the invitation’s causal weight is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Sequence of planting, plaque discovery, final candlelit repose creates a deepening rhythm rather than causal chain; closure takes form of earned stillness (Charged Poise) where possibility of absolution crystallizes against the garden, cost legible in dusk-falling labor and continued task ahead. Orientation anchored within first 120 words; no ambiguity late.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene structure holds; orientation is swift and the closure beat (slide re-inscribed, Elara’s purpose reconfigured) lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration. Causality is light—slide changes because she looks—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught early and honored. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise, but the causal chain is thin: the fortune-teller’s hint and necklace sighting resolve the conflict off-stage, and the “sound of trust breaking” remains unheard. Orientation is clear, yet the decisive change feels asserted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a deferred promise (“there, you will understand”) rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. Causal linkage is thin: the ring’s taste cue leads her to the clearing, but the election’s stakes and her role are told, not tested. Orientation is clear; lens is Causal but incomplete.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cave becomes womb, the lock becomes symbol of shattered chains, and the new painting crystallizes her stance. Causal linkage holds—discovery of forgotten painting → note → decision to paint—though the note’s convenient placement is a soft coincidence. Cost is visible in the act of burning years of safe repetition. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of remembered portraits and crystalline light reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the trickle of water reweights the premise that truth can revive the oasis. Causal linkage holds—map fragment → chamber → betrayal → inscription—though the “because” between hearing betrayal and deciding to etch truth could be sharper. Orientation is swift; no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the spinning sculpture crystallizes wonder while foreclosing permanence. Causality is lyric rather than linear, but the lens holds and the cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    Quiet causal spine—the locket key yields the letter which reframes stakes; mailbox setup pays off in the ending beat; orientation clean, lens (Causal) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the laboratory awakens, passages open, and Elara’s stance crystallizes with the dice now “silent”—a visible, felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality is lyric rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single continuous scene; orientation is immediate. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Eli’s stance toward memory shifts with visible conceptual cost. Causal chain (wildflowers → coffee patterns → chamber ritual → memory retrieval) holds without gaps. One minor ellipsis: how the wildflowers “glow” is not prepared.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis—she seals the prophecy and accepts vigilance—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is coherent, but the cost is soft; the brook’s pause and wing’s dimming gesture at price without making it visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Clara accepts the tutor’s charge, pouch in hand, sealing a new path with felt social risk. Causal chain holds—meteor shower → Elias appears → seal revealed → sugar task—though Elias’s vanishing leans on situational coincidence rather than earned logic.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tapestry she now carries reweights the garden’s purpose and her stance from isolation to custodial independence. Causal chain holds—shell contact → memory flood → weaving → dawn return—with no teleporting props. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; density and cadence shift at the star-fade image tighten the stake. Cost is legible in the shell’s silence and orchid’s dimmed glow.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the scroll’s erasure reweights Elara’s future work and self-concept. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each fade of ink tightens the emotional cadence. The final image of the blank canvas carries undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored by word 80.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    The causal chain is simple: seashell’s hum → archway → pool vision → realization. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance toward her quest crystallizes with felt cost (“journey far from over”). Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the globe clears, the names are spoken, and the past is re-weighted with felt cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens; causality holds cleanly across dream shards and shrine beats.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure is Charged Poise: final paragraph crystallizes stance rather than foreclosing a path, and ‘sense of peace’ tells rather than dramatizes felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—impression layering toward resonance—which the last paragraphs echo, though linkage across beats is looser than best-in-class. No orientation debt; spatial/ temporal anchors are clear within first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal lens maintained: discovery → new information → containment attempt. Closure lands via Earned Stasis: the orchard survives, but the dust returns, the diamond is sealed—felt cost is the eternal vigil she accepts. All causality is on-page; information never teleports. Slight hand-wave: her ability to chant a seal without prior set-up gives a pinch of late convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the portico’s activation reconfigures the world and Elias’s role, a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Causal linkage is mostly intact, though the middle relies on montage-like summary rather than beat-by-beat escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the music box’s autonomous song reweights Elias’s purpose and the loft’s atmosphere; the broken jar’s faint retained music supplies visible cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift rather than causal chain—and holds cleanly to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single-scene escalation from vibrational threat → crypt key activation → cloaked intruder’s banishment; causality stays tight, orientation is immediate, and the closure (harmony retained, but world still wounded) lands with a felt conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single arc traced with discipline: lake freezes → begins tracking → viaduct epiphany → spreads practice. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: she refuses hurried motion, stakes crystallized). Transitions are legible; one soft causal leap (“whispers of her work” draws newcomers) is forgivable at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure is a Decisive Change: emerging from the tunnel with “free.” Earned under a Situational lens (coherent pressure crystallizes stance). Causality clean until the final discovery photo, where the leap from “a photograph equals proof” is thin; cost feels more described than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    Causal spine is thin: Alistair’s repair magically cures emotional block and Elias then decides to believe Thomas with almost no on-page friction. Closure image (Elias feeling ready) lacks a visible cost; the trade-off is asserted rather than dramatized. Orientation is early and clear; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is a narrated epiphany—holographic bell rings, world listens—without on-page decision or cost. Causal chain is “and-then” exposition; the lens is Accumulative/Textural but the pattern break is asserted, not shown. Orientation is clear, but closure lacks the required felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens sustained: lie → offline bypass → final coordinates. The numbers constitute a patterned signal that reweights meaning when decoded. Closure hinges on a Conceptual Repricing—void in the archive maps to void in the missing crew, felt cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored crystal becomes beacon of unity with visible light spread. Causal chain is linear—fragment summons shards, Elara places orb—yet the “how” of shard attraction is asserted not dramatized. Orientation is clear within 120 words. Drive lens is Causal; one tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance toward endings crystallizes under the northern lights with felt cost (“weight lift”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of listening deepens until cadence shift—though the causal trigger for her change is more atmospheric than event-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene structure is clean; the causal lens holds with a clear before/after shift (“learning to dance with the mismatches”). Closure lands as Charged Poise, but the cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally—no forfeiture or irrevocable act seals the change.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the consecration renews the parapet and the prophet confirms the clearings will endure—an Earned Stasis with visible cultural cost. Causal chain is thin (consecration → glow → prophet’s approval) yet coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the story layers sensory detail and photograph-arrangement until the dusk image reweights the ruin as living monument. Closure is a Charged Poise (“quiet hope echoed”), but the cost is only implied, not felt on the page, keeping it just under the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-scene structure is clean; orientation is swift and atmospheric. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the crystal’s final whisper reweights the stakes, and Elias’s walk toward the door crystallizes both gain and loss. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; however, the cost (crystal’s exhaustion) is more asserted than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the chalk dropped, the circle complete, the sound heard—an Earned Stasis that forecloses further searching. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each chalk mark and driftwood piece layers density until the final cadence shift. Causality is lyric rather than plot-driven, but the pattern is taught early and paid off. No orientation debt; fog and garden anchor by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the new device reweights time’s flow with visible cost (“warm glow of fulfillment”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of stillness → spinning → deliberate rhythm tightens stakes once. Orientation is clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: mother-daughter reconciliation reweights the broken vinyl’s meaning; causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One soft patch—Claire’s arrival is compressed to “within hours,” a mild ellipsis that doesn’t rupture but slightly dilutes pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: key → relearn runes → close loops → void absorbs shadows. Orientation is anchored early; only one transition (workshop → precipice) is cleanly marked. Closure is a decisive change with conceptual cost—the key’s glow extinguished, knowledge restored, world re-ordered. Minor ellipsis around mentor’s fate is motivated and does not break linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the tooth becomes a star, the maze paths clear, and Elara steps through a “gateway” with earned lightness. The causal chain (tooth → fountain → transformation) holds under a Causal lens, and the cost—loss of her certainty stone—is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing glass reframes her vow and the grotto’s moonlit aperture crystallizes the stake. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each polishing stroke thickens atmosphere until the final image reweights the premise. One transition (grotto → village) is clean and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of moss, icicles, and pendant images tighten toward the shared notebook moment. Closure lands as Charged Poise—shared language reconfigures isolation into connection—yet the cost (loss of absolute solitude) is only implied, not dramatized. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a clear Earned Stasis: fragment laid among glowing shells refigures “collecting” into “solemnizing” stories, foreclosing Elara’s earlier escape impulse. Cause holds: fragment’s glow cues each encounter, driving deeper into nexus; final image recasts entire walk as pilgrimage, cost legible in surrender of narrative control (“her words flowing like a river”).

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—golden orbs crystallize the restored stories—but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized. Causal lens holds: harvest moon alignment triggers song return. However, the decisive change is narrated summary, not on-page action with felt forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the map pulses with new life and Elara steps away. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and starlight infusion reweight the orchard’s stillness. Cost is felt in the spent vial and her measured renunciation of rest, but the lens could be crisper.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the timer’s hum reweights the cavern and Elias’s mission, and the “warm, fragile” echo carries felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of reflection study tightens into the dusk alignment beat. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s decision to weave her own fractal map reconfigures her options and stakes under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The cost is legible in the “crack form within her” and the lamp’s steadier flame. Orientation is anchored early; the whalebone-reverie voice teaches its pattern and pays off in the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: the finished carving crystallizes her stance—“the here and gone of life itself”—with felt cost. Lens tilts Accumulative/Textural: pressure thickens through wood-grain, steam, and mane-strand density until stance locks.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lagoon’s resumed shimmer and Mara’s step reweight the premise—stillness becomes beginning. Causal linkage holds: wheel’s hum → voice message → fragment collection → re-vision of ghost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are taught by kinetic lagoon above clouds within first 120 words. One transition (nightfall) is brief and contiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the terminal’s “illusion of movement” crystallizes hope’s equation while Eli accepts its impermanence. Causal chain (find artifact → experiment → resurrect → relinquish) holds under a Causal lens, each beat narrowing options. Orientation is anchored by 120 words. Cost is visible in the final image: dawn light exposes the terminal’s inevitable emptiness. Minor ellipsis between rigging speakers and dawn break is motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the hush thickens, crystals whisper, clocks tick louder until the finished clock reweights the sanctuary. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—she stays, but the dream is re-borne inside duty—cost legible in the “lighter” stones and her tender smile.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal through-line: the sundial’s glow triggers the salvage → journal revelation → truth key. Closure emerges when the canal’s image reconfigures from decay to possibility in the final sunrise, with concrete cost. Orientation is anchored early; minor ellipsis around how the chest was hidden is allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the decoded knot-map reweights her mission from search to stewardship, and the fulgurite’s glow seals the shift with felt cost (she now carries the weavers’ trust). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density increases until the final image—but causality between knots and fulgurite remains lightly sketched rather than rigorously linked.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: accepting new thread re-weaves tapestry motif with felt cost (old thread now doubled, absences reweighted). Causal lens holds—each beat (asking, writing, gifting) triggered by prior cue. Orientation anchored early by twilight/ship horizon.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.0)
    The causal linkage (“because the map → therefore descent → revealed machine”) holds; the closure (renouncing forced beauty) lands as charged poise. Mythic scope slightly strains 800-word economy in setup.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the act of grafting reweights the premise from “scars must be erased” to “scars can sing.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each beat layers density until the final image crystallizes the new stance with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (fountains awaken, city reclaims memory) with conceptual cost. Causal linkage is present but lightly sketched; the breadcrumbs function more as Accumulative/Textural pattern than because/therefore chain. Orientation is clear within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s light now “embraces” rather than burns, and the gear’s integration reweights the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of light increases until it crystallizes—but the causal bridge from “sonar pinging” to “conduit” is asserted rather than dramatized, blunting the 9-gate.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara finds the shape of grief through creation itself, reconfiguring her remaining options (carve the journey, carry the loss) with discernible cost—spectral Tomas departs, mentorship complete. Causal line: mentor memory → insight “grief in movement” → ribbon pattern → marble etching is tight. Orientation anchored early; temporal span “butterfly migration” stays legible. Meets Publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    The clock-tower arc follows causal escalation: rake inscriptions seed internal tension, choice to carve/refract absolution alters town rhythms, and the pendulum’s poised stillness delivers charged closure. Structure holds under the “Causal” lens without unmotivated turns.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the silo becomes “a cathedral” and the tapestry’s meaning reweights Elias’s purpose. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence tighten toward the final image—but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, keeping it just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the obsidian spire’s shadow flips from barrier to gateway, and the lake’s thaw is felt in the golden light. Causal lens holds—each beat flows because/therefore—but the cost is more conceptual than visceral, slightly softening the punch.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-scene structure is clean; orientation is swift. Closure is a Charged Poise (notebook filled, room now “threshold”) with conceptual cost, but the pirate broadcast’s arrival feels coincidental rather than causally triggered by Clara’s actions.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the ash settles, the chair stills, and impermanence is crystallized with felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of image and cadence shift reweight the stake. Orientation is clear by 80 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    The piece follows a single causal line: sewer → repeated visits → collapse → surface. Orientation is clear by ~120 words. Closure lands as a soft conceptual repricing (“threads in the same tapestry”), but the decisive change is off-stage; Kael’s decision to leave the sewer is triggered by Lira’s report, not by a prior setup that makes the choice inevitable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene arc holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; the rosette’s glow and swelling choir create a resonant reconfiguration of the library’s silence. Closure lands with conceptual cost—the space is now “living cathedral”—but the causal linkage between humming and audience transformation is compressed rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene, causal lens holds: seed planted → growth → fruit → bite. Closure lands as earned conceptual reconfiguration—world reweighted by shared memories—with visible cost (her solitude in the greenhouse). Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the drones’ sacrifice reweights the tower’s silence. Causality is clean—key → staircase → orb → vision—but the orb’s “deliberate act” is asserted rather than foreshadowed, so the reweighting feels slightly retrofitted. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bay goes on breathing, but Elias’s stance has shifted—he now sees “the reasons” and carries the shard’s lesson with a Charged Poise; cause holds under accumulative-textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: Liora’s warning → Elara’s hesitation → revised plan. Closure is Earned Stasis: Elara chooses caution, paying with time and risk. Cost is legible in “weeks later” gratitude tempered by earlier fragility. One micro-turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    Causal linkage holds: because she drops the chipped die she must re-roll, therefore redefining her goal from capture to release of the past. Closure—the reweighted image of perpetual motion as acceptance—is on-page and scaled to length. An early 120-word anchor is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stroke thickens pattern until the greenhouse air itself reconfigures. Closure is a Charged Poise—the canvas glowing as bridge—with the cost legible in her irrevocable insomnia now yoked to an endless task.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lens and bread reconfigure communal memory with visible cost (laughter after years of silence). Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; one transition (workshop → square) is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: dismantle yoyo → symbols lock → lighthouse reverses. Closure lands with visible cost—the island “humming with energy” and Elias’s trembling hands—though the beat could be sharper if the yoyo’s logic were tested under duress rather than accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Clara’s recognition that fear needs acknowledgment reweights the premise and is paid for by the funhouse’s dissolution. Causal chain holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each mirror and paradoxical note thickens pattern until the luminance ruptures it. One minor causality wobble: the advisor’s materialization lacks prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final chord stills sea and orchard, reweighting the premise that chaos can be tuned. Causal chain holds—each strike alters cloud patterns—though the driftwood orchard’s physics remains lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the living shell reweights the city’s doom and Elara’s mission. Causal chain (pattern language → crack → chamber → mandate) holds under Causal lens. One transition (surface to tunnel) is clean. Cost is conceptual—knowledge of impending collapse—rather than immediate personal loss, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure registers as a Charged Poise: the archive uncovered re-weights meaning rather than the world. Causal chain is intact (letter → station → archive → renounce), yet final stance (“a deeper understanding…context”) is stated more than dramatized—costs legible but not fully felt.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pavilion’s glowing mosaic reweights the entire quest, turning absence into palpable presence. Causality is clean—each repair action leads to the reveal—but the cost (raw hands, soaked clothes) is more catalogued than felt. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of restoration and revelation intensifies until the final image crystallizes meaning. No orientation debt; anchors are clear within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stamp’s glow reweights the library from repository to gateway. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each discovery layers density until the blackout’s stripping-away catalyzes revelation. Cost is the isolation and the irreversible opening of hidden passages.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kael renounces transforming grief into product, foreclosing the lantern-as-escape path. Causal chain—Lira’s prompt → basilica visit → crane unfolding—holds. One transition (garden→basilica) is clean. Cost is felt in the softened light wrapping him. No orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: drone-strike rupture → observatory drift → crystal epiphany → earned stasis. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “she was no longer just a survivor—she was a seeker.” Cost is felt in the tattered dress and the irrevocable loss it signifies. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the chip reweights Kael’s sense of belonging. Causal chain is linear—find three pieces, slot them in—without tightening or felt price. Orientation is clean; no teleporting props, but escalation is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis once Elias aligns the watch hand with the broken clock carving and releases both object and false narrative into sand; the single transition from terrace steps to shore tightens options under a causal lens and leaves a felt cost. One micro-orientation slip—Elias pockets the watch earlier without on-page cue—does not derail causality.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the passing of the drawer pull crystallizes a fragile new stance. Causality is situational—pressure builds through dialogue and weather rather than because/therefore chains—yet the final image reweights the premise with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens: rising image density from compass → poles → sunrise crests reweights stakes (“mocking” dawn → “golden light” promise). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration; Mara’s smile crystallizes new stance without resolving all regrets; cost is felt. Minor ambiguity on exact time elapsed mid-paddle. Orientation and causality are legible under the taught pattern; no breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.2)
    Situational lens holds: lake’s pressure forces a crystallized stance rather than causal dominoes. Orientation anchors by 3rd paragraph. Closure is Charged Poise—he leaves carrying new empathy—but the conceptual cost is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory layer intensifies until the final moonlit orchard image crystallizes new meaning. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with conceptual cost—“the bond you desire is not what you remember”—framed as earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the crack’s glow reframes regret into presence, with the felt cost of absence made visible. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images and cadence shift reweight the stake. Orientation is firm by 120 words; no causality breaks. Minor slip: the “tablecloth now stained with cake and joy” is retroactive exposition that could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as the portal opens and Elara steps back aboard, but the causal chain is thin: the tear’s insertion triggers the gate without prior constraint or price. Orientation is clear; lens is Accumulative/Textural.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: releasing the bugs merges with the stars, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of hush, light, and sand accrues until the final image. One causality wobble: the whispering hush becomes articulate words without prior signal, a late rule change that slightly blurs motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: blackout → investigation → key discovery → cradle ignition. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the fort’s light reconfigures social reality—though the blackout’s origin remains off-stage, a mild ellipsis. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pattern is grasped, the path forward is foreclosed by the new unreadable sequence. Causal lens holds—each rock placement tightens options until the final reweighting. Cost is legible in the inert dust and the unreadable new pattern that restarts the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance shifts from censorship to uncensored creation, cost paid in exposure of personal scars. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of charged objects (timer, envelope, map) reweights stakes. Orientation is clear by 120 w. Minor drag from reflective summary mid-piece prevents 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the overture becomes the act of questioning itself, with a felt conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of images (sundial, needle card, brook) reweights meaning. Orientation is clear by 80 words; no causality breaks. One meaningful tightening: shift from seeking hidden music to embracing the process.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing library reweights earlier fractures, cost legible in the final image. Causality is loose, however—how does poem-painting convert a prison yard into sanctuary? The coffee tin’s letters motivate Elias, but the link between “words rebuild” and the rooftop declaration is asserted, not shown. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens contradiction at end.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ticking clock and new melody reweight her stance with visible cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of memory fragments tightens to a cadence shift. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a tidy, low-stakes CR: the tree stands, memory is “safe.” The causal chain (dream → seed → plant → safety) is linear and unchallenged; no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. Orientation is clear, but the lens remains Accumulative without a tightening turn.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the compass stops spinning, letters dissolve, and Elias walks away lighter—cost is the relinquishing of the relics and the sorrow they carried. Causal chain is soft (lace “whispers” rather than drives), but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density and cadence shift reweight the stake from seeking to releasing. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("butterfly was more than a creature"), but dust mechanics lack causal precision; "preprocesses reality" functions thematically rather than constraining action under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: grotto discovery crystallizes options with conceptual cost (apprentice captive), but the felt cost of her endurance isn't fully embodied on-page during the final reflection moment.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "silence itself" revelation reweights the entire premise. Accumulative lens holds through emotional pattern deepening; orientation anchored by "winterglass conservatory" within 40 words.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.3)
    Causal chain holds with Decisive Change closure (lens activated), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—fragment retrieval is procedural without narrowed options or felt cost. Orientation clear early, yet cost proof ("weariness lifting") remains abstract without prior sacrifice shown.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("future uncertain, but together"), but the sanctions' tangible impact remains abstract; a single concrete loss (e.g., depleted food stores) would tighten the escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (fragment's dissolution), but the "discovered herself" resolution lacks tangible sacrifice. Orientation anchors early (120 words), yet Accumulative lens falters as pressure accumulates without narrowing Elara's options. Final image reconfigures meaning but cost remains felt rather than legible.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: chains falling as seeds are secured reconfigures freedom/resilience under causal lens. Wall collapse timing creates one tightening that forecloses escape routes; cost legible in "chains dragging like anchors" during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) closure. Orientation debt past 120 words (unclear era/timeline) applies -0.4 penalty despite functional closure with visceral cost ("resonant ache in chest").

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: Lira’s transformation from "thief" to "seeker" crystallizes with the jar’s light mingling with moonlight, reconfiguring her purpose with undeniable cost. Causal lens holds flawlessly through flower-code trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes with "thawing heart was a process, not a destination" and bookmark placement. Cost legible in "weighty lightness" and melting ice's approval. Accumulative lens holds perfectly; pressure deepens via sensory density.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost—"mirrors shattering into light" reconfigures identity stakes under Accumulative lens; orientation anchors library/Elara by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (vanishing star crystallizing the map), but cost legibility falters—no exact line pinpoints the sacrifice beyond implication. Accumulative lens holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (thoughts as "bridge" replacing mystery), but loop mechanics remain vague. Orientation solid early. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through music-driven density shifts, though timeline "unfolding" lacks causal pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "mistrust began to thaw, freed by honesty" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (vulnerability as risk/reward), but Accumulative escalation lacks one intensifying pressure point to push into high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.5)
    Valid Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost (accepting flaws as beautiful), but lens ambiguity past midpoint undermines escalation. "Luck as fortuities" introduced yet never pressures choices, violating Accumulative/Textural density requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal closure holds with Earned Stasis (proof achieved but station destabilized), but cost proof lacks specificity; "at what cost?" stated rather than dramatized through concrete consequence like colleague backlash.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: ghost vanishing with "faintest echo" and dissolved program charge the final image with conceptual cost under Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens via sensory density (water rippling to melody) with no causality breaks; orientation clear by paragraph 1.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: auroral sorrow transforming into resilient sway reconfigures truth’s weight, but fever backstory exceeds BRR limits by summarizing without present-micro-choice anchor, slightly muddying causality at midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("weight lift"), but "sense of peace" abstracts the emotional charge; Causal lens holds yet cost proof lacks visceral embodiment in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis: Lira’s journals fill with unremembered entries, erasing the refuge yet embedding its silence in her work. But escalation falters—the catacombs "shifting as if guiding her" feels coincidental, not pressure-driven under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds: Finn's dormant wonder activates with visible cost ("purpose had shifted"), reconfiguring magic through CR. Accumulative lens holds via eclipse progression, but keepsake glow risks magical convenience without sufficient character-bound perception.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds tightly: diaries → scrolls → ritual creates a clean because/therefore chain. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with conceptual cost ("weight of centuries pressing upon her") that reconfigures the world’s state without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost implied in "stillness after last orders," but no legible cost proof at closure beat. Escalation fails under Accumulative lens: microdot discovery triggers instant clarity without deepening pressure or narrowing options—stakes remain abstract despite explicit signaling.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Earned Stasis through rhetorical accumulation, but cost remains abstract despite dimensional restoration. No visible sacrifice or enduring consequence weakens final beat under Accumulative lens. Orientation strong, yet cost proof test fails per Q2 requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure achieves Earned Stasis as the writer slumps post-symphony with the horizon "reflecting the soul," crystallizing the cost of exhaustion and unfulfilled longing. Orientation is anchored by 80 words, and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density buildup. However, escalation relies on atmospheric pressure (dawn) rather than protagonist-driven choices, limiting tension progression.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with density increase toward Earned Stasis closure; the tablet’s fading glow and Elara’s relief ("feeling lighter") provide visible cost. Orientation test passed via rain-soaked viaduct anchoring by line 5, but procedural generation mechanics remain vague, weakening middle escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with the tear and realization, but lens ambiguity persists past midpoint (Accumulative/Textural only solidifies during song reversal), costing high-band eligibility despite felt cost in "raw, aching aliveness."

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise: courtyard’s reconfiguration as "what’s worth protecting" crystallizes stakes with felt cost (sacrificed solitude), though the alley-to-wasteland transition lacks causal texture, slightly diluting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "shadows soften" crystallizes emotional shift with visible cost in Elias’s release of suppressed grief. Accumulative lens holds through memory shards, each narrowing his emotional options toward uncorking the vial.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "time was not a thing to discover, but a poem to write" reweights the premise with felt cost (rope's weight, solitude), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern-dense escalation to the mirror sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is Charged Poise: hush transforms from void to "muse" with felt cost ("silence... expectant"). Accumulative escalation through violin notes awakening shipwrecks/greenhouse holds lens consistently. Cost legible but not visceral enough for 8.9+.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost—the violet-orange dusk crystallizes the "fleeting moments" premise—but lens ambiguity persists until paragraph 4 ("As the transformation completes"), risking Accumulative/Textural coherence; the static electricity payoff validates the taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds firmly: mistaken envelope → letter exchange → meeting risk. Closure (Charged Poise) crystallizes with undeniable cost—the locket’s physical lightness signifying emotional vulnerability paid. Orientation anchored by word 30; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density builds toward Charged Poise closure where the marked sculpture crystallizes Lira’s shift from "untethered" to belonging. Cost is legible in "luminescent ache" softening to "quiet warmth," though escalation lacks one decisive intensification beyond tag discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orientation clear by para 1 (rooftop/canals/sunset); Accumulative lens holds with sensory density building toward Charged Poise closure at sketchbook moment. Cost legible in "giant’s nap ending" line, though "unreachable" legend slightly softens stakes escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (ignoring mentor's warning for potential breakthrough); causal linkage holds from mosaic discovery to final harmony realization, but danger remains abstract without visceral manifestation.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (visibility redefined as being heard), but the "weight begin to lift" phrasing obscures tangible price. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural through sensory accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "the nursery still stood, but it was no longer the same place" crystallizes cost of surrendered control. Storm pressure accumulates texturally to this moment, though the leaf’s dissolution edges toward coincidence rather than earned causality under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: brooch becomes "silent witness" after exchange, reconfiguring Elara's artistic purpose. Orientation clear by 120 words ("painter named Elara... tidal island"). Accumulative lens holds through atmospheric deepening, though the old woman's arrival borders on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("essence remained" signifies identity dissolution), but causality stumbles at climax—the pearl's sentience feels unearned, relying on "unseen forces" convenience rather than protagonist-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with cost ("absences no longer voids but spaces waiting to be filled"), but cost legibility lacks pinpoint specificity; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds though escalation could deepen pressure earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with legible cost ("something within her had shifted"); Accumulative lens holds through arrow path and mirror labyrinth. Minor flaw: fortress arrival lacks causal pressure buildup despite strong midnight timing.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lacks legible cost: Charged Poise achieved but no forfeiture or consequence (e.g., villagers' skepticism unchanged, no personal sacrifice). Lens ambiguity between Situational (migration timing) and Accumulative weakens escalation; midpoint fails to commit to one drive method for pressure buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens holds: storm intensity and fragment hum escalate pressure coherently. Charged Poise closure lands with visible cost ("void... transformed") in final image. Orientation clear by 100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: father’s "tentative but sincere" grip crystallizes rebalanced relationship stakes. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through ink pot’s escalating resonance. Minor abstraction in "liquefying rigid thinking" slightly dulls causality.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.5)
    Orientation solid by line 30, closure valid as Earned Stasis with felt cost ("hands trembling slightly"), but escalation lacks meaningful deepening—the hum's intensification doesn't narrow options or reweight stakes under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands ("texture of memories was... in the act of remembering itself") with felt cost, but the repository container discovery feels coincidental rather than earned escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens; tides rhythm establishes setting but doesn't concretely narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully when Mara understands the compass is "a state of being," with felt cost in her "bittersweet expression" crystallizing the trade-off between logic and impermanence; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural pressure intensifies through sensory density.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with conceptual cost ("fight far from over"), but Vorin's disruption attempt remains summarized not dramatized, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens. Two non-closure issues trigger -0.8 cap.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with visible cost (clutching the sand grain at departure), but lens ambiguity persists past midpoint—the Accumulative/Textural drive isn't firmly established until the dawn approach, weakening early escalation under the selected lens despite functional orientation anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "her work was far from over" crystallizes cost of perpetual renewal under Accumulative/Textural lens. Mist thickening and anchor lifting deepen density without causality breaks; cost proof solid in final lines where renewal promise implies emotional exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with visible cost (Elias's perpetual guardianship), but "wild hush" concept isn't charged in final image. Accumulative lens holds, yet cost proof lacks specificity at climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with oxygen depletion cost, but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs Hybrid) persists past midpoint; "time running short" pressure isn't leveraged in the final beat's crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (rejecting hush legacy); Accumulative lens holds via sensory pressure buildup. Copperlight-to-dawn shift reweights stakes without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with "beacon of resonant awakenings," but conceptual cost ("freedom and reckoning") lacks visceral legibility; Accumulative lens holds though escalation feels atmospheric rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure (Earned Stasis as canyon exhales with stories) lands with felt cost (her exhaustion), but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening—the sleepwalking paths accumulate passively without narrowing options or raising stakes under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with mural realization, but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt; Accumulative lens holds through cyclical time motif.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands via the final line’s reweighting of surface mail’s purpose ("remind it of what it once was"), with felt cost in "echoes of the past remained, waiting." However, the letter retrieval lacks tangible stakes escalation, softening the pressure arc under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (mentor silenced/severed connection), but cost proof lacks visceral legibility; "adjacent possibilities" resolution strains accumulative lens coherence at midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative lens holds with density escalation; condensation messages tighten stakes; closure (Charged Poise) reweights regret as bridge but cost legibility falters—feeling "whole" lacks visceral tradeoff for healing.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: stepping into night with "shared anxieties" and coral's glow crystallizes options with conceptual cost (enduring trauma to create hope). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) clear by para 2; persistent constraint (wrist injury/anesthetic) shapes decoding tactics. Cost proof: "numbness remained, replaced by quiet determination" legibly pays price.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—the fog-painting crystallizes her artistic rebirth with felt cost of years drained—but knowledge network’s late introduction weakens causal escalation; "fold of a daydream" teaches temporal fluidity effectively for Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "certainty had been a cage" crystallizes conceptual cost. Orientation test passed early but lens ambiguity in "exchange certainty" demand slightly softens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear Situational lens holds through greenhouse confrontation to Charged Poise closure ("world felt heavier... Elias felt alive"), but orientation anchors arrive late (142 words), missing the 120-word threshold and capping Q3 at 7.0 per policy.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with the shell's "exhale" and "reef-shadow joy" crystallizing harmony within pain, but the conceptual cost remains oblique; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density, though no tangible forfeiture (beyond postcard disintegration) legibly narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (shattered wind chime preserving voices); Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shifts; cost proof crystallized in "fragments floating upward like shards of moonlight" amid preserved echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with cost: Kael's "sorrow and hope" crystallizes relational stakes paid by Elara's vulnerability. Lens ambiguity hurts—Accumulative/Textural pressure builds via promise-weaving, but inkwell's magic feels coincidental rather than earned pattern, weakening causal linkage in climax.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost (trembling → resolve), but adhesive analysis feels retroactive rather than causally earned. Accumulative lens holds with atmospheric pressure tightening options.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("preserved herself"), but meteorite chip’s role in pressure escalation remains decorative rather than constraining choices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with felt cost of leaving logbook; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through light-pattern escalation, though memory shift relies slightly on convenient disorientation without sufficient present-microchoice anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with cost—abandoning fireflies—but alarm intrusion breaks Accumulative lens coherence; ocean pressure threat lacks causal setup, making escalation feel coincidental rather than rhythm-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: memory's flickering vanishing reconfigures "missing pieces" with conceptual cost ("beauty in rediscovery"). Accumulative lens holds—density builds through sensory accumulation to crystallize stance. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "his work far from over" crystallizes the cost of endless serendipity labor under Accumulative lens. Starlight beam on the bishop reweights randomness with conceptual cost. Lens holds consistently through observed details, but cost lacks visceral immediacy to reach 9.0. No orientation debt or causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: sentinel's departure crystallizes reconfigured stakes (verse as beacon), while garden's brighter blooms and whispering "fledge" make the felt cost legible through environmental reweighting under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis (sharing reckonings) lacks legible cost; "hope" reconfiguration feels abstract without tangible sacrifice—no on-page sentence concretely shows paid price for the stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: box's weight shift ("heavier with purpose") crystallizes cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds consistently—feather visions deepen stake reweighting. No orientation debt; celestial dance motif taught early pays off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise under Accumulative/Textural lens: the tide erasing patterns crystallizes the cost ("not in permanence but in creating"), with visible consequence altering her stance. Orientation is anchored by line 5 ("grotto sanctuary"), and lens consistency holds through the final image reweighting hope's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly—the mirror's revelation reconfigures purpose with felt cost ("burden no longer heavy") under Accumulative/Textural lens, though cost remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Valid Charged Poise closure with heartbeat cost ("fainter, borrowed and shared"). Orientation clear by word 30. But lens ambiguity: Accumulative/Textural pressure (lullaby density) undermined by causal phrasing ("mirrors surrendered"), weakening escalation logic at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with treaty signing and dawn arrival, but "price of redemption" speech borders on thematic echo (-0.2). Orientation clear early; Accumulative lens holds through celestial/terrace motifs. Cost legible in "cost she was still learning to bear" though emotional specificity could deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: rain washing salt while egg is buried reconfigures meaning with undeniable cost ("fragment of her own lost humanity"). Accumulative lens holds throughout; orientation anchors within 100 words. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: snow carrying echoes reweights the city's reality with conceptual cost ("role as courtesan would never be the same"). Orientation solid (courtyard/snow/prism by para 1), but lens ambiguity: Accumulative/Textural dominates yet causal thread-untangling feels under-pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    Charged Poise closure lands with "catalyst" cost reference, but Accumulative escalation lacks agency-driven pressure buildup—epiphany emerges passively without narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (monarchs' absence as societal silence), but the Accumulative/Textural lens isn't explicitly anchored early; subtle pressure escalation via sensory density lacks one clear "meaningful tightening" beat that narrows options under grotto's unsettled rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands but cost proof fails—"knowing she had done what she set out to do" tells rather than shows irreversible consequence. Auroral flare lacks felt stakes reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost (wafer seal dissolution), but storm resolution feels coincidental rather than driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative/Textural lens; lens holds yet escalation lacks meaningful tightening beyond atmospheric density.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("frugal ways had prepared him for this destiny"), crystallizing the covenant stance. However, the Accumulative/Textural lens falters mid-story: schematic discovery lacks pressure escalation, and the tile's decryption happens via summary ("as he connected the dots"), weakening causality.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid lens (causal/accumulative) holds; closure as Charged Poise ("How do I start?") carries felt cost via Kael’s raw voice and sagging shoulders; sanctuary mechanics slightly convenient but payoff in pin symbolism salvages causality.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with legible cost ("fleeting moment" implying ephemerality), but restoration lacks struggle—breathing method succeeds without tangible pressure, creating minor causality gap in escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise (ribbon woven into glowing tree symbolizing resilience) lands with felt cost: her reinterpretation of breach as "necessary shedding" crystallizes stance with emotional weight. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but scroll discovery edges toward convenient causality.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("surge of purpose, a brightened disquiet"), but Accumulative lens weakens escalation—woman's arrival resolves mystery without protagonist-driven pressure shift. Final cost legible but not earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost ("weight of discovery"), but guardian resolution lacks causal linkage. Strength: Clear orientation and causal chain until climax.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation debt: "chimera twin discoverer" profession remains unanchored past 120 words, muddying stakes; closure (Charged Poise stepping through door) has felt cost but emerald card's glow guiding her reads as coincidence not earned escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.1)
    Charged Poise closure lands with conceptual cost (stories now "waiting to be told"), but "heart pounding" lacks specificity to prove cost. Accumulative lens holds through rope vibration density, though door transition feels coincidental rather than earned. No persistent constraint shapes tactics—braiding succeeds without setbacks. Cost proof insufficient for high-band despite resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure achieves Earned Stasis with visible cost ("body weary") but lacks persistent constraint shaping tactics. Causal chain holds (cracks → path → bloom), yet the cost remains superficial—no deepening of sacrifice beyond physical fatigue. Orientation anchors firmly by word 40.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the reformed prism’s song reconfigures meaning with undeniable conceptual cost (sacrificed memories), while causal star-path alignment drives every escalation beat without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("memory was safe, for now... would call to her again"), and Accumulative lens holds tightly; fog-solidification timeframe creates precise pressure without coincidence resolving stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise (beacon walls, smoldering knot) with conceptual cost, but the cost isn’t unmistakable on the page; "we rise" lacks earned tension as the sole micro-turn preceding victory.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost ("metamorphosis as inevitable as cicada’s emergence"); Accumulative lens holds perfectly as time fragments layer toward reconfiguration of her entire approach.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure (Charged Poise: "tasted true silence... set her free") lands with felt cost, but doll's "porcelain limbs stretching" creates minor causality friction in pivotal beat; orientation anchors immediately via "xenial trellis" and "bunker builder's claustrophobic child".

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Mira's whispered "thank you" crystallizes emotional reconfiguration with legible cost ("anxiety unravel"), under the accumulative/textural lens. Minor deduction as the cost remains internal without tangible forfeiture, though the vial's "pristine clarity" visually anchors the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal drive holds firmly: murals unlock archway sequence, leading to Conceptual Repricing closure where throne’s collective purpose reweights the quest with undeniable conceptual cost. Sunrise deadline weakens escalation by remaining abstract despite early setup, missing one opportunity for tangible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with the severed scar’s cost, but escalation lacks meaningful deepening—the darkness’s pressure never forces tactical adaptation beyond Lira’s established method. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, yet density peaks too early without a mid-scene intensification that reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: returning with diamonds forecloses escapism through "rebuild what was lost" cost, though the conceptual price ("pressures of her past") feels slightly undersold in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly with conceptual cost ("truth was painful, but it was hers to bear"); Accumulative lens consistent throughout; minor deduction for no persistent constraint shaping tactics during standing wave sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with conceptual cost ("armor less burden"), but reality-shifting pressure remains vague; cost legible in "shed when ready" yet escalation lacks tangible narrowing of options under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns and object recurrence tighten the dominant stake (finding meaning in forgotten histories). Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with felt cost—"mend her own brokenness" crystallizes her emotional trade-off. Missing a sharper pressure point before resolution; cost remains abstract despite "heart lighter" physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly (vanishing with key), cost legible via transmitted ledger. But enforcers' arrival feels coincidental rather than causal escalation; "tyranny won't stand" assertion weakens conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost ("chest rising and falling"), but prophecy dissolution feels unearned—music's counter-code mechanism remains abstract, weakening the accumulative lens's causal logic at the pivotal climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with "something had shifted forever," though orientation test waiver risks subtle causality drift in folklore research montage.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens holds through closure: Charged Poise achieved when tinkerer folds the map, with cost legible in "lighter" compass and greenhouse's transformed perception. Orientation clear by paragraph 1.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (coin fixed to her sign, regret softened into resolve) with legible cost, but furnace entry lacks causal motivation under Accumulative lens—vision sequence happens to her rather than through active exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with felt cost ("tooth falling... power spent"), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density; minor escalation quibble as pressure builds steadily without a distinct intensification beat.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is a flawless Conceptual Repricing under Accumulative/Textural lens: mask strap sinking crystallizes mercy as "truth to embrace" with visible cost (release of physical anchor). Orientation clear by 80 words; forest’s responsive light tightens pressure toward the earned stasis of her rootedness.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: fragment's purpose fulfilled with visible cost (emotional weight of histories made tangible), under Accumulative lens. Orientation anchors market/platform by 80 words; lens inferred by midpoint with consistent density escalation toward resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change with undeniable cost ("weightless burden lifted"), causal lens held rigorously from whispers to clock activation; orientation solid by line 5 with circus setting and Marcus' ghost-seeing established.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: "work far from over... she was ready" crystallizes eternal labor with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds perfectly; frost patterns taught early pay off in final reconfiguration of purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is valid Charged Poise (holographic proof/bittersweet triumph) but cost proof fails: "wounds remained unhealed" is told, not shown through image. Archaeological dispute resolves off-page ("forced to concede"), undermining causal weight under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: rust receding and chip's dullness manifest conceptual cost. Causal-accumulative lens holds through tether discovery to climax, with the journey shard taught early and transitions legible.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "some things meant to be lost" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost (compass sinking), though causal agency is passive under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation succeeds early, but Accumulative/Textural lens falters at climax: Mara's passivity ("stepped forward," "approached") makes pressure feel coincidental rather than earned. Critical failure: no legible cost in closure beat—the "profound purpose" assertion lacks felt price despite Charged Poise framework. Cost proof test fails; cannot point to on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with visible cost ("postcards felt heavier"), but orientation drift in dream sequence slightly delays concrete stakes beyond 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    Valid Charged Poise closure: entity's acceptance crystallizes stakes with felt cost (physical exhaustion, emotional vulnerability). Accumulative lens holds, but cost legibility slightly soft—conceptual price of truth not yet tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: bottle disappearance crystallizes Elara's perpetual motion with felt cost ("rejected staying"), under Accumulative/Textural lens with seamless density escalation from single lantern to cove revival.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise when Elara speaks "I remember," crystallizing the garden’s relief with felt cost—the sigh and "work far from over" reconfiguration—under a consistent Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation succeeds (atrium anchored by para 1), but closure's Charged Poise lacks unmistakable cost proof—"smooth yet fragile" texture is conceptual without concrete forfeiture. Escalation is flat; vortex reopening occurs smoothly after one action with no narrowing of options or felt price at the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds (rain "in harmony" reconfiguring chaos/calm balance) under Accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual rather than legible on-page; no exact sentence shows forfeiture or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: lantern dimming crystallizes reconfigured options (her internal stillness sustains her) with undeniable conceptual cost ("strength passed to her"), holding Accumulative/Textural lens through density buildup to final star affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise (oasis awakening) with felt cost ("air grew heavy with emotion"), but Orientation Test fails: "scorched wasteland" lacks concrete anchors by 120 words. Lens (Causal) holds, but disorientation doesn't serve closure payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost via stabilized chronometer, but escalation lacks narrowing options—Thaddeus resolves the conflict. Two distinct issues (passive protagonist, vague cost) trigger -1.5 Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with kite's ascent reconfiguring meaning, but the cost ("warmth spread through her") remains emotionally abstract rather than viscerally legible; Accumulative lens holds though the wanderer's backstory gap slightly undermines pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.3)
    Valid Charged Poise closure with conceptual cost of mortality, but six-month timeframe fails to tighten decisions or create meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens. Discoveries accumulate smoothly without pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. Strong orientation anchors setting but pressure lacks escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (skepticism softened into awe), but the Accumulative/Textural lens lacks sufficient density escalation; the pilgrim encounter doesn't materially tighten options or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands via "narrow vastness" reweighted in final image with felt cost ("heart heavy... spark of possibility"). Accumulative lens holds, but escalation lacks meaningful density shift—steady accumulation without pattern break weakens pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative lens holds with dawn arrival as Charged Poise closure. Cost of isolation felt but not viscerally legible in final image; "calling" phrasing risks thematic echo without concrete forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds with chess game escalation, but cost legibility falters; the sky's restoration lacks tangible consequence beyond Kael's internal shift, weakening the Decisive Change's felt impact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "luminous absence" reconfigures the interregnum's uncertainty with conceptual cost, but escalation lacks sufficient pressure—Kael's presence eases rather than challenges her, weakening the causal chain toward her realization.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (maze reconfigured as path) with felt cost ("hidden thunder passed, leaving quiet strength"), but the conceptual cost lacks concrete anchoring; storm imagery resolves too cleanly without irreversible physical or relational consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("weight of guilt began to lift"), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural dominant at end) slightly weakens escalation; thunder motif resolves without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost ("surrender a shard of her heart"), but lens ambiguity—shifts from causal (ritual warnings) to accumulative—past midpoint triggers -0.3. Orientation solid but spire's magic feels convenient resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: workshop stability fractures but reconfigures into "sanctuary," legible via the statue’s glow intensifying as pockmarks become "map of resilience." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds—density peaks as gears spin wildly, then steadies with her declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: final image of displayed painting crystallizes reconfigured stakes (isolation vs. connection) with felt cost in earlier aloofness. Accumulative lens holds through sensory deepening, but cost legibility falters—"lighter heart" lacks concrete on-page price for the "temporary eternity" shift. Orientation anchors within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (doubts replaced by quiet certainty), yet the woman’s appearance relies on coincidence rather than causal escalation, weakening the "because/therefore" linkage required for Hybrid lens integrity at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes options: beacon works but cyclical task persists, cost legible in "glow dimmed." Accumulative lens holds—density peaks with traveler arrival. Weakness: cryptic calls resolve too neatly as "instructions," reducing pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "the weight of involuntary truth lifted" crystallizes cost while the orchard's restored "fractured grace" reconfigures meaning; causal lens holds with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with Elias's "strange sense of peace" crystallizing his stance amid mist, reconfiguring isolation into purpose with conceptual cost (carrying borrowed memories). However, lens ambiguity undermines escalation: Accumulative/Textural pressure builds atmosphere, but the causal boot-print discovery resolves too neatly without narrowing options or raising stakes meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds perfectly: chip→ants→cavern→archway creates clean escalation. Earned Stasis closure lands with felt cost (end of loneliness) via decision-state crystallization at "maps now seemed alive with possibility".

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong orientation and Charged Poise closure ("vowed to restore balance" with conceptual cost), but the star-being's "softly commanding voice" appears abruptly without setup, breaking accumulation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation; Charged Poise closure lands with visible cost ("something had changed"). Late lens naming ("by returning differently" at 75%) nearly triggers ambiguity cap but payoff justifies cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively: "the weight of feral nostalgia lifting like a fog" crystallizes cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors cabin/grave early; density escalation from fragmented memories to unified "now" reweights stakes flawlessly. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog-to-light transition and screw's evolving weight build Charged Poise closure. Orientation Test fails (location unclear until para 2), costing 0.4; "bittersweet expression" makes cost legible but late anchor caps potential.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (scars reweighted as symbols), but the Accumulative lens weakens when rain cessation resolves tension too neatly; quill's recrystallization lacks visible tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure achieves Earned Stasis through orchard's "essence" remaining, with felt cost in "trees would soon be gone." Orientation clear by line 3; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory density builds to reconfigured final image.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure fails cost proof test: temple "trembled" but no on-page consequence for witness. Spiral arbitration resolution feels unearned as dictionary's glow-to-merge shift lacks causal pressure buildup; cosmic illusion dissolution occurs off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing but cost remains abstract ("profound peace" lacks tangible consequence). Missing visible price on final image deducts 0.6 per Q2 cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Valid Charged Poise closure: "boundaries are permeable" reconfiguration carries conceptual cost (worldview shift). Accumulative lens holds—mushroom glow density increase tightens stakes. Orientation clear by 100 words; no causality breaks. Missing one visible cost escalation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost, but the final image’s reconfiguration lacks precise on-page cost anchoring; "ready to begin" softens the required felt price of her father’s legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Eli’s "ready to begin" crystallizes stance shift with visible cost in "estrangement... began to dissolve." Accumulative pressure tightens through call patterns without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with Charged Poise closure ("promise of what could still be"), but escalation lacks meaningful pressure—Mara's exposition resolves everything conveniently without narrowing options or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands but cost proof fails: no exact sentence/image showing legible price paid (e.g., "heart no longer heavy" avoids tangible loss). Orientation clear by line 3, but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural) weakens escalation coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully—the compass stilling crystallizes options with felt cost ("heart lighter, mind clearer"). Constellations' pause lacks integration into stakes, slightly weakening causal escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "world still uncertain, but she was confidently uncertain" crystallizes stance with felt cost in pen's demotion to "dried-up relic," though escalation lacks pressure spikes before void entry.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully ("silence was no longer empty"), but camera's supernatural click breaks Accumulative lens rules—unestablished magic undermines causality despite poetic intent.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.7)
    Valid Charged Poise closure with tears as cost under Accumulative/Textural lens, but escalation lacks pressure—clues yield effortlessly with no narrowing of options. Orientation clear early, yet missing meaningful tightening per scope requirements for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise under Accumulative lens succeeds with hum resonance reconfiguring stakes, but cost proof fails: tears transforming to "purifying" lacks concrete legibility of sacrifice. Lens holds consistently through cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: key turn crystallizes options with felt cost (labyrinth trembling). Situational lens holds—storm/labyrinth pressure forces stance crystallization. Missing one escalation beat where pressure actively narrows options beyond container blockage.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with visible cost ("shoulders lighter"), but the Accumulative/Textural lens falters—stranger's transformation lacks causal pressure from guardian's actions. Rain-slicked dock anchors orientation cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    Orientation fails: location/time unclear past 120 words without functional disorientation payoff. Closure lacks cost—Elias' success feels unearned as the rebellion faces zero opposition, violating Situational lens coherence at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds: scrimshaw discovery → dream → journey → island → detachment. Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with felt cost (lost scrimshaw, gained self-acceptance) in final image. No orientation debt; anchors by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost (isolation as resistance), but orientation test waiver is narrow—turbines/farmhouse anchoring by para 2 barely clears the 120-word threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (lake reshaped), but "ban lifts" setup remains unexplained, weakening causal linkage. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet underdeveloped stakes limit escalation impact at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with felt cost in "beauty in imperfection," but escalation lacks meaningful intensification under accumulative lens—the concertina's awakening leans on coincidence rather than protagonist-driven pressure buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s exhaustion and renewed purpose crystallize options with conceptual cost ("balance" demanded by the lamp’s duality). Accumulative lens holds—sound fragments tighten focus on the central stake (redefining progress) without causal breaks. Cost is legible in the factory sequence’s despair.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with tattoo as visible cost, but curtain activation relies on coincidence rather than causal pressure; "chosen" revelation lacks prior setup about their power.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost ("Tower had fallen... something new could rise"); Accumulative lens holds as data/cards/tape layers reconfigure meaning, though micro-turn before dawn slightly softens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "end of innocence was not an ending" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost; Hybrid lens (Accumulative dominant) holds through pagoda's activation and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully—the river stone's placement crystallizes irreversible change with conceptual cost ("what had been lost, and of what could still be saved"), perfectly executing Accumulative/Textural lens through sensory reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds under Accumulative lens, but cost legibility falters: "fragility/strength" epiphany lacks concrete on-page price (e.g., no physical tremor or tool-rearrangement consequence).

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands flawlessly: scars fading with "stories now complete" shows visible cost, and the accumulative/textural lens (density increase via tunnel memories) holds without contradiction. The final image reconfigures the displaced miracle with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Elara’s descent reconfigures the theater’s meaning with felt cost ("she thought of her own life, of the loves she had left unspoken"), under a coherent Accumulative lens where letter accumulation narrows emotional options.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with "spirit alight" crystallizing options, but cost remains abstract ("fear and exhilaration"). Missing concrete on-page price for the 9+ band. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through sensory density escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (archive reigniting) lacks visible/felt cost; clock’s revival feels convenient. Lens is Hybrid (causal/accumulative) but cost proof fails—Mara’s "surge of hope" is unearned without sacrifice, violating Q2 cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: the light’s revelation reconfigures the rainforest as mind-metaphor with conceptual cost (prior void now filled). Lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of sensory patterns culminates in legible insight. No causality breaks, but cost proof ("felt void" implied) lacks exact on-page anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (leash gone, courage internalized), but the ferryman's reappearance feels coincidental rather than earned. Cost proof falters—no exact line crystallizes the price paid during the air punch.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("silence transformed," bolt "heavy with knowledge"), but the staircase stain discovery feels coincidental rather than earned escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens; cost legibility slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orientation debt: "ancient temple library" appears at 42 words but "who" (Elara) isn't anchored until paragraph 2, triggering -0.4 penalty; closure lands as Charged Poise with visceral cost ("facade cracked") under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable conceptual cost: "paths vanish because we never understood where they led" reweights premise. Accumulative lens holds—density builds via rhythmic tapping and atlas examination to crystallize stakes. Minor opacity in how alarm directly pressures her pivot to evening analysis.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Charged Poise closure lands with felt cost ("lull felt less like rest and more like defeat"), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs Hybrid) slightly weakens escalation. Hum intensification reweights stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure is Charged Poise (embryo’s light as beacon for rebirth), but cost feels abstract. Vision fading leaves "breathless" as sole physical toll; guard’s convenient exit avoids meaningful escalation or sacrifice under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise works (smiling at ocean with cost "not healed, not entirely"), but escalation relies on coincidence (wind stealing photo) not character agency. "Pearl of stillness" realization lacks causal buildup; single tightening insufficient under Accumulative lens for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: ascending staircase crystallizes options with felt cost ("ache remained, no longer burden"). Accumulative lens holds through card-rearrangement pressure, reweighting Tower’s meaning with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with felt cost (accepting grief), but drone's role in escalation is underdeveloped; lens holds as Accumulative/Textural with density increase at ink revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("betrayal of everything") and visible dread, but final thematic echo ("world would never be the same") undermines legibility; causal lens holds firmly through letter→network→transfer sequence with meaningful tightening at terminal access.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "blade sheathed at her side" crystallizes the conceptual cost of peace requiring readiness; Accumulative lens holds with pressure building through symbolic density ("quiet" engraving reweighting the final image).

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("emotions transliterated into something greater"). Accumulative lens holds: silence density increases until symphonic eruption. Goddess appearance slightly coincidental but pays off rail spike reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise works, but cost feels conceptual rather than felt; "journey of discovery" final line overstates resolution, diluting the earned stasis of redirecting the telescope.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly with "meteor hush" reconfiguration; cost legible in "hands no longer steady but free," though firmware shift slightly strains accumulative logic by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: Elara's stance crystallizes ("meaning created one whisper at a time") with felt cost (lilac unease becoming guide). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, but cost legibility falters—unease's transformation lacks visceral specificity in final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with Charged Poise closure; "mercy though aberrant now" crystallizes conceptual cost. Lens ambiguity early (retrocognition vs. sensory accumulation) prevents 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara’s bittersweet watch as the woman departs with the glowing coin crystallizes mended possibility with felt cost ("work was not done"). Accumulative lens holds—density of sensory shifts (shadows to harmonies) tightens stakes without causal turns, and the dawn’s "hues of hope" reconfigures meaning with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with "willowglass hope" cost, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—no setbacks or trade-offs during creation process, leaving pressure underdeveloped despite solid lens coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost but fails cost proof test—no exact sentence shows legible cost at ending beat. Orientation clear early; Accumulative lens holds. Non-closure accumulation: minor causality gaps (unexplained fossil levitation) apply -0.8.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Elara stepping into changed air ("charged with quiet inspiration") crystallizes the conceptual cost of carrying wisdom, with the Accumulative lens holding through button-cataloging density. No causality breaks; the bone button’s discovery tightens options meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost; no on-page sacrifice for the "awakening." Snow codes introduce pressure but resolve coincidentally via the letter, violating accumulative/textural lens requirement for pattern-driven reweighting with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (gutters stopping as time's weight crystallizes understanding), but false urgency from "until gutters stop" deadline undermines Accumulative lens—coincidental resolution weakens protagonist agency. Anchors who/where/when by paragraph 1 avoid orientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands but cost remains conceptual. No on-page sentence/image makes the price legible—community healing happens off-scene, violating cost proof test for tangible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (shared vulnerability), yet lens ambiguity persists—Accumulative/Textural pressure from "quivering hush" motifs lacks causal escalation, weakening the "meaningful tightening" requirement for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost (Elena's irreversible transformation into the library's embodiment), orientation anchored by 40 words, and Accumulative/Textural lens held through sensory density shifts toward the resonant finale.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with legible cost (surrendering the spiral), but the groove's "perfect" fit introduces coincidental convenience that slightly undermines agency under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with visible cost ("protests erupted"), but community division feels coincidental rather than causal escalation from her action; orientation is flawless with radio station details anchoring by line 10.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.1)
    Valid Charged Poise closure as chamber transforms with visible cost (claustrophobia's "vengeance"), but lens ambiguity: starts causal (compass guiding) then shifts to accumulative without teaching pattern by midpoint, weakening escalation coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: quarry "listening" after portrait reconfigures empathy’s possibility. Accumulative lens holds through mist/ribbon density, but figure’s appearance lacks causal motivation—coincidence complicates but doesn’t deepen stakes. Orientation clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("true cost of bravery"), but the jet stream's role as "test of humanity's worthiness" feels underdeveloped in causality despite solid orientation and lens coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with the sanctuary reveal, but cost remains purely conceptual—no on-page forfeiture or endurance cost anchors the "pixelated amnesty" resolution. Orientation is clear early, yet causal links weaken as the glass flake "aligns with landscape" through coincidence, not earned observation.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens, crystallizing cyclical paths with conceptual cost in the moonlit money spread. Cost legibility falters slightly—the father’s regret isn’t viscerally mirrored in Elias’s physicality during the pivotal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with felt cost ("burdens carried in silence" acknowledged), but variable stars' alignment feels coincidental rather than earned through protagonist agency under Accumulative lens. Lens clarity holds post-midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: "spirit unbent" crystallizes reconfigured stance with visceral cost in the confession beat. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3 ("cursed lake," "Eira"). Lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural) isn’t taught early enough—vortex’s "chaotic rhythm" only clarifies the pressure mechanism at midpoint, risking cap under cross-caps.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost (scars pulsing), but "void she was determined to fill" remains abstract. Lens (Hybrid/Accumulative) holds, yet cost lacks visceral specificity at climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)

    Closure lands as valid Charged Poise with conceptual cost (ambitions transformed), but escalation lacks tightening—seed activation happens abruptly without narrowing options. Orientation is solid (arbor established by para 1), yet pressure doesn’t cohere under Accumulative lens until climax.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("After tomorrow disappeared, the world would continue to shift"), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—problem resolves via single orb-dissolving action without causal pressure buildup under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lens ambiguity past midpoint (Causal vs. Accumulative) caps score. Cost proof fails: "steady resolve" lacks legible price; no felt consequence for ignoring inspection timeframe. Orientation test passed but closure (Earned Stasis) feels unearned due to shallow causality.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: "began to trace the lines" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("raw solace" shifting weight). Accumulative lens holds via sensory density tightening stakes. Minor deduction as the man’s appearance edges toward coincidence without deepening causality.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with pulsing parchment implying ongoing cost, but watch's agency ("chosen her") slightly undermines protagonist causality; cost legible yet conceptual repricing not fully earned by her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Decisive Change lands cleanly: violin's song mends perforations with felt cost ("mulberry ache," opaque violin). Causal lens holds—scouts' presence forces balcony action—but orientation debt (midsummer timing vague) prevents higher score despite strong cost proof.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost (“true motivation had never been to capture sparks”) under Accumulative lens; aurora’s shift and traveler’s disappearance crystallize reconfigured stakes without retroactive fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: Elara's emergence crystallizes stance with felt cost (transformed unrest). Accumulative lens holds—density builds through sensory accumulation toward the lake's vision without causal breaks. The "cycle" realization reweights prior material with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost proof: no on-page sentence/image showing Mara's uncertainty's price. Lens (Accumulative) holds but cost ambiguity weakens reconfiguration. Strong orientation anchors early but payoff remains conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: ripples' pattern shift crystallizes stance with felt cost ("heart heavy but unburdened"), though lens clarity at midpoint slightly falters during reflective block.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis fails cost proof test: canyon's "sigh" is atmospheric, not legible cost. Accumulative lens holds, but stakes remain abstract without dramatized consequence. No tightening forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: spire's walls halting after harness use crystallizes options with visible cost (panic, trembling hands). Causal linkage holds through harness deployment; persistent constraint of manual skill shapes climax tactics decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost (lifelong quest), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—descent into library faces zero resistance. Cost proof fails: no on-page sacrifice beyond internal realization during the vow.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (emotional transformation from "quietly enthusiastic" to "beacon of hope"), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—the distillation climax encounters no resistance, muting pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with waves returning and bell’s scarred weight, but "dripping rates" method feels under-motivated; cosmic imbalance resolution lacks visceral cost escalation despite visible scar.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with wind chime's return, but cost ("surge of purpose") feels conceptual not felt. Orientation solid by paragraph 1, yet stakes never viscerally threaten town's present reality. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds but escalation lacks meaningful pressure shift.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative lens holds with starling patterns deepening meaning, but cost legibility fails—the "shift within herself" lacks concrete on-page price. Orientation test passed, yet non-closure accumulation cap applies for two distinct issues (cost proof + lens clarity).

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure lacks visible cost—dawn descent feels unearned stasis without sacrificed stakes; orientation fails past 120 words (no temporal/spatial anchors beyond "nocturnal arbor"); ambiguous lens (hybrid) never solidifies by midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (dissolving dojo, rewritten history), but escalation lacks causal agency—the brain's "response" feels externally imposed rather than driven by Kael's choices, weakening pressure coherence under Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation Test failure: "nocturnal haven" remains spatially vague past 120 words without functional disorientation payoff. Closure (discovering artifacts) lacks visible cost—Elias's seamless acceptance undercuts Earned Stasis despite coherent causal lens (seed→key→door).

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with laughter's tentative return and visible cost (exhaustion), but lens ambiguity until midpoint ("hours blurred") blocks 9.0 eligibility. Orientation anchors tunnel/Eli early yet disorientation risks aren't fully leveraged for closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "I will wait" forecloses the return path with visible cost (garden fading risk), driven by Accumulative/Textural lens where sensory density escalates pressure toward crystallized stance without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with undeniable cost (broken crozier nourishing sapling), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation; minor deduction as the "penny drop" moment feels slightly unearned by immediate prior causality despite thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing: "silence was not absence" crystallizes cost through relinquished assumptions. Lunar perigee timing provides causal pressure, but Earned Stasis lacks tangible forfeiture beyond epistemological shift.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost (Mara's collapse), but causality falters: merging timelines requires no tangible sacrifice beyond fatigue. Radio call serves as weak escalation; the transient's warning doesn't meaningfully narrow options before the rift leap.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("fragile, fleeting, worth every risk"), but escalation falters—shadow figure's appearance feels coincidental, not driven by accumulated pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise (chain resonance/stars) with conceptual cost, but visible price of preserving towers remains abstract; orientation clear, lens (Accumulative/Textural) held coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.7)
    Orientation Test failure: location/time remain unclear past 120 words ("twilight" undefined, atrium's reality ambiguous), triggering -0.4 penalty. Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks legible cost—photo's "warmth" is sentimental, not conceptual price. Lens ambiguity (Causal vs. Accumulative) undermines escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with visible cost (psychological shift in claustrophobia), but phase transition mechanics lack causal setup—fleck's travel function emerges abruptly without prior logic, weakening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with dawn-lit snow reconfiguring the observatory's meaning, though inkblot-to-data shift lacks sufficient causal groundwork for seamless Accumulative/Textural escalation under scrutiny.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: language preserved etched in canyon with visible cost ("copper veins faded," trembling collapse). Orientation succeeds early ("towers of bone...canyon of endless echoes" by word 15), but bird-flight method arrives late (60% mark), slightly weakening Accumulative escalation’s inevitability under the held lens.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the "heavier" silent phone and "cold" arrowhead crystallize emotional transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—border unity with "temporary respite" cost—but drone chase resolution relies on convenient crevice escape, slightly weakening causal escalation at pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost: "silence was not an end, but a beginning" crystallizes the transformation. Accumulative lens holds perfectly—sensory accumulation (bells, mist, warmth) deepens stakes without causal breaks. No orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Elara's return with restored scarf crystallizes her guardianship duty under conceptual cost ("the place was fading"). Causal lens holds perfectly—the geometry method directly unlocks the portal, with cost legible in "edges fraying like the scarf" during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure is Charged Poise (painting as portal revealing courage), but cost remains conceptual, not legible on-page per cost proof test. Accumulative lens holds (light density intensifies), yet pressure lacks tightening—no visible tradeoff when dream "unravels" without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise works under Accumulative lens (reconfiguration via "unchanged, yet everything felt different"), but cost remains conceptual rather than visceral. Escalation lacks meaningful tightening—the vault yields too easily after one whispered phrase, missing a pivotal resistance beat.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    Charged Poise closure valid with conceptual cost (facing truth), but locket discovery feels coincidental; grandmother's foresight strains plausibility. Cost underdeveloped in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise ("shard-mirror no longer felt like a prison but a portal") lands with visible cost—her breath shallowing earlier now replaced by "quiet resolve." Accumulative lens holds through tea-leaf pattern shifts without disorientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost; "preserved wonder" is conceptual but no sacrifice or trade-off is shown on-page. The sprouting seed resolves tension without narrowing options, violating causality under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("heart heavy with reverence"), but lens ambiguity persists: Accumulative/Textural pressure isn't taught early enough to justify the henge misalignment discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: placing the globe down crystallizes her stance shift with visible cost ("silence felt less like a tomb"). Accumulative lens holds—density builds through sensory accumulation toward the letter's "let the snow fall" reconfiguration. Map discovery slightly convenient but not disruptive.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis: Elara's acceptance of ongoing work forecloses isolation with the cost of the ghost's dissolution ("essence scattered like stardust"). Accumulative lens holds via storm-intensified density, though the lightning/thunder timeframe's urgency lacks precise clock pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure succeeds with Charged Poise (tears/warmth crystallizing stance) under Accumulative lens. Minor flaw: "scattered light" mechanic never constrains choices despite repeated mentions, weakening density escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (the vanished cloud's afterimage), but the "faint afterimage burned into her vision" lacks visceral stakes escalation; Accumulative lens holds yet cost feels abstract versus felt, missing the Q2 9+ gate's demand for unmistakable on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly with felt cost ("world seemed different" post-collapse), but lens ambiguity early (Accumulative/Textural not solidified until coin mechanism) triggers minor lens drift penalty at midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: map discovery crystallizes options with felt cost (Thorne's absence transformed). Accumulative lens holds through pattern density increase. Orientation clear by line 15.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("weight of purpose clearer"), but the "unseen clock" motif’s payoff lacks concrete consequence. Orientation succeeds, though the Accumulative lens requires tighter pressure accumulation in the mirror sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: bell ringing crystallizes nebula's return with visible cost in Elara's fading. Orientation anchors ("orchard planet," "dawn") within 50 words. Missing persistent constraint shaping tactics—e.g., bell's physical weight affecting Kael's strike—blocks 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: mended puppet and steady beam crystallize options with felt cost (blood, acknowledged fragility), holding Accumulative/Textural lens through atmospheric intensification to final whisper.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: the bud’s emergence weakens the curse while mechanical birds’ "cries echoing like a warning" prove tangible cost. Causal lens holds firmly from nut discovery to map creation, with orientation anchored by paragraph one.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with conceptual cost ("no longer just a polymer chemist"), but the river foam insight arrives abruptly without causal buildup, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with cost: pavilion dissolves, dawn arrives, "a piece of her own sorrow" gone. But lens ambiguity past midpoint—shifts from quest (causal) to sensory accumulation—triggers -0.4 penalty. Orientation strong (desert fortress anchored by 120 words).

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (community rebirth requires sustained effort), but the astronomical clock’s reactivation lacks causal linkage to Elara’s specific linguistic choices; gears turning "as if responding" creates soft causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with "vowed to carry dreams forward, no matter the cost," but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—mirror modification proceeds without setbacks despite stated risks, flattening pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: seed acquisition forecloses "forgotten combinations" quest with visible cost ("responsibility, a promise").

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with visible cost (exhaustion, hedgehog's retreat), but lens ambiguity past midpoint risks coherence; "no longer silent" payoff just avoids thematic echo penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: king-toppling crystallizes stance with cost (worry stone’s weight), but twilight anchoring slips past 120 words; accumulative lens holds through nexus pulse escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "recovered a piece of her own identity" crystallizes cost with conceptual weight. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation, though cost remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) works with conceptual cost, but escalation lacks causal narrowing—Elara’s success relies on tool functionality rather than earned tactical shifts. "Journey far from over" feels stated, not viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: Elara’s commitment to foresight crystallizes with legible cost ("weight of her findings settled"). Causal lens holds throughout—patch discovery to wind analysis to wreckage reconstruction—but the disaster reconstruction feels slightly tidy, lacking a meaningful tightening of options before the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost (personal triumph), but chisel-timing coincidence weakens causality; aurora-conduit mechanics remain unexplained, creating minor lens ambiguity for Accumulative/Textural design.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly (shared heartbeat rhythm, fade now calling) with felt cost of irrevocable change, but scholar’s "He knew you’d need this" risks thematic echo undermining causality.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly with "truthful lie" reweighting the premise, and cost is legible in the "heavier air." However, lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs. Causal) at midpoint weakens escalation clarity despite strong final charge.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: stepping onto the bridge crystallizes options with visible cost ("weight of sacrifice... but also hope"). Accumulative lens holds through patterned escalation (shifting puzzle → intensifying bead glow), with cost legible in the final image's reconfigured silence.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: the ambiguous transformation ("more and less himself") crystallizes options with felt cost, and causal lens holds. However, the cost isn't visually anchored until the surface return, creating a slight lag in legibility during the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost—"weight of responsibility" crystallizes when repair bay transforms into nexus. Causal lens holds cleanly (shard discovery → transport → orb merger), but cost proof is slightly abstract; no persistent constraint shapes tactics beyond the orb's glow.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density (sea glass, stones) escalates pressure toward Charged Poise closure; cost legible in "luminescent ache" resolving to "quiet resolve" at dawn without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully when beings bow and declare "You have steered us home," crystallizing the Herald's role with conceptual cost (abandoning ordinary existence).

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: Lila’s refusal to escalate violence preserves the fragile truce with visible cost ("trust, once broken, could never be fully repaired"), though necklace clue arrival feels slightly convenient under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) reconfigures her purpose via aurora’s "harmonious glow," but conceptual cost of surrendering skepticism remains abstract—no on-page legibility of paid price beyond stated "sense of purpose" per Cost Proof Test.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("rectification of years of silence") under Accumulative/Textural lens; disorientation waiver earned through motif payoff though glimmer discovery edges toward coincidence-complication.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: courtyard "sigh" and realization reweight the stake with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors by line 1, lens unambiguous, but "sandstorm calm" metaphor slightly muddles the cost legibility at the critical beat.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with walls shifting, but cost proof fails—triumph lacks visible sacrifice. Orientation clear by paragraph 1, yet escalation under Accumulative lens stalls; dance climax resolves via coincidence (chamber hum) not protagonist agency. Lens ambiguity cap applies as drive shifts from causal to textural.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("memories merely misplaced"), but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—the ritual proceeds smoothly without narrowing options. Air shift/tug feels convenient rather than pressure-built; cost emerges only at endpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with visible cost ("weight of responsibility") under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchors by 100 words. Escalation lacks one tangible resistance beat beyond metaphorical "thrashing," narrowly missing 8.8+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visceral cost (erased scroll as liberated canvas), anchored by stalactite rhythm shift. Accumulative lens holds cohesively; orientation clear by paragraph one. No causality breaks but density lacks one persistent constraint for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: melancholy yields to resolve with visible cost in final image. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds throughout, but midpoint ambiguity risks cohesion. Disorientation pays off via starlight nexus closure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: globe clearing reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost (time's distortion overcome). Accumulative lens holds through dream fragments, but cost legibility slightly soft—dawn's warmth dilutes emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("beauty and effort persist, waiting to be seen"), but the Accumulative/Textural lens lacks sufficient density escalation before the crystallization beat.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost (fading sunset, battle "not over"), but causality breaks at climax: Elara realizes deception only after the key repels the figure, not during the vision sequence. One distinct non-closure issue (-0.8) despite strong orientation and lens adherence.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.9)
    Orientation Test fails: no clear "where" (sanctuary geography) by 120 words; closure (Earned Stasis atop viaduct) lacks legible cost—completion feels unearned without dramatized price. Lens (Accumulative) holds but pressure never tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with felt cost ("Some debts are paid in blood" photo), but causal escalation falters as discoveries require minimal effort; tunnel junction symbols appear without earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes Elias’s stance with undeniable pressure ("the storm was coming"), but cost (professional risk, emotional toll) remains implied rather than dramatized on-page. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via density increase in workshop beats.

    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the bell’s vanishing echo reconfigures stakes with felt cost (her exhaustion, the world’s irreversible awakening), and the Accumulative lens holds as pattern-breaking density (recurring bell motif) tightens the dominant stake without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost (void becoming actionable pursuit), but "mirror of the void" near-thematic echo slightly over-explains the final image's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (mended fractures via light), but felt stakes remain abstract. Accumulative lens holds through mirror visions, though the "shifted options" lack concrete tactical trade-offs visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing: ice whisper shifting from threat to lullaby crystallizes acceptance with felt cost (her lifted weight). Orientation anchors at 78 words; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory accumulation to Charged Poise ending.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise ("dance with mismatches") reweights destiny concept with conceptual cost, but cost remains abstract—no visceral felt price in final image despite strong lens coherence (Accumulative).

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: footprints erased but actions endure, with conceptual cost (impermanence vs legacy). Orientation clear by para 1. Minor escalation flaw—consecration ritual lacks deepening beyond single beat, barely meeting "one meaningful tightening" threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: "healing was not just an act but a process" crystallizes cost with undeniable pressure. Accumulative lens holds through photograph arrangement deepening, no orientation debt. Final image reweights premise with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: crystal's depletion ("energy draining into him") creates undeniable conceptual cost for language restoration, but the "faint whisper of hope" final line slightly overstates the reconfiguration under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fog-thickening-to-lifting cadence shift reweights time's sound with conceptual cost (chalk's uselessness). Minor pressure slack in middle beats prevents 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (observatory's shift from stillness to dynamic constancy). Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases via leaf motif and clock-hand reconfiguration. Cost proof weakens slightly as the "warm glow" lacks visceral tradeoff for the observatory's transformed state.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (mother-daughter reunion crystallizing reconciliation with cost of time running out), but blood work confirmation feels summarily telegraphed rather than dramatized pressure; "confirming what they all feared" softens the causal stakes escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost ("key felt heavy... purpose fulfilled") under clear causal lens; orientation anchored in first sentence, escalation tightens options through workshop-to-precipice progression with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds consistently (tooth→maze→fountain→sacrifice), but conceptual repricing closure lacks legible cost: the stone's loss triggers abstract "warmth" without concrete consequence, failing cost proof test despite Charged Poise potential.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Charged Poise closure lands with legible cost ("memories no longer felt like burdens"); accumulative lens holds via polishing density increase. Reflection adheres to BRR, but global cap prevents 9.0 despite flawless causality.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the shared notebook crystallizes options (solitude vs. connection) with palpable cost (Elara’s risk of renewed exposure). Accumulative lens holds—moss/icicle patterns deepen into shared language. Cost proof: "vulnerability, when protected, could bloom" reweights prior solitude with social stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("conflicted nature giving way to purpose") under Accumulative lens. Missing persistent constraint shaping tactics precludes 9.0; mist lifting lacks causal link to final writing act.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost ("work far from over"), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs Hybrid) past midpoint weakens causality. Cost proof insufficiently visualized beyond abstract statement.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.9)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—tremor and glow feel coincidental rather than earned consequence; no visible price paid despite "felt cost" requirement for Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    Strong Charged Poise closure with felt cost ("fragile, like first snowflake"), but "wounded season" timeframe lacks active pressure despite lyrical description. Orientation solid; accumulative lens holds through sensory deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (crack in calcified layers) under Accumulative/Textural lens; starlight reconfiguration of her weaving patterns crystallizes the stance shift, though the "crack" could be more viscerally rendered to elevate cost proof.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands when rain tapers and lion is held—"rust-hued peace" crystallizes cost of endurance; Accumulative lens holds via carving progression.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragments accumulate density until Charged Poise closure ("ghost isn't enemy but guide") reconfigures stakes with felt cost. Orientation clear by word 10; disorientation serves closure via "fractured stillness" motif.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost but causality falters: terminal's "response" to Eli's actions feels coincidental, not earned. Sextant's role in narrowing options remains unproven.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with "carry it with her" realization, but the "bear" whisper introduction lacks sufficient causal buildup, weakening the escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise (sunlight breaking as Elara stands with journal/sundial) lacks concrete cost proof; "changed everything" is vague thematic assertion rather than legible on-page consequence. Accumulative lens holds but pressure accumulation feels coincidental (chest find), not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lacks legible cost: "ancient methods are safe" declares victory without consequence. Charged Poise fails as fog’s approval is atmospheric, not earned through narrowing options. Lens (Accumulative) holds but cost proof test fails.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (the woman’s tears, traveler’s acceptance), but the "geography of healing" lens emerges too late (~line 150) for seamless integration, narrowly missing 8.8+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "beauty could not be forced" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("sacrifice, patience"). Causal lens holds through machine activation and vision, though egg's mechanical taint feels under-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost (uncertain growth), but cost legibility falters—no exact image anchors sacrifice. Orientation clear early, but lens (Accumulative/Textural) lacks density increase at pivotal grafting moment.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change: placing the shard releases memories/water with visible cost (confronting trapped younger self). Causal lens holds perfectly—breadcrumbs narrow options relentlessly. No orientation debt; anchors established by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (generational weight), but abrupt shift from "troubling serenity" to "harmonious resonance" lacks causal escalation under Accumulative lens; cost legibility dented by convenient gear transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost ("grief was not something to be solved but something to be carried") crystallized in the final ribbon-tucking gesture; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density shifts from "thundering calm" to migration epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with "become the pendulum bob himself," cost legible in "incremental grace." Orientation anchors by word 20, but town transformation summarized (fisherman/baker) weakens escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise (stars shimmering brighter) lacks felt cost; "intentions endure" is conceptual but unearned—no visible price paid during decoding. Orientation solid, but Accumulative lens fails cost proof test: no density shift or pattern break to reweight stakes despite thematic hints.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis works but cost is abstract (no visible sacrifice beyond metaphorical "weight"). Spire's transformation lacks causal linkage to writing act, weakening accumulative lens coherence at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—abandoning quill for notebook crystallizes stance with felt cost ("quill and parchment forgotten")—but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs. Situational) weakens escalation; radio’s agency blurs causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("safety is mirage"), but rocking chair's timed stillness feels coincidental rather than causally earned under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing with cost (worldview shift), but the critical turning point—"flicker of hope"—happens off-page during unshown weeks, breaking causality. Collapse news forces action, yet the actual change (accepting Lira’s narrative) lacks on-page escalation. Orientation solid within 120 words; lens (Accumulative/Textural) inferred by midpoint and held.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise ("true victory lay not in applause, but in the silence they had replaced") with conceptual cost. Lens ambiguity (causal vs. accumulative) past midpoint prevents 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the glowing fruit’s bite crystallizes her stance with conceptual cost (doubt transformed into shared hope), though celestial alignment’s urgency isn’t leveraged for escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (drones' sacrifice burden), causal chain intact, but escalation lacks meaningful narrowing of options; descent-to-revelation sequence feels inevitable without sufficient resistance to heighten cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with conceptual cost ("world felt a little more alive" implying eternal displacement). Accumulative lens holds through object-density escalation. Shard's glow slightly convenient—coincidence complicates but doesn't resolve, triggering -0.8 cap. Cost proof solid: final image makes hush's burden undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost (shattered certainty requiring adjustments), causal lens holds through ampoule fragility escalation, but lens ambiguity at midpoint slightly weakens causality proof.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as valid Charged Poise (weaving loss into motion) with felt cost, but Accumulative/Textural lens isn't fully taught until the die slips; mid-story ambiguity slightly weakens causal legibility for escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens: "saffron quiet" crystallizes reconfigured purpose with felt cost of exhaustion transforming into resolve; moon progression provides sufficient tightening, though brush's magic origin remains slightly unmoored from prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lens’s emerald reflection on the waterfall crystallizes Verdania’s rekindled unity with felt cost (years of cultural erosion). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—sensory density (honey’s hum, bread’s scent) escalates pressure by reweighting the stake (identity preservation) through the lens’s glow. However, the beekeeper’s timeframe lacks causal traction, muting escalation’s rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("tide rushed back in, swallowing exposed rocks"), causal chain holds tightly. Minor causality gap: why yoyo unlocks stone isn't dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with funhouse dissolution, but "fear dies in understanding" risks thematic echo. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through luminance/mirror density, though clock room feels like a forced escalation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: "world was perfectly in tune" crystallizes reconfigured stakes with conceptual cost (dissonance resolved into "restless euphony"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via density escalation—cloud patterns contracting to music—but cost remains abstract, lacking a concrete image like a physical sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure as Earned Stasis works under Accumulative/Textural lens, but cost ("time running out") remains abstract; the turtles' dying state isn't made viscerally felt through Elara's physical or emotional experience in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: "pit of lies was a little shallower" crystallizes cost through the rosebush’s bare branches. Missing setup: no tangible opposition narrows options before the ledger’s easy riddle.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with the pulsing mosaic—cost visible in Elias's raw hands and "strange lightness," reconfiguring absence as active force under Accumulative/Textural lens; one tightening (journal discovery to resolve hardening) suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost: blackout ends but Elara departs unscathed, no sacrificed option or enduring consequence. Orientation strong early, but climax’s "stillness remained" feels thematic assertion, not earned reconfiguration. Lens (Accumulative) holds yet stakes evaporate.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: unfolding the crane crystallizes options with visible cost ("first genuine smile"). Accumulative lens holds—density intensifies through light/shadow shifts, narrowing Kael’s emotional stance without causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (final image reconfigures "survivor" to "seeker" with felt cost: "world still broken"), but lens (Accumulative/Textural) ambiguously established until midway; circuit breakers' silence creates necessary pressure for crystallization without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("fragments of himself"), but fails "cost proof test": no concrete on-page sentence shows legible cost beyond internal resonance. Accumulative lens holds through gathering pieces, yet escalation lacks meaningful pressure—finding artifacts feels frictionless despite "coherent pressure" requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: watch sinking into sand crystallizes irreversible cost of withheld truth; Accumulative/Textural lens holds as driftwood carvings reconfigure stakes without causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: drawer pull exchange crystallizes reconfigured options with conceptual cost ("forgiveness is a path walked"). Orientation penalty: mist/parapet setting anchored at ~150 words (past 120-word threshold), applying -0.3. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through final image.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost ("regrets lingered but no longer defined her") under Accumulative lens. Sensory density escalates meaningfully as poles fade, reweighting stakes through cadence shift without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise (Elias understanding he "can't go back" but carries empathy) lands with visible cost: lost baseball, irreversible shift in self. Accumulative lens holds—sensory density builds to crystallized stance without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise works, but causality breaks at the guardian's transformation: Elara's inhalation triggers instant change without visible struggle or cost. The "let go of the past" demand lacks on-page proof of difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the saucer's crack shifting from "wound" to "reminder" reconfigures time's fragility with felt cost. Accumulative lens holds—density intensifies via card draws and firefly vision—but escalation lacks one more decisive deepening beat before climax.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.5)
    Accumulative lens holds: stitching sequence deepens pressure via sensory density. Charged Poise closure lands with undeniable cost in "spirit becoming lighter" and "centuries" weight.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with cosmic resonance but cost legibility fails: releasing the bugs has no physical/emotional consequence shown on page ("lighter steps" contradicts sacrifice). Lens (Accumulative) holds yet cost arrives too late for full integration.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost in "Thorne’s silence speaking volumes," though blackout’s unexplained origin slightly undermines causal rigor at the inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (lifelong obsession continues), but "borrowed dawn" overstatement in final lines weakens the earned stasis. Accumulative lens holds through aurora/eel synchronization intensifying density.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with storm/timer pressure culminating in Charged Poise closure; bus timetable backstory arrival strains causality slightly at midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "questions were not paths to answers; they were the answers themselves" reconfigures the sundial's meaning under Accumulative/Textural lens. The brook's shift from "counterpoint" to "music" crystallizes the felt cost of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    No legible cost at closure despite Charged Poise attempt; "patching is how we rebuild" handwaves stakes. Lens (Accumulative) holds but cost proof fails at moonlit rooftop.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure achieves valid Charged Poise with the ticking clock and horizon moment, but cost legibility falters—the emotional price of acceptance isn't concretely shown in the final beat ("smiled" lacks visceral weight).

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost (memory preservation), but causal linkage falters: the monsoon’s threat remains abstract despite "fraying" signs. Cost proof test fails—no specific on-page forfeiture or irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: compass needle halting at horizon crystallizes emotional reconfiguration with felt cost (“heart lighter than years”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—tide dissolving letters reweights “unspoken apologies” through visceral imagery. No causality breaks; cost legible in dissolving physical letters.
