  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through "a practice of noticing, a practice of keeping faith with change," with visible cost in the flood's destruction and the slow work of recovery. The accumulative lens holds consistently as patterns build from dust to data to community repair, though the final paragraph slightly over-articulates the thematic convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from survival through discovery to resolution, with the ledger strip serving as the causal thread. The closure—choosing to create a window that frost will read—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost: the protagonist must return to face potential danger. The "steadily adaptive answer" pays off the established pattern of glass, frost, and testimony.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when "We are unshaken marvels ourselves, proof that even a capsized world can learn to balance." The accumulative lens holds as sensory patterns build toward this crystallized understanding. Cost is visible in the community's need for translation and the protagonist's tireless work in "brittle cold."

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the undertaker transforms the library into a permanent registry for the dead, with clear cost ("grief taught me to lift what the living cannot carry"). The accumulative lens holds as density builds through catalog cards, signal codes, and the final SOR pattern that "knits a harbor where nothing must depart."

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from the bell's introduction through its various meanings (donations, medicine, intergenerational exchange) to the patrol confrontation and final transformation. The closure lands with resonant reconfiguration as the bell shifts from secrecy tool to wind-rung thanks, with clear cost in the risk taken and winter endured. Slight softness in the final image's cost articulation prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through breath-based revelation leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist releases hoarded love. The closure lands with felt cost as the "storage closet unlatch[es] behind my ribs" and the protagonist actively decants rather than spills. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (twilight viaduct, camera obscura artist, post-memory state).

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with patterns of disintegration/reformation building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist accepts that "the present is a continual photograph fading." The halo fragment's transformation from shard to ring with the garden's final "quaking reverie that holds still" delivers closure with felt cost of accepting impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story delivers a clear Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara successfully distributing seeds to the community, with visible cost in the chain she carries and the pursuit she endures. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks. Slight deduction for the cost being more symbolic than viscerally felt in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered imagery (drowned orchard, aurora, forge of absence) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist transforms personal betrayal into healing technology. The closure lands with clear cost—"sealing the pattern into the listening bowl"—as the protagonist moves from seeking the sound of breaking to preserving what comes before, though the causal mechanics of how "absences grow edges" could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the realization "I knew what I had always stolen" - a conceptual repricing of the narrator's role from taking to returning. The accumulative structure coheres through moonbeam/light motifs. Minor deduction for slightly abstract cost articulation, though the transformation is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as narrated actions and ceremonial language build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the space transforms from abandoned to purposeful. The closure image of setting the bookmark "at a chapter he had written with his hands" carries visible cost (physical exhaustion) and conceptual repricing of the space. However, the middle section's pacing occasionally stalls with repetitive narration patterns that don't always deepen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with patterns of doubling, codes, and hidden identities building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the brothers unite through shared vulnerability. The closure lands with felt cost ("I would keep falling, but now toward us, not away") and the drive lens holds consistently. The orientation anchors (rusted library, midnight, stunt double) establish clearly within the first lines.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught mapping of silences that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration—the courier accepts his mission and the oracle commits to "walk the tide's erasures." The cost is visible: she bleeds into the stones, accepts isolation, knowing "the gold will keep flaking, and the star may die." The piece teaches its method early ("summarizing silence") and pays it off through accumulated gaps becoming coordinates.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator embraces their cyclical existence, with cost visible in "I know that tomorrow will be another yesterday." The looped timeline structure coheres under the Accumulative lens, each repetition adding layers of meaning. Orientation anchors (robot janitor, frozen courtyard, research hall) establish by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the public revelation transforms mistrust into collective acceptance, with visible cost in the narrator's vulnerability and the curator's bow. The accumulative structure coheres as doodle revelations build toward communal healing. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3. Minor deduction for slightly mechanical resolution where all parties converge too harmoniously.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where garden and gardener achieve mutual recognition as "equals in attentive weather," with visible cost in accepting "both bloom and wither." The accumulative structure coheres through recurring marbles, dials, and fountain, building to "Nothing else needed measuring; the work itself settled the account." Orientation anchors clearly (garden, gate, maze).

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Jae encounters his own sideways selves, reweighting the entire time theory with personal cost ("felt forgiven"). The accumulative structure coheres beautifully—each holographic/sideways image builds toward the mantas' lateral return. Minor orientation wobble around the vault sequence, but the taught pattern of sideways imagery maintains coherence throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught "in between spaces" that builds through water-damaged images becoming scores, reflection-maps, and silence-choreography, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where conducting silence releases the ghost's trapped breath. Cost is legible in the narrator's acceptance of the conductor role and the house's final exhalation.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration achieved through the narrator's release of the swallowed truth, with visible cost in "where the tension leaves my shoulders" and the final image of shared burden. The accumulative lens holds consistently through density increases (ash smudges, weather metaphors, body-as-instrument) that reweight the central metaphor of weight/balance. The oracle's folding and returning of the smudged gentian creates a perfect closure image where "some truths become lighter only when they can be shared."

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative structure coheres through the valve wheel as recurring anchor, building from radio confession through tunnel exploration to the final forgiveness. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when "I forgave the wheel, and I set it back to open" - a gesture that accepts the truth without requiring ghostly proof. Cost is felt in "Weight arrived in my arms" and the acceptance that "Normal means are heavy."

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration as the keeper accepts their role within regenerative silence, with cost visible in "reality itself seems to float." The accumulative structure coheres as seasonal observations build toward understanding that silence is "not absence but compost." The orientation anchors clearly (underground library, chronicle keeper, timeless witnessing) and the lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively toward Ada's moment of release during totality. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Ada traces the question mark and accepts wonder as love, with visible emotional cost. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (sage ridge location emerges gradually) and because the therapeutic frame somewhat insulates the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the historian commits to teaching walls to speak to each other, accepting the role of intermediary in a dreamless world. The cost is palpable—he "volunteers" to absorb stories "stranded without sleepers." The accumulative structure coheres through the brass disk discovery revealing the displaced axis "unseated dreams," making his final stance inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with fortune-writing patterns building to the lighthouse projection that makes "You already know" bloom across kitchen walls—a Resonant Reconfiguration where open secrets become visible truth. The cost manifests as "their shoulders said thank you for arranging the tide," showing the town's ambivalent gratitude for forced transparency. Causality holds through fortune→microdot→lighthouse→revelation chain.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through accumulated rhetorical pressure that allows Mara to "choose her own name again." The possession's dissolution through linguistic unraveling rather than exorcism spectacle is elegantly earned. Cost is visible in the "dry sound that forgave nobody and everyone." Slight opacity in the exact mechanics of the "dimensional anchor" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where fortune-writing transforms into musical notation with visible cost ("exhaustion hits"). The accumulative structure coheres as memories become musical movements, culminating in "Some night a diner will break one and read the hush inside, and feel the dawn performing in their ribs." The lens holds consistently though early orientation could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis—the protagonist renounces flight ("no urgency to fly") with visible cost in the shift from defying to accepting gravity. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and repeated imagery build toward the final reconfiguration. Slight deduction for delayed orientation (who/where crystallizes slowly) though this serves the dreamlike progression.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Mara transforms from fearing numbness to carrying "hush" as presence that enables teaching. The backward recording sequence creates textural density that reweights silence from absence to "a way for presence to travel." Cost is felt through the frost/water transformation and her students' future tenderness.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator returns to copying weather "without hurry," having preserved their integrity through lateral tactics—the cost is the ongoing surveillance and forced deception. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pressure builds through layered details (footsteps, message, figure's arrival) toward this earned stasis. The decoy charts and pigeon message create clear causality within the accumulative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through botanical imagery building to the amberhorn revelation and final reconfiguration. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the empty vial transforms from trap to compass, with emotional cost paid through tears and the acceptance of "what I can bear." The ultraviolet revelation provides causal linkage between past and present understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught lyric compression. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the mirror scene where the protagonist accepts their flawed past, with cost visible in "forgave the version of me that ran first and helped later." The rope's transformation from escape tool to connection grammar provides coherent throughline, though some middle passages drift into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece builds density through layered images (sunken orchard, shipwrecks, mendicant's bowl) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "pockets full of beginnings" reweights the opening's "chronic hush." Cost is legible in the line "not to break, but to release, so wood can remember its tree without forgetting the ocean"—showing the price of holding both states.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through sensory detail toward Rhea's transformation. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as she subsumes the counterfeit to find her authentic stance, with cost visible in "the counterfeit receding." Orientation anchors clearly (amber grotto, dusk, dealer/client), and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the Harbor Ledger project gathering names and stories, but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost. The ending presents completion rather than transformation—Mara and Jun share custodianship, but no path is foreclosed, no price paid. The mistaken envelope initiates action effectively, yet the resolution feels ceremonial rather than earned through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the communal "leaning" posture creates a living arbor, with visible cost in the "ache that stayed, but now it glowed like a lantern meant for many hands." The accumulative lens holds as fragments (tag search, stories, shards) build toward collective embodiment. Opening/closing frame of "Beyond the murmur of lost languages" creates effective circularity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure: the narrator releases an echo larva into the world, transforming observation into participation with temporal debt as cost. The piece teaches its time-borrowing mechanics early and pays them off through the giant's breathing rhythm and the interrupted cadence discovery. Slight deduction for the abstract "metronome of rain and stone" that could be more concretely anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the theorem "love equals attention multiplied by time, divided by the courage to admit uncertainty." The cost is legible in accepting unsolvable equations—"a theorem he cannot solve but can carry." However, the accumulative pattern relies heavily on metaphorical abstraction, and the physical actions with the glass eyes feel ornamental rather than essential to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with effective density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when the dweller helps the girl find her mother's notebook, crystallizing his purpose. The closure lands with felt cost ("heart big as a boiler") and the etched arrow suggests future visibility, though the causal linkage between the tape's "sense memory" and finding the notebook could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through pattern breaks—from tying knots that "sighed loose" to finding jasmine "braided itself with the hop"—culminating in Mara's vow to reconstruct "only what grows kinder" with clear cost (surrendering control). The orientation anchors cleanly (plant nursery, storm season, Mara) and the Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt price as she commits to daily attention over command.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands powerfully as Resonant Reconfiguration - the pact transforms both characters' relationships to the island, with visible cost (giving back the gnat, the keeper's tears). The accumulative structure coheres through rain trails as connective tissue. Slight deduction for the mother's appearance feeling marginally convenient despite its emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as the pearl's acceptance of the pilgrim reweights the meaning of "everyday magic" from conquest to magnification, with clear cost in the narrator's lost authority ("I did not see it coming"). The accumulative structure coheres beautifully as musical patterns build toward the closure where "morning routines" become the true magic.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with "absences have shifted, no longer voids but channels navigated," showing clear before/after with felt cost. The accumulative structure builds coherently through valve-turning, window-tapping, and route-tracing toward this reconfiguration. Slight opacity in the exile's specific nature prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns build toward the fortress revelation and final reconfiguration ("When we emerged, the hour reset, and I began anew"). The closure lands with conceptual cost—releasing rigid patterns to access truth—though the phantom train sequence could strengthen causality between discovery and transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with patterns building toward the shared grief moment in the "room" where "our griefs exchanged coats." The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the narrator accepts their role as "skeptic with mercy, tending the unheard symphony" with visible cost (keeping Lio's shell, promising care). The orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and causality holds through pattern accumulation rather than explicit because/therefore links.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through prismatic imagery and magnetic field manipulation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where goodbye transforms from ending to "blueprint of the next room." The corridor sequence dramatizes this conceptual shift with visible cost—the narrator pays with memories, Lio with his refusal to forgive. Minor orientation wobble with "escondite" (undefined Spanish term) but recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - the narrator transforms from passive inheritor of dishonest legacy to active agent of fair trade, with the ink pot bridging father's forgery to witnessing truth. The accumulative pattern holds throughout, building through ritual gestures toward the final "new vowel of fairness arrive." Cost is legible in risk taken and legacy confronted.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure with clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where "patience answers patience" crystallizes the narrator's role. The piece teaches its pattern early through the lamp's hum metaphor and pays it off when "their hum will find mine, a duet slowly rehearsed." Cost is visible in the narrator's isolation and the weight of being the sole keeper of memory, though the emotional price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through layered fragments (overheard stories, poison label, mechanic's information) toward a Charged Poise closure where the narrator leaves the label for the widow to "choose whether to inventory truth or keep the ledger balanced." The cost is legible in both the narrator's ongoing erasure and the widow's trembling recognition, with the ocean as persistent constraint shaping his ghostly existence.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong pattern-teaching through the cello's resonant hums building toward a Conceptual Repricing where "kindness carried forward until it looks like gravity" reweights the entire quest. Cost is felt through the myth buster's vulnerability ("he feels the riddle unclench like a fist") and the observatory's continued humming after he leaves. Orientation anchors arrive late (protagonist role clear only by line 3), triggering -0.3, though the atmospheric opening serves the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Nessa's choreographed solution that literally realigns the rafts, with visible cost in her temporary alliance with the consortium. The accumulative structure builds pressure effectively through privatization encroachment, though the orientation of the raft city's physical layout could be clearer earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the moth's final flight reweights the narrator's purpose from documentation to witness. The closure lands with felt cost: "the moth made a soft collision with my sleeve, dusted me with a century." Orientation anchors early (moonlit summit, crater inspector), and the chemical timing mechanism provides causal scaffolding for the lyric accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the depot "returns the smile in the language of settled wheels," confirming the artisan's methods work. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward this validation. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (who/where emerges gradually) and because the cost, while present in the effort and precision required, could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where discovering the rivers' "singular convergence" transforms the narrator from skeptical editor to witness/clerk of natural governance. The cost is legible in accepting that "water that begins as one must learn to part again" - acknowledging both connection and inevitable separation. The accumulative lens holds consistently through pattern-reading and gradual revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the tuner's methodical restoration building through footsteps, fork resonances, and gradually expanding participation until the bell speaks and the town commits to practice. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with "not by decree, but by walking the measure they made together," showing visible communal cost through commitment to unglamorous return. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 with the tuner, his fork, and the abandoned town.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the signal successfully transmits through the temple's acoustics, with visible cost in depleting air and the narrator's fear ("proud and afraid"). The accumulative structure coheres as sensory details build toward the transmission moment. Slight deduction for mild orientation delay - the rescue mission context emerges gradually rather than anchoring immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens builds through copperlight imagery, confession layers, and the lattice's transformative filtering toward a Charged Poise closure where the narrator positions himself as lens-keeper who will "answer in the measured way of a lens rotating." The "drain held answers that were not yet bodies" creates urgent stakes with visible cost in choosing how truth emerges. Early orientation anchors solidly by line 3, though the "thread a labyrinth with your own story" shifts between self and reader address without clear purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the bead transforms from ferry token to doorway talisman, with clear cost (the ghost's departure: "vanished without receding"). The accumulative structure coheres through repeated ephemeral teachings building to the orchard's awakening. Slight deduction for dense backstory integration that occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through ritual actions and sensory accretion toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where water returns to the harbor. The closure lands with visible cost—Sera leaves the plate behind, transforming from taking to tending. Causality occasionally softens into mystical convenience (hidden sluices opening), but the pattern-teaching of sleepwalking paths and the tether's accumulating names maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the narrator's decision to remain, with visible cost of foreclosing the diaspora return. The accumulative lens holds as images (sundial, bones, orchard) layer and reweight through the restoration sequence. The final orbit "that kept the orchard speaking and my journey unbroken" crystallizes the reconfigured stance with clear before/after legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the narrator holds the letter at the mail slot, recognizing their own transformation through helping others transform. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details (chalk codes, arcade echoes, naming practices) build toward this crystallized moment where past and present converge. Cost is felt through "heart loud as sorting machinery" and the weight of "the last lesson is patience," though the final withholding gesture could land with more visceral consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece coheres through pattern accumulation (stitching/listening/conspiracy) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where accepting blame becomes a form of power. The cost is legible in "You will be blamed" followed by the narrator's acceptance, and the final request for sleep as "travel through adjacent possibilities" crystallizes the narrator's method. Some causality between stitching and revelation could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through lyric recursion until the Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: "I will share the hinge and let it breathe us." The cost is legible in the protagonist's recognition of "that tenderness hoarded" and commitment to vulnerability. The orientation anchors (mangrove labyrinth, spirits, Mara) establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the mother reaches for the uncle's sleeve after learning the boy will keep his fingers—a gestural reconciliation earned through the narrator's translation work. The accumulative lens holds as details (cast messages, coral grooves, boat drawings) layer toward this moment, though the cost remains more implied than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of "joy's trail was a ribbon in the fog," reweighting the entire accumulative journey with conceptual cost—joy requires collaborative incompleteness rather than solo perfection. The accumulative structure coheres as each projection and correction builds toward communal recreation. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator exchanges certainty for curiosity, with visible cost in accepting incomplete knowledge. The accumulative structure coheres through nested discoveries (sketch→glaze→secret), each awakening deepening the central question. The "pause between question and reply" pattern creates rhythmic escalation. Slight opacity around the exact nature of the sound-activated restoration technique.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative/textural structure builds from individual resistance to collective action, with the final garden concert achieving Resonant Reconfiguration—transforming illegal thought into protected artistic expression with visible cost (the risk of arrest, the exposure). The closure lands with "A garden keeps the spark, and we keep watch," reweighting all prior planting as both literal and metaphorical resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the protagonist's transformation from insomniac isolation to gentle tender, with visible cost in the treaty signing and breath-written vow. The accumulative lens holds consistently through repeated refrains and deepening imagery. Deduction for slight orientation delay (shell location/nature unclear initially) and some causality softness in the Gardener's arrival mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the caretaker tests their own name against forgetting, making them both guardian and potential artifact. The accumulative structure coheres through pattern—from general library duties to specific repair to personal vulnerability—with clear cost: "I taste salt and dust, the twin spices of relief that age leaves behind."

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration through the composed promises leading to reconciliation. The closure lands with visible cost—three winters of silence resolved through vulnerable collaboration. The orientation anchors clearly (archive, dawn, linguist) and causality holds as each promise movement builds toward Lio's return.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist harmonizes competing interests through tuned gates that "hum like tempered bells," with visible cost in the forbidden lovers' encrypted compassion and the mountain's acceptance. The accumulative structure coheres well with the breathing amphitheater motif creating rhythm. Slight deduction for the orientation delay (who/where/when takes ~120 words to fully establish) though this serves the atmospheric opening.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator releases the pigeon choir and "feels a hinge loosen where suspicion had rusted it shut" - trust returns with visible cost (the attic clearing, the risk of another betrayal). The accumulative structure coheres through dust-mapping, pigeon-training, and music-exchange patterns. Slight opacity around the mars meteorite's function prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Charged Poise closure where maintaining distance becomes "a companion rather than a wall" with clear emotional cost ("I breathed in that ache"). The accumulative pattern of codes/grain/thresholds coheres meaningfully. The piece teaches its metaphorical logic early and pays it off. Slight opacity in the butterfly effect frame prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through synchronized breathing, archive revelations, and the final transformation where "sunrise tasted like consent." The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the protagonist shifts from anxious outsider to someone who can "put the pencil down" and breathe with place—visible cost in releasing control. Orientation anchors (underwater city, midnight arrival, landscape astrologer) establish cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: paths are revealed as conscious caretakers, not cowards, with the village accepting an edited route. The accumulative lens holds as metaphorical density builds toward this revelation. Cost is conceptual but legible—the community must accept the path's decision. Minor orientation wobble with the bird's sudden appearance, but the pattern teaches itself and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through "Objects are not souvenirs until they learn the hand they belong to" with the janitor's return of the bishop marking acceptance of grief's diagonal path. The accumulative structure coheres, though some middle passages meander without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the tattooing transforms exile into vocation through "obsidian grace that could pass for ordinary." Cost is visible in the permanence of exile and the risk of discovery ("if patrols asked"). However, the nostalgia ban's mechanics remain vague, and the transition from garden to future coastal wandering feels slightly unearned causally.

    Accumulative/textural lens holds as the piece builds through layered images of glass, water, and light toward a resonant reconfiguration where the glazier commits to preserving communal memory in the atrium design. The pond divination scene meaningfully deepens the stakes and provides the tactical shift. Closure lands with conceptual cost as "we were its light first" reweights the entire development project, though the middle section's pacing occasionally stalls on reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through layered imagery (fire/ash/paper/stone) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where shared grief transforms into shared teaching. The cost is visible in "burned fingers" becoming tools for "enlighten[ing] without preaching," and the empty box becoming "lighter than guilt, heavier than air." The closure reweights the opening's "learned silence" into active translation of pain.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens as patterns and decorations accumulate meaning until the final "serene upheaval we had called forth" lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The grotto setting and gauge mechanics remain consistent throughout, building pressure through iterative attempts. However, the precise nature of the "upheaval" and its cost could be more concrete—we see the village path "bright with scattered tin" but the actual price of this transformation remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through discovered artifacts (diaries, negative, letter) that reweight the protagonist's role from observer to inheritor. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when accepting the burden transforms mapping from career to citizenship. Cost is legible in "my name slid away like a coin down a tide drain" and the weight of the promise settling on shoulders.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost - the narrator must relinquish control and "ask mirrors...the way you ask a friend to stay for tea." The accumulative lens holds consistently through pattern teaching (coded lullabies) to final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through "The forever war did not end, but it loosened its grip" with visible cost in the bowl of casings and annual return promise. The accumulative structure coheres well through ritual steps. Deduction for slightly abstract cost representation - while the emotional weight is felt, the specific trade-offs could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the egg releases its "remembered weight" into the echo chamber, reweighting the drought from destruction to preservation vessel.

The accumulative structure coheres through salt/echo/extinction motifs building to the final "manufactured, and somehow nearly forgiven" rain.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught repetition ("alarming serenity," "bodily poetic," "between sigh and smile") building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the city "learning slowly how to refuse and still sing" shows clear cost through the guards' "pikes sighing into frost." The ritual's completion transforms collective speech with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the final "meteor hush" transforms from isolation to collective listening, with clear cost in surrendering artistic control. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through the stick's passage between hands. Orientation anchors cleanly establish the dome setting and post-argument context.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the narrator lying in moss, "eyes open to green light," waiting for history to answer—a Charged Poise that crystallizes the tension between action and receptivity. The accumulative pattern of temporary structures coheres into this final stillness where the narrator becomes another transient signal. Cost is felt through the vulnerability of waiting and the acceptance that these gestures may dissolve "beyond sunset."

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the bells speaking names creates a before/after where silence becomes preservation. Cost is visible in the year-long journey of self-forgiveness and the physical exhaustion. The rope-braiding system provides persistent constraint that shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration where breaking the wafer seal transforms from violation to "consent older than the archive," with visible cost in accepting an invitation rather than following directives. The accumulative/textural lens holds as dream interpretations, archive interactions, and weather patterns build density toward the protagonist choosing to be "chosen" by the path. Orientation anchors (bunker, forest, storm) establish early and the closure lands with "my name stops being a maze and becomes a direction."

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the covenant ritual, with clear cost ("oil when oil was spare, and hours when hours were kinder than coin"). The accumulative structure coheres as mathematical patterns guide discovery, though the middle section could tighten slightly. Who/where/when anchored early through "ancient babylonian palace reimagined as an observatory."

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration achieved through Rell's acceptance of the broken pin as compass, reweighting his resentment into breath. The sanctuary's rule of "shifting grace" creates consistent world logic where reality bends to emotional need, culminating in visible cost as Rell "returns the unspent years to the floor." Slight deduction for mild orientation delay (sanctuary's nature clarified gradually) though this serves the dreamlike texture.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught imagery (mirrors, frost, breathing) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the dream settles "as into a hammock" with visible cost in the "loosening like shoulders after hard labor." The closure transforms capture into care through accumulated sensory pressure. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of the "runaway dream" early on, though this pays off through concrete manifestation.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the deciduous vow ritual restores the orchard's natural cycle, with the daughter's ribbon literally tied into the solution—a visible cost that charges the final image. The accumulative build through pruning/grafting/bell-ringing creates density that reweights the opening decay. "Call it accidental wisdom, the kind that fixes you while fixing wood" crystallizes the transformation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the curator understands his true role is "to curate the between" after discovering his aunt archived herself into the orchard. The accumulative structure coheres through the cameo's transformation from blank inheritance to active portal, with clear cost: accepting that "the orchard would claim them in return." The nonlinear inheritance concept drives both plot mechanics and thematic resolution, though some middle passages could tighten their causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the library opens and transforms into a space where "might-have-beens" can be studied, with clear cost in accepting error without exile. The accumulative structure coheres through pattern recognition (gaps, omissions, missing entries) that builds to the revelation. Orientation anchors establish the mountain bookstore setting early, though the time traveler's role could be clearer. The piece teaches its lyric logic of following absences and delivers on that promise.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure - the protagonist releases their ledger and plants the empty jar, accepting transformation with visible cost. The emerald card's transformation from pigment to permission to compass shows clear progression. Minor opacity in early spatial anchoring (ship's geography unclear) prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as absence patterns intensify through rope braiding, seal impression, and doorway manifestations, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the ledger's reunion rewrites history with clear cost—a lost generation of research recovered but requiring perpetual vigilance. The orientation anchors (archivist, clock tower, mysterious door) establish by line 3, and the closure lands with "bridges are only doors that learned to stay."

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered sensory detail building to the bloom of hush as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with clear cost—the physical effort of creating the bloom and the ongoing commitment to "keep tending" it. The piece teaches its pattern early through the echo chamber stone's function and pays it off when the hush creates "rooms to pass through like weathered guests."

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the beacon's rekindling transforms the protagonist from isolated custodian to community anchor, with clear cost (solitude traded for belonging). The accumulative lens holds as details layer—star paths, the shard's silence, Lio's arrival—building to "we rekindled more than light; we rekindled the grammar of belonging." Who/where/when anchored early through "beacon-tower custodian" and "ravaged saltlands."

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator transforms from passive archivist to active participant, with visible cost in risking their own vulnerable memory. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the crystallizing moment where "collective memory had room for my own edge."

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently as the narrator collects silences that culminate in sharing gilded hush with the father, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where both characters' understanding of safety transforms with felt cost ("fear cannot corner the ones who enter"). The monthly gravity inversion provides coherent world-logic that enables the journey without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the storm glass's crystallization patterns, the progression from noise to hush, and the mathematician's gradual unclenching. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when "motion now is kin to rest," with visible cost in the operator's memory of the singer's suicide and the mathematician accepting air holding her "without hands." The recursive structure (opening and closing with the train whistle's echo) reinforces the textural accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the empty throne as "nobly empty" while establishing seasonal stewardship fundamentally reweights the premise with clear cost (century of potential silence risked). The accumulative/textural lens holds as details build toward the final image of "unrealized futures turning into seeds." Orientation anchors clearly by line 3. The cost of deferring singular power for distributed governance is felt in the "duet rather than throne" compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure: the girl crossing "unescorted" without looking back crystallizes the narrator's teaching success with visible cost (solitude refilled).

Slight opacity in the middle teaching sequence prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the literal crystallization of pressure into diamonds, reweighting the opening metaphor. The accumulative structure coheres as parallel-self texts guide transformation. Cost is visible in "let the vow cut you before it cuts the crop" and the narrator's acceptance of responsibility. Minor orientation friction with the abstract "concepts become physical" season slightly dulls early clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where ash-letters reveal the dynasty's deliberate self-dissolution transforms shame into purpose. The accumulative structure coheres as sonic resonance literally manifests ancestral wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation through theater metaphors, alchemical imagery, and the final kernel choice that crystallizes into "possibility settle into him like a homecoming." The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration where he chooses one future and releases others, with visible cost in abandoning his armor and warrior identity. Slight weakness in the middle where causality loosens around how exactly the orchard "answers" him.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout with dust patterns building toward the Resonant Reconfiguration where the archivist transforms from passive recorder to active preserver, creating "bridges, not perfect, but spanning where footsteps feared water." Cost is legible in the emotional weight of documenting lives that end at "emancipation, a door thrown open onto darkness we pretend is sky."

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative/textural structure builds through puddle reflections, lagoon ripples, and moth swarms toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara becomes "the hinge" between erased voices and the museum's false histories. The cost is legible in lines like "the world keeps the shape of what it resists" and her acceptance of anonymity. Minor orientation wobble with the temporal jump from "that afternoon" to "now" around line 11, but the closure lands powerfully with her coded freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where "the oath holds" crystallizes the protagonist's successful maintenance of cosmic balance through musical intervention, with clear cost (isolation, daily burden, loss of teacher).

Orientation anchors (grotto, morning, saxophonist) establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator realizes their role is continuous receptivity rather than mastery. The cost is legible: eternal apprenticeship to the arbor's wisdom. The phrase "Emerges transformed always" serves as the pivotal discovery that reweights all prior sorting and monument-building. Orientation is clear by ~100 words with who (seed sorter), where (skyborne arbor), when (the hush).

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural design with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the protagonist transforms from precision-seeker to flow-embracer with visible cost (lost workshop, new uncertainty).

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the kintsugi-repaired self accepting incompleteness - "I am not healed, but I am held together." The accumulative lens holds as metallurgical processes mirror emotional repair. Cost is visible in accepting permanent damage. Slight deduction for density that occasionally obscures immediate causality.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong closure through Resonant Reconfiguration when the woman's laughter braids with the river and she passes through "a clearing I could not enter," showing clear cost in the narrator's necessary separation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist transforms from instrument to "wood again," with the pewter strap marking a boundary and the forest internalized. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward this reconfiguration. Cost is visible in the "wall the function cannot cross" and the commitment to carry this knowledge to others still "turning screws."

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through market description, lens revelation, and painting examination to reach a Resonant Reconfiguration where naming the child transforms the painting from drowning in anonymity to gaining substance. The cost is visible ("the price of the dusk became irrelevant") and the accumulative lens holds throughout. Slight deduction for the abstract "eternal instant" concept that doesn't fully integrate with the concrete naming action.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the mainspring's unwinding releases trapped time/debt, with visible cost in "the ceiling answered with a softness of release."

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as frost patterns, whispers, and printing accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator accepts wobble over perfection, with the mother-memory circle as crystallized cost. The closure lands with "all awakenings must rustle, or else drown" as the new orchard law, though the middle section's causality between printing and library's response could be more explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure where covering mirrors during storms allows the shard's song to strengthen, building to council vindication—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (the shard cracking, revolutionary failure remaining). The drive lens holds consistently through pattern accumulation. Orientation anchors (asteroid, excavation, rival theories) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure: the narrator trades their shadow to restore light, establishing a new covenant of listening rather than ownership. The cost is visceral—the shadow steps away "like a careful apprentice"—and the final image of shared vigilance ("Together we keep the city singing") resonates with earned transformation. Causality holds as each confession and truth-telling builds toward the binding agreement.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator achieves "hinged awakening" through accepting love over explanation, with visible emotional cost ("walk home lighter, hinged awake").

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens coheres as sensory details and craft metaphors build toward the Resonant Reconfiguration of the archway transformed into "a door through." The slide's revelation of "timewoven alliances" reweights the narrator's solitary journey into collective work across time. Cost is visible in the storm's physical toll and the choice to remain "perpetually learning" rather than achieving mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through layered discoveries—postcards, cathedral glass, scent patterns—toward the grandmother's final postcard that reframes the entire journey as inheritance and continuation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as beach arrangements accumulate into revelation, with the diary warming and lagoon darkening as pattern indicators. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration when the city "speaks, a music that was always there," with cost visible in the officials facing signatures and the protagonist remaining "half-retrocognitively trapped." The encrypted diary discovery pays off through stenograph punches that bloom into suppressed testimony.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the amber bottle's "faint ticking" signals collective life beginning without wishes, with visible cost in the labor and arguments.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Decisive Change lands through the narrator's choice to break the archival pattern, with visible cost in the unrecorded prophecy that would have prevented the orchard's destruction. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and memories layer toward the final renunciation, though some middle passages drift into pure description.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully when Return settles into the oak acorn cap "like a hearth," transforming the narrator from waiting keeper to active participant in seasonal inheritance. The cost is legible in "I will be keeper as long as the pattern holds, and when it loosens, I will teach the next pair of hands"—accepting both responsibility and eventual release.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the bell choice over sirens literally alters the storm's path ("the corridor faltered, split, and sidled away"). The splice holding becomes metaphor for trust and repair. Cost is visible in the risk taken against "budget audits" that "favor blaring decisiveness." The accumulative structure coheres well with sensory details building toward the transformative bell-pulling.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through "flourishing stillness again, not empty, but full of spared collision" - the station and narrator enter mutual recognition with felt cost (vulnerability exposed to ice and meteors). The accumulative structure coheres as sensory details (copper smell, yellow light, meteor streaks) build toward the final crystallization. Cost is legible in "I told the sky I was afraid" and the meteors' respectful withdrawal.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases toward the queen's arrival, where the recluse's acceptance of heat into the archive constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost.

Orientation anchors clearly by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator recovers the lost memory of learning to count by tremor with their mother, reweighting all prior time-keeping attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the boy's loss transforms into "ribbonless yet tethered to a new listening." The cost is visible in what's surrendered (the kite) and what's gained (attention to incompletion). The accumulative structure coheres through the central metaphor of "woven dawns" - beauty found in fragments. Slight deduction for the middle section's pacing where the teaching moment extends without sufficient pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear accumulative/textural structure builds through copper wire tuning, architectural secrets revealed as relationships, and community integration, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where death becomes "returning to the woven map we had made."

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through sensory layers (bronze quiet, amber, orange and rust) toward a Conceptual Repricing where "home is a rate constant, not a place." The cost is felt through the narrator's transformation from skeptic to participant, though the exact mechanism of the "makeshift reaction" remains somewhat opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images of seed-planting, bird-reading, and dead-language speaking that culminate in "the battlefield unlaces under green."

Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—the final communication reweights distance as "not a wall but a lens" with visible emotional cost in the separation. The story teaches its pattern early (preserved objects holding messages) and pays it off through the relay activation. Slight deduction for the convenient placement of the relay tower, though it's adequately foreshadowed.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered time perception building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist creates "a true north of devotion to what persists."

Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the closure transforms confusion into navigational method with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with chess piece swaps building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "wrongness poured out as starlings leaving a barn" and weather returns to normal.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as footstep-words accumulate into a communal archive, with closure showing the narrator's transformation from victim to nomadic witness. The final image of traveling "with the nomadic penumbra, following where small gestures shine" reconfigures the opening's "luminous absence" with clear cost (leaving behind stability). Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, though the conceptual density occasionally obscures immediate causality.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where home transforms from place to practice, with the cost of confronting buried shame made visible. The piece teaches its lyric logic early through "ivy made of pages" and maintains coherent pressure through the seer's substitutions. The closure lands with "I spoke my first true hello, and the mountain answered," showing earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation through the tapestry unwinding that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration—the village's gradual awakening paired with the narrator's beginning to forgive themselves. The cost is felt through memories of the burned kingdom and the deliberate choice of the "longer method" over the "brilliant sacrifice."

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost - each person surrenders "a single hue from a memory" and the artist pays twice. The accumulative structure coheres as poetry sessions build to collective action, with the child's "Split twice becomes many" crystallizing the new payment system. The lyric compression serves the piece well, though early orientation could be slightly clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure: the engine's activation doesn't resurrect Mira but gives "the pattern of her choosing," transforming grief into understanding with clear emotional cost ("It does not give me her"). The accumulative structure coheres through repeated imagery (bells, ribs, gold seams) that reweight at the ending, and orientation anchors (workshop, acid sea, alchemist) establish by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist adds "a single curve" to the cave's natural paintings, then backs away to let it "breathe without me."

The accumulative lens holds as patterns of reflection/reality build toward this crystallized moment of keeping the promise through release rather than capture.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the piece builds density through sensory layers and metaphorical patterns that culminate in the freighter's successful passage—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the captain's "quiet salute" validates the whisper method. Cost appears in the narrator's patient endurance against doubt. However, the orientation remains slightly diffuse early on, and the exact mechanics of how scent guides ships stays metaphorical rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: "Reverse migration is never over; it is a tide that keeps time with absence." The closure reweights the opening's wounded station into a system for navigating loss, with clear cost in accepting Mara's permanent absence while maintaining connection. The accumulative structure coheres well, though one middle transition ("Night dons its hammered blue") creates brief spatial uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong Accumulative structure building toward Earned Stasis—the narrator accepts their role as truth-teller and keeper-holder despite the storms. The patrol scene provides genuine pressure that tests this stance. Cost is visible in "the orchard steadied a little, its injuries sighted but endured." Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the keeper's act of signaling transforms the stranger's death from meaningless to witnessed, with clear emotional cost in "what is rescued does not need a shrine, only a witness."

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the queen merges with her stone self, accepting dreams as part of identity rather than mystery to solve. The accumulative structure coheres through recurring images (bleeding starlight, moths/flames, threads) that reweight at the ending. Cost is legible in the choice between throne and self-knowledge ("I cannot serve it as a ghost of unasked questions").

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the final image of "returning differently" crystallizes their transformed relationship with palpable cost ("so the presence we caught can keep catching us"). The accumulative lens holds as density builds through the spiral metaphor and repeated returns. However, the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually implied.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks that reweight meaning—the grave discovery, dream chronicling, and final acceptance form a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator chooses forward motion despite chronological confusion. Cost is unmistakable: "the day I died" and continuing to patrol "after my own funeral" shows the price of this acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when "We are three" arrives with water and laughter sounds, reweighting the entire repair as birth-work. The accumulative lens holds through water imagery and breath patterns. Cost is felt through the father's vulnerability and the irreplaceable screw given away. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the protagonist drinking the dissolved rune-letters, achieving integration of past wounds "as warmth slowly." The accumulative structure coheres under sustained ritual pressure, though the cost could be more viscerally felt beyond the burning lungs.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through perfume releases, stylus writing, and sensory layering that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator plays the "imperfect miracle" nocturne. Cost is visible in exposing the foreman ("names and numbers, money trails") to save the orchard. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 ("gossip-column exorcist"), though the ghost-communication mechanism strains credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly: narrator shifts from ending/judging to becoming "a hinge" that unifies "outbreath of what had been with the inbreath of what would be." Cost is legible in the surrendered certainty and accepted role. The accumulative structure coheres through spiral walking, dictionary consultation, and breath metaphors building to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands when the narrator realizes they shepherd "edges...thresholds" rather than time itself, reweighting all prior measurement actions. The piece teaches its accumulative pattern early through water/breath/measurement repetitions, building density toward the crystallized understanding that "we were exactly placed at the edge of what came next." Cost is felt through the blood offering and the acceptance of imprecision.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through Mara's interactions with the farm until the final recognition that "what begins as vigilance can become hospitality." The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where she achieves self-knowledge "neither harder nor softer, simply more true" with the emotional cost of accepting Kian's absence paid throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as details accrue toward the resonant reconfiguration where she accepts contradictions as bridges rather than rifts. The closure lands with emotional cost ("grief smell green") and the bus scene crystallizes her changed stance. However, the middle section with the lantern discovery feels slightly convenient, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara transforms from maintaining separation to facilitating connection, with visible cost in her letting "endings learn" to become beginnings. The accumulative structure coheres through repeated patterns (weekly calls, glass disc rituals) that reweight at closure. Deduction for slightly abstract resolution that could land with more concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear accumulative/textural lens with density increasing toward the reunion that serves as Resonant Reconfiguration—the covenant regenerates through accumulated proximate causes rather than decree. Cost is visible in the careful distance they maintain ("without touching yet") and the weight of what was lost. The orientation anchors (jetty, twilight, archivist role) establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the station transforms from disused to "a ledger of kindness disguised as light." The moon rock's journey from ritual object to child's pocket and the narrator's received map of favors crystallize options with felt cost. Orientation anchors early ("disused railway station") and the closure lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully: "The stillpoint is not escape but axis, a consent to pivot without erasing the radius." The cost is unmistakable—the protagonist accepts carrying their full grief-map rather than finding erasure. The accumulative lens holds throughout as sensory details build toward this crystallized understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the seed shipment's retroactive authorization—a concrete manifestation of "editing history" that reweights the opening's failed farming. The accumulative pattern builds from listening to translating to editing, with cost visible in "months ago" dating that implies foreclosed alternatives. The recursive structure of bowls affecting bowls pays off, though the mechanism of how pen-work creates shipments could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Arin's method transforms from harbor experiment to city practice, with clear cost in the line "When no one remembers you, song remembers you." The accumulative structure coheres well through pattern-teaching of mapping gestures. Slight dock for the advisor's ontological status remaining deliberately vague.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as artistic clues build toward the revelation of hidden names and the punctuation seeds that write the city's vow. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration when seeds sprout filaments linking all elements into "a single living sentence," with clear cost in the narrator's transformation ("wholly undone"). The persistent constraint of protecting readers while preserving memory shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira awakens carrying both their memories and the donors' fragments, accepting rather than untangling them. The cost is explicit: "We would not return to before." The accumulative lens holds as drumming patterns build to breach the treatment's boundaries.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory detail and pattern ("steel carries murmurs like rivers"). The closure—Ivo's successful retrieval proving his method—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration where quiet expertise triumphs over loud authority, with the cost being Rade's surrendered dominance. The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3, and causality holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator receives the dental mirror as a tool "when speaking failed," crystallizing their transformation from seeking to learning how to help others. The cost is felt through the brother's "refusing the old pull" and the narrator's voice returning "like floodwater." The accumulative pattern of light-weaving builds coherently to this earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where the town's slowed pace represents earned change with felt cost ("decisions need a longer cradle than a clock"). The synchronized window displays create causal pressure that builds to the grotto scene's deliberate stalemates, teaching patience through action. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly (library, chess coach, evening setting), and the final image of "listening until the future answers with a slower voice than fear" lands with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist's self-naming stabilizes the island and transforms their relationship to community, with visible cost of surrendering protective identity. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until line 3 to fully anchor the protagonist's role.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens builds through repetition of performance, turbines, and dried flowers toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "something finally did not" work—a crystallized resistance with clear cost (surveillance risk). The progression from morning performance to evening whittling to teaching children creates coherent pressure. Slight dock for the inspector's too-easy satisfaction undermining stakes momentarily.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where boundaries dissolve "responsibly" as the group moves from atrium to lake. The cost is palpable in the guard's tears and badge surrender, and the final "fertile" certainty that "keeps humming" crystallizes the transformation with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the plant-language system building density toward Ivo's awakening that "beauty in imperfection is a rhythm." The reed tongue transforms his perception from seeking color names to understanding "edges of things breathe and the spaces between them sing," creating a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (his best brush and jarred smoke). The phoenix-as-cycle frames both opening and closing, creating coherent pressure through the market of "bartered awakenings."

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through bell stations toward the "connection is not a bridge but a braid" reconfiguration, with visible cost in the volunteer's grief transformation. The lens coheres well through sensory layering. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until line 5 to establish the narrator's role clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the narrator's transformation from private grief to communal healing, with visible cost in the commitment to "be here as long as the curtains lift." The accumulative lens holds as density builds from personal loss through shared rituals to the final image of the singing lily. Orientation anchors clearly (observatory, after Devin's death), though some middle passages drift toward reflection without sufficient present-frame pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the final client seeking her scattered bandmates—the story reframes from fortune-telling to "finding the chorus that will let her sing alone," with visible cost in the faded wristbands and chipped buttons. The accumulative structure coheres through repeated measurement acts that build toward this reweighting of isolation/connection.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure where density increases through the archive's transformations, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator emerges "altered" with new teaching methods. The cost is legible in accepting to "carry the atoms of nostalgia like lantern seeds, igniting only when hurt asks for light." Who/where/when anchored early through "lost civilization archive" and "saffron-veil historian."

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mira trades her unlived life for Ilen's wholeness, with the library accepting this bargain and inscribing her name in the sky. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building texture toward this exchange. Cost is unmistakable in "the half-lit room where she had stored the life she did not live."

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds through layered metaphors of healing/amputation that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration where removing what "refuses to heal" applies equally to the chameleon's tail and the shelter's false promises. The cost is legible in "I would reconstruct trust not with grand bargains, but with small nocturnes" and the final image of waiting "until the mist thinned and the stars tired of listening."

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the protagonist plants ivy in the fossilized coffee ring, transforming grief into growth with visible cost ("Take back what you can... teach me to read it in living scars"). The accumulative structure coheres through coffee ring imagery that deepens from trembling cups to fossil memory to planted future, with the displaced miracle's cost legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks and density increases that reweight the dominant stake—unused love as active, waiting presence rather than void. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she writes "stay, because what I mean is do not leave," transforming goodbye into invitation with clear emotional cost. The warehouse metaphor constrains choices throughout, and the final marking of the shelf shows visible price paid for self-recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, building from personal gift/curse through cosmic methodology to concrete artistic liberation. The sculptor's transformation constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("weeps as if a knot inside her unwinds"). The ending's expansion to city-wide healing and the narrator's continued role creates Charged Poise. Minor orientation wobble with the archway's physical/metaphysical nature slightly dulls precision.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from frozen stasis to germination through textural layering. The closure—spores taking root and spreading—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost ("Dreams do not visit me"). The archive's transformation from "occasionally everywhere" to settled presence tracks clearly through wave-function logic.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with the gear's placement creating a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the translocation from curse to curriculum. The notebooks discovery provides concrete proof of the protagonist's own design, making the acceptance of displacement a true cost. Early orientation is deliberately elusive but pays off when the mechanical forest's grammar resolves into legible maps.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as protagonist accepts courage "light as breath and heavy as love" with the skiff nesting in their chest—a decisive internal shift with felt cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through ridge traversal and courage materializing. Orientation anchors established early ("After the leash breaks, the tide slackens").

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image where "silence remained, it no longer asked us to forgive it" - showing transformation with felt cost. The accumulative structure coheres well, building from injury to understanding to negotiated resistance. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation and some opacity around the exact nature of the "unpardonable silence" system.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered revelations until Serane's identity dissolves. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as she withdraws her claim "like a blade reversed," with visible cost in her tears and the court's lost coronation. The rune of drift's temporal mechanics and the library's breathing quality establish consistent world rules that enable rather than resolve the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure where the tapping rhythm accumulates meaning until it reveals the corridor's pattern, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration when the community assembles to follow the breathing path. The cost is visible: daily lantern resetting, acceptance of impermanence ("nothing assembled stays assembled if it cannot move"). Orientation anchors clearly by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara transforms personal search into collective wayfinding, with cost visible in risking exposure. The accumulative structure coheres through the hum motif building from tremor to full activation. Orientation anchors clearly (abandoned spaceport, post-rebellion lull). Deduction for slightly abstract final line about "courage to ask a machine the right question."

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from reed whispers → kite discovery → decoding → unsealing → transformation, with clear Decisive Change when the seedling becomes community infrastructure. The cost lands viscerally: "the council arrived to argue, but the new trunk already held a scaffold of walkways." Slight deduction for compressed middle beats that could use more breathing room.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through repeated trauma triggers (vent fans, helicopter, photograph) until Rafi achieves Earned Stasis—continuing his work while holding trauma differently. The closure lands with felt cost when he folds the photograph "the paper new only in the way his hands now held it," though the extended backstory exposition weakens causality in places.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara becomes the keeper. The closure lands with visible cost ("I will keep the light tonight, and I will keep the faces that come to it"). Threading the cards to fix the wick provides causal linkage. Orientation anchors establish lighthouse library early.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator dissolves into absence, breaking the metronome's counting - a visible cost that reweights the opening's "silhouette that refuses to darken." The accumulative lens holds as ephemeral patterns build toward this dissolution, though the algorithm/hunger reveal strains clarity momentarily.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—the city "woke strangely rested" with subtle behavioral changes rather than revolution. The letter's release through dormant networks creates visible cost (the archivist's uncertain future) and reweights the opening's "breathless echoes" into active punctuation. Orientation anchors (library, archivist role, frozen stacks) establish cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the piece builds through repetition of roses, teaching, and transformation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where violence transforms to cultivation. The father's letter provides closure with visible cost—his exile and the narrator's continued work as "hinge soundless with use." Orientation anchors solidly by line 3 with setting and context clear.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator releases the coastline map back to the tide - "Give it back, she breathed, and I knew she meant not hoard but hold in a way that keeps opening." The accumulative lens holds throughout with pattern-building toward this moment. Cost is felt through the narrator having to surrender control of the coastline's restoration rather than possess it.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the lens reopening and "daylight pours like warm inquiry," paying visible cost through the protagonist's board call and systemic change. The accumulative structure builds through observatory ascent, discovery, proof, and transformation. Slight weakness in the journalist's disappearance thread which doesn't fully resolve causally.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Earned Stasis—the protagonist chooses to stay and listen "until the dissonance finally unmade itself," with cost visible in "I am not forgiven, not yet." The accumulative lens holds as sound/translation imagery builds to closure. Deduction for delayed orientation (we don't clearly understand the narrator's profession and setting until several paragraphs in).

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through ritual layers to a Resonant Reconfiguration where "the emergent hush rode home in breathing." The cost is visible in the bearded man's emotional "landslide" and the collective vulnerability of "staying messy." Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught renaming ritual that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the fire-feeders accept new names tied to reparative work. The cost is visible in "sullen" men kneeling and the crowd's "breath...like a warm coat of frost." Orientation anchors established early (plaza, post-fire, narrator's role), and the closure lands with "the work begins to move them."

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure - the mutual promise to "finish letting go together" crystallizes their shared role as caretakers of memory with visible emotional cost. The fractured timeline concept drives the central tension consistently. Minor deduction for slightly abstract handling of the "fractured timeline" mechanics which could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when they successfully access buried memories through their devised somatic method, with visible emotional cost ("her brother's last words," "my father's map"). The accumulative structure coheres through repeated imagery (muscovite, light paths, somatic markers). Slight opacity in the telepathy pill's exact function prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the narrator's partnership with the cave through the fossil exchange creates "trust earned by exchange." The orientation anchors (post-hibernation world, coastal caves, sensory mapping role) establish by ~100 words. The cost is visible in leaving the fossil as "resident not carried" and accepting the cave's terms rather than imposing human ownership.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the warehouse transforms from prison to "road" with clear cost—the prophecy becoming "clay, quick between the fingers of everyone." The accumulative lens holds as density builds through button-cataloging to communal liberation. Orientation anchors solidly (hourglass turner, amber warehouse, cliff setting). The transformation from counting to offering lands with felt communal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands with Ansel slipping the ring on and understanding "courage could be practiced, not spent" - a legitimate Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (releasing the microfilm, accepting return to dangerous work). The accumulative structure coheres well, though the middle section's boot/cane/fingertip code system feels slightly mechanical against the otherwise lyric texture.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens governs as imagery and ritual actions build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the map-stitching transforms both characters' relationship to their burdens. The closure lands with felt cost as "the palimpsest promise settle[s] like a cloak, not erasing, but warming the scars." Opening orientation is deliberately atmospheric but anchors the coachman, river crossing, and waiting stance adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with density increase and pattern breaks that reweight the dominant stake of understanding why places resist change. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the potter's realization that "someone keeps choosing the same steady tenderness" with visible cost in her solitary departure. The fractured timeline device through the lantern glass creates coherent pressure without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator transforms from passive grief to active light-bearing, with felt cost in the mother's countdown and father's memory. The pattern of light/dark imagery accumulates meaningfully toward "protected vulnerability" as both architecture and stance, though the transition from fire escape to harbor could anchor more clearly at ~400 words.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Charged Poise: the narrator crystallizes their role as one who holds doors "kindly" rather than closed, with the cost felt in their acceptance of perpetual mediation between extinction and presence. The accumulative lens holds as images (sundial blade, stone hum, fossil voices) layer into this final configuration. The storm sequence provides the one meaningful deepening as the narrator must actively steady the library.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure with clear anchoring (lotus temple, after rain) and a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the lovers "rejoin the city, arm by arm." The installation serves as effective causality, though the cost could be more visceral—we sense emotional stakes but don't feel the full weight of what the year's silence cost them.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with subsonic frequencies as the persistent constraint shaping tactics throughout. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the narrator's active resistance creating breathing space for the community, with cost visible in refusing the trickster's offers. The orientation anchors (midnight shift, university radio, election season) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the final telescope revelation reweights the entire spatial mutiny concept—from antagonist to fellow sufferer. The accumulative structure coheres through organ/geometry/key progression with clear cost (risking Council censure by wearing the artifact). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3. The lens holds throughout without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the final painting that reweights the evidence—the blue ribbon fragment reveals not Mara's presence but her absence/exchange. The cost manifests conceptually in the letter-writer's confession of bringing Mara "to the edge," though the exact nature of harm remains purposefully elided. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer toward meaning rather than causal resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal structure with the copper nail serving as both symbolic inheritance and functional key that reverses the exile system. The closure lands with visible cost—exiles returning, system changing—though the resolution feels slightly rushed. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details ("wet bread," "dripping anemometers") build toward the reversal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens dominates, with density increasing through glass fragment discovery, bridge encounter, and musical resolution that "sculpts possibility from the ashes of 'never'." Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the hitchhiker returns through the narrator's bridge-song, with cost visible in "trading himself" and the "ledger" signing "a receipt." The magical realism elements are taught early through "luminous disbelief" and scaffold arrows, though causality occasionally strains.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator discovers the tire rut "that entered and exited through the same gate" and understands the circular exchange of hunter/hunted. The accumulative structure builds through startup rise/fall toward this earned insight with visible cost (company failure, abandonment). Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where shared reading transforms both isolation and understanding—"through shared burdens we learned meaning." The pattern of variable stars as grammar builds coherently toward the revelation that decoding requires dialogue not solitude, with clear cost in abandoning solitary practice for collaborative witness.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure with clear closure: the confession thaws, truth emerges, and the orchard unspools with visible cost ("the way circles widen and stay calm after battle"). The expanding circles pattern teaches itself early and pays off through both literal searching and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from grafted isolation through scar-linking to maze navigation and covenant renegotiation. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when "the maze reconfigured, less a trap than a grammar" with visible cost in the cambium-sealed vow. Orientation anchors (cobalt glade, root-bound to maple) establish early. The "future arrives early" temporal concept maintains coherence throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the planting of "listening seeds" that reweight the narrator's role from destiny-trader to tender of meaning, with cost paid through scattering grandmother's stories. The accumulative structure coheres through recurring images (ash, bones, roots) that charge the final stance. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. Minor deduction for cost visibility—while conceptually present, the emotional price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative/textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—the narrator moves from insulating with facts to allowing memory its value, with professional risk as legible cost. The piece teaches its pattern of applause/echo/memory early and pays it off through the final valuation decision. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the quarry setting's relationship to past concerts.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through ritual actions (reading tablets, adjusting nodes, planting seed) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator accepts companionship with transition rather than mastery. The cost is legible in "the vacuum that remains" and the foreclosed path of calling the spirit back, with the seed's sprouting and arbor's renewed harmony confirming the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the librarian's cyclical "keep, keep, keep" accepts perpetual change with visible cost (the endless labor of cataloging dissolution). The accumulative lens holds throughout, building through tidal imagery toward the final image of pages turning like tides. Minor orientation wobble with "after tomorrow disappears" but it serves the fluid temporal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered confessions that reweight the dominant stake of isolation vs. communion. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully when the pearl's placement transforms the bunker from isolation chamber to communion space, with clear cost in the inspector's career pivot ("mistaken safety for solitude and called it a career").

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as bathroom graffiti coordinates lead to physical stations of grief, each location deepening the narrator's understanding of complicity. The Resonant Reconfiguration arrives when the narrator stops asking the river to mirror himself—a clear before/after with felt cost in accepting the brother's death resulted from professional hubris. "River does what it was asked to do" transforms from verdict to instruction through accumulated site visits.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered imagery (watch cipher, mist currents, blank books). The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the protagonist becomes a messenger bridging two letters, with visible cost in returning the first to fire and accepting delayed echo. The cyclically reversed time pattern teaches early and pays off when the watch "ticked backward twice and forward once," opening the corridor.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change closure where Ilya plays the violin, letting it dissolve rather than preserving it for the museum, with visible cost (losing payment, defying empire). The accumulative/textural lens holds throughout with pattern breaks and density increases building to the dissolution. Orientation anchors (observatory, midsummer, noon deadline) establish stakes early and the "promise to keep" throughline maintains causality.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with the aurora's variations, static patterns, and ritual gestures building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist captures her mentor's final essence. The cost is felt through "Let them meet themselves kindly, then let them go" - the mentor's voice teaching even in death, forcing the protagonist to accept loss while preserving wisdom. The "seed to be planted" creates visible future consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost: "To find the source of contentment, I saw now, was not to capture it, but to tend what carries it moving forward." The hairpin's sacrifice and the narrator's acceptance of caretaker role show clear before/after with emotional price. The accumulative lens holds as imagery densifies toward this reweighting of the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure when Lark chooses the third path—returning money while naming officials and arguing for taxes she opposed. The hollow mirror shard as payment creates conceptual repricing of conscience work. Cost is visible through political risk and the "cloak of doubt" settling as "weather report that warns without panicking."

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story operates as an Accumulative/Textural piece that builds through the pond ritual, trance sequence, and final understanding. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator accepts vanishing as "a gift of space," with visible cost shown through the village transformation sequence. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early through the floating platform and grotto's magnetic pull, paying off these elements in the final reconfiguration of understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through bird patterns, bone resonance, and the wandering pulse building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where stillness enables travel ("Hold still, and the world will carry you"). The cost is legible in leaving behind the stones and accepting emptiness ("a lesson coiled around nothing"), with the wandering pulse "less alone for having been heard" marking genuine change.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the protagonist releases ownership and accepts the role of "apprentice forever," with visible cost in renouncing possession of the keystone. The accumulative lens holds throughout with pattern-taught repetition of "lingering luminance" and "accommodates impossibilities." Orientation anchors (mage, stairs, spire) established early.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure: the protagonist surfaces "wet with a vow and a color," having internalized the library's lesson about "standing still while moving." The cost manifests as binding commitment ("It was not magic, but it was binding") with the final image reweighting the lanterns as "the very notes I had heard."

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    The backwards prophecy structure creates coherent accumulative pressure, with the dome's transformation and corridor opening serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration. Cost is felt through the surrender to reversed causality ("matter following the memo"). However, the conceptual density occasionally obscures immediate stakes, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where naming transforms both the reaper's role and Miren's unresolved fear into "Shoreless." The cost is legible in "felt no triumph, only a new corridor of work opening." The accumulative lens holds as density builds through layered recordings, crystallizing fears, and the final harbor image that reweights the opening heartbreak.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through dripping rates that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Efan's mathematical ceremony partially restores cosmic balance. The "silver ripple returned" provides visible cost acknowledgment - only an echo restored, not the original. Causality holds through accumulated observations leading to the ceremonial adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands through communal story-sharing that transforms the town from ruins to "something living," with clear cost (defying bureau's neutralization order). The accumulative structure coheres as photographs lead to memory recovery and collective action. Orientation anchors effectively by line 2. Slight opacity around the temporal markers ("after a wind chime falls silent" recurring) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through starling patterns, crystal placement, and sensory layering until the orchard's transformation crystallizes as Resonant Reconfiguration. Cost is visible in Iri's deliberate restraint of formulas and the sealing away of the reliquary. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and pays off with "fruit that grew like thoughts." Slight deduction for cost being more conceptual than visceral at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the final nod exchange that reframes debt and trust with visible emotional cost ("weight on my ribs loosens, not fully gone, but carried better"). The accumulative texture coheres as patterns of watching, falling, and trust crystallize in the landing sequence. Orientation anchors clearly by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where joint custody becomes the only viable solution, with cost visible in "They did not cheer, and neither did I." The accumulative structure coheres through complementary opposites pattern. Who/where/when anchors establish by ~100 words ("floating rock dojo," "that week").

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward Charged Poise—Mara crystallizing her stance to steward the mysterious gift against commercial pressures. Cost is visible in the "trickle" of profit she accepts and the confrontation she anticipates. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (the escape room context emerges gradually) and the closure relying heavily on conceptual rather than dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates as Accumulative/Textural, building through sensory layers (tunnel echoes, machine harmonics, children's squeals) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where laughter returns as "foundational, a slight uplift in the floorboards." The closure lands with felt cost—grief tips his hat but keeps his seat warm—though the causality between the conductor's ritual and the house's response remains somewhat elliptical.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the closure achieving Resonant Reconfiguration through the narrator's transformation from dimensional exile to one who carries "thresholds like books, and books like thresholds." The cost is legible in "The day is thinner for a breath, but it holds" - showing the weight of interiorizing the garden. Who/where/when anchors establish early through "frozen garden in mist" and "feral library guardian."

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure - the narrator walks "with the care of someone who has begun to live" after breaking free from the bishop's calculus. The accumulative structure coheres through ritual progression: emptying, packing, burning, breaking the crozier. Cost is visible in the burnt palm and the destroyed relic. Minor deduction for slightly abstract framing of the "gate" opening.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through pattern accumulation ("stopped naming...stopped fearing") toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the city learns to "keep time with what it let go," with visible cost in the grandmother's instruction to "listen without keeping." The closure lands with the engineer's note crystallizing the narrator's role, though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually implied.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through surreal maritime imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "Farewells became arrivals, and arrivals did not vanish." The cost is legible in accepting the tide's undertow and the line "breath steadies after grief learns its rhythm," though the magical mechanics of pattern-alignment could be more causally grounded. The orientation anchors (ferry, deckhand, dawn departures) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the architect's realization that he's "mapping the city through temporary allegiance" and the curator's insight about habits as internal artifacts. The cost appears in his debt to failed passages and the ephemeral nature of his work—"no artifacts, only habits." However, the accumulative structure occasionally obscures precise stakes in middle sections, particularly the "anger erupting quietly" beat that doesn't clearly connect to surrounding material.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through layered images of edges, rays, and unfolded horizons until the aliens' return triggers a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator "knew then how to teach them all." The cost lands in "I bowed with my palms open in the dim"—accepting their underwater prison while finding stellar navigation through pressure marks. Orientation anchors immediately (benthic city, navigation instructor) and the pattern of edge geometry constrains tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where "incidental heroism, nothing I intended" crystallizes the premise that connection matters more than solving. The twist that the man is the actual caller reweights the entire investigation. Cost is visible in "grief redialed his sleep" and the years of loss. Slight opacity around the child's exact nature prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through leaving the gold fleck—"The machine had enough of me and more of them"—with visible cost after honoring the dead. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details and phase transitions build toward this moment of release. Minor orientation delay (cave location) doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through radio static clearing, ink patterns, and porcelain shard handling toward earned acceptance. The closure lands with visible cost ("courage to continue anyway") and the recurring heartbeat counting frames both opening and ending. The orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the ghost's transformation pays off the established pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (birds scattering, canyon resisting) that reweight the dominant stake. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—the narrator accepts permanent residence to tend the echo-school, with the cost of their travel-name paid on-page. The because/therefore linkage from offering the name to receiving the language's full testimony is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through cryptid phenomena until the narrator accepts the keeper role—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("we let the garden metamorphose our bitterness"). The arrowhead's transformation from tooth to seed to sprouting root provides causal linkage, and the descent/return structure creates clear before/after, though some middle transitions feel compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase and pattern breaks building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the orchard "began to reawaken itself" and statues root "not in command but in choice." Cost is visible in the risk of being sealed by the statues ("If I failed, the statues would lock") and the protagonist's sustained tension throughout. The closure lands with both transformation and felt consequence as even the city's machines "hesitated as if embarrassed by their perfect timing."

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece successfully builds through pattern (absences, promises, deliveries) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist understands delivery as "linking holes" rather than filling them. The orientation anchors (mailman, disputed territory, checkpoints) establish clearly by line 3. The cost manifests in the boy's transformed posture and breath. Deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the storm's cataloging sequence, though it pays off thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration: the train transforms from "drowsy serpent" to wearing "the day," with the misting hush evolving from pooled breath to "shone like a vow kept." The carpenter's singing catalyzes material change (carousel turning, lamps lighting) with felt cost—his silence broken. The "wrong turn" discovery of the oasis provides causal linkage that enables the restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when "Tonight I have not found the place where stories live, but I have seen its weather" - reweighting the quest from destination to process. The hyperbolic geometry path pays off through snow falling as letters and the library counting back in waves. Slight deduction for the middle section's abstract wandering ("distribution of endings") before grounding returns.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator releases the dream and reconceptualizes their role from hunter to guide, with cost visible in letting go of the pursuit. The accumulative structure coheres through the photography/light-painting motif that transforms from capture to passage. Slight opacity in the middle "cipher" section prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator's ability to sing transforms from imprisoned to freed, with clear cost paid through vulnerability and risk. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently through pattern breaks and density increases culminating in the mother's return as "idea." The journey from locked door to freed voice tracks causally through each beat.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens coheres through pattern accumulation ("broken constellations," recurring apple imagery, ledger motif) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist writes grandmother's name "a third time, my correction, stubborn as salt"—accepting partial recovery rather than full restoration. The confession about loving work more than relationship crystallizes the cost, and "crisp nostalgia sharpened the day" signals earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the council grants the stay - the library's worth is repriced through accumulated demonstration rather than argument. The cost appears in "reluctant faith" and the child hearing "themselves returning, not suddenly brave, but mentored into resilience." However, the council's transformation feels slightly underearned given the story's brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural structure coheres through pattern-taught metaphor (pruning as memory-keeping) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the seed's planting crystallizes the "weaving between worlds" concept with felt cost—the child's promise and changed perception. The orientation anchors (waterfall parapet, orchard, valley) establish by ~100 words. Closure lands with the child tasting future transformation, though the conceptual cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silence literally accumulates through the needle's work, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where "the hush changed weight, no longer interlaced with panic but with choosing to stay." Cost is visible in the transformation from restless to grounded spirits. The orientation anchors (prism sanctuary, mask restorer, under starlight) establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative structure coheres as video evidence, physical exploration, and community gathering build toward reopening the chapel. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with "a wound is also a seam where one thing meets another," reweighting the torn map. Cost appears in the community's careful reverence and the verger's exhaustion, though the emotional price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered maritime disasters toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator's ascent with the snow globe crystallizes the physics of letting go—"some artifacts need a second chance at weather." The cost is legible in "I had time for air and sorrow," though the conceptual weight could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught encoding system that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the city's body begins "to pulse in a rhythm more like living." The ghost's needs translate into concrete civic actions (opening vents, sharing water) with visible cost in the narrator becoming "less a singer than a hinge, opening what hurt." Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator arranges the letters "warmly inquisitive, curious without trespass" and leaves the diary open—a decisive stance that reweights the ascent from assignment to sacred duty. The accumulative structure coheres through the ten-floor progression, each revealing deeper layers of Mirek's true mission. Cost is legible in accepting custodianship of "absences folded small."

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through "spooled wholeness gathers our wandering hours," with visible cost in the drifting period and emotional vulnerability of the narrator's method. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through layered cloud emotions. Deduction for the somewhat abrupt appearance of the rescue lights without sufficient pressure buildup in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the mural holds its dawn while the building falls, with visible cost in the destruction around the preserved tree. The accumulative structure builds through layered discovery (coin → atlas → pigments → mural) with clear causality. The orientation anchors (tree library, demolition countdown) establish stakes immediately. Minor deduction for slightly delayed specificity about the protagonist's exact task.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where the apprentice's pattern recognition releases trapped light, transforming both the physical situation and their role aboard ship. The figure-eight navigation pays off the hopscotch/navigation parallel established throughout, with clear cost in the risk taken ("fingertip of trust") and the physical transformation experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the locksmith understanding "the library had repaired him as much as he had repaired it, a trade of attentions across time." The accumulative structure coheres through recurring water/time imagery, and cost is visible in his acceptance that he can only borrow, never own, this rhythm of repair.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where isolated survivors become "a bridge of bodies and stories and shared hunger," with visible cost in their exhaustion and vulnerability. The accumulative structure coheres well—bell patterns, chalk messages, and rescue orchestration build toward collective transformation. Orientation anchors (orchard planet, floating arches, harvest work) establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the final sung lullaby that ripples outward, with visible cost shown through the soldier setting down his rifle and the minister holding a stranger's hand. The accumulative structure coheres around the lighthouse-as-doomsday-clock metaphor, though the exact mechanics of the "hush pane" and its relationship to global events remains somewhat opaque, preventing full causality clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the final image of hours coiling "graceless and beautiful" while "the cliffs hold their breath" crystallizes the narrator's earned stasis with visible cost. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early through impressions without touching and pays it off when guiding the travelers using this same method.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration through the Braiding polymer design that transforms past harm into future healing. The chrysalis serves as a physical anchor for transformation, and the cost is visible in accepting lawsuits, scorn, and uncertain reconciliation with sister/mentor. The ending's "first unbroken day" crystallizes the shift from fragmentation to wholeness with earned emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the vendor obtains the comma-seed, transforming their role from seller to keeper of beginnings. The "by quantifying absence" method creates coherent causality, and cost is visible in offering "my ledger of returned regrets" and "the quiver of my own unfinishedness." Slight opacity around the exact mechanics of entry prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the keeper stands taller, memory "subsumed into a body that could bear it without bleeding." The accumulative lens holds through sensory layering and pattern breaks. Cost is visible but could be more visceral at the exact closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through community transformation from isolation to connection, with the cuckoo clock weight literally and symbolically enabling the first bridge. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as language patterns, physical bridges, and choral elements layer toward the "town, once siloed, cradles itself in a chorus" closure. The cost feels more conceptual than visceral—effort and time rather than sacrifice—which prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates as Accumulative/Textural, building density through layered memories and canyon resonances toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the narrator accepts a new role. Cost is visible in the mirror breaking "a final time" and the narrator feeling "no panic, only a wider field of view," though the transformation could be more viscerally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the narrator returns transformed, carrying "safes reopened in my ribs" - a clear before/after with felt cost. The accumulative structure coheres as each grotto element builds toward the final image of the city discovering how to listen. The gravity inversion provides a clean temporal container. Slight deduction for orientation taking until line 4 to fully anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from silence to pulse to shared breath, with the porcelain insulator transforming from "mute larynx" to promise.

Slight weakness in the elders' covenant explanation feeling expository.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator signs "with my name and Anya's," accepting inheritance with its implicit costs. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building from silence collection through diary opening to continuation of the archive. The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3, and causality tracks cleanly from workshop preparation through resonance technique to earned opening.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where accepting the corpse flower's stink stabilizes the swaying bridges—a clear before/after with felt communal cost. The accumulative structure coheres well through sensory layering. Slight deduction for the abstract "turning of the tide's thought" which delays concrete temporal anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the spindle reveals resilience as "not a wall, but a music that gathers, bends, and carries us home" - conceptually repricing the quest's object. The accumulative lens holds throughout with water/echo patterns building to this crystallization. Cost is visible in the transformation required ("the season unknots its shoulders").

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal closure where the narrator's survey work directly enables the helicopter's safe landing, with visible cost in the crashed relief craft and failing hospital generator. The accumulative lens holds as wind pattern documentation builds toward the decisive corridor adjustment. The "singular convergence" concept pays off through the dust devil's precise timing at the helipad, though the child's arrival could be better motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "the hush remained unfettered" creates Earned Stasis. The sculpted hush transforms from concept to "common air, a standard by which noise could be measured" with visible cost in the city's altered geometry. Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the protagonist successfully mends the seam "with enough humility" after understanding their prior shortcuts and pride. The cost is visible in the empty market that "paid in emptiness" and the penance of patient weaving.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise as the narrator sets "a salvaged future tense" while accepting the sky's vanishing stars, with visible cost in their smallest signature and the fragment left to "drink in the vanished light." The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the couple's transformation and the narrator's self-confession, though the orientation anchors take slightly too long to fully crystallize (the observatory relationship clarifies late).

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from delivery routine through ritual communion to earned understanding of the courier's true purpose. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the protagonist accepts both their mentor's absence and their role as continuance-planter. The "corridor" sequence where widow and lost man overlap provides clear emotional cost. Slight deduction for the conceptual heaviness in the final third that borders on explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly when Mara accepts her grief through the frost's revelation, with cost visible in "the bleak relief of someone finally believing her own weather." The accumulative structure coheres through frost patterns, prism colors, and the arbor's amplification, though the mechanics of how objects "absorb emotions" could be more precisely dramatized rather than asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the fabric becomes wind on brother's face and "he knew he had been held," with clear cost in Kio's thinning.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    The accumulative structure coheres well with the "bartered awakenings" payoff creating genuine transformation. Cost is visible when Iven trades his memories ("names of his parents and the dog") for steadiness, and the closure lands with the bells ringing in "azure defiance." However, the middle section's pacing occasionally stalls with exposition about the silk's properties.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the narrator discovers they redirected the evacuation as a child, accepts this truth's weight, and transforms it into "routes others can survive." The cost is palpable—mother's protective silence, the weight "heavy metal and rain," and the responsibility of mapping paths for survivors. The accumulative structure coheres through sensory anchoring and parallel universe mechanics that pay off in the revelation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of safety as "candle smoke, salt, and softened paper in hands," reweighting the anonymous letter chain from mere communication to embodied community care.

The accumulative lens holds consistently, though some middle passages drift toward exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the piece builds density through repeated lighthouse imagery and storm dialogue, culminating in "our headline will always be weathered joy." The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the child's arrival and the narrator's shift from solitary keeper to teacher, with cost visible in accepting this "stubborn crown." However, the orientation remains somewhat abstract - we never fully anchor in concrete physical space or clear temporal progression.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the narrator accepts their role as story keeper, standing in liminal space where "attention itself were a narrow stair carved into the air." The accumulative lens holds as details about light, the wing, and story magnetism layer toward this final understanding. Cost is legible in the discipline required—"teaching apprentices to weigh silence as carefully as pigment"—though the middle section's customer interactions could tighten causally.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through dream dust measurement, sextant healing, and tree witnessing that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist can "finally hear the register of their quiet." The discovery of archived tags and their translation creates genuine transformation with visible cost (the labyrinth's years of accumulated sorrow). Orientation anchors (tower, labyrinth worker, night) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the piece builds through layered actions (gathering lullabies, threading voices, weaving dawn) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where "we rekindle a dying realm by letting it swaddle itself in what it feared to lose," with visible cost in shared scars and surrendered grip. The orientation anchors who/where/when adequately ("alchemical orchard greenhouse," "mirror world"), and the closure image of mutual drinking creates reciprocal transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost: "We did not reconcile into old shapes, because books rarely return to uncreased spines."

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the community's collective opening of the vault reconfigures the city's relationship to truth with visible cost ("The room filled with shy rain"). The accumulative structure builds coherently through discovered maps, archived conversations, and final collective action, with the "Pluviary of Spoken Things" crystallizing the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the Keepers depart carrying "only a new slowness in their steps" after experiencing truth through resonance rather than documentation. Cost is legible in their abandoned claim and transformed pace. The piece teaches its pattern early through bell-tuning as metaphor for attention, though the transition to the Keepers' arrival could be slightly smoother.

The closure lands with the mailbox becoming an "open library" and the community's new dawn practice. Orientation anchored effectively by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient resolution mechanism of the hairpin matching exact rhythms.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the "knot deciding it had been a bow all along" with liberation of trapped names achieved. Cost is visible in the drowned engineer's fate and the risk taken. Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by line 3. Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "liberated voices" crossing the web—the mechanism could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure: the narrator understands their work "keeps a path through change" while accepting that memories live in objects rather than minds.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—the prophecy's code untying "like wet shoelaces" and the valley's transformation show visible cost and change. The piece teaches its pattern early ("smoothed hush," "terrestrially cosmic shimmer") and pays off through density shifts. Orientation anchors solidly by line 3. Deduction for slight abstraction in how exactly "mapping silence" mechanically works to dissolve the code.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)

However, the transformation feels slightly orchestrated in its completeness.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal lens holds: discovery of shredded documents leads to reconstruction, which reveals the resonator's true function, enabling practical calibration that saves the orchard. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the narrator transforms "curse for calibration," with visible cost in the company's "Liability exceeds projected goodwill." The pattern of investigation→revelation→implementation creates clear because/therefore linkage throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently as fragmented messages accumulate into the prophet-pattern, with closure landing as Resonant Reconfiguration when seeds scatter into lightning and allegiances lock. Cost is visible in the town's embarrassment at "miracles in work boots" and the transformation from variant to unified allegiance. The prophet as "pattern wriggling in barometers" that measures "hunger as direction" provides conceptual repricing of both weather and revolution.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Jonah accepts the repaired heart's rhythm as a map for earned steps. The accumulative structure coheres through the repair metaphor extending to human transformation. Cost is visible in Jonah's "braced for failure" becoming acceptance "without asking for mercy." Slight deduction for the cost being more implied than dramatically contested.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught kaleidoscope translations building toward the bell's resonant activation—a Conceptual Repricing where "some bells ring in readiness so the future has a north."

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the final image of stars as "bright bones of the sky, set just so that we could heal" reweights the entire narrative through the bone-setting metaphor. The cost is palpable—Ari's erosion by shame, the drowned child, the community's need for resolution through a false body. The accumulative texture coheres powerfully, though one instance of unclear causality (why exactly Ari placed the substitute body) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through glass polishing that builds to Resonant Reconfiguration when the garland transforms the village atmosphere. The closure lands with felt cost as "faces brighten without glare, and hands unclench." Who/where/when anchored early through grotto setting and tide markers.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration achieved: the pianist's encore delays the train schedule, creating "a rare and grateful patience" that reweights his relationship to clockwork fate. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward this cadence shift. Cost is visible in the delayed train and the risk taken. Slight deduction for the surreal arbor sequence which, while purposeful, creates some causal opacity in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the planted seed transforms into a tree that sorts myth from memory, with the island awakening itself.

    Orientation is immediate (after the flood, in a broken greenhouse, with Mara), and the accumulative/textural lens is taught and held. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she commits to a modest, ongoing practice and a new algorithmic ethic, accepting continuing mess (“gutters would clog again”). Cost is the renunciation of drama and acceptance of ongoing labor and limitation. The throughline coheres without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image-density builds to a Charged Poise closure—an annealed plan that forecloses other paths. Orientation is clear from the opening (canyon, night, aftermath), and each move (ledger → frost → rival → plan) coheres. Cost is legible on the page (“He’ll claim I forged it” vs. “truth unfixed”); the chosen tactic binds her to the canyon and dawn. The persistent constraint of frost/dawn and the canyon’s acoustics shapes the final option set.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene layers system, audience, and gesture until a charged poise ending (“click I do not hear still satisfies,” “permission to continue”). Closure lands with cost tied to the hush and the capsized past, reweighted by the present translation. Orientation is strong early (who/where/condition of silence), and the backstory shard clearly feeds present tactics (algorithm rewrite). Slight softness: present-tense tension could tighten one more notch before release.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure coheres through recurring signals, tools, and cadence toward a reconfigured beacon (“SOS” to “SOR”). Orientation is strong from the package to the library; one clean scene shift. Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (choosing staying over rescue, accepting miscall risk). A slightly abstract external cost (the storm risk never bites) keeps it shy of 9.2+.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, held throughout. Pressure coheres from secrecy and scarcity to the patrol’s stop under the arbor, then deepens into tightened tactics and the charged final reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: breath-image interplay deepens until a resonant reconfiguration lands (“the glass itself becomes a door,” “I decant”). Orientation is taught early (twilight viaduct, camera obscura) and never slips. Closure carries cost—she releases hoarded love, changing her future options—and the final cadence (“feeling the viaduct breathe easier”) pays the pattern. The constraints and ritual (box, parapet, breath, tear) coherently chain beats.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressing the shard intensifies geometry, pages of air flip, descent underwater, then the ring/path reweights stakes. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with explicit cost—“accept that the present is a continual photograph fading”—and a reconfigured tool (shard to ring) that lays the final path. Orientation is clear enough from the first lines; pattern is taught and paid off. The price and before/after are legible in the last two beats.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal spine: breach noise → infiltration → decoding → vault retrieval → evasive tactics → distribution.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal links; moves stack from bouquet → path → hidden room → mentor’s failed negatives → moonbeam reanimation. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/RR: the craft reinterprets from taking to returning, with the mentor’s debt reframed. Orientation is strong from the first lines and the pattern is taught and kept. Cost is primarily conceptual/ethical rather than materially painful, but felt via the mentor’s near‑erasure and the protagonist’s renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the melt, kiln brightening, and crafted vessels steadily reweight the stake. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: he sets the bookmark at “care and risk,” plans a gathering, and chooses to hold the room. Constraints (dead grid, fuel dependence, cold) shape tactics and the final image. Cost is on the page (“arms shook,” limited fuel), and the before/after is legible without a forced decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a Hybrid lens, causal beats are tight: decode cast → open box → roof meeting → mutual acknowledgment → plan. Orientation is clear from the first lines (library at midnight, narrator’s role), and the puzzle mechanics pay off without loose ends. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they choose to tell the truth and reclaim/return credits, with cost implied by debts and exposure. The seashell’s assist borders on convenience but doesn’t undercut the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of listening-as-mapping and tightens around the one-star clock; closure lands as a charged handoff (he goes with the booklet; she stays to finish and carves the stones). Cost is on the page in bodily sacrifice and separation, and the storm/star constraints persist through the end. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and no causal breaks undermine the cadence turn.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: loops accrete meaning, notes stack, and the generator’s failure deepens hush toward a charged poise. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when).

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: the maze’s elegant objection and the fountain confrontation create the decisive tightening; confession reconfigures options, leading to the garden’s acceptance. Closure lands: the exchanged nods, steady dials, and unlatched gate crystallize a before/after with visible cost and reweighted agency. Orientation is clean early (garden, dials, maze, persona). Causal links hold without contradiction: deception → maze censure → confession → partial absolution → earned equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens with a causal spine: missing mantas → probe/lever → lattice → inversion → return → markers for proof. Orientation is clear early; each move follows because/therefore logic, with the lever and gantry constraining options. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: rescue accomplished and meaning reweighted by the intimate proof and its kept secret. The cost is quiet (surge loosened, the concealment, the peril of the nexus) but on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid with an accumulative dominant lens: pattern recognition (ink, light, reflection) escalates into a concrete ritual that alters the world state. Orientation is crisp from the start (flooded opera house, pit) and causality holds through lantern alignment → score of rests → stepping on reflections → baton. Closure lands on‑page with cost: obeying the “rests” choreography under threat of drowning, culminating in reconfigured house. No stray rule changes; each mechanic is seeded and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritualized acts (smudge, balance test, scale) build to a charged poise where speaking reweights the stake. Orientation is swift and sure (mountain weather station; caretaker; oracle) and the storm clock coheres. Closure lands on the page with cost—“name it” beside the ticking scale while the storm arrives—and reconfigures meaning (shared truth lightens). No causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid with accumulative dominance: pattern-density and cadence culminate in a decisive act (closing, then reopening the valve) that reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing—he accepts “normal means” with weight and turns off the radio. Causality holds: mapping panic to hum leads to the tunnel; turning the wheel produces pressure and knowledge. Cost is on the page via renunciation of the ghost-narrative and acceptance of a heavier, ungilded truth.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: pressure accrues via flood, bricked niche, and the obsidian room’s discovery toward an Earned Stasis. Orientation is early and stable (catacomb library, river, swan). Closure lands as a resonant recommitment to witnessing tethered by “regenerative silence,” with conceptual cost (renouncing judgment, living with decay). The causal threads are soft but coherent for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural build is clean: eclipse cadence structures the scene, stories deepen stakes, then the decisive linking of locket to guitar culminates in totality. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the grief is honored, not solved, and “wondering as love” reweights prior beats. Orientation is crisp from the outset; no causality breaks. Tactics are consistently shaped by the eclipse’s timing and the therapist’s approach.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (tapestry, diaries, brass disk) accrue toward a conceptual repricing—dreams unseated, rooms woke, he becomes the listener of last resort. Orientation is strong from the opening and supports closure. The ending lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he returns the disk to the dark, whispers to the axis, and commits to “teach the walls to speak,” with the cost of ongoing porousness implied. The final near‑pulse in the silo reweights prior images without mechanical explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: envelope → decision to repurpose specs → lighthouse projection → town-wide repricing of “open secrets.” Orientation lands early (island/harbor/night) and the two-shard movement to the lighthouse is legible. Closure is a conceptual repricing/charged poise that lands on the page (“You already know” lighting the town), with a felt social cost. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural with causal spine and holds through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through patterned silence and rhetoric until a cadence shift enables the unthreading. Closure lands on-page: Mara reclaims her name; the possession evaporates; the street subtly reorients—an RR with conceptual cost (ending a bargain born of grief). Orientation is clear from the opening, and set-ups (looped absence, palette) pay off. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but legible through the “deal” foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly from the first pane of glass to the thawed close. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: fortunes reframed as breath instructions and the “first movement” completed before exhaustion, with cost in renunciation and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the rain‑seeded procedure teaches a pattern, escalates into the middle‑arch alignment, and resolves via Earned Stasis. Causality is coherent within the world‑rules (tablet warms → puddles rearrange → pathway → message → descent). Closure has on‑page cost (forgoing flight, erasing the tablet’s seed) and reconfigures the initial premise. Orientation is clear early (viaduct after rain; tablet), with one continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to the reverse‑unspooling to the needle’s repair and the hush’s redefinition. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration: stitching the filament into the needle turns absence into compass and reweights the premise. Cost is implied and felt (frost rubbed from ribs; admitting she’d already stopped), not spelled out, but sufficient at this length. Orientation is clean within the first lines (who, where, when) and the single scene coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid lens (Situational dominant with Accumulative texture): the pressure of the follower + rogue “care” coheres and culminates in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—lateral withdrawal, decoys left, real data dispatched. Orientation is clean from the first lines (courtyard at dusk, followed home), and every setup pays off (bench, charts, pigeon, arch). Cost is legible: the narrator foregoes direct challenge for a risked, lonelier integrity and potential surveillance consequences. Final cadence reconfigures options: work continues under a different social contract (“where laws still breathe”).

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Structure is clean under an accumulative/textural lens with causal hinges: lamp request → UV revelation of the etched “amberhorn” → decision to open the vial → flower opens → tears archived. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: the vial reweights from trap to compass and the protagonist’s stance toward memory measurably shifts. Orientation is swift and steady; the single-scene pressure holds. The archive action supplies concrete consequence, preventing a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned details intensify to a closure pivot where the past is repriced and integrated (rope to mirror, vow, final road-constellations). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost—abandoning a heroic self-myth for accountable mercy. Orientation is clear early (grotto, starlight, energy beings); single scene coherence never wavers. The prison-of-clocks vision is a decisive deepening that reweights options rather than a late rule change.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through image and ritual until the group decides to “visit the halves and the almosts,” and the bowl’s contents “draw a map.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—the community assumes ongoing obligations; the artist enshrines incompletion as practice. Orientation is crisp by ~120 words (who/where/when). The final cadence (“song that refuses to be done”) reweights the premise without tying off too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the scent ritual, static “braille,” and Rhea’s herd account densify toward a Charged Poise/RR ending. Closure lands on the page: transfer of the petal, the spark, her steadied eyes, and the narrator’s quiet renunciation (“charged her little… wrote down nothing”). Cost is subtle but present: he remains apart as she integrates. Orientation is clean from line one.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats build from misaddressed envelope to Ledger to public naming, culminating in shared custodianship and a charged promise. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s attention has been retuned, and Mara/Jun accept an ongoing cost of stewardship. Orientation is clean early (harbor, open‑air library, night librarian). The tightening is gentle rather than stark, but the final image reweights the premise with a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the listening walk accrues signals to a posture discovery, communal mirroring, and a vow to tend the arbor. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the posture reframes “tag” and the protagonist dedicates practice; the cost persists (“not healed… ache… meant for many hands”). Orientation is swift and stable; set‑ups (obsidian arbor, shards, permission) pay off in the final build. The beat‑to‑beat causality is associative rather than linear, but coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterning of cadence → interruption → oval → larvae → bells → reseal. Closure lands on the page with cost (bells counting debts, seconds tugged back), and options are reweighted (chooses not to hold the moment open). Orientation is clear by ~120 words (who/where/goal), and the rules are learned through action. No causality breaks or late rule patches.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene accrues objects and patterns until the theorem and tethered eyes reweight his loss. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who, where, when). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he accepts uncertainty, leaves the eyes, and pockets the rope’s end—cost is the renunciation of reunion for coherent carrying. No causality breaks; the stalactite, ticking drips, and mosaic all pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning accumulative/causal: outage lowers the world’s noise, enabling the tape to guide him; therefore he locates the notebook and chooses unseen service. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—he forecloses direct visibility to preserve his method, with cost acknowledged on the page. Orientation is clean from the outset (library at dawn, outage, ducts). No dropped setups; the tape’s “release” at “Mother, I found it” provides a decisive cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm‑driven pressure accrues across days and images toward a reweighted practice of care. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing—the vow to “reconstruct only what grows kinder” charges the final image and reframes prior arranging as harm. Costs are on‑page: social pressure to advise, material disorder, and the seduction of fixing “buttoned, polished, persuasive.” Orientation is clean from the opening and remains coherent despite temporal glides.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive (causal + accumulative) holds: brooch discovery → keeper recognition → return to seam → apparition → exchange → pact → aftermath. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and decisive act: releasing the gnat and making the pact with a felt price. Orientation is clean early (island, post–water wars, painter/lighthouse keeper). A small convenience—apparition’s timely arrival—fits the story’s taught magical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: rising musical density and pattern shifts culminate in the pearl choosing the pilgrim and a reweighted final image. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the guide’s role is inverted; cost is the loss of ordained authority. Orientation is crisp from the outset (musical crystal cave, pilgrim with map), and set‑ups (unseen forces, listening map) pay off. Causal threads are lyrical rather than mechanical but coherent within the taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: absences become “channels navigated,” the harbor acquires a practicable cadence, and the valve is redefined and released with a price (renouncing performance for structure). Orientation is clean early, and each patterned action (tapping, valve turns, pane tracing) coheres to the final cadence shift. The communal cost of no parade and the chosen practice over monument read on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid tilted Accumulative/Textural: images accrete toward a closure where the rules of the narrator’s mapping are re‑priced. Orientation is clear (midnight, square, depot) and the pattern is taught (arrows/punch/train) then paid off at the fortress. Closure is on‑page: offering tools, being refused as-is, then unbuttoning patterns—an earned reconfiguration with cost. Causal seams are lyric but coherent: dare → platform → mouth’s test → renunciation → reset.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns and motifs (tile, spirals, whales) densify until the midnight breach precipitates the “room” and a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; cause-effect accrues via disciplined attention rather than plot machinations. Closure lands on-page with cost when the narrator enters the room and speaks their own losses, reweighting skepticism. The final promise to keep the door open seals an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant lens: density builds through storm, prisms, and the corridor until a conceptual repricing lands (“goodbye… is the blueprint of the next room”). Orientation is clear early, and the scene holds single‑window integrity with one tightening passage (corridor and the payment). Cost is legible on the page—memories paid; Lio’s refusal transmuted—though not devastating. Setups (storm/amulet/prisms) pay off coherently in the final reconfiguration and revised contract of the curse.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal drive holds: the director’s habit with the bolt and the shift-change reset create the window; the dolly push, camera blink, and van handoff culminate in on‑page change. Closure lands with cost via the signed witness, the evidence transfer, and the cleaning of residual warmth. A hairline convenience (the director reliably leaves the bolt hanging) is seeded early and reads earned. The ending’s conceptual repricing (fairness as math, not miracle) is grounded by tangible consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds cleanly: lamp hum → refracted light → drafted “invented histories” → delivery to a silent town → freezing basin → recommitment. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise in the final switch‑flip: he persists, with cost in isolation and the lamp’s weakening. Orientation is early and firm; cost is felt if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: overheard whispers → mechanic’s info → targeted wait → widow confrontation. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he sets the label as a “small verdict” and exits, forcing her choice while accepting continued erasure. Cost is legible on the page (he remains nameless and exposed). Orientation is clean from the opening: docks, containers, death on paper.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held; actions compound toward a clean CR at the end. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when), and the pattern of sound → echo → figure → duet is legible. The closure lands on “kindness over certainty,” with conceptual cost implied; a hair more felt price would open the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain: fences appear → coded responses → liaison confrontation → trade → chip‑triggered realignment → cross‑spend success and delay. Orientation is strong from the opening image; the drive lens reads Hybrid with causal dominance at closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the city’s layout and alliances shift, buying time at a cost. The “only a season” line makes the price explicit on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the timed vials, creeping dawn, and moth’s emergence intensify toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is immediate and clean (moonlit summit, crater inspector, before the crews). The closure lands with cost on the page (extinction implied, hush > archive), and persistent constraints (solar wind killing electronics) shape tactics to the end. The because/therefore is tonal more than mechanical, but the cadence tightening is decisive and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with a causal spine: repair → calibration → first alignment → fog setback → adaptation (basin + code patch) → clean coupling and departure. Orientation is crisp from the first lines, single scene, single stake, and the closure lands on-page. Cost is felt as risk of failure within a live clock and persistent constraints (fog, blindness) shaping tactics. The final image reconfigures the charged pattern into quiet relief without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: condensation patterns → reeds → culvert → locker/valves → water’s convergence → quiet return. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator accepts the lesson that beginnings require future partings, deferring mapping until “tomorrow.” Cost is legible in the unease about naming/taming and the physical exposure; orientation is clear from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated footstep measures and object re‑entries build toward a communal cadence. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the town answers with feet; an ongoing practice replaces absence, with the cost of time/return plainly named. Orientation is clear early (archway, town, fork) and the throughline is clean from arrival to bell repair to communal accord. Minor: no hard turn, but the density shift (more bodies joining, bell speaking) functions as escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with causal dominance: each move (“stop,” unsnarl, place transmitter, vial as coupler, exhale tones) tightens options and produces the answer signal. Orientation is crisp from the first two lines (who/where/why) and maintained. Closure lands on‑page with cost: the signal takes and an answer thrums, but depth and dwindling air remain, charging the return swim. The persistent constraints (line drag, acoustics, air) shape all tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, held cleanly. Closure lands as Charged Poise: he places the lattice over the drain and commits to segmented truth as the boat arrives, with the hush guiding, not his old lie. Cost is legible: foreclosing silence or total confession to control consequence. Orientation is clear early (lighthouse prison, bodies not yet found), and the pattern taught (lattice/hush/lens) pays off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: lessons accrue through cameo teachings to a charged cadence shift (“six cold syllables,” saplings uncurl). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: bead hung in the doorway, ghost gone, vow kept, travelers altered by pause—cost is palpable. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and sustained. The trader’s knock provides a concrete decision that tightens options without breaking the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid with accumulative dominance: a ritual quest whose steps causally open sluices (“I press the plate… a chamber opens,” culminating in “hidden sluices open”). Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when) and the object/route/payoff chain is kept. Closure lands on the page with a communal before/after and a price (relinquishing the forbidden plate). Slight softness: obstacles resolve smoothly, so tightening is more textural than adversarial.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is clean within the first lines (who/where/why), and the accumulative/textural lens holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: aligning the sundial to the guide’s stele reweights time/home, culminating in the charged choice to remain. Costs are legible on the page (slowed excavation, foreclosing leaving), and motifs are paid off (gnomon absence → rebuild → elders' blessing). The sequence coheres without outliney “and then” beats.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chalk clues, arches, busker’s vibration, and past mark accrete to a Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clean from the first line; pattern is taught and paid off by the final wait at the slot. Closure carries cost via the deliberate delay and the burden of naming, reweighted by the discovery of the narrator’s own earlier mark. The options are reconfigured without a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density increases until the whisper hardens into speech and the “blame” verdict reweights the scene. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the final watch with the candle after accepting blame and letting the names stain the cloth. Orientation is strong from the outset (observatory, keeper, eternal candle), and causality within the lyric logic is consistent. Cost is on the page (“You will be blamed…,” blood on thread, names that won’t wash out).

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: song → fog-writing → reflection → injunction → practice → poised refusal. Closure is on-page as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she forecloses rushing a decision and commits to a different practice. Cost is legible in the scar/time-keeping wound and the relinquishment of the old “compass” of leaving. Orientation is clear early (skiff, mangroves, spirits) and serves the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through waiting, decoding, and the family’s arrival, resolving in a resonant reconfiguration when the room “unclenches.” Orientation is clean from the opening (atrium, anesthetic, role, stakes). Closure lands with cost through a charged poise rather than a decisive act—their small connection, enabled by the child’s “Also Us,” reweights the scene. The surgeon’s news avoids deus ex machina by not solving the core bridge, which has already begun.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: attempts → obstacle (fog‑bitten film) → tactic shift (crowd corrections) → final wreath loop and departure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: joy is re‑found communally, with a plan to “paint the gaps tomorrow.” The cost is subtle—yielding solitary authorship, accepting communal memory—but present. Orientation is clean from the opening; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear and sustained: sound → pigment awakening → voice → ethical decision. Orientation is crisp from the first line (who/where/when), and the pattern of “pause between question and reply” structures turns. Closure lands as an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration: she chooses a blended restoration, explicitly foreclosing total erasure for a charged compromise. The cost—departing from the curator’s “faithful” brief—registers conceptually and ethically in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with causal dominance: audits and permits threat → plan to exploit the public performance clause → staged garden‑text forces the collectors into complicity. Orientation is clean early (greenhouse, audit towers, drones; single POV). Closure lands on‑page via the officers stepping over “ENTER” and laughing, triggering the tax‑exempt loophole—an unmistakable decisive change with conceptual cost and risk. Minor elasticity in how quickly the legal clause works, but it holds within the story’s taught logic.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated lullabies and postcard work build to the fifth‑cycle opening, breath‑signed treaty, and the shell’s photosynthesis. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: choosing the treaty alters stance and climate inside while insomnia persists. Orientation is clear from the opening (inside a gargantuan shell; insomniac poet). Setups (postcard, lullabies, armistice) all pay off on the page without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the repaired chime is offered, the name threads down, and the final grace note licenses rest—after the vow not to fail again. Cost is emotional and vocational (the promise, the tremor of nearly‑lost sound), and the tightening is clear when the wind warns the sound is escaping “unless I hurry.” Orientation is clean from the outset; pattern holds through the cadence shift at the balcony and coda.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid lens with a causal spine: composing → summoning → testing → revising the coda; the closure lands as a collaborative reconfiguration with felt price. Orientation is clean by the first lines (who/where/when). The cost is legible in the new clauses (confess doubts, plan rescues) and the foreclosed path of mutual silence. The only hairline convenience is Lio’s shadow‑entrance, but it’s foreshadowed by the archive’s acoustics and the placed pages.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear causal flow: arrival → detection of imbalance → encrypted proof → hidden sluice → catenary solution → public stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a pact, a new protocol (“logged in song”), and tuned gates that alter the city’s future. Cost is present in the choice to protect lovers and accept accountability. Orientation is immediate and the drive lens (accumulative with causal spine) holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patterning of dust mapping, chip/scale, and slips thickens to a cadence shift when the attic must be cleared and a gust forces action. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she commits to trust, sends the choir, secures the latch, and hears the music return, with felt cost on the page. Orientation is clean from the opening line and never wobbles. The meteorite’s persistent constraint shapes tactics at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterning of codes→grain→seam→opening→choosing distance. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the narrator declines descent, reconfiguring “sacred thresholds,” with ache as cost. Orientation is taught early and feeds the ending’s logic. The chain of discoveries feels inevitable within the story’s rules.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues via time limit and ritual until a resonant reconfiguration lands. Closure is on‑page and earned: dawn “as password,” the city shifting from sentinel to host, and the narrator’s maps “know when to put the pencil down.” Cost registers as surrender to the city’s cadence and acceptance of non‑nativeness; the persistent constraint (sunrise/currents) shapes tactics throughout. Orientation is clean from the opening and all set‑ups (feather/key, exhale, algorithm) pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: listening → vision → reframe → reroute → letter → charged final image. Closure is a conceptual repricing: paths as caretakers, not cowards; the alternate route is an earned stasis with cost (detour, delay, communal adjustment). The stakes stay contained yet coherent; the deadline motif supports urgency without literal countdown. The cost is more ethical than bodily, but it lands on the page (“walk a footnote that becomes a poem”).

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tactics accrete (coins, chalk, bishop, light) until the janitor’s grief reframes the game and the return of the bishop crystallizes a charged poise. Closure lands in the on‑page exchange—“He pockets the bishop… then returns it”—with cost in acknowledged grief and the refusal of souvenir. Orientation is clear from the opening; the pattern is taught and paid off by the “rehearsal for luck” repriced as civic breath. Stakes resolve into an earned stasis: he resumes the act altered by the interlude’s truer work.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the verse accrues through dots and gaps until a charged poise ending (“exile tilt into vocation”). Closure lands with cost: illegality, ongoing risk, and a chosen identity that forecloses a safer path (“If patrols asked… I would say gardener”). Orientation is clean from the opening and pattern is taught early (negative space method). The ending’s reconfiguration is felt and legible without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned images (glass, pond rings, cranes) accrue into a Charged Poise closure where a specific plan emerges. Orientation is clear from the first lines (place, role, time) and the mid-story deepening occurs when the boy’s stone widens the pattern into “rescue what we nearly lost.” Closure lands with a concrete tactic (reuse ferry boards, etch tide map, mist as choir) reweighting prior stakes. Cost is implied (political, economic pushback) rather than enacted on-page, keeping this just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single scene, single POV, clean anchors by line two (moonlit ridge, firefighter, box). Accumulative/textural drive holds through the ritual of waiting → handoff → joint restoration → plan. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: grief voiced without apology and the box leaving them empty but reweighted. No causality breaks; the on‑page act of opening and repairing grounds the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the patterning intensifies, other selves accrue, and the gauge’s new steady angle provides on‑page closure (a Charged Poise/RR) that reweights options. Orientation is strong from the outset (grotto, tools, gauge), and the pressure coheres around calibrating hope post‑storm. The closing image (“gauge… poised like a held breath”) lands a before/after. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but it’s present in the acceptance of shared choreography over solitary mystique.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (diaries → negative → silhouette/child → letter) tighten toward a charged poise. Closure lands on‑page with cost as the narrator accepts legacy and promises return, mapping “future footfalls” while the tide lifts the house. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when). The final image reweights the premise without mechanical wrap‑up.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through ritual, cadence, and image density toward a reweighted final stance. Orientation is clean early (terrace after rain; search for the atelier); cause-and-effect within the lyric logic holds (find parapet → enter studio → learn coded songs → mirrors yield futures). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: a new method and stance yield altered options, with cost in humility and ongoing work. The bells’ entrance serves as paid-off temporal hinge rather than reset.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene with clear anchors (terrace, delegations, dusk to moonrise) and an accumulative/situational drive toward a Charged Poise closure. Ritual steps causally accrue (names, breathing, bowl of casings, facing the sea) to reweight options; cost lands in the provisional, ongoing nature of the agreements. The ending’s pledge and annual return make before/after legible without false finality. No orientation debt; lens holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual actions layer (tarp, map, tuning fork, speakers) toward a cadence shift where the chamber “drank the dust.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he trades matter for sound, accepting a charged poise as thunder and manufactured rain return. Orientation is clean from the first lines, and cost is on‑page (the egg’s irreversible loss). Setups (map, fork, drought‑chamber) all pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: unlocking the prism → bowl hums → grate opens → rethreading → city wakes; the patrol’s approach tightens the window. Closure lands with a decisive reconfiguration of the city’s speech, and the final image reweights the world’s rules. Cost is present as danger and a foreclosed path back to “gentle obedience,” though it remains more implied than paid. Orientation is solid from the outset; the accumulative motifs support a causal spine without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural held cleanly through closure. The decisive shift—offering the stick, adopting a rule that those who speak must hazard themselves—lands on the page with conceptual cost (ceding authorship, exposing glibness). Orientation is clear from the dome opening onward; the pressure coheres through to the charged, no‑applause ending. The woman’s entry is a precise tightening beat that converts intention into practice.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns accrete (reeds/pebbles/fern beats) toward a charged poise ending. Orientation is clean early (grotto above clouds; last monarch migration), and closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with cost—the choice to honor via transient signals and to wait. The hawk interruption and subsequent resumption reconfigure cadence without breaking coherence. Stakes resolve in a reweighted final image rather than a decisive act, and it reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: rope → skylight/aurora → horn → wax → bronze → bells, with each step tightening pattern and consequence. Orientation is clear early (icebound sanctum, aurora, furnace, rope) and persists. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the bells speaking names and the narrator choosing to remain, with exhaustion as on‑page cost. No causality breaks; persistent constraints (cold, rope mechanics, aurora) shape tactics and the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: storm pressure, dream‑method, wafer breach, recovered verb “to shepherd,” culminating in opening the door. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—directives “decay into invitations”—with the cost of leaving safety implied by weather and relinquishing algorithmic shelter. Orientation is strong early (who, where, when) and pattern is taught and kept. One decisive cadence shift (map steadies, door opens) delivers the before/after cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: a clear because/therefore chain (tile → schematic → arcs → alcove → urn → disk → map → vow) builds to Earned Stasis. Closure lands in the pledge to maintain the wires and arithmetic, with a tangible price. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). The pressure remains quiet but coherent and unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the hush, the shapeshifting corridors, and the mute box build to a resonant reconfiguration where Rell’s options are reweighted. Closure lands on the page: he leaves carrying the broken box, with belts “carry breath instead of blame,” a costed before/after. Orientation is taught early (soundless sanctuary, no weapons) and paid off (writing on slate, silence as rule). No causality breaks; pattern and payoff match.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure coheres through the ritual corridor and breath pattern, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration (teach holding, not trap). Stakes are anchored early and the final seam “bright as glass mountains” registers conceptual cost and relief. The strain (wobbling mirrors, fear of shatter) is on-page and paid off. Closure is quiet but decisive within this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from entry to ritual: mapping stress lines → improvising rite → bell/ribbon cutover → orchard shedding. Closure lands on‑page as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (cathedral “breathes on purpose,” narrator refuses the tin). Orientation is clear by ~100 words (cathedral/orchard, breach, mender POV), and all set‑ups (ribbon, bell, no choir) pay off. The decisive cadence shift arrives with the bell’s color‑taking and the falling “deciduous vows.”

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: bathroom vision → forbidden grove → lineage rule → cameo activation → ingestion → repricing of role. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with cost (“the orchard would claim them in return,” cameo impression left behind). Setups (rules, aunt, bathroom) pay off precisely. The causal seams remain legible despite lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive leaning accumulative/textural with reliable causal stepping stones: gaps research → apprentice rescue → ascent → ritual of kind failure → library opens. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Resonant Reconfiguration: redefining rescue and failure, with the diary’s seeds charging the final state. Costs are conceptual (forsaking correction, accepting fallibility) rather than concrete, but legible on the page. Orientation is clean early, and the pattern taught by the prose is kept through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern and cadence concentrate toward a real cost: the price of remembering equals losing the twin-discoverer self. Orientation is taught early (abandoned carnival ship in fog) and the motif-pattern (“As memories alter”) coheres rather than confuses. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: planting the empty jar, swatch over heart, compass toward a changed self. The cost is legible on the page in the relinquishment of the ledger and the acceptance of forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: absence → anomalous door → rope mechanics tested → ledger retrieved → seal‑ledger merge → door resolves. The stakes narrow as the doorway widens and he risks stepping through, then chooses threshold work instead. Closure lands on‑page with the merge and the wall’s return; cost is conceptual (choosing order over exploration) but present. Escalation is modest and could use one harder complication before the ledger merge.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the bloom of hush creates a shared “room,” the beings’ behavior changes, and the narrator marks the hinge on the map with the cost of continued tending. Orientation is clean from the first lines; the pattern of learning → planting → hush holds. The price is conceptual and ongoing rather than dramatic, but felt in “they do not leave; they learn where to be quiet” and the commitment to keep tending.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid with an accumulative end: patterning of hush/prism/star paths deepens into a cadence shift at rekindling and communal answer. Orientation is immediate and steady; causal logic of the fix is clean (missing constellation → hush as seam → insertion). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: light as belonging; the cost is felt but quiet (risk, surrender to meaning, the trimming/fit). Slight softness in explicit, low‑friction success keeps it just below top band.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of gathering others’ memories → intensifying self-doubt → lightning’s nonverbal sanction → decisive disclosure in the forecourt. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: risking personal imprint within a collective system, proven by the shadow covering the shoes and the quill’s new weight. Orientation is clear from the outset; single POV and scope are tight. The ending reweights the premise without mechanical tying-off.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: discovery of the mosaic note → tool cache → placements via wind and structure → hush → ignition → communal lift. Orientation is crisp from the first line (who/where/when) and the pattern is taught early. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “gravity loosened, not vanquished,” with the rag knot retied and options reweighted. Cost is felt in endurance, risk, and the earned cadence shift without a neat fix.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single scene, single stake, clean orientation, and the accumulative/textural lens is taught and held. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with visible conceptual cost: “Yes, I will go inland,” after foreseeing futures and naming passage. The cicada hinge recurs to charge the final beat, and price is acknowledged (risk to identity and coast). No causality gaps or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds a patterned tasting toward a charged reconfiguration in the shop. Closure lands on‑page as a resonant reconfiguration when the “gilded hush” softens the father’s plans and the two redraw entrances. Cost is legible via the risk of overexposure and the narrator’s fear of losing doors, which shape tactics. Two‑shard structure is clean, anchored early, and the gravity‑hour constraint coherently frames the action.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring pulses (train whistle → hush) pattern and then deepen toward a Charged Poise closure. Closure lands on the page when her shoulders loosen and “motion now is kin to rest,” reweighting transit with cost implied by grief and the singer anecdote. Orientation is clean from the outset; single scene coherence never wavers. Cost is subtle but legible in the relinquishing of control and the operator’s vigilant labor.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid lens leaning causal: rumor → waterfall → ruby key → mural method → hatch → inverted stair → throne → choice. Closure is an on‑page renunciation with a system‑offered compromise; the empty throne plus duet stewardship is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (foregoing singular sovereignty under time pressure). Orientation is clean from the first lines; stakes and deadline persist to dawn. Setups (ruby, murals, orchard) pay off precisely at the decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of return → invocation (ring) → student’s arrival → lesson → earned stasis with the unescorted crossing. Closure lands with cost (“breathed out names I had promised never to speak,” the hour of mercy, stepping aside). Orientation is clear early (sanctuary under starlight; the door without a house), and the single‑scene frame is tight. The final image reconfigures the premise without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative texture over a causal spine: gauges redden → parallel texts advise → bolt anchors → signing triggers outcome. Closure lands on-page as a Conceptual Repricing/Resonant Reconfiguration: “I sign… and open the feed,” paying the cost of personal accountability to realize the promise. Orientation is clear from the outset, and props/payoffs track cleanly. The vow’s cost and its survival into the final image (“kept a promise that kept me”) seal the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern teaches early (ritual objects, silence, resonance) and tightens toward a Conceptual Repricing: “Do not rebuild the throne… build bread ovens.” Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the gramophone/ash method escalates coherently from tone to words to a strategic map. Closure lands on the page with cost (foreclosing dynasty restoration, leaving the seal) and reweights prior material. The persistent constraint—speech withheld, truth arriving via resonance—shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cues, patterned movement, and image density tighten toward the kernel choice. Orientation lands early (who/where/when) and the program’s directions causally step him through the greenhouse. Closure is on-page with cost (“choose one shape and release the others”) and a decisive act. No causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern density escalates from dust readings to the button to the counselor’s “gentle italics,” culminating in the addendum and the envelope. Orientation is clear from the first lines (foster care file room, morning routine). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the unknown reweighted from “cavern” to “corridor,” with the cost of accepted uncertainty. Each step (dust → button → prints → addendum) coheres and tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative cadence: lyrical patterning builds to the hinge activation and the open circuit to the museum. Closure arrives as a charged poise/earned stasis: she keeps the hum, foregoes recognition, with the siren and secrecy as on‑page cost. Orientation is clear early (museum -> dusk walk -> lagoon), and the causal chain (key → box → program → captions sweating) holds. The price is more conceptual/social than physical, but legible and tied to the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Pressure coheres as condensation forms sentences and hungers “with more hunger than patience,” answered by adaptive musical tactics; the “second line” naming a loved city is the clear tightening. Closure lands in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: a visible ring of absence where the sentence would close, the oath sustained at cost. Stakes and constraint (fog window, listeners outside) remain active through the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Held under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the hush arrives, the first leaf’s legible message tightens the frame, instruction lands, and the narrator changes method—closure as Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and set-ups (dust speck, folklore, monuments) pay off. Cost is mostly conceptual and vocational (accepting a new burden of making futures tangible), but it’s on-page (mossed knees, delayed reach, labor). The cadence heightens toward the phrase “Emerges transformed always,” which reweights the prior pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid drive with causal spine and textural accumulation holds: compass → greenhouse → hatch → falls → hidden room → water clock → new stance. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration (adoption of a new practice and ethic), with the waterfall and compass as persistent constraints/tools. The cost is on-page (abandoning prior model of mastery, risk through the falls). Minor neatness in the final summarizing lines keeps it shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: repeated tests escalate toward the furnace ritual and alloy, culminating in a conceptual repricing of “weight” and redemption. Orientation is clear by sentence two (after the search party, foundry, officials), and causality is coherent within the mystical rules taught through action. Closure lands with cost: returning the coin “heavier without gaining mass,” accepting limits, and sealing the seam with both names. The throughline never fractures or resets.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds (harp → voices → woman’s fear → tooth → river) to a resonance shift where laughter braids upward and the narrator refuses entry. Closure is a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid with visible cost: he stands aside, leaves a string, moves on. Orientation is crisp from line one (who/where/when). No causality gaps; each beat coheres under the method and premise.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure builds via body‑honesty triggering forest equations, culminating in a boundary vow and offering the theorem. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the strap is knotted as a limit and the mission reframed with cost (“a forest inside me that refuses to be silent”). Orientation is clear from the opening; no causality breaks. The ending’s cost is legible in the body flare and renounced path.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: the lens and listening tactics intensify to a resonant reconfiguration as the name surfaces and alters the painting’s state. Orientation is crisp from the start (dusk, elevated market, translator’s aim); beats link coherently from lens placement to naming. Closure lands on-page with cost—the narrator pays in awakenings, refuses further intake, and the scene’s anonymity is permanently reweighted. The single-scene scope is tight and the final tied sailcloth functions as a before/after marker.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene coherence with clean anchors and a tight investigatory sequence culminating in an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing. The cadence shift at the backward wind releases the hush and ledger crossings, reweighting the world’s rule (time as currency) with felt cost. The causal spine (notice sag → discover barrel → choose to unwind) remains intact under an accumulative/textural lens. The final image (fluorescent dies for good; smile no longer flakes) signals after/Before without over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from frost‑script to rupture to the decisive print, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration with clear cost. Orientation and rules are taught early via the press’s function and the library’s buoyancy. The closure lands on the page (the printed circle, the stilling of clouds, the chosen law) with a visible before/after. No lens drift; causality and motif logic remain consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid drive (textural accumulation to a causal public test) is clear: shard discovery → method → public readings → council storm demo → vote. Closure is on‑page with cost: the archive is revised while the narrator remains “defunct,” and the shard cracks. The orientation is strong from the outset, and setups pay off (mirrors, storms, shard, Ledger’s opposition). The final act reconfigures the central question without tidy absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid lens leaning causal: entering the chamber → negotiation with rust → terms (tether + collateral) → payment → reconfigured city. Closure lands via decisive renunciation (shadow) with an ongoing constraint (“keep mending what isn’t torn”). Cost is on-page and shapes the final image (shadow laboring in rafters). Orientation is clean early, and setups (honesty, tuning box, chip) pay off without late rule-changes.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story escalates through pattern intensification (hinges, hush, jars, compass) into a resonant reconfiguration: acceptance of “failing properly” and a costly, ongoing grief. Orientation is clear early (factory shutdown → fissure → lagoon), and closure lands on the page with cost. The final actions (offering compass/boots; marking the ledge; pocketing “a jar of hush”) crystallize a before/after without neat explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues from storm → lantern projection → collaborative build → dawn gate. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a new gate exists and a vow reframes future journeys, with conceptual cost (renunciation of haste, commitment to patient joins). Orientation is strong early; causality is lyrical but coherent. Cost is felt though not punishing, keeping it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned observation → experiment via glass layers → seasonal build → amber pavilion repricing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the final postcard reframes night as “the gentlest daylight,” and the narrator’s work becomes “doors.” Causality is coherent (cathedral method leads to mural design which culminates at the pavilion). The cost is subtle but legible in time, stamina, and disciplined waiting woven through the seasons.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterning (debris → lagoon response → punches → dissemination) coheres into a closure where testimony reconfigures the city’s options. Closure lands with cost: “half‑retrocognitively trapped” and the zeppelin tilting toward the courthouse form a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis blend. Orientation is clean early (archivist on the zeppelin above the coast) and sustained through the beach/lagoon to library to inland arc. The causal chain of actions (signal → clerk → punches → publication) is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds from solitude to communal activation, closing on a charged repricing: from wishes to witnessed labor, sealed by the bottle’s “ticking.” Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and causality coheres: invitations → bell → gathering → declaration → sweeping. Closure costs are conceptual/social and land on the page (“authority would be labor shared and witnessed”). The single-scene window holds without stray shards.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural held throughout; the ritual density crescendos into a decisive refusal. Closure is Earned Stasis: a deliberate non‑recording that forecloses a professional path with on‑page cost (“If I refuse… the orchard drops…” vs. “If I accept…”). Orientation is clear early (orchard atop skyscraper after foghorn) and carries to the charged final image. Setups (wax shaving, horn memory) pay off cleanly in the closing decision.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the hatch → naming → alignment/singing → seasonal passage → planting builds to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is swift and clean (who/where/when within the first lines). Closure lands: planting Return in the cap shifts the city toward spring with the cost of lifelong custodianship. Causal seams are lyrical but coherent; no teleports or unkept set‑ups.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with a Situational-dominant close: the “zero hour” pressure coheres until stance crystallizes in ringing the bell over flipping the siren grid. Closure lands on-page with conceptual and social cost (risking audits and delayed alarms) and a reconfiguration (“we had switched our posture”). Orientation is clean from the outset, and the bell’s reprise structures the arc. The corridor’s faltering edges toward magical correlation, but it functions symbolically without breaking logic.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: stillness → outage → lantern-lit communion → boundary revealed → charged poise at the open roof. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the choice to attend rather than pursue forecloses a path with felt cost. Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/what). The power failure is a decisive intensification that coheres the piece’s pattern and pays off the early seeded motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual is established, the queen’s entrance tightens pattern, then the kiln/custodian shift reweights the stake. Closure lands on page with cost: he opens the lid fully, integrates heat, accepts pain, and inscribes a sigil, reconfiguring his role. Orientation is clean from the outset; no lens ambiguity. The covenant’s re-seating within color functions as a resonant reconfiguration with a persistent price.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details accrue (capsule → fragment → walking the letter) until the cadence shifts and the final ritual reframes time. Closure arrives as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—choosing patient, non-numeric timekeeping for the community—visible in the weekly sales and the last “follow the soft thunder” cue. Orientation is clear early (emerald silo, role, visitors), and set-ups (garage posts, capsule, fragment) pay off. The on-page cost is felt but modest, landing more as conceptual repricing than decisive sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: density builds from hush to rupture (string snap) to crafted response and a reweighted hush. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they do not retrieve the kite; they ritualize its loss (raft, final line left to silence), with visible cost. Orientation is immediate (poet at lagoon after rain), the scene stays continuous, and the ending’s image reshapes the premise cleanly. The persistent constraint (kite gone) shapes tactics throughout the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patterned acts (wiring, listening, community rules) deepen until the final copper circle. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: “silence arrived not as absence but as trust,” with on‑page cost (fatigue, a lost branch, acceptance of death). Orientation is clear from the first lines (caretaker, orchard, six months). The ending reweights the premise without resorting to a tidy mechanical wrap‑up.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the path → rotunda → basin → window sequence builds density and culminates in a conceptual repricing at the window. Closure lands on the page (“The window unlatched itself… I understood then that home is a rate constant”), with a quiet but legible price (a recalibration of stance, resisting nostalgia while accepting ritual method). Orientation is clean from the opening. Setups (amber, rain, institute ritual) all pay off coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring acts (fertilizing cracks, reading birds, translating wind) densify toward the treaty image. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: bayonets turned lattice, “treaty tightening,” and the final narrow crossing crystallize before/after in concept and image. Cost is legible in the reef’s death, the labor, and the renunciation of conquest. Orientation is clear quickly (harbor, jetty, mule cart at dusk), and the pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain: cylinders acquired → decoding via waxed leaf filter → instructions → dusk activation → contact → re‑priced understanding. Orientation is quick and firm (Sluice, post‑war, scrapyard economy), and the dusk constraint tightens the window. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: they connect, but the world’s distance remains; the riddle re-reads with consequence. No teleports or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught and sustained: the patterned returns (compass, stars, silence) reweight the dominant stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR when “true north” is redefined and a new custom is chosen with visible cost. Orientation is clear from the outset; no causality breaks. Quiet, but the ending image tightens the frame decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with Accumulative/Textural dominance: the patterned swaps intensify toward a decisive final act, yielding an on‑page change (the wrongness exits; mountains return). Causality holds—sundial → opening → piece revelations → rook/bishop vows → queen letter → last swap—while the bell’s locking raises constraint and cost. Cost is legible in the protagonist’s vows, the relinquishing of wages, and assuming the burden to travel. Orientation is clear early; no lens ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (walking‑as‑writing; echo as archive) and held to closure. The ending lands as a charged poise/earned stasis: the narrator resolves to leave only the board and lantern, accepting anonymity and risk as the price of a people’s archive. Orientation (interregnum, whispering gallery) is clear and feeds the final image. Causal tightness is less important than the cadence shift, which is precise and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: images and rules (feather, stone, nightly substitutions) layer toward a cadence shift during the bookstore’s reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a door “sized for your voice” and the first true hello—cost made legible by the earlier admission of buried accent/talents and the active re-shelving of shame. Orientation is clear from the start (mountain bookstore, quest for seer) and there’s no causality break. The final image reweights the premise without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with tight causal links: each decoded thread yields a specific temporal return, escalating toward a central fork (all at once vs. increments). Orientation is clean from the first lines; pattern is taught and consistently used. Closure lands with cost: a partial release, a chosen constraint (pigeons), and a reweighted self‑reckoning. The final overflow/image serves as on‑page DC/RR without mechanical over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative drive is clean: echoes/poems build until the canyon declares new terms and the artist chooses to pay twice. Closure lands on the page with cost (surrendered hues, the mentor’s “gold” given) and a reweighted rule set. Orientation is strong from the first lines; world rules (echoes, bone towers, ritual) remain consistent. The final breeze that does not echo is a crisp RR/CR marker.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: measurement → setting ribs → narration to wake the engine → fitting the charm culminates in a charged cadence shift. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the engine “names” loss without repair, and the workshop steadies; price persists in Mira’s absence. Orientation is clear from the first paragraph and continuously reinforced by tactile action. The constraint of breaths and fumes provides a persistent pressure that shapes tactics and the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: mirror crack → cave progression → oasis mirror → corridor → single curve → renunciation → return. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he keeps the promise by not living in the painting, returning to paint “inhales and exhales.” Cost is legible in the refusal and the un‑fixed mirror reflecting the chosen split.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern intensifies from ritual preparation → hum/scent release → wind seam → freighter’s quiet approach → mentor’s witness. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the salute and mentor’s eyes closed reconfigure status and validate the method. Cost is present as disciplined restraint and labor; while subtle, it’s legible on the page. Orientation is crisp from the first line; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pattern of calls/building → beacon points → journey → ritual → conceptual reweighting. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “not return but recognition… leads me with her,” with cost evident in the station’s dimming and the renunciation of reunion. Orientation is clean within the first lines and used to charge the ending. Setups (moon phases, censer foot, beacon) pay off without teleports or unkept promises.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Situational lens holds: storm, patrol, and involuntary honesty compress options, and the eye ritual reweights the stake. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: they keep practicing openly, accepting risk; the orchard “steadied a little” as cost and consequence resonate. Orientation is clean early (ravine orchard, empathy virus, role), and set‑ups (inspectors, smuggling, textbooks) pay off. The cost is legible in “If they had asked to see it, I would have handed it over.”

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural drive with clean causal carries: discovery of notch → flower as key → lantern code → ambiguous reply → ledger and concealment. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise; he forecloses memorialization in favor of ongoing witness with felt cost (ambiguity borne). Orientation is crisp from the first lines and pays off in the final image. The cost is on‑page: accepting an unprovable reply and carrying the ledger burden.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative texture dominant; because/therefore links hold (promise → ants → cavern → chip → seam → mirrors → step → crossing). Closure lands on the page through a decisive step and an earned stasis reframed as daily practice; cost is legible in leaving safety and braving the rising creek. Setups (chip, promise, glimmer, ants) pay off precisely at the seam and final pocket image. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph (shop, creek, midsummer), and no causal seams fray.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs (starlight wound, moth/flame, thread) densify until the waking/merging reconfigures the premise. Orientation is clear early (queen, palace, mountains; then ridge → grotto), and the path compresses into the decisive grotto beat. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with stated cost (“choose who rules… who you will not be able to forgive”) and a final image that reweights the omen (bleeding stops). No causality breaks; each beat logically deepens or narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: an experiment is mounted, density accrues, and a closure image (“a thimble of light”) delivers Conceptual Repricing with a felt cost (promised slowness, thresholds over trophies). Orientation is clear enough early: two friends at an ember nexus, one the pocket-sun alchemist. The escalation coheres toward the sun’s inward clicks and release. The cost is on the page in the vow to “spend it carefully” and to keep returning differently, foreclosing hurry.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and tactics densify from cabin to scroll to sky‑script, culminating in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Cost is legible where urgency to “correct the program” is replaced by ink and acceptance, and later by choosing to patrol after one’s own funeral. Orientation is clear early; the taught pattern (lyric dream logic) pays off in the reconfigured ending. The closure reweights the premise without hand‑waving.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: fog, water, breath motifs tighten until the decisive insertion of the screw and the final ping. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world is reweighted by “We are three,” with the paid price (relinquished relic) charging the final image. Orientation is clean from the first lines, and each beat follows coherently. No causality breaks; the pattern taught early pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a ritual sequence tightens under the breath‑clock as images and constraints accrue toward the final drink. Closure lands on the page with cost—“my breath thunders in its cage… With my last scrap of air, I drink”—a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis moment that reweights scars as story. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when and rules: platform, storms, held breath, tools). The breath constraint and storm metronome persist as a price shaping tactics and the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid lens with a causal end: the radio magic summons Mara, whose stylus replies escalate to the peach drawing, prompting the call that alters external options. Orientation is clean early (archive, orchard deadline), and set‑ups pay off (perfume, metronome, stylus). Closure lands on the page with cost via the foreman call and a reconfigured relation to rumor. The final “Play” anchors a resonant reconfiguration while the causal action is already in motion.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density tightens from threshold to lectern to naming illusions to hinge realization. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: from “end of history witness” to hinge, with the cost of relinquished certainty stated and felt. Orientation is anchored early (temple library, spiral arbitration), and the persistent constraint of the ritual and lectern shapes options through to the final image. The beat sequence coheres without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues via observation, calibration, and pattern recognition until the “boundary event” reframes the job. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (shepherding edges vs pacing minutes) with cost on the page (refusal to correct, potential job friction, blood). Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/when). The final image reweights prior beats without breaking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a sequence of calibrations builds to a reconfigured stance on security and grief. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and the final image delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis—when she turns off the rig knowing “edges” anew. Cost is legible as a relinquishment of clench/control and acceptance of permeable vigilance. The beat structure is quiet but coherent, with no causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clear early; the rainwashed library frame holds while motifs (lantern, priors, martingale) accrue toward a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she commits to teaching and living risk as stewardship. The corridor/lantern note is a decisive tightening; the ending’s “odds change, mercifully and slowly” marks the before/after with felt cost in duty and grief. Causality is lyrical but coherent; no teleports or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive: patterned wrong‑number rituals tighten into the emergency when “the third rail arced,” compelling a new tactic (looping the child through Rojo and Flora). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she saves the child and recommits to estrangement, recorded as “The Lesson of the Opened Elevator,” with the felt price of continued distance. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when established by the booth and tunnel). Causality holds: each escalation (arc → emergency line → loop → routing crew) proceeds with earned logic.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, with a Charged Poise/RR closure. Orientation is clear from the opening and the pattern (proximate causes as method) holds to the end. The reunion arrival edges toward coincidence, but the piece frames it as the payoff of context restoration rather than deus ex machina. Cost lands in the archivist’s acceptance of limits and the couple’s tentative, touch‑withheld exit.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: rumor → gathering → storm/outage → improvised systems → neighbor‑dragged trolley → charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: connection is instantiated (“you are holding one end…”) and the moon rock’s handoff reweights the social contract. Orientation is crisp from the opening; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in pledged returns, spent labor, and the acceptance of contingency over the fantasy of a miracle train.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sonic cues and tactile languages densify toward the clearing where the ring chills and the stillpoint manifests. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—accepting an axis rather than escape—paid with keeping sorrow alive in the body. Orientation is clear early (blind mapmaker in an ultrasonic forest at a cosmic pause), and the platinum ring functions as a persistent constraint/gauge shaping tactics. The end reweights prior beats (“map is inside me”) with a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: listening → pen ritual → terrace‑timeline → interference melody → retroactive addendum. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing when history bears an on‑page addendum at cost to certainty and linear time. Orientation is clear from the outset (station in “the Quiet,” role, stakes) and the pattern taught early pays off in the ending image. The cost—risking hubris and relinquishing neat causality—is legible in the pen theft and the uneasy temporal slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: mapping silence, camera clicks, bell permission, then the reweighted ending. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration/CR—the vow to keep the camera empty and surrendering the map to the tide—carrying a conceptual cost (“They could not take applause home”). Orientation is clean from the start and every move follows the established method. The final image reprices memory and music with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a sequence of artistic clues coheres to a CR closure where arson is revalued as primer and the city becomes a vow kept. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/what). The ending exacts conceptual cost (public stigma, secrecy, bearing the portrait as a shield) on the page. The causal knitting is lyrical rather than plot‑mechanic; still, each step logically enables the next.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: sound, rhythm, and intention intensify into a legible closure. The decisive change lands on-page (Mira awakens; “agreed awakening”), with conceptual and relational cost (hosting donors, institutional consequences). Orientation is established early (research wing, night, garden-as-instrument), and each move logically grows from the last. The closing image reweights prior beats without mechanical tying-off.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: storm disables tools → Ivo proposes a whisper-led method → locates courier → jammed gate solved by the key → Rade concedes. Orientation is secure early, and the single-scene structure holds. Closure lands with the courier recovered and Rade’s surrender, though the felt cost is modest (mainly Rade’s loss of face). The drive lens reads Causal throughout without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: shutters, light, water build to a Charged Poise closure as the narrator bears the mirror and re-aims the light. Orientation is clear quickly (dock, rain, canal, guardian), and beats cohere causally within the lyric mode. Cost is on-page in the brother’s “refusing the old pull” and the narrator’s vulnerable confession. The patterning intensifies rather than resets, culminating in the “final chord” of shutters.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: windows, grotto, clock chime, and deliberate stalemate build toward a quiet reconfiguration. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the town accepts unfinished moves; price is the refusal of quick decision. Stakes and pattern cohere, though the cost signal is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from island appearance → scrimshaw charge → whale call → public naming → crossing. Orientation is legible early (dock worker, coast, disappearing island), and pattern holds through closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the island “stays,” ropes self‑release, and the protagonist’s stance toward self and community is reweighted with cost. No causality breaks; each intensification grows from prior beats and rules.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from mandated cheer and surveillance toward a charged poise: turning off microphones and then publicly naming “lightness” over joy. Anchors are clear early (farmhouse, turbines, mandate, inspectors), and recurring motifs accrue meaning into the final line. Cost is legible—defiance within the broadcast frame and the ongoing risk of fines/annotations—without over-explaining. The inspector beat and the off‑mic lesson provide the single meaningful tightening this length requires.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure coheres via ritual acts that reweight meaning—paraphrased decree, synchronized breath, crossing the line, stepping onto ice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: public risk, relinquishing authority, and literal boundary traversal. Orientation is clear early (atrium by frozen lake; post-ban context). The final cadence (“a boundary dissolves responsibly… and it keeps humming”) crystallizes the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece teaches its pattern (plants, heat, breath) and tightens at the reed choice, then reweights meaning when the reed awakens a different sense. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: he accepts edges-and-rhythm over color, with on-page costs (barter, foreclosed search). Orientation is clean from the outset; the furnace/phoenix cycle coheres the window of action. The final botanical exchange affirms the new stance without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: stations accrue meaning, and the lamp lens mediates deepening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “connection is not a bridge but a braid,” the work continuing into schools and hospice with the price of not-knowing maintained. Cost is legible in the refusal of spectacle and the acceptance of grief’s unpredictable contours (the sandbar image). Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/when), and there’s one coherent scene with a light shard of public outings folded in.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds from solitary return to communal ritual to a specific mother‑child moment, culminating in a charged vow to stay. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: “I will be here…” reconfigures the initial aim with a felt price of ongoing vigilance and patience. Orientation is clean early (observatory, keys, console) and carried through to the final image. The mechanism of the projector and the lily motif enact the closure on the page, not as abstract summary.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: a sequence of consultations builds to a conceptual turn. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the final client’s desire is repriced from “find people” to “find the chorus that lets her sing alone,” with a felt renunciation. Orientation is clear early (loft, rain, tools, post‑crash city), and the tape returns to charge the ending. Cost is subtle but legible in the reframing and acceptance of alternative value.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; escalation via layered landings and pattern-breaking tactics culminates in a Conceptual Repricing and Earned Stasis (refusal to steal, acceptance of being altered, and not publishing). Orientation is taught early (who/where/aim) and pattern holds through closure. Cost is legible on the page: surrendering publication/citation for alignment and carrying change instead of loot. The final cadence reweights the archive as permissions rather than facts, reshaping the story’s premise.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: image‑linked beats gather until one decisive sacrifice reweights the field. Causality is clean (vines tighten → trade offered → personal dreams sacrificed → shadow reunites), and the closure’s cost is on the page. Orientation is swift and legible from the opening. The ending functions as Resonant Reconfiguration: a paid price changes options and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from atmospheric preparation to the decisive cut, then to the public letter and final charged stillness. Orientation is clear early (workshop, night, post‑con), and closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: tail tip and brochure as relics with cost. The causal throughline (con → loss of trust → pruning → amputation → invitation to witness) coheres. The price—material loss and exposure to oversight—sits plainly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs accrete toward a decisive ritual that reweights stakes. Orientation is clear early (tower at dawn, post‑anesthesia), and the two‑shard structure (tower → tunnel) threads because/therefore continuity. Closure lands on the page with cost: cracking the hourglass and planting the ivy in the fossil ring. The price—relinquishing Mira’s object and accepting a non‑reversal—reads unmistakably.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and sustained: pattern builds through objects and breathlike sound until the aisle with her name reframes the search. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing coupled with a small decisive act (writing “stay”), reweighting the premise with a felt personal price. Orientation is clean by the first lines (who/where/when clear). The final image (projector exhaling, thunder speaking) seals the before/after without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: circuits, meteor/door, sculptor’s pages, failures/rest, and a final widening (“the city remembers”) deliver a resonant reconfiguration with cost. Orientation is clear from the outset (aurora-lit archway, river, instrument). The cost—ongoing burden, fatigue, patience earned through failure—lands without over-explaining. Closure is quiet yet legible: vocation affirmed with a price and broadened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: chant → clock engagement → archive settles → game/bottle → spores planted → morning’s reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis: the train becomes a greenhouse, the clock “breathes,” and the archive sleeps, at the price of continued vigilance. Orientation is strong from the outset (post‑forest world, rail/dune, single POV on a night into morning arc). Costs and options are legible at the end (quiet instead of spectacle; duty over rest).

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominant: perception density and patterned images tighten until the gear’s insertion creates a decisive change. Because/therefore chain holds: hum→search via wind method→tree with missing seconds→repair→calibration→library discovery. Closure lands with cost (relinquishing the lesson of ruin) and a reweighted premise (frontier as interior distance). Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned images (tide, star, skiff, ridge) intensify and culminate in a decisive reach that reweights the premise. Closure lands with cost—the vigil, renunciation of the guides’ ferry, and commitment to “row by choosing.” Orientation is clean from the first lines (bay, inlet, ridgeway), and no causality breaks occur. The final image (star’s place taken by courage; skiff nesting inside) provides on‑page RR/DC.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details (radiators’ clicks, cobalt pane, bolt) accrete toward a closure where “remaining” and playing “easing” reprice safety. The cost is on-page (pain, time, taxed silence) and the final image (faint print/permission) crystallizes a before/after. Orientation is clean early and pattern is taught and paid off (radiator Morse, the bolt’s use). The ending locks as Resonant Reconfiguration with a conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid lens with accumulative texture and clean causal threads: cryptic messages → guided reading order → comma restoration → ink test → renunciation. Orientation lands early (library, Lyr, incoming claimant), and set‑ups pay off. Closure is on‑page with cost (“withdrew her claim like a blade reversed”) and the world consequence is gestured (“a dawn without a coronation”). No teleports or soft resets; the rune’s rule holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, patterned beats (tapping, ribbons, logs) coherently accrete toward a reconfiguration: path-as-schedule. The closure lands on page with cost: a choreographed, perishable corridor requiring nightly assembly and acceptance that stability is impossible. Orientation is clear from the outset (station, new keeper, goal), and all set‑ups pay off (key, atlas page, taps). The lens holds through to the final conceptual repricing line.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean: hum→circle→contact→query→map→public projection, with the risk of “waking whoever silenced them” as the cost. Single scene, single POV, dominant stake maintained. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (systems awaken; route broadcast), though the cost remains conceptual rather than paid. Orientation is strong from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: kite message → council refusal → secret unsealing → embryo becomes learning tree. Orientation is early and solid; lens reads primarily Causal with a closing RR/DC that reconfigures communal options. Cost is present (defying the council, breaking an oath) but not heavily dramatized beyond the morning argument. Closure is on page and alters the world’s available choices.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens around the helicopter/gull beat and resolves in a charged final image (photo folded with steadier hands, work ready). Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: he reweights his past without erasing it. The mosaic time-spread is coherent and pays off thematically, though it stretches the “single-window” scope. Cost is legible on the page: he accepts ongoing exposure to triggers and responsibility rather than retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with causal spine: discovery of threaded cards → inference of redesign → descent → rewicking → light. Closure lands on the page with cost and commitment: she burns a new wick made from the deck’s threads and declares, “I will keep the light tonight,” reconfiguring her role. Orientation is crisp from the opening and supports the payoff. The pieces the keeper left function as a persistent constraint that shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: ink‑reading builds to hut → contracts → metronome → chamber offer → refusal. Closure lands on the page with cost: he erases his outline and exits as the metronome “forgets how to count,” a decisive change. Orientation is clean early (post‑eclipse, wind‑carved camp, single POV). Setups (ink as teacher, mentor’s metronome) pay off tightly without stray threads.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pattern density builds to the timed release at the grid’s midnight “rehearsal.” Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the city’s behavior subtly shifts and the object is both preserved and freed. Orientation is clean early; causal links (hesitation → timing → dispatch → distributed effects) are coherent. The price is legible on the page and shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure gathers as the trio arrives, ritual calms, and the father’s letter reframes the vow. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she recommits to tending until “blame learns to breathe,” with the cost of continued absence made legible. Orientation is clean by ~100 words (dome, aftermath, role) and the final image reweights prior motifs. Causality is lyrical but coherent; no unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density rises from the initial casting to the elders’ test and the charged hush, culminating in a clear closure beat. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost: the protagonist returns the traced coastline—foregoing possession—in “let the map spill back into the tide.” Orientation (who/where/when) is taught early; the world rules are learned through action (iron as tuning fork, voicing silence). The price and before/after are legible without mechanical over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain: call → ascent → wager → shutter → measurable world shift → funding decision → reopening. Closure lands on the page with cost (accepting responsibility and restructuring the observatory), reading as Decisive Change under a Causal lens. Orientation is crisp; single scene integrity holds. The final image (nib as “small spike”) crystallizes the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens taught early holds: letters → recorder → amber → client tattoo → self‑tattoo culminate in Earned Stasis/Charged Poise. Orientation is clear from the outset (tattooist, lab, clients, silence as instrument). Closure carries on‑page cost and a legible before/after: the narrator chooses to “stay” and binds the guilt inward. Setups (letters, amber, glyph) pay off without stray threads.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the hush densifies, the tile reweights the circle, and the ending’s cadence shift (“rode home in breathing”) lands a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear from the outset (grotto, unlearning, facilitator). The decisive tightening occurs at the interjection and tile placement; cost is the relinquishment of certainty and slogans. Closure is earned though more explicit consequence could sharpen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/situational design tightens from the boy’s request to the ethical trial and renaming ritual. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: punishment is resisted; labor-binding names are assigned, and the tessera’s return loosens the past. Cost is legible in the refusal of “easy echo” and the community’s charged silence. Orientation is clean from the outset, and set-ups (tessera, plaza grammar) pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats tighten from coin‑song → echoes → visible fracture → anchoring the Star → door of leaves → charged stasis (“the timeline… learning our rhythm”). Closure is on‑page with cost: the duty continues, reweighted by the blue bell fading to a thread and the pact to “finish letting go together.” Orientation is crisp from the opening. The ritual scaffolds turns without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught and held: breath/tap grammar + wand + geode cohere toward a cadence shift. The static shock interrupts, forcing recalibration, then the method crystallizes into a charged final image (geode set aside; rig stilling). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: kindness-as-method reframes the goal with felt cost (grief confronted, not erased). Orientation is clean early (studio, rain, rig) and supports the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative dominance: pattern builds via sensors/grammar → vein → throat chamber → contract → storm test → amber trust. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the fossil becomes “resident,” the contract holds, and the narrator’s role shifts from claimant to partner, with cost (yielding the object, promise as material). Orientation is clean early; the escalation reads coherent with storm pressure. Ending reweights options for the future (“first page of return”) without feeling tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern-building (hourglasses, buttons, echo pulses) culminates in opening the doors and a communal reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: from counting to offering; prophecy redistributed. Orientation is clear early, and set-ups (jar, ledger, buttons) pay off. Cost is present but soft, as taboo-breaking yields immediate acceptance, trimming peak voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene with tight causality under a Situational lens: the rendezvous pressure coheres toward a decisive act. The closure lands on‑page: the microfilm is sacrificed, the ring is chosen, future options reconfigured with cost. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and set‑ups (pillbox, codes, promise) pay off. The cost (forfeiting intel/lever) is legible in the act and its negotiated consequence (reentry via Len).

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: stitching + ferrying cohere into a Charged Poise/RR closure as the far bank reconfigures the coachman’s sense of road and burden. Orientation is solid early (fog‑bound crossing, coachman, ferry), and the final image pays the promise. Cost is understated but present (weather/river pressure, acceptance of fear, the labor of stitching/rowing). The single meaningful tightening occurs at the current’s turn and the choice to hold rhythm until the gutters stop.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural design teaches its pattern (glass, threads, thrum) and lands a resonant reconfiguration: the place resists change through repeated kindness, and she chooses to enact and extend that rule. Cost is legible on the page (last water; patient labor; leaving cups behind). Single scene holds cleanly with coherent cadence shift as the threads braid and the sound returns. No orientation debt and no causality breaks within the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with clear causal spine: petal falls → launch → pick → clean → light → sweep. Closure is on-page (Decisive Change: lighthouse lit) with Charged Poise in the final image (“cut the lighthouse beam into slips”). Constraints persist (salt-bitten hinge, brittle wick), and the cost is legible in the careful, time-bound ministrations.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of hum/sundial/voices densifies until the stone circle falters, prompting a focused retuning. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—the library steadies; “weather into shelter” gains literalized charge via the word scratched into the sundial. The cost is present but mostly atmospheric, not decisively priced in character terms. Orientation is clean from the outset; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual builds, wind shifts, threads converge, chorus forms, and the lovers rejoin. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when strangers read lines aloud, reweighting secrecy and community with a felt price of vulnerability. Orientation is clean from the first lines; set-ups (spiral, leaves, bowl) all pay off. Pressure is gentle but coherent, with no causality gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative texture and clear causal turns: detect anomaly → trace booster → deploy countersigns → resist temptation → redefine channel. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (university radio, midnight, election season). Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration—refusal of power, reallocation of frequency—with an on‑page price. The sequence tightens logically with the wave’s counter‑pressure and the dean’s constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: organ + compass + alleys cohere and culminate in the Observatory repricing (“mutiny was…a hunger to be heard”). Causal links are clean—signal, chord, triangle transfixion, retrieval, exit, lock, telescope—no teleporting props or resets. Closure lands on the page via Conceptual Repricing with social risk implied (Council) and bodily constraint (claustrophobia) shaping tactics. Slight cap: the on‑page cost is felt but subtle, not sharply dramatized in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries (ribbon → phone case → perfume) deepen pattern and reweight stakes. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: the admission of not‑knowing and the letter from the woman in blue reconfigure the case into an empathy praxis with cost. Orientation is clear from the opening quarry scene, and the studio/letters shard coherently. The price—choosing empathy and art over solving—is legible in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: decoding couplets → locating the panel → copper nail insertion → mists reverse → confrontation with the director. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with a conceptual and social cost (defiance of authority, redefinition of exile as refuge). Orientation is strong from the first lines. A slightly sharper on‑page price at the end would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discoveries (glass flake → scaffold map → under‑bridge encounter) intensify into the climactic act of forgiveness‑music and the ledger’s “receipt.” Closure lands on the page with cost (entering a system that is “listening,” risking complicity to extract return). Orientation is clear early (pullout after a hitchhiker vanishes), and the ending’s RR is unmistakable in the arm‑in‑arm warmth. Setups (ledger, amnesty, bridges) pay off without mechanical over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterning of maps/ribbons/money/dusk intensifies toward a Conceptual Repricing closure (“the circle is where the hunted and the hunter trade names”). Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when anchored) and the narrative keeps a single coherent POV. Cost is legible at the end: the startup’s demise and the charged quiet of the train reweight the central question. While largely summarized across time, the cadence shift in the final third delivers a decisive reconfiguration rather than a soft fade.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pattern of light-as-grammar builds to the reconfiguration that decoding requires a call-and-response (“key vs. lock”). Orientation is firm early (observatory, night watch, telegram) and the sequence tightens toward dawn and the shared reading. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: the narrator forecloses solitary decoding and commits to continued witnessing with Mara. The beat chain is coherent and motivated, with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under a causal lens, each move leads to the next: circles → snag → seed → filtration of lie → thawed confession → public breathing of truth. Closure lands on-page with cost: the seed is spent, the mayor is exposed, and social reality reconfigures as the crowd listens. Orientation is clear early (who, where, why), and the rule-set (lake keeps what’s dropped; seed eats only lie) is taught through action. The final cadence is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid that reads decisive without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clean causal chain from scar-link vision to maze activation to confrontation to the new vow sealed in cambium; the rule-set is taught through action. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Resonant Reconfiguration: rejecting the eclipsed covenant and instituting a braided vow that reweights the world’s terms. Cost is legible (foreclosing noon certainty, joining pain as bridge, recording in flesh/wood), and the mapletree constraint persists through the final image. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an accumulative finish; causal spine is clear: seek Weaver → fetch “a destiny that refuses” → trade → pay debt by planting. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (seeding the last stories). Orientation is immediate and stable. One clean tightening (Weaver’s condition) carries through to the bone‑hand pit and the final planting.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis when the narrator assigns museum value and writes “interpretive panel about the night after the applause,” reweighting the premise with felt cost. Orientation is clear from the opening, and the quarry/echo pattern tightens toward the final image. Causality coheres through the scrap’s discovery → recognition → revaluation.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: hum restored through layered rituals; filings and felt planted; voice tuned to rails; the seed splits as the serenade returns. Closure lands on the page with cost (labor, vigilance, and relinquishing control) and a resonant reconfiguration (“keep company” vs “own transition”). Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/why). The final image reweights prior motifs without a mechanical tie‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: need → guided ritual → name consolidation → charged exit. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise—the bells’ “migratory pitch” and the pinned card reweight options with a felt, if subtle, cost. Orientation and rules are taught through action; no causality breaks. Cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → confessions → directive in the “heartbeat of a hesitation” → crowning act → world reconfiguration. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with on‑page cost (defying protocol, vow of silence) and a decisive act. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/why). The pattern escalates coherently without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: graffiti → sluice gate → culvert shallow intensifies meaning and options toward a Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clean from the first lines; single POV, one continuous excursion, one dominant stake. Closure lands on the page with cost when the narrator steps into the shallow, counts to twelve, and reframes the river’s “verdict” into instruction, then records a new practice. The price—relinquishing tidy certainty and accepting culpability—reads unmistakably in the final actions.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure coheres around patience as method, the watch’s rule, and the door that “would not open for hurry.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the unsounded letter is written, the watch “clicks… like a key finding an honest lock,” and the narrator adopts a new role with stated cost (returning the first letter to fire). Orientation is clear and pattern-taught; each beat (“pauses,” “spiral,” “breath‑script”) tightens tactics. Cost is legible in the renunciation and in the disciplined endurance required to open and write.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands decisively: he plays, propagates the music, and the violin melts; officers arrive to a cost‑marked aftermath. The Hybrid drive leans Accumulative/Textural (density and pattern crescendo) with a causal peak choice that forecloses the museum path. Orientation (who/where/when) is lucid early and fuels the noon clock. The cost is on‑page and irreversible, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through auroral intensification, chip warming/dimming, and the radio’s emergence. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when) and the ritual’s steps causally progress. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she secures a shard and accepts loss. Cost is legible in the refusal to resurrect and the archival seed—keeping shimmer over life.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned images tighten toward a charged act (offering the hairpin to the comb‑shaped slit) and a resonant renunciation. Closure lands with on‑page cost (the wall keeps the hairpin) and a reconfiguration of the goal (contentment as tending, not capture). Causality within the lyric frame tracks: each step opens the next (hairpin → wall → vines → pruning → planting → relinquishment). Orientation is clear early and serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    Situational lens holds: the lighthouse, wind, and chimes force stance crystallization. Closure lands on the page with cost when they choose to confess and set terms, naming names and reversing a tax promise. Stakes are legible early and resolve via a charged, on‑page decision rather than summary. The final image sustains the price and options reconfigured.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual → ripple‑watching → trance vision → repriced understanding → quiet application. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing with cost: the narrator relinquishes the need to be seen and accepts absence as gift, while the mentor’s further “unwinding” hurts. Orientation is strong early (who/where/what) and the taught pattern (withholding → revelation) pays off on the page. The final return home and applied renunciation completes the arc cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres through sound-patterns and avian grammar until the pulse “chooses a path” through the narrator. Closure lands on page via a resonant reconfiguration: the cast arrowhead striking the “exact rib,” then the renunciation of tools, which redraws options. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what) and the method taught is paid off. Cost is legible in the forfeiture of implements and identity as a skimmer, exchanged for listening as travel.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the climb → keystone → light → descent → civic application → renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: refusal of ownership with a felt cost (eschewing profit, enduring apprenticeship) and a reweighted identity. Orientation is clear from the opening with spire, stairs, and goal; the two‑shard structure (spire/city) is legible. The persistent constraint—automation season and the spire’s rules—charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout: pressure builds via density of listening and image rather than plot turns. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing when the narrator binds themself with a vow and reframes sound as “a colorable weather,” with the final image of lanterns as notes. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph, and setups (key tag, library, vows) all pay off. The cost—lifelong attention and patience—reads on the page as a real price.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: coins → flips → dome turn → distillation → corridor, with the backward prophecy re-weighting each move. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing: trusting the “blind toss” reshapes causality and unlocks the corridor. Cost is the relinquishment of agency-as-control, cued by the narrator’s earlier shame and doubt. Orientation is clear early and pays off in the final image without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from cylinders → scattered light → unstable figure → focused naming. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: “Shoreless” is named, the wound resolves, and he accepts an ongoing, costly vocation. Orientation is clear from the first lines; no causality breaks. The persistent constraint of dwindling light sharpens the endgame.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: observation → pattern → ritual yields a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost: he must finish before sunrise, cradles brittle devotion, and accepts restoring only an “echo.” The final image (fractional sea adjustment, silver ripple) reweights stakes without over‑explaining. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and causality is coherent within the lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Situational: the breadcrumb trail (photos) coheres pressure toward a stance crystallization. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he will file reports but refuses to expunge the town’s story, enacted via the ridge gathering. Cost is legible conceptually (defying bureau directive) and emotionally; a touch more on-the-page consequence would push higher. Orientation is clean early and pattern-teaching steady.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: signs (starlings’ geometry, waterfall moods, copper light) tighten toward the sealing act. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration: orchard “remembers,” roots and sap change, and Iri forecloses the path of recitation. Cost is legible in the chosen restraint and surrender of the reliquary. Orientation is clean early (Iri, orchard behind cascading veils; the “before final transformation” clock).

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with causal dominance at the end: observation → revised approach → guided docking lands cleanly with cost. The on‑page closure is the safe cradle and the quiet nod that reconfigures trust (“we are not done paying”). Setups (seam squeezed, fog‑color signal) pay off without teleports. Orientation is clear early, and each beat links by cause/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid lens (situational with accumulative textural build) holds cleanly; the dojo week escalates to a charged final act. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: joint and indivisible custody plus the narrator’s thaw, with a felt cost (foreclosing singular claims and neutrality). Setups (complementary opposites, vivification) pay off in the carry‑the‑jar test. No orientation debt; constraints recur clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues from the storm’s hush to the seed’s dare to the chosen rules, culminating in a Charged Poise closure (quiet vow, timer, door locked against dilution). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). Cost is legible—she forecloses scale and accepts scrutiny for a harder path—even if the landlord/inspectors remain off‑stage. One continuous scene with a clear cadence shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: sound-work in the tunnel builds a pressure pattern that opens into a communal response. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: laughter returns as a structural tremor (“a loosened screw exhaling”), with cost visible in his labor and anonymity. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean from the first lines; the tunnel-to-house conduit functions as the throughline. The ending’s charged poise—he carries “repaired silence”—reprices the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and rules (boundaries of light, interiorizing) accrete toward a charged poise ending. Closure arrives with felt cost: the bead keeps a “sliver of my breath,” and the narrator leaves by not leaving, reweighting options. Orientation is taught early (frozen garden, guardian) and feeds the final image. No causality breaks; set‑ups (sundial, pendant) pay off precisely.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: successive approximations accrue to a hinge where breaking the crozier opens the gate. Orientation is clean from “ember nexus at twilight,” and the scene remains single-window. Closure lands on the page with cost (crozier sacrificed, palm in heat, stepping through). The because/therefore chain in a lyric mode is coherent and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern tightens: refusal → attunement → lunar pull → stylus/gorge record → backward prologue to “first hello.” Closure lands on page with RR/CR: the city “learned to keep time with what it let go,” enabled by the protagonist’s specific acts. Cost is legible as relinquishment and accepting a non‑resurrection solution; a persistent constraint (perigee, physical mast/gorge) shapes tactics. Orientation is crisp early, and no causal stitching gaps undercut the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid with Accumulative/Textural dominance: patterned images (wake lattice, dripping letters, hourglass dust) accrue toward a decisive choice at the doors. Closure lands on the page with cost: selecting the door that keeps the tide—permanence purchased with undertow—reconfigures stakes and outcomes (arrivals stabilize but never simplify). Orientation is taught early and serves the payoff; all key set‑ups (radio, hourglass, grotto) pay out. No causality breaks; each turn grows from prior images and decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each room’s rule adds pressure toward the triangle-and-bridge moment. Closure reads as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—connection is “ethically provable through repeated steadiness,” with the bridge holding because they commit time and attention. Orientation is anchored early (pre-opening gallery; curator; unlisted chambers). Cost is the ongoing obligation to maintain weak gravity and to leave only habits, not objects.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: patterned edges/rays build to the aliens’ return and the unfolding blossom. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR when “stars as pressure” reframes navigation and instruction. Orientation is crisp from line one; single POV and two‑shard rhythm stay coherent. The cost is implied (forsaking lamp‑comfort, yielding to where to fall) rather than dramatized, but it reads on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with clean causal links: phones tremble → hearing aid ping → gallery → photo misread → man revealed → connection. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the narrator brokers contact and reframes “finding” as a charged endurance, with emotional cost borne by all three. Orientation is strong from the opening and the taught pattern holds through the end. The price—living with grief while choosing to keep listening—lands on the page in the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: pressure coheres through environment and ritualized actions toward a charged final stance. Orientation is clear early (cave, tide, forgotten facility) and causality is tight (fleck → lock → terminal → names → renunciation → escape). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she leaves the fleck and exits under a live tidal clock, with felt conceptual and material cost. The brine/phase transition mechanism set early pays off in the door and final seam.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant lens holds: pattern → pressure → recalibration/defragmentation → renunciatory alignment. Closure lands on the page as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—the choice to “let the signal fade” and pocket the shard as a lens, not a wound—at felt cost. Orientation is clear from the opaline dome and radio; causality is clean from ghost coordinates to technical rectification to reweighted self‑relation. No soft reset; the before/after is legible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: textures → sound via diamond and avian choreography, escalating to the curse’s price. Closure lands on-page with cost (“I offered my name... and the curse took it”), reconfiguring options into a living, moving record. Causal through-lines (each tool enabling the next tactic) cohere, and the ending’s ongoing caregiving seals the before/after. Orientation is clean from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: images accrue (phone, arrowhead, seedlings, drain) toward a charged descent and consent to be keeper. Closure lands on the page with cost (“keepers sometimes must be kept” → “I stayed on…”), a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the pattern taught by midpiece pays off in the staircase and choir. Each move coheres: phone → instruction → song → opening → names → consent.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and cadence build to a resonant reconfiguration as statues’ halos gutter, joints unclench, and the orchard shifts from surveillance to shelter. Orientation is crisp from the first line; objects and stakes recur coherently. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (risk of punishment) present throughout, though little paid after the turn. The final image (“Beauty… teaches stone to dream in daylight”) reweights the premise without breaking prior rules.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: patterned images (checkpoints, drones, cobalt arcade, bottle) intensify toward Mina’s opening of the jar and the choice to deliver the misrouted letter. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: he leaves lighter with a concrete destination and altered understanding, with a felt (if modest) risk to rules. Orientation is clean and pattern is taught early. Stakes escalate subtly rather than via big reversals, which suits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: attempts → failure (no power) → “wrong turn” oasis → repricing to voice → singing restores the carousel. Closure is an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration with a soft but legible cost (vulnerability and ongoing stewardship). Orientation is clean from the opening and the two‑shard transition pays off. The causal thread is lyrical but coherent and purpose‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of geometry/sea intensifies until the map opens, then reweights at the card-writing and renunciation. Closure is a charged poise/Earned Stasis: “I must return with news, or else the map will fold shut forever” and she does, paying the opportunity cost. Orientation is clear from the outset; one continuous scene with a single cadence turn. Constraints (patrons browsing, closing time, fold-shut risk) shape the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: patterned pursuit intensifies to the sea’s question, the dawn‑shot, and the open‑door renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: naming without chains and letting the dream go, with the cost legible on the page. Orientation is clean early (librarian, islands, dawn) and threads consistently through the library/shore return. The persistent constraint of time (sunrise) shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritualized steps (twilight, first star, mirrors, ribbon, song) build to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on page—the singing reweights the premise; the locksmith’s bow and “payment was the song continuing” seal the after state. Cost is present (risking voice/public exposure), though it remains largely symbolic rather than consequence‑driven. Orientation is clear early and pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs (ring, mirrors, constellations, ledger, apples) densify toward a ritual admission that reweights the stakes. Closure lands on the page with cost: the confession triggers exchange, yields partial memories, and the tide turning forecloses further access. Orientation is clear early (island, greenhouse under noon slack), and the ledger/apple beats concretize consequence. The final correction—writing her name a third time—locks the before/after with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with Accumulative/Textural dominant: pressure builds via ritualized acts (tea, shadow corridor) toward an on-page reweighting when the council grants a stay. Orientation is stable from line one (forgotten library, archivist, decree) and the pattern is taught early, then paid off. Closure lands with cost—the narrator risks vulnerability, the stay is “reluctant,” and the work must continue. Setups (letters, bottle of dusk, shards) all return functionally at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, held from first line through closure. Closure lands when Miren and the child plant the essence‑swollen seed at the seam; the cost is Miren’s relinquishment of the heirloom and binding it to a public threshold via the child’s promise. Orientation is early and clean (Miren, parapet, waterfall). The density builds from pruning to child’s arrival to the charged planting; the final image reweights the stake with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through iterative knot‑work and memory-catching to a resonant reconfiguration where the hush “changes weight” and the masks release the last storm. Orientation is clean from the outset and the final image reweights the premise with cost (collected storms, surrendered voices, kept-but-not-forever). The wind snap near‑fall is the decisive intensification that tightens resolve. Closure lands on the page with a felt price and a coherent before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain from torn map → archival footage → seam → communal opening → reframed map. Closure lands via Decisive Change (reopening) and Resonant Reconfiguration (keeping the tear visible as seam/wound). Cost is legible in the refusal to sensationalize and the choice to preserve hush. Structure holds as two shards cohering to one closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues via time/air limits, current, and layered transmissions; closure lands in a charged ascent with the gauge’s “time for air and sorrow.” Who/where/when anchor early and hold. The final act—filming, then pocketing the globe and rising—reconfigures the mission from listening to carrying, with a felt price. Quiet but legible cost and a coherent single scene meet scope.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm-pulse, graffiti, and plate cohere toward a closure where vents are opened and water shared. Orientation is strong early (courtyard, storm, ghost in wires), and cause feels earned: encoding → valves blink → communal response. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a lasting stance (“I swore to keep translating”) and visible communal change. Cost is more conceptual than painful, but it’s legible and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught by the floor‑by‑floor ascent and pays off with a resonant reconfiguration: “encrypted against despair” reframes the mission, and the narrator assumes stewardship. Orientation is crisp from the outset (elevator, spire, assignment). Closure lands on the page with a clear stance change and conceptual cost (keeping what breaks you close, curating others’ grief). The elevator’s stop and open arrangement of letters seal the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues via drift, squall approach, radio hush, then contact and tethering. Closure lands with a Decisive Change plus conceptual repricing: reconnection “like a bead on a rosary” and the blank lines as proof. Cost is present as a relinquished solitude/charge of absence, though lightly rendered. Orientation is clean from the first line; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative climax: the hush/countdown + craft layers build to a charged poise as the building falls and the sky “survives.” Causal beats are clean (coin → safe → pigments → layered glazes → completion before blast), with the foreman’s “one more minute” tightening options. Closure lands on the page with cost (time, risk of collapse, acceptance of limits) and a reweighted world-rule (the room remembers dawn). Orientation is crisp from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative texture and clean causal links: observation → pattern recognition (dog-ear + hopscotch) → enlist helmsman → figure-eight maneuver → release of light. Orientation is clear early (airship at dusk, night watch), and closure is an on‑page Decisive Change with a resonant reaffirmation of purpose. Cost is felt (risk, static, the plea for trust), though it’s modest. The pattern teaching and payoff are coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: pattern builds from library → prophecies → mirrors → cedar breath → tuning → reconfiguration. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library thaws slightly, the wheel and key are left, and his understanding reweights the premise with a cost (he relinquishes ownership). Orientation is crisp from line one; staging is coherent and rule-consistent. The causal chain is gentle but clean, with the uncapping as a decisive enabling beat.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative: ritual patterns (bell, chalk) accrete until a crisis (the unmoored arch) forces a coordinated response and then a collective launch. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: a community reconstitutes itself into one body and earns sight of the “nebula of respite,” with cost in risk, fatigue, and relinquished quarrels. Orientation is clear early—orchard planet, arches, bell—and the taught pattern (signals → action) governs all turns. The final oath‑ring reweights everything without mechanical over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: mounting hush, trembling mechanism, needle lean, then vow and song. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: the vow‑song reconfigures the function of the lighthouse’s beam and the narrator commits to waiting with visible cost. Orientation is clean within the first lines (who/where/when). The cost is legible in the relinquishment of warning for vow and the acceptance of potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the clock, patrol arcs, and living geometry intensify toward a charged exit and the caretaker’s return. Closure is a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: “Before the night frost forms…I will find them; afterward, the orchard will find me,” with on‑page cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and all set‑ups (roots trick, nut, blueprint, frost) pay off in sequence. No causality breaks; the horn/patrol change is a clean tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: observation → insight cadence → design decision → vowed accountability. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with tangible cost named (“lawsuits and scorn”) and a reweighted plan. Anchors are clear early (ravine, chemist, failed packaging) and the single scene with reflective span remains active. The final image crystallizes options without tying them off mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: counting pauses → hinge → vault → offering → comma‑seed → return. Orientation is clean from the first line (who, where, when), and the closure is a Charged Poise: the seed that can sprout only under this lull, the first sentence “sleeping” in her hands. Cost is legible in the offerings and the withheld breath/attention required to enter. A hair shy of 9+ because the price, while elegant, remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally pressured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain is tight: rain → discovery → warning → contact → decision to cook → meal → reconfigured bearing. Closure lands on-page with cost (the chef’s scoured throat, “borrowed thunder”) and a visible before/after for the keeper. Two‑shard structure (site then kitchen) is clean, with a single dominant stake. The final image (puddles vanish; saved coral) locks an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change hybrid.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: from the elevator’s first “hola, shalom” to bridges raised and a communal canon, density and patterning deepen toward a reconfigured town. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—elevator repurposed, town stitched—with conceptual cost (labor, scars preserved, storms flexing). Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks. The cost is gentler than piercing, but present on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: three pulses and the quake/seam intensify pattern density toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page as the mirror splits and the narrator departs with a new stance (a map of pathways), reweighting the premise with a conceptual cost (choosing process over possession). Orientation is clear early and consistent. If anything, the price paid is quiet rather than sharply dramatized, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern-teaching, density, and cadence shifts drive a resonant closure. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when via “prism-minded archivist” and “serpentine grotto” during the tilt hour). The closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: leaving with “safes reopened in my ribs” as time expires, accepting limits with conceptual cost. The hour constraint and the choice to exit through a final corridor make the before/after legible without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of listening → assembling → sounding → repricing to pulse. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: tying the insulator as a promise and leaving the music behind marks a before/after with the cost of renounced virtuosity. Orientation is clean early (grove, sculptor, insulator, hedgehog), and all set‑ups pay off. The constraint (silence that wants pulse) shapes ending tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure coheres through the hum, pauses, and patterning toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. On‑page closure lands when the stone is seated and surrender reframes the covenant, with the cost of renouncing victory and accepting judgment. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when) and pattern is taught and paid off. A precise causal hinge (“before the next phase”) helps unify the cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early (pre‑fireworks hush → ritual tools → resonance) and held through closure. The clasp’s opening and the double‑signed entry deliver on‑page closure via a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost (accepting Anya’s charge). Orientation is clean by ~120 words (who/where/when; workshop, town hush), and the fireworks clock shapes the cadence. Setups (pacifist method, silence collection) pay off causally at the hinge click and the inheriting entry.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: parcel → planting → bloom/stink → communal breath → steadied bridges → council clarity. Orientation is solid early (who/where/when) and the closure lands on the page with cost (taboo broken, stink endured). The final image reconfigures options (village can choose amid stink) and the protagonist’s stance softens into stewardship. Causality is felt even in lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with Accumulative/Textural dominance: water-guided ascent → spindle contact → fusion → planting under a live inversion clock forms a coherent tightening. Closure lands on-page via the decisive act of fusing/planting and a Conceptual Repricing of resilience (“not a wall, but a music”) with the cost of ongoing obligation and relinquishing the relic’s independence. Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/when under inversion). Beats connect cleanly without teleports or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal chain is tight: survey → diagnose wind trap → mark corridors/offset → radio/upload → pilot lands. Closure lands on the page with cost via an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: they refuse the dangerous corridor and “promise nothing” while committing to a revised approach that could still fail. Orientation is crisp from line one; the drive lens stays causal despite lyric texture. The final image (quiet landing, inventorying what almost failed) seals the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cadence intensifies from first bell to final tone, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where the hush becomes a “standard by which noise could be measured.” Orientation (who/where/when) is immediate and stable. Closure lands on the page with a conceptual repricing and felt cost signaled by renunciation of the “noise market” and disciplined endurance through doubt. The bell/chisel synchronization and aurora metronome provide a coherent structural spine.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound, silence, and thresholds pattern toward a final cadence shift where the seam is re‑woven. Orientation is early and stable (Thunder‑echo range; post‑guardianship return), and the present action remains active despite reflective texture. Closure is on-page with cost: the seam knits only when the narrator alters method and accepts culpability. The final image (driftwood lane left; ravens carrying apology) reconfigures the premise with earned restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds via repeated printing acts, halo feedback, and astronomers’ “Between vanishing stars” until the confession and final image. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she reframes ambiguity’s purpose and externalizes it by placing the fragment on the windowsill to “drink” vanished light. The cost is legible—letting go of protective ventriloquism and accepting ethical accountability for editing grief. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear early, and the pattern taught by the voice pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the ridge’s hum, breath, and pendant accrue into the corridor, then thin to a charged stasis with cost. Orientation is clear within the opening moves (courier, ridgeway, widow, parcel). Closure lands on-page: the corridor opens, then must close; the yew is seeded and the courier accepts the price of ending. The absent mentor’s rule set informs tactics and the final image without a mechanical “explain-everything” ending.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominant: arbor → car frost communion → return to arbor for amplification → handprint/name → reweighted final stance. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing (“Objects do not forgive or accuse; they witness”), with on‑page cost as Mara confronts old grief. Orientation is clean from the opening and the lattice metaphor coheres causally through to the prism’s answer. No loose setups; each introduced element pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: pattern density rises (edges/amber/hush) until the fabric “takes its own breath” and carries the message. Closure lands on the page with cost (loom emptied; self‑thinning; borders buried) as a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is early and steady (orchard, loom, Kio), and the sequence from weave → lift → arrival reads coherent without causal breaks. The persistent constraint (distance/river) shapes the chosen method and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure coheres: three nights of preparation culminate in the storm where vows are tested, the silk tightens, and the arches settle. The closure lands on-page with cost—he trades memories and dreams and bears physical bruising—and the town gains new options (stackable rubble, living ladders). The lens reads Hybrid with Accumulative texture over a causal spine, held cleanly through the end. No orientation debt; the ending’s bell-ringing reconfigures the world’s stance credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: each sensory and multiverse thread intensifies toward the reveal that she pressed REDIRECT. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: accepting guilt and choosing preservation over erasure with a felt cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why) and the bay/shard mechanics pay off. The child-image across worlds is the meaningful tightening that reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the lamp’s failure mid-storm initiates a patterned build (letters, stones, sea glass) that culminates in a charged poise at dawn. Closure lands with cost through the keeper’s recommitment and quiet “Thank you,” reweighting safety as an ache rather than an outcome. Orientation is clear early (lighthouse, storm, keeper, skipper), and the single-scene window is coherent. The persistent constraint (dead lamp/haunted room) shapes tactics through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern is taught early (ritual, laughter, beam, storm) and deepens with the child’s arrival, the newsroom of two, and the “burn absence into direction” move. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: an emerald vow that reweights the post‑print premise with felt cost (endurance, solitude, responsibility). Orientation is clear within the first lines (who/where/when; after the last print newspaper; emerald lighthouse). The persistent constraint (storm, reefs, beam) shapes the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: light‑tracking tactics deepen until the widow’s dangerous accretion forces an adaptive act, culminating in a charged poise ending. Orientation (who/where/when) is taught early and consistently. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—magnetism becomes posture with ethical cost—made legible by the intervention and the final vow. Causality is lyrical but coherent, with set‑ups (wing, light, donor heart) paying off.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pin’s sound, root breach, sextant alignment, and tag archive build toward a reweighted final stance. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—the world’s rules (trees witness; grief can be measured) click into place with cost already paid in the meticulous labor. Orientation (who/where/when) is clear early, and cause lines remain coherent. The hush/pin beat functions as a taught pattern break that tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Held under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates via pattern-deepening: ledger constraint (no intact mornings) forces a tactic shift to voices, then the cross‑mirror weaving tightens options. Orientation is clear early (greenhouse, mirror world, role) and the window-loom turn coheres. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: dawn woven from communities across both sides, with cost in shared scars and a negotiated light/dark. No causality breaks; the pattern taught is paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under a Situational/Accumulative lens, the causal chain is clean: invitation → hidden library → confrontation → reading tactic → recalibrated bond. Orientation is swift and legible; the secret corridor transitions into a single continuous encounter. Closure is an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): they accept a changed relation and foreclose a path, with the clerk’s “front door” line sealing cost and choice. The coincidence of both being invited is justified in‑world by the Order’s design.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual actions build until the room “unbends,” the witness arrives, and the practice reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clean by ~100 words (season, place, intent), and closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with on‑page cost (not exonerated; must keep returning). Beats link coherently from discovery to brewing to communion to planting. No causality breaks; the final image reweights the premise convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: mentor flare → cracked slide → library directive → final vow. Closure is on page as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the narrator binds themselves, with cost made legible. Orientation is clean early (frozen library, role, tools), and causality is lyric but coherent. Persistent constraint (cold, fragility, dwindling illusions) shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative lens is taught early and held: hush → false starts → cutpurse trigger → lime spill → silent accusation → captured “brittle inhale.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (she engineers a break and pays coin/moral price), and the sunrise clock cleanly releases the tension. Orientation is clear from the first lines; no causal gaps or resets. The final image reweights the premise without explaining it away.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: taste-patterns and forest-election ritual intensify toward a charged tally and a vow. Orientation is swift (bluff under aurora, ring’s function, goal stated), and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on-page cost (“I will let it carry me when the taste of alone returns”). Beats sequence coherently from arrival to quorum to tally. No causality breaks; pressure deepens by patterned images instead of plot machinery.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid lens (causal with textural lift) holds: return to the cave → broken lock resists → drawing as bridging tactic → opening → decision to bring pages upstairs. Closure lands on the page: the box yields, jar is uncorked, and the protagonist’s stance reconfigures into ongoing, risk-bearing action. Cost is embedded—she keeps the day job but can no longer refuse the calling, shifting her options. Orientation is clear early (boardwalk/carnival/gallery) and carries through.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: discovery of the fragment → map alignment → hatch access → confrontation → collective reopening. Closure is an on‑page Decisive Change with cost (post suspended, city dimmed) and a new equilibrium (“Pluviary of Spoken Things”). Orientation is crisp from the opening sentence; no teleports or unkept set‑ups. The escalation reads cleanly without outliney “and‑then” seams.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues from pilgrims → Keepers’ demand → Iri reweights the field by sound, culminating in Earned Stasis (refusal via resonance). Orientation is clear early (bluff, bell tuner, post‑words world). Closure lands with cost: the Keepers leave empty-handed, and Iri recommits to guarding, marked by the ledger star and tremor. No stray setups or causal gaps under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: the magnetic shift and pump reversal raise pressure; the miniaturized burn is the act that reweights the system, landing in an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the first lines (greenhouse dome, desert, caretaker). The cost is real if subtle—risking damage, defying system logic, and accepting a new “map”—and persists in the charged final image of workable storm. Setups (tin, north drift) pay off without deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught and held: stories accrue until the chorus opens the lock. Closure lands on the page with cost—neighbors risk pain by voicing wounds; the narrator wagers authority on listening over spectacle. Orientation is crisp from line one (courtyard at dawn; Harbor House curator). The final unlocked letters reweight the premise without mechanical tidy‑up.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern builds via dance, dice, and encoded hesitation, then reweights at the “question” that opens the vent. Orientation is crisp early (sunken lab, Warden Current, two actors) and the closure lands on-page with conceptual cost (defiance under surveillance, doubt as breach). The blue warning pulse tightens the middle without derailing coherence. The final image of strands humming with liberated voices seals the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant lens that holds: image‑driven escalation culminates in a on‑page RR/CR. Causal threads are clean (grounds → pier pockets → whale → glass memory → corridor → retrieval → recharged tin). Orientation is firm from the outset (lantern lighter, harbor, beached whale). Cost is legible at closure through the reweighted vocation and the risky crossing into gravity pockets.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pressure mounts through pattern–density and cadence until the code’s resistance (“clinging to a stone like frost”) meets a focused counter-tactic (breath-guided attention). Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration: the code unknots, and what remains is “room,” with the cost of humility and ongoing vigilance (“did not claim victory... keep listening”). Orientation is clean early; pattern taught and paid off. The final image reweights the premise with felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the pattern of ritual, silence, and listening densifies until the rooftop cadence shift. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the world reweights when the building speaks and the narrator inherits duty. Orientation is clear early (stairwell, neighbor, teas) and the final act (pressing the seal) pays off prior rules. Cost is legible as responsibility and complicity in merciful fictions.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern teaches (garden, shell, dawn rule) and tightens into the on‑page transfer. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis—the narrator becomes the archive with a felt price, ending options reweighted (“the garden would never repeat that weather again”). Orientation is crisp early (garden at twilight to dawn) and the causal thread is coherent within the lyric mode. No soft reset; the cost persists into the final readiness vow.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held; images and actions accrue toward a clear Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is clean within the first lines (who/where/purpose), and set-ups (key, unfinished scroll, unlinking strokes) pay off at the end. The cost is legible in the refusal to complete and the conscious return of power (key) to rest. The final reconfiguration—leaving a blank margin as verdict—lands on the page with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pattern of call-and-world-shaped response intensifies from general echoes to direct questions to a personal test. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a conceptual repricing of “echo” as obligation/networks, with a visible emotional price in Lio’s self-implication. Orientation is solid early (who/where/when), and there’s no causality breach. The final promise tightens options and reweights prior beats with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: dreams → mapped taps → Sofia → dive → snow globe/password → communal witness → foreman’s tacit admission → earned quiet. Closure lands with cost in the final charged image (husband cranks until it sticks), reconfiguring the stake from exposure to rest. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph; no teleports or rule breaks. The restraint tactic persists as a constraint shaping every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density of images and actions (whistle, whisk, communal wiping) coheres toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early (parapet after rain; crowd) and the throughline—teaching effort’s invisibility—tightens to communal action. Closure lands on the page with cost (giving the whisk; collective service replacing fireworks). The cadence shift from watching/listening to acting (drying stones) seals the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning Causal: storm → observation of calm → investigation → shredded‑letter reconstruction → resonator explanation → recalibration → next storm holds. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/earned stasis: “traded a curse for a calibration,” with social and ethical cost (loss of myth; liability line). Orientation is clean from the outset; no teleports. The cost is more conceptual/social than visceral, but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative drive holds: arrival of Brin → mayoral test → prophetic pattern → door opening → seed scattering → town’s tonal turn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the community’s allegiance re‑spined by the new “prophet” and weatherwork, with implied cost (risk, patience, scars). Orientation is clean from the cobalt portico on. Slight softness on explicit material price prevents a higher score, but the conceptual cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from jars to music box to communal harmonizing, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure arrives on the page with cost: a conceptual repricing of the narrator’s trade and a vow that forecloses a path. Orientation is immediate (loft, dunes, dawn) and maintained across the two‑shard structure (loft → beach) with causal continuity via the music box notes. The final image (“ticking like a lighthouse for the quiet we had chosen together”) reweights prior motifs with earned clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid drive with causal dominance: rumor → preparation → sonic exposure → renunciation → joint stewardship. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: they foreclose ransom and commit to co‑keeping with the cost of trust and relinquished leverage on the page. Stakes stay coherent, single scene, clean anchors. The turn is quiet rather than knife‑edge, which slightly reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patterned returns (ice, moon paths, viaduct, humming) deepen and then reweight stakes at closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “not a storm but a school,” teaching begins indoors, and tools/rituals are laid down with cost. Orientation is clean from the first lines; no causality breaks. The price—choosing patience over panic—registers on the page (ropes lowered, slow tasks accepted).

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominant: observation layers (salt-locked drains, wick as lung) culminate in a stance shift and concrete acts (reporting preventable; refusing evidence surrender). Orientation is clear early; pressure coheres via supervisor pings and the algorithm’s preference. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise blend with legible conceptual/professional cost. The lantern’s relight → vision → report forms a clean because/therefore chain inside the lyric weave.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with clean causal spine: shop repair → removal of “thorn” → ticking → visitation counsel and choice. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the apology becomes a map, with the charged image of ticking that demands repeated choice. Cost is legible: no absolution by repair; time must be kept by ongoing action under scrutiny (parole, guilt, storms). Anchors are early and stable across the two‑shard structure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece tightens through patterned attempts toward the hinge’s twitch and the “bell beginning” beyond sound—an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (a readiness that must be held). Orientation is clear early; the pattern is taught and paid off by the cadence shift and the workshop’s “pressure inside the joints.” If anything, the cost is more spiritual than practical, but it’s legible and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Causal. Because/therefore links are clean—pattern → lie to bot → vault → Driftwood path → Sink challenge → discovery → post with cost. Closure lands on-page via the decisive act of posting despite risk, with the “profiles lighting up” serving as a resonant payoff. No orientation debt; the before/after is legible and paid.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the mirror reconstruction and public proposal sequence coherently deepens pressure to a charged poise: the “weighted breath before reply” where the sphere hovers. Closure is on-page with cost (no prophecy, only practice; the narrator’s season-long watch). The two shards (shop, orchard assembly) are cleanly linked, and all set-ups pay off. Stakes narrow from accusation to a concrete, shared protocol, reconfiguring options without false neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring acts of listening, scanning, and preparing build to a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—asking the clinic for another delay. Orientation is clean early (euthanasia tourist at a drift‑ice marina), and set pieces (child rescue, storm feint) ladder meaningfully. Cost is present on the page: choosing to continue living with vigilance over a scheduled “clean” ending. Structure coheres without and‑then drift.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Situational lens holds: encounter pressure coheres from approach → confession → tool-offer → rewritten letter. Closure lands on-page as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid (meeting “where rivers kiss the rows” with the burned edge sealed in), with conceptual cost clearly legible. Orientation is anchored early and maintained. Causal throughlines are clean without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual → wind test → method shift → charged quiet. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: a widened clearing, sealed record, and vow to repeat despite the valley’s forgetfulness. Costs are present (restraint, labor, non‑speaking, ongoing vigilance) and shape tactics. Orientation is legible early and stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the ritual builds density from circle to mirror to corridor walk to final word‑kites. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: the town’s breathing “less fractured,” the weighted case, and the choice to walk the ruins mark a before/after with emotional cost (unnamed trembling points, endurance to keep walking). Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/why). Setups (case, photos, lavender/factory) pay off in the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught and kept: cards (Sprout, Scar, Orchard) deepen toward recognizing the hush as “the staff,” then committing to testify by sound. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: language’s growth shifts from lexicography to tending and listening, with the noon delivery pledged. Cost is the self’s turn from speaking to hearing as speech, legible in his reticence and oath. Orientation is clean from the first lines; pattern coherence never wobbles.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned listening and marking build to a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis where he chooses accompaniment and resets markers for the self who won’t remember. Orientation is clear early (fog sculpture garden, ruined museum, tapes), and the tide/fog constraints persist through closure. Cost is on the page: he foregoes certainty, loves the chalk lines as they fade, and accepts the price of ongoing loss. The final cadence reweights prior images without breaking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: quake → misalignment → noisy chronometer reinterpreted → re‑tuning → sharper image → faint heat tremor captured. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the chronometer’s “message” and the final decision to unlearn the Moon’s “silence.” Orientation is immediate (lunar observatory, night after landslide). Cost reads as risked data loss, time, and a relinquished dogma rather than spectacle, but it’s on‑page.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear orientation from the first lines, a single continuous scene, and a tight causal chain (lab result → call → arrival → farewell). Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the son stays, the shard passes, and the father’s breaths thin. The cost is on the page (imminent death, admitted estrangement) and the accumulative hymn pattern tightens toward silence. Hybrid drive with accumulative dominance is taught and held.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: repeated loops and mechanical windings accrue toward a CR closure where noon is reconceived as an agreement. Orientation is clean early (observatory, caretaker, key), and each action coherently sequences toward the contract image. Closure lands on the page with cost—the signed gold line entering the body and the island “breathing noon” without sun. The pattern taught (loops, sealed awakenings) is kept and paid off without contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive, dominantly accumulative with clean causal beats: tooth → map → Ari’s emergence → shoulder set → shared decision. Orientation is quick and clear; the hedge‑maze garden holds the scene. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: they redraw the map, leave the tooth, and commit to a new account with a real cost when the town “will clamor tomorrow.” The cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the craft pattern accrues to a closure where the garland transforms dusk into a “layered hush.” Orientation is clean from the opening (grotto, mist, sea glass, village above). The ending lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (renouncing fire; investing time/patience), and the persistent constraint (no flames) shapes tactics. The brother’s possible return reframes stakes without undermining on‑page closure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, each beat coheres toward an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration: the shared burial and mutual vow reweight the relationship. Orientation is clear early (post‑viral confession; moss‑colonized data center) and every step flows logically from prior images and choices. The closure’s cost is legible in the pendant’s forfeiture and the refusal of spectacle. One scene, single POV, with a decisive cadence shift at the handover/burial.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: density builds from hush → visibility pocket → contrary thread → pact → renunciation. Closure lands via Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: “I chose the river…” with the market path foreclosed. Cost is present (refusing market ladders) but shaded rather than dramatized. Spatial and temporal anchors are clear from the outset, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual preparation → harvest‑moon alignment → communal singing → reconfiguration of the village’s relation to place. Closure lands on the page via a resonant reconfiguration: bowls mend, wells find echoes, and the village carries a new calm “like water in open hands.” Cost is implicit—renouncing convenience for patient, collective attentiveness—and paid in the practice and restraint. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: arranging objects, listening, releasing starlight, imprinting a map, and sealing the fissure build toward a clear on‑page reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost and consequence—the lake exhales, aurora moves—earned by his earlier patterning and resource rationing. Orientation is strong from the opening sentence and the constraint (“since the northern grid went silent”) persists through the end. The final act (sealing) is a clear decisive change that reweights options for all.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned mapping, calibration, harvesting, and a cadence shift at the end produce a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure carries cost—the renunciation of the repaired timer and the cave keeping his laugh—reweighting the premise from possession to stewardship. Orientation is clean from the opening. The jars, timer, and hollow all pay off coherently in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned actions (orienting, threading, weighing) build to a resonant reconfiguration when the narrator reorients to shelf their own fear. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why) and the closure lands on the page with cost—admitting the fear of being “weighed beyond my marrow” and revaluing it as duty. The lamp guttering and ledger drying provide a concrete cadence shift that seals the before/after. A whisper more constraining consequence would tip this into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early (kettle as metronome; rain beads as lenses) and held through closure. On‑page closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she chooses not to fix the name, keeps the tin shut, wraps the carving, opens the window—accepting absence with cost. Orientation is immediate (widow, loft, morning ritual). The kettle‑clock structures one continuous scene and the cost is legible in the refusal to restore and to summon memory.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs and actions accrete to a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure where the contract becomes “restarted habits.” Cost lands on‑page: relinquishing plundered futures, staying despite groaning ladders and calling bones. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and set‑ups (camera wheel, story‑rope) pay off in the final cadence. The final image reconfigures options without flattening ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative cadence: a sequence of functional fixes (because/therefore) builds toward a charged, purposeful stasis. Orientation is clean; causality tracks from diagnostics to interventions to visible outcomes (sinks, fans, heat, light). Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the terminal’s purpose re-aimed, with tomorrow’s burden implied. Cost is understated but legible in the commitment to maintenance and the rejection of grander, rocket-era fantasies.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: listening deepens, images recur (crystal, finch, bell-that-never-rang) toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure arrives in an Earned Stasis: he will not rebuild nor renounce, inviting the dream to “walk beside him like weather,” with cost legible as lived ache. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the pattern taught is paid off by the final not-ticking image. The sanctuary constraint persists and shapes the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: approach → hook/box → maps/ledger revelations → appointment implied in the ledger → confrontation with engineer → joint departure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: truth reframes the city and the narrator’s path, with a visible social and personal cost. The cost is quiet but legible (family ties, collusion, risk in proceeding during the “radio silence” window). The single‑scene scope is respected and the lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from dock arrival to hidden splice to amphorae method to the test with fir seeds and dawn return. Orientation is clean from the first line; the rope/fulgurite pattern is taught and paid off. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—trust proven, braid intact—at a conceptual cost of vigilance and custodianship. The fisherman’s return seals consequence without breaking the quiet mode.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the ritual (thread, knots, projection) deepens pressure toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with cost as the obituary reframes absence and the quince “approve,” and the woman’s weeping irrigates rather than breaks. Orientation is clean early (harbor, closed gate, garden) and the rules are taught through action. The final image reweights the premise without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural; pressure coheres via pattern build (palace sway → tuned cradle → storm → hatching). Closure lands on‑page with cost: he refuses coronation and reorients a city’s trajectory; mills slowing implies material sacrifice. Orientation is clean from the first line; set‑ups (chains, acoustics, rose window) pay off. The final image reconfigures premise and stakes without breaking the taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns of wind/coin/sand intensify toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on page when she uses the red thread to graft and later pins the threadless coin at the station, a before/after with cost and communal implication. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why), and set‑ups pay off (water’s song, coin, black sand). Quiet but decisive cadence shift at the graft seals it.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: breadcrumbs, patience, and refusals accrete toward a charged poise ending. Closure lands via Earned Stasis—the renunciation of the flood and a commitment to slow unsticking—with a clear cost and reweighted city stakes. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/what) and the pattern is taught early (box→breadcrumbs→voices) then paid off. The broker interlude provides the key mid‑piece pressure and tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: travelers arrive with fire; the narrator refuses that logic and demonstrates an alternate transit, culminating in a charged endurance. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: they depart transformed by resonance, while the keeper remains counting—“infinity is only patience”—with a felt price. Setups (sonar, petals, gear, no‑flame rule) all pay off without amnesia. Causality within the lyric frame is consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the piece builds patterned beats (ribbon, hush, butterflies) toward a charged final act. Orientation is crisp early (who, where, when), and the greenhouse frame stays coherent across the migration. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise in the spare kite curve with visible cost (renunciation of ornament, measured pacing). No causality breaks; the father’s arrival tightens pressure at mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres around the held pause and pays off with a resonant reconfiguration: release of the pendulum plus the shared carving/action on the ridge. Orientation is clear from the opening and the pattern is taught early (tools, tide, brass) and sustained. Cost is legible in relinquishing strict exactitude and taking on the burden of mending. The ending’s charged poise (bells as invitation; ridge’s answering knell) closes the before/after cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lens: Hybrid with causal dominance—each step (clock → border → missing grave → sacks → letters → marking truth) links cleanly. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he reframes absence, marks it, and will plant poppies—time reset signals a before/after. Cost is understated but legible (exposing a lie; accepting custodial responsibility for a painful truth). Orientation is strong from the opening; no teleporting props or rule breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure coheres through iterative modeling and charged images, culminating in the hinge choice and the poised lift of the quill (Charged Poise). Orientation is clean early; causality flows via “model suggests” → “I choose” → “place three hinges” → “test with beads.” Cost is conceptual but legible: responsibility, potential misuse, and constrained hours as a price for controlled innovation. The final poised act reweights the stakes without needing a physical execution on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density builds from tuning to instructions to payment, culminating in a charged promise and hidden instrument. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the vow to “carry tempo forward,” the cloaked glow, and the cadence marker “within my ribs” establish a before/after with cost. Orientation is clear early (ember alcove, mist, copyist, shortwave). The persistent constraint of secrecy shapes the final image and future options.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece tightens through recurring objects and withheld labels toward a charged final cadence. Closure arrives on page when the chair rocks and slows, with the mother’s acknowledgment reframing their survival; the cost is legible. Orientation is clear early (house, box, mask; then studio; then gallery), and the pattern is taught and paid off. No causality breaks; each step coheres with the central aim.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: demand for the cog + noon sluice jam → the lead through the drowned library → the cog as ratchet fix. Closure lands on the page with a decisive act; the water drops and the wheel “catches,” reconfiguring meaning from emblem to method. Cost is tangible (time pressure, risk of flooding, social narratives dampened) and the lens holds. Orientation is strong from the first lines, and no causal seams show.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds from the opening hush to the final “denoted” silence. Closure lands as a charged poise: the final rest and passing of the rosette reprice the premise with the cost of unlearning and restraint. Orientation is clean early (velvet library, cabinet of scores, Mara’s role), and the set-ups pay off (rests, rosette, subtracting noise). The on‑page exchange—Rafi catching and offering the rosette—crystallizes the turn without violating the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The alignment → planting → memory‑fed growth → pruning → fruit → communal soup accumulates to a resonant reconfiguration where rebellion becomes rebuilding; cost appears in the pruning of tender memories and the ordinance risk. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/when grounded). Closure lands on the page in the communal tasting with a charged before/after, though external consequence remains implied rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear causal chain: Mara arrives → riddle → reveal → lightning channeled → drones wake. Single-scene structure holds, with closure delivered on-page as both a material reset (drones reawaken) and a conceptual reweighting (ritual as necessary function). Cost is legible in the act of revealing the guarded tray and relinquishing the box. The Hybrid lens is steady, with causal dominance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: three house visits build a pattern that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing (“they live on… our pauses”). Orientation is clean from the outset; the method teaches itself by use. Closure lands on the page and is causally linked to the displaced‑object method and the beetle tin recovery, with a felt, if quiet, cost (“tiny vows”). The piece stays within one arc and one POV without structural drift.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The sequence coheres as Oris threads the ampoule to the lattice and releases “time” (hesitation), culminating in a reweighted premise: delay as civic mercy. Closure lands on the page with cost—choosing diffusion over decisive action and bearing the scholar’s initial recoil. Orientation is clean early, and the motif of “structural weakness” unifies cause and tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: proofs, dice, steps. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise when the narrator declines the rupture and shifts aim to “shaping the corridor into a remembering instrument,” a choice with cost. The dice lying flat (5 and 2) and taking seven charged steps seal the before/after. Orientation is clean throughout (single POV on an infinite staircase); no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: offerings, moon-brush ritual, and the neighbor’s map build toward a Charged Poise closure. The final dot and shared tea reconfigure the premise into a “small republic” with social cost implied by years of endurance. Cost is felt but soft; no single decisive trade-off narrows options on-page beyond earned stasis. Orientation is clean from line one; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominance: ritual density and object rules (the lens selects survival) build to the public trial under the falls, reweighted by the stranger’s correction and the gifting of the lens. Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the guide accepts stewardship with cost and a seasonal obligation. Orientation is clear early (who/where/mission), and causal links (bread → softened wax → legible faces → ritual) hold. The cost is felt: burden accepted, names now literally eaten to endure, and the guide leaves under a charged vow.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative lyric texture and clear causal beats (yoyo keyed, stone opens, options reweighted). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the protagonist forecloses the door and chooses the keeper, with the cost (lost escape/power) legible on the page. Orientation is clean by the first lines; set‑ups (backward script, hunger stone) pay off. The price and constraint of “hunger” shape tactics to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Strong causal chain: resuscitation → advisor’s plan and clasp → breached funhouse → paradox dictionary → summoning → revealed weakness → flash/gaze → exit. Closure lands with a decisive change: fear’s weakness is exposed and exploited; “my name swam back into my face.” The price is the protagonist’s vulnerable confession and the risk of being edited by attention. Pattern is taught early and paid off; no orientational debt.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds (approaching “mouth,” D drone, bee overtones, tower, knife net), each tactic reweights the stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the storm passes because threat is transformed into orchestra; final listening to silence reframes control as attunement. Orientation is clean from the start (who/where/when) and pattern is taught early (dubbing/naming). Cost is implicit (risk, exertion), if not deeply taxed.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pattern density builds (shell seams, rhythms of five/six/five, lattice grammar) to a Charged Poise/DC—stepping into the corridor to be “measured.” Orientation is clean early (city on turtle shells; gate rusted shut; mother missing) and all set-ups pay off (tag, ledger, whistle notes). Cost is legible in the corridor image and conceptual repricing (“measures, not mercies”) lands. Causal threads are tidy without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: artifacts accrue until the narrator’s stance reconfigures the premise (Conceptual Repricing + Resonant Reconfiguration). Orientation is clear from the start; single scene coherence is maintained. The cost—publishing the truth and handing the ledger to families—lands as a social and emotional price, legible if not dramatized in fallout. The patterning (shipments/passengers, tulips/strike, ledger/margins) pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: an entry window opens “after the drawbridge rises,” the descent deepens from service door to the “deepest room,” and closure crystallizes in the final slip and waterline mark. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he accepts witness over repair and pays anonymity and ongoing labor. Orientation is clear from the first lines (who/where/when) and never lost. The persistent constraint (water level/bridge timing) shapes tactics and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: silence enables investigation → stamp tests → documents contradict doctrine → conceptual shift → protective concealment. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (“lowered, not lost”) paired with Charged Poise in the final image. Cost is conceptual and vocational—choosing evidence and secrecy over immediate revelation—made legible by the blackout’s end and the hum’s return. Orientation is clear early; pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong accumulative/textural build from ascent to nave offering; pattern density increases (steam, prisms, cranes) until the shadow’s “faint hand” delivers an on‑page RR with cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and the rule‑set (lanterns sip dreams; stairs invert) is taught through action. Closure is paid: he does not get the shadow back; instead a reweighted stasis lands. One hairline: the abbess’s “stair turned” bell as a structural hinge is slightly arbitrary but not harmful.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: cooling breakers → anomaly/basin → perturbation → charged final poise. Orientation is clear early (floating observatory over drone‑scarred valley), and closure lands with cost: the hush required for pooling, the ongoing ache, and the chosen vigilance. The basin discovery and transmission mark the tightening; the final image reweights the premise (“a grip forming in the dark”). No causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: resistance of the dome → missing vowels → algorithm shift to read silence → invitation cadence. Orientation is clean from the outset (observatory at dusk; drone pilot + pilgrim), and the final image delivers a resonant reconfiguration with on‑page proof (“the printout now bears a final line”). The cost is a conceptual relinquishment of map-as-place to tuning-as-belonging, visible in the method switch and final directive. Causality is lyric but coherent; no unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with causal dominance: terrace meeting → agreed test at the shore → sifted planks escalate knowledge → watch hand confirmation → confession and burning choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with tangible cost on the page (“Burn them… keep one page”) and a future‑facing plan that reweights the premise. Orientation is clean early; the taught pattern (lyric accumulative with concrete beats) holds. The final image (belief/time losing a hand) reprices the story’s archive logic.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single, coherent scene with a clean situational drive: the exchange, a snag, a deliberate de‑escalation, then completion. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise): the drawer pull reframes conflict; mist thins; metal cools—cost is conceptual and social, on the page. Orientation is crisp early; the moon‑phase synchronization elegantly sets the clock. Slight subtlety in cost (more felt than explicit) prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with an Accumulative dominant ending: lyric pressure accrues through motifs (fog, poles, compass) and culminates in a charged final image that reweights the premise. Orientation is immediate and clean; the external situation (grounded boat) coheres causally with the internal stake. Closure lands on the page with cost (“carrying sorrow…open and used”). The because/therefore linkage holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid drive with causal dominance: rumor → gate → skiff → warming ball → confession → forked choice → stay. Closure lands on-page with cost via an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change: choosing to ferry others and surrendering the ledger. The baseball’s heat compels a concrete action that reconfigures options, and the caretaker’s receipt of the ledger marks price. Orientation is clean and the pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: spice ritual → beasts’ attention → Mira half-formed → price named → metamorphosis accepted. Closure lands on-page with cost as the narrator becomes a passage and forfeits “plain speech.” Orientation is clear early (orchard, phoenix aftermath, goal) and the pattern taught by the language pays off. The fortune’s revision and sap-climb seal a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: clouds → glade → descent → chamber → atonement → return, each beat tightening the premise. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she frees stalled seconds and accepts ongoing fallibility with a specific place to kneel, at real emotional cost. Orientation is clear by the second sentence (who/where/when), and all set-ups (saucer crack, mobile moons, tablecloth) pay off. No causality gaps or teleports; pattern is taught and fulfilled.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: patterned images (weight, tears, stitching) build toward the opening, and causality is clean where it matters (balance → lock yields). Orientation is crisp early (last caretaker on a recycled ship, a physical lock with rules). Closure lands on the page: the chamber opens, its nature reprices the mission, and the pledge forecloses conquest. Cost is legible in the earned stasis: ongoing self‑discipline and custodianship instead of release or victory lap.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Situational lens holds: pressure coheres around orchestrating hush and safe positioning as the mountain “practices restraint.” Closure is on-page and paid: a gentle lateral exhale, calm evacuation, and the reweighted release of the jars (CR/RR blend). Orientation is clean by the opening lines; setup pays off via the fisherman/volcanologist/child beats converging. No causality breaks; the coincidence engine is dramatized as her method, not a patch.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: blackout → coded path → workshop intrusion → Rhun’s arrival → recalibration of the fort → town’s new dusk. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost: the fort’s purpose changes and authority rebalances, and the record’s “unexplained” blackout becomes lived knowledge. Orientation is clear early, and set‑ups (sundial, quill holder, cradle of sparks) pay off. The only softness is the low friction of Rhun’s pivot, which trims the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Clear causal chain: seeking the herder → teaching the ground to listen → pattern casting → door opening → choice and cost. Closure is decisive and costly: brother returns, eel herder takes his place; the narrator’s vow is repriced into ongoing work. The hybrid lens leans causal with lyric accumulation; it holds cleanly through the end. Cost is on the page (“for him to stay, she would have to go”).

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the poet aligns the constellation with their own scar, claims purpose (“This is why I write”), and restarts the timer to measure courage; the cost is facing erased history and living by a ritual that demands ongoing exposure. Orientation is clean from the first line (who/where/when). Setups (timer, storm, envelope, teacher) pay off coherently without mechanical over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid drive with Accumulative dominance: patterned light and objects accrue until the sundial throws the gate; the decisive act is signing and stepping through. Closure lands on the page with cost—the loser’s signature, the relinquishment of certainty, and departure into the unknown. Orientation is clean from the first lines (glass atrium, brook; single scene). Because/therefore linkages hold: decoding begets map, pressure begets duel, insight begets entry.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught immediately and held; the scene coheres around a single night’s rebuild culminating in a charged poise/CR: beauty as practice, the tin’s closing “like a page turning.” Orientation is clear early (vagrant poet, rusted library, Lio). The false‑bottom reveal and map reweight the action mid‑scene; strangers arriving and shelves rising intensify cadence toward closure. Cost is felt via risk (demolition notice, siren) and identity drift; it’s quiet but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs and density build to the on‑page closure where the announcement of the delayed last train and the concourse hush reweight the premise. Orientation is clear early (station pianist; misdelivered reel) with one taught transition to the arbor. Closure reads as a resonant repricing: a small, costly “pebble” in fate’s shoe without wreckage. Cost is present but conceptual rather than visceral, keeping it just short of the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via dream-led seeking, the seed’s responses, and the monsoon’s approach. Closure lands on-page with the planting, the seed’s light sorting myth from memory, and the oath—an RR with a conceptual cost (ceded role, risk of failure before rain). Orientation is established early (who/where/when). The monsoon punctuates rather than resets, confirming earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs (compass, lace, tides) accrue until the cove scene forces a stance. Closure lands on the page: speaking the apologies, lace turning muted cerulean, and a teaching pledge—an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change with cost. Orientation is clean from the outset; props and rules are seeded and pay off. The compass and lace constrain tactics, avoiding coincidence-led resolution.

The felt cost is the release of a long-held, protective pattern of hoarding.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.5)
    This story is a masterclass in the Accumulative/Textural drive. Causality is lyrical rather than linear, but every image and scene builds pressure toward the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.8)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens. It teaches its core mechanic of "looped timelines" early and builds upon it with each repetition, deepening the narrator's understanding rather than just advancing a causal plot. The closure is a perfect example of Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the narrator finds a stable, meaningful place within the loops, with the conceptual cost being the renunciation of a singular answer or "forgiveness."

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.5)
    The structure is flawless for its length, using an Accumulative/Textural lens that shifts perfectly into a Causal one for the climax.

The plot is elegant, motivated, and fully resolved within its own logic.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.4)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is flawless for its purpose. The inciting incident (the maze's objection) flows directly from the character's "mended deception," creating a tight metaphorical causality. The closure is a superb Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the narrator and garden achieve a new equilibrium ("the work itself settled the account"), a state earned by renouncing performance for honesty, which serves as a palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a flawless Causal drive, moving from problem to theory to action to resolution with convincing linkages.
