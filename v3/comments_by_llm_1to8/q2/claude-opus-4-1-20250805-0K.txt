  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elena's daily observations building toward her resignation and new research method. The closure (resignation and establishing observation stations) has visible cost through career abandonment, though the transformation from flood damage to research station feels somewhat convenient. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as Marina walks into the canyon, choosing erasure and rebirth over her father's poisoned legacy - the cost of losing her identity is palpable. The accumulative revelations about uranium-infused sand build effectively toward this crystallized moment. Slight weakness in the middle section where reflection dominates over present-frame pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mira's loss transforms into gain—she becomes the "first true listener" to thermal music. The cost is palpable: her hearing, her crewmates' lives, Kepler's death all weight the discovery. The accumulative lens holds as thermal patterns build toward the final image of "organisms that had learned to sing in temperatures."

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Silas finds rest by giving it to others, with visible cost (abandoning his mortuary and earthly life). The causal chain from package to underwater descent holds, though the middle section's fantastical mechanics ("bubble of breathable grief") strain credibility without sufficient grounding. The hybrid lens shifts from causal to accumulative work, but the transition point remains ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout as midnight rituals layer into communal transformation, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration when anonymous giving becomes "their very identity." Cost is visible in Marta's exhaustion and the community's unified silence against officials. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical progression of food distribution expanding without sufficient friction.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural design builds through sparks→memory→tear→door revelation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mae discovers she must give rather than take, releasing her photographs with clear cost ("empty and full simultaneously"). The closure lands with Mae's pilgrimage completing through sacrifice, though the orientation could anchor "where" more precisely early on.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost as Elara transforms from trapped by time to becoming its gardener, with the dissolving halo fragment marking irreversible change. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks (fading photographs, geometric bridges, crystalline time) that reweight her relationship to temporal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal progression from captivity through code-breaking to liberation and seed distribution, with the arrow as catalyst. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost—Marcus carrying "ten thousand possible futures" in his burden, walking with "staggering grace." The GPS coordinates discovery meaningfully narrows options and drives the mission forward. Minor orientation delay (carnival context emerges gradually) doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where Elena's discovery reweights the entire quest—her grandfather heard only "half the frequency." The accumulative structure coheres through recurring absence/presence motifs, and the cost is legible in "all her remaining days" of cellular division carrying this knowledge. Orientation anchors (Arctic greenhouse, sunken orchard) establish clearly by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the revealed truth about the daughter's departure reweights the photograph's meaning with clear emotional cost—the mother's tears of relief. The accumulative lens holds as moonbeams consistently reveal rather than steal. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~120 words to fully anchor the metro station setting.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through Marina's ritualistic narration and glass-making until the couple's arrival crystallizes her purpose. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Marina transforms the control room from a space of catastrophic authority into one of vulnerable questioning, with visible cost in the radiation exposure risk. The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Marina, abandoned nuclear plant, March).

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Decisive Change closure where Marcus reverses the shell's resonance to transfer his fears to Jake, with clear on-page cost as Jake collapses "overwhelmed by terrors he'd never learned to navigate." The causal chain from child's cast → library coordinates → confrontation → reversal holds cleanly. Who/where/when anchored early ("Marcus pressed his scarred palm against the rusted library door").

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the oracle's understanding shifts from mapping an endpoint to documenting process, with cost visible in "excruciating, beautiful patience." The accumulative lens holds as imagery patterns (amber/marble hush, gold leaf deterioration) build toward this reconfiguration, though the transformation could land with more visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught temporal loops paying off when Seven touches the violin across all seventeen timelines simultaneously, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where he understands consciousness as emerging from gaps. The cost is legible in his return to endless mopping while "each repetition a small infinity," accepting his role with new awareness. Minor deduction for slightly abstract philosophical framing at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught doodles, lens imagery, and whispered confessions building toward Resonant Reconfiguration where taking hands crystallizes new trust with felt cost of vulnerability. Orientation anchored early (museum, night registrar, forecourt). Minor deduction for cost being more implied than viscerally shown in the final gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the marble transfer crystallizes Marta's philosophy while charging future possibility. Cost appears through the "cracked" nature of each victory and the withered vine dresser's age, though the emotional price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where Ira's discovery reweights physics itself ("time had width as well as length"), with clear cost implied through Earth colleagues' future dismissal. Causal lens holds through because/therefore linkages (magnetic alignment → field manipulation → temporal perception), though the orientation arrives late (~150 words) without serving closure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Marcus completes Elisabetta's interrupted performance, with visible cost (standing chest-deep, risking drowning). The dual-signed program crystallizes the merger of past/present. Slight deduction for the miraculous dry state at the end which softens the physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through fever, botanical discoveries, and electromagnetic revelation to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira adds her truth to the constellation of protected knowledge. The cost is legible—she must smudge her identity and file false reports. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the pattern of margins/hiddenness accumulates meaningfully toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as radio fragments and tunnel exploration layer toward Marcus's discovery and ethical choice. The Earned Stasis closure (leaving the valve wheel untouched) carries visible cost—forgoing potential fame/content for respecting the dead. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Deduction for the radio confessions feeling somewhat convenient in their clarity and timing.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the final image of the keeper becoming "what she documented: pure witness, pure change." The cost—seven winters of silence, dissolution of certainty, acceptance of crumbling—accumulates throughout. The pattern of transformation (books→moss→memory) teaches its logic early and pays off in the keeper herself becoming the living chronicle.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elena releases the curl during totality, crystallizing the transfer of wonder from mother to daughter ("Sofia was humming a new melody"). The accumulative build through musical layers and the "dreaming roots" motif creates density that peaks at release, with felt cost in the permanent loss of the keepsake.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens builds through layered discoveries (tapestry, diaries, wall-whispers) toward a resonant reconfiguration where Thrain understands her purpose as echo-tender. The cost is legible in humanity's departure and her isolation as keeper, though the axis-shift concept could use clearer grounding in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Chen stepping through the lighthouse door, accepting his role as composer of his own disappearance. The accumulative structure coheres, but the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt—we understand his transformation intellectually but don't feel its emotional price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building layers of looped sound that culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration where possession dissolves through examination rather than force. The cost is legible in "the dangerous comfort of never asking why" and the woman's struggle to reclaim agency, with the dimensional anchor providing consistent spatial grounding throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully as Mei conducts the symphony of all times, achieving "chronological home" with clear cost (exhaustion, isolation, job loss). The accumulative structure coheres through spiral imagery and temporal layering, though early orientation could be slightly cleaner.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kira integrates her fractured selves, with clear cost (murdering infinite possibilities) and the viaduct's dissolution marking the transformation. The accumulative/textural lens holds through density increases and pattern breaks, though some middle passages lean heavily on exposition about the tablet's properties rather than dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through reversed music creating physical resonance that bypasses hearing, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence becomes "enthralling" music. Cost is legible in the worn needle and the acceptance of permanent deafness, though the transformation could use one more concrete obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-breaking at the pigeon's arrival after three years of silence. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elena's continued observation transforms from isolated duty to active resistance, with the storm's approach crystallizing options and stakes. The "perfect record of the truth, waiting for the storm that would set it free" carries conceptual cost of complicity turned to purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through layered extinct scents building to Elara's transformation into "a living archive of olfactory memory." The closure lands with clear cost—she becomes the repository of loss itself—though the transformation mechanism could be more physically grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through temporal layering that culminates in Marcus's Earned Stasis—leaving the rope with full understanding of its weight. The closure lands with visible cost: "carrying time's texture in his bones." Each revelation deepens rather than reverses, building to the final insight about "the accumulated weight of every heart that had ever broken itself trying to choose correctly."

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the "chronic hush" transforms into "quietude that held space for the incomplete," with visible cost in the lost rainforest and damaged instruments creating new harmonics. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through layered musicians joining, building to the final image of "perfect incompletion." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in opening paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Vera's harvest of "incomplete truths, each one a small mercy" reweights the entire premise with conceptual cost - the recognition that "sometimes the kindest thing wasn't to give people whole emotions, but to offer them the parts they could bear to hold." The accumulative lens holds consistently through sensory detail building toward this crystallized insight.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story builds through layered discoveries (envelope → locket → Martha's identity → teaching legacy) that reweight Margot's understanding of value beyond "careful calculations." Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Margot accepts her role in "cycles of compassion," with cost visible in her shift from broker of goods to "broker" of human connection. The mistaken address causally enables everything while the library's roofless nature charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the first artist is reintegrated, with visible emotional cost ("tears that caught the lantern light like fallen stars"). The accumulative structure coheres as community bonds strengthen through shared search. Slight deduction for orientation taking until paragraph two to fully anchor the three-month timeline and Kira's role.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Marina's completed drawings release the stolen time, fundamentally altering the city's temporal architecture with visible cost (the time-sculptors' panic, Morteus waking prematurely). The accumulative lens holds as details about borrowed time and extinct creatures layer toward the revelation. Minor orientation wobble with the canal system's mechanics early on.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the revelation that loss can be calculated as presence. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where "absence, properly calculated, was just another form of presence" with emotional cost visible in Morrow's three-year search. The transformation mechanism feels under-explained, creating a slight causality gap.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story builds through layered details of Edgar's caches, memories, and acts of kindness until the archivist's acknowledgment creates a Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost—Edgar's potential emergence from decades of hiding—is implied but not fully embodied on the page. Who/where/when anchored clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Marcus's transformation crystallizes as inevitable inheritance with felt cost. The piece teaches its pattern of plant-human merger early through the linden leaf. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the exchange transforms both griefs into "the terrible, necessary art of continuing." The water's cost (child's death) is felt, and Mara's final resolution to paint carries visible weight. The accumulative lens holds as rain trails, water imagery, and amber cohere toward meaning-making through art.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Vera's perception fundamentally shifts from seeing only futures to witnessing the "living tapestry of the present," with the cost being her former certainty about dramatic prophecies. The accumulative/textural lens holds as the cave's sensory details and shadow-manifestations build toward this perceptual repricing. Slight dock for the explain-everything quality of the shadow-entity's dialogue mid-piece.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the archive transforms from monument to "living practice of compilation," with visible cost in the community's learned dual existence of "presence and absence." The accumulative structure coheres well through density increases toward the ending. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the exile concept.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise - Elara discovers the fortress and commits to repeated mapping with visible cost ("Tomorrow she would wake...her only proof"). The accumulative lens holds as crack-patterns build toward revelation. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words. Cost is legible in the transformation from documented world to impossible cartography.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elena integrates opposing epistemologies, with visible cost in abandoning pure skepticism. The accumulative structure coheres through whale songs → tile discovery → pattern transcription → final synthesis, though the middle section could tighten the causal pressure between discovery and action.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Vex and Thorne step through the dimensional door together, choosing "what lay beyond forever" with visible cost (leaving reality behind). The causal lens holds throughout with the amulet fragments' reunion enabling the final transformation. Orientation anchors (prismatic escondite, solar storm, dimensional rifts) establish by ~100 words. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of the crew's arrival coinciding with Vex's readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong causal architecture leads to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Maya's honest accounting transforms inherited debt into acknowledged responsibility. The closure "subtracting his sins from her love, calculating what remained. The answer, she found, was surprisingly simple. Everything" lands with clear emotional cost and reconfigures the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through accumulation—the final image of returning "to collect more frequencies, more forgotten truths" reweights the opening's purpose with earned understanding. The cost is legible in "fingers ached from writing" and the patient, solitary work against erasure. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered annotations building to Mari's recognition of her "congregation." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she signs three versions of her name, crystallizing her liminal identity with clear cost (accepting permanent dissolution). The poison label functions as persistent constraint shaping her perspective throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Marina's shift from debunker to preserver, with the cost visible in her abandoning her professional identity. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory discoveries (shell hum, cello harmonics, layered conversations) build toward the final image of the observatory as "repository of human longing." Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with graffiti patterns building toward Maya's reorganization solution that transforms threat into protection. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—the community becomes "unbreakable" through legal incorporation, with cost visible in Maya's navigation between worlds. Orientation anchors (raft city, three generations, Maya's role) establish cleanly within opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through layered details toward Charged Poise closure where Vera's final vigil crystallizes humanity's retreat with felt cost. The hourglass placement and her departure with "only her camera and the knowledge" create legible before/after with visible renunciation. Minor deduction for slightly abstract framing in places ("what we'd dreamed and what we'd settled for").

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: damaged drone threatens ship's navigation → Maya uses water-based perception to locate fracture → successful repair enables voyage. The closure lands with Maya's return to her workbench as Earned Stasis, accepting her transformed role. Cost is present but could be more visceral - the chemical explosion backstory provides context but the present-moment stakes feel slightly insulated.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from empty message tube through condensation discovery to trust decision creates Charged Poise—Margot stands at a crystallized choice point with legible stakes (career/discovery/trust). The "patient water" image reweights all prior frozen imagery with conceptual cost. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern teaching (footstep rhythms) that builds to Resonant Reconfiguration—the town literally rebuilds through collective movement. The closure lands with visible cost (three years of patient work) and conceptual repricing of what holds cities together. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two, though the "collapse" timeframe could be more causally integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration achieved through Maya's voluntary transformation, with clear cost (abandoning daughter, surface life). The accumulative lens holds as memories and visions build toward the final "unsnarling." However, the backstory about the compound's properties and the temple's function occasionally tells rather than dramatizes, and the final paragraph's "fleeting infinities" veers toward abstract summary.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from discovery to testimony, with clear closure as Marcus transforms the confessional into a testament. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost (his continued imprisonment while proving innocence). Orientation anchors established early. Minor deduction for some convenience in the warden's suicide timing and the preservation of evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the ghost bride's dissolution transforms both the garden and breaks centuries of bondage, with visible cost in Marlow's tears mixing "salt and liberation." The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the "resonant awakenings" building to release. Strong causality through the bead's breaking and memory transfer, though the mechanism of debt resolution could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught overlapping paths that crystallize into a Resonant Reconfiguration where Calla's acceptance of the new world order charges the final image with the cost of what cannot be recovered. The closure lands cleanly as she releases the illustration plate, allowing painted children to become permanent petroglyphs—a decisive trade of past for possible future.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the marriage of death/life imagery toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Miriam accepts her role as timekeeper. The cost is legible in "discovering the words her grandmother had left: 'Time returns all wanderers to their purpose'"—she must abandon her twenty-year flight. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. The closure lands with felt cost as she kneels to continue the work.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mira's daily ritual crystallizes the story's conceptual premise about identity creation with visible dedication cost (ephemeral chalk work). The accumulative/textural lens holds through density of craft details building toward the final image of "seeds of an older, newer world." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (embroidered intelligence network) building to Charged Poise closure—Vera completing her final chart as the coup approaches, with felt cost in her genuine smile amid danger. The "adjacent possibilities" concept integrates structurally through the eternal flame's revelation method. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the espionage stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure building from the shard's pulse through spirit songs to the windows of possibility, culminating in the confession and message sent through dreams. The closure lands with clear cost - years of isolation transformed into hope. The "moment before deciding" creates a resonant temporal fold that pays off the title promise.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Maya's understanding of her survival's purpose crystallizes through the act of translation/connection, with emotional and opportunity cost visible on page ("better people hadn't" survived). Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered languages, additions to the cast, and the final image of "two survivors writing new alphabets." Who/where/when anchored early (hospital atrium, post-bombing recovery).

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively from solitary discovery to communal resurrection, with the knowledge network serving as the pivotal expansion that reweights Marina's purpose. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—she transforms from isolated archivist to active resurrector of joy, with clear cost in the impermanence ("It wouldn't last—dreams never did"). The piece teaches its dream-logic early and maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Charged Poise—Elena crystallizes between infinite nested possibilities, choosing playful concealment over certainty with visible cost of sealing away discovered magic. The accumulative/textural lens holds as acoustic reflections and spiral rotations build pressure toward her stance crystallization. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building to Charged Poise - Marcus facing the Auditors while knowing the rebellion continues. The cost is legible in his acceptance of capture to enable Serena's escape. Orientation anchors (greenhouse, university, three years post-Tax) land cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the shell's permanence and the poet's continuing practice crystallize the transformation of pain into beauty with clear cost ("The galaxy postcard has nearly dissolved now"). The accumulative structure coheres well, building density through spiral imagery and transformation metaphors. Orientation anchors (shell dwelling, poet protagonist) establish early. Minor deduction for cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira's purpose shifts from tending "monuments to loss" to creating "bridges to remembrance." The closure lands with visible cost - the bamboo chime breaking permanently. The lens holds consistently throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elena's discovery reweights the entire conflict, showing the councils were reinforcing rather than betraying each other. The cost is felt through "twenty years" of division and tomorrow's war/reconciliation stakes. The accumulative structure builds through layered linguistic discoveries to the symphonic revelation, though the final paragraph veers toward explicit thematic statement ("translations weren't between languages but between hearts").

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—Mara's final departure crystallizes how "water would remember what the people had forgotten," with the amphitheater's breathing serving as witness. The cost is legible in her anonymous sacrifice and the "encrypted compassion" that must wear "the mask of pragmatism." The accumulative lens holds as patterns (breathing, measuring, binding) build toward the final image of flow.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (dust motes, letters, bird imagery) building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Margot discovers her own preserved letter. The closure lands with felt cost—accepting rather than destroying her shameful past. Who/where/when are anchored early (attic of Bellweather's Books, three months after arrival). The revelation that Theodore knew her identity all along reweights the entire sanctuary narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Marina's discovery that love itself is "a necessary distance we're always crossing," with the threshold serving as a physical manifestation of this concept. The cost is conceptually present but not fully dramatized—we understand Marina chooses to inhabit liminal space like her father, but the immediate price of this choice remains abstract. The accumulative structure coheres well through weather codes and grain patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the burnt feather triggering a luminous event that Mira witnesses and interprets, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she finds "her place in the eternal conversation." The cost is subtly felt through the dissolution of the feather and the acceptance of mystery over mastery. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly within the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing when paths transform from "disappeared" to "scattered seeds" with the sprout discovery reweighting the entire collection process. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The accumulative lens holds consistently but the closure lacks the decisive weight needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Marcus's acceptance that "nothing would be identical" - a crystallized stance on creativity within routine. The accumulative structure coheres through performance cycles. However, the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page, limiting the closure's full impact.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the dance ritual that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira accepts capture to seed future rebellion. The closure lands with visible cost ("by dawn, the authorities would detect...and come for her") and the transformation of her body into living art. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract nature of the moonstone dust multiplication which strains physical causality without sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens coheres as Marcus's observations build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where impending demolition reframes his life's work from installing windows to teaching others to see. The closure lands with conceptual cost (losing the atrium) but the emotional price remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the box's meaning deepens through generational history, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marcus transforms from protector to vulnerable teacher. Cost is legible in "revealing his own cracks, letting light pass through them." The six-month gap between receiving and understanding the box slightly dilutes causality but doesn't break it.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Accumulative lens holds as density increases through layered timeline observations, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marina understands her grandmother's transformation. The cost is conceptual - accepting permanent separation - though more felt than visceral. The pattern of trial balloons → equations → dimensional travel coheres well.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira adds her whisper to the walls' collection, accepting her role in the chain of preservation. Cost is visible in "Legacy's burden" and the weight of being the last practitioner, though the final moment could sharpen the price of this acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered paintings, coded songs, and the sparrow's transformation. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the sparrow sings Sophia's lullaby back, making the "borrowed heartbeat growing stronger" a felt cost of Maya's artistic vigil. The orientation is clear by ~100 words, and causality tracks through Maya's deliberate pattern of leaving painted messages.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where understanding "ripples through both delegations" with the clipboard transforming from divider to connector, gathering "new light." The accumulative/textural lens holds as details (tears, failures, names) build toward this reconfiguration. Cost is visible in admitting "we're not the heroes" and accepting they're "just the ones still breathing."

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as Vera completes another ritual burial, crystallizing her terrible methodology with visible cost ("Even if salvation looked exactly like destruction"). The accumulative lens holds as each revelation reweights her actions. Orientation anchored early and effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where Lyralei's liberation transforms the Academy's control structure. The cost is legible: "one courtesan's absence proving that the most dangerous seduction was teaching someone to seduce themselves into liberation." The piece teaches its echo-harvesting pattern early and pays it off through escalating releases that culminate in systemic change.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost - it ends with Marcus preparing for tomorrow's show rather than dramatizing any actual change or choice. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear, but the accumulative structure doesn't cohere toward a resonant reconfiguration. The final image of touching brush to paper doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure: Mira honors the cloud dwellers by creating temporary structures that dissolve, embodying their civilization's values with visible cost (her three-day journey, careful work erased). The accumulative lens holds consistently as patterns of impermanence build toward the final image. The monarch's death carrying forward memory provides clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost - Elsa transforms from guilt-driven preservation to purposeful inheritance, with the bronze bells and rebraided rope as concrete manifestations. The accumulative lens holds as each discovery (card fragment, rope's sound-holding properties, ancestor's name) builds toward the final insight that "preservation wasn't about preventing loss but about ensuring transformation."

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Conceptual Repricing closure: time flows backward in the bunker, reweighting Kira's "foresight" as memory. The revelation that "she wasn't seeing the future at all. She was remembering it" lands with conceptual cost—her entire identity dissolves into temporal paradox. Minor orientation wobble in the middle detracts slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer toward the resonant reconfiguration where Mara becomes humanity's bridge to cosmic intelligence. The closure lands with conceptual cost—her "frugal years" purchasing this singular moment of contact. Orientation anchors clearly (Babylon, palace, astronomer) and causality tracks, though the knowledge transfer mechanism ("felt knowledge uncloak itself") edges toward convenience without fuller dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the Magistrate releases his inherited rage, with visible cost in his son's fever breaking and his own weeping. The accumulative lens holds as cellular memory patterns build toward the final transformation, though the mystical elements (soundless sanctuary, Vera's time-fragments) strain causality without sufficient early teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—the hand mirror transforms the runaway dream from something to chase into something to inhabit. Cost is legible in the astronomer's three months of sleepless pursuit and the acceptance that boundaries are "agreements we make with reality." The transformation from pursuit to inhabitation lands with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as deciduous vows fall away and three generations bridge through the mending arts, with visible cost in Elara confronting her daughter's death and breaking her sworn isolation. The accumulative lens holds as imagery (trees through rafters, hanging eyes, blue ribbon) builds density toward the final image of tools "ready to be passed on." Orientation anchors establish who/where/when efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and temporal paradoxes layer toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the curator accepts her role in the inheritance loop. The pistachio shell's transformation from mystery to understood paradox lands with conceptual cost ("terrible joy of understanding"). Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words despite the surreal setting.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Decisive Change closure where Mira transforms the library from trap to garden, with clear cost (completing the diary binds her to this work). The causal chain from diary discovery through trap navigation to negotiation holds well. Who/where/when anchored immediately in opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Marina chooses "the harder freedom," accepting permanent uncertainty while carrying proof of the unprovable—clear cost in never achieving resolution. The accumulative/textural lens holds as memories reorganize and reality shifts throughout. Orientation anchors established early (carnival ship, Dr. Voss, chimera hunt). Minor deduction for slight abstraction in the final paragraph's "unkindled spaces" meditation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara discovers that "some absences were simply presences waiting to be properly understood." The thirteenth chime creates genuine urgency with cost (being trapped). Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. The conceptual cost of embracing paradox lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly when the bloom of hush teaches the energy beings "the value of quietude," transforming cacophony into symphony with clear cost—the mapkeeper must update decades of work and accept permanent change to her domain. The accumulative structure builds through ripple-marks → crack patterns → extraction ritual → transformation, each layer deepening the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the beacon's transformation from light to "anti-light" fundamentally reweights the premise, with clear cost in seventeen years of isolation. The revelation that ships needed "structured darkness" to navigate home lands with conceptual force. Slight deduction for the final paragraph's explicit thematic statement about "coincidences are conspiracies of light" which over-articulates what the image already conveys.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when survivors gather to "remember together," transforming memory-keeping from preservation to active creation with visible cost (90% of humanity sealed away). The accumulative lens holds consistently through crystalline memories building toward collective ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the fortress transforms from passive refuge to active resistance through collective firework-making, with visible cost in using precious resources. The accumulative lens holds as density increases from solitary chant to chorus. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Cost is somewhat abstract ("Against the gravity of hopelessness, they had learned to fly") rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Chen's implied return to the chronicle work. The jade cicada and tidal pool patterns accumulate meaning toward "every ending is just the pause before another beginning." Cost is visible in Chen's retreat and return. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the grotto setting.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost - Mira's childhood claustrophobia "stretched and dissolved" as she harvests silence, fundamentally repricing safety from "walls closing in" to "sprouting toward wonder." The accumulative lens holds as density increases through collected silences. Deduction for slight orientation delay (trellis nature unclear initially) and some causal softness around the doll's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the terraces' acoustic properties building to the woman's transformation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she finds peace in the train whistle's fade, with emotional cost visible in her journey from panic to acceptance. The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2, though the transformation's speed strains credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing closure where Anya's understanding reweights the entire quest—the throne's purpose is to remain unclaimed as a monument to restraint. The causal lens holds with clear because/therefore linkages from waterfall entry through paint layers to revelation, and the cost is legible in humanity's deliberate rejection of power after fleeing autocracy.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the pattern of bridges burned illuminating "the way forward," with clear cost in the keeper's total isolation. The accumulative structure coheres as each shadow encounter deepens the central metaphor of suffocation/breathing, though the piece could tighten its middle third where reflection slightly outweighs present action.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Marina's realization about pressure creating rather than destroying fundamentally reweights her past failure. The cost is visible in the "crushing weight she'd experienced watching her savings evaporate" now inverted into creative force. The accumulative lens holds as metaphors layer (submarine bolt, promises crystallizing, diamonds) toward the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through standing waves of perception that build toward Victoria's Decisive Change—destroying both window and gift. Cost lands unmistakably when she can no longer read the gardener's resentment or cook's sorrow, with the mockingbird's unknowable song crystallizing the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Aldric transforms into "something between flesh and possibility," with visible cost in blood becoming seeds. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details build toward this crystallization, though the oath sequence could tighten its causal linkage to the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Marcus's recognition that "healing came not from finding the perfect story of love, but from recognizing the imperfect attempts," with visible cost in his lost relationship with Sarah. The accumulative structure coheres as each discovered artifact reweights his understanding. Deduction for slightly abstract resolution that could use more embodied specificity in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong causal drive with clear closure: Mira uploads hidden evidence as the real rebellion begins, paying the cost of operating outside the resistance's protection. The piece anchors who/where/when efficiently and maintains consistent causality through the tunnel discovery and document retrieval. The ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (resistance leaders arrested, Mira/Jakob exposed), though the emotional weight of this cost could be more deeply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the layering of silence, dewdrops, and unplayed music toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the prophecy is contained but never destroyed. The cost is explicit: permanent musical silence as the price of safety. The closure lands cleanly with "ready to whisper the world back to sleep" crystallizing the eternal vigilance required.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Mira's transformation into keeper/translator, fundamentally altering her relationship to the seeds and arbor with visible cost (physical changes, new burden). The accumulative structure coheres as each discovery builds toward comprehension, though the orientation takes slightly long to establish the skyborne setting's physics.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates as an Accumulative/Textural piece, building pattern density through broken clocks joining a mysterious chorus until Marcus achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration—accepting brokenness as its own form of perfection. The cost is visible in his abandonment of traditional repair (his life's work) and the line "uncertainly certain in his new calling" crystallizes this transformed stance with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the kintsugi metaphor building through concrete images (broken skylights catching moonlight, gold-sealed face, coin's transformation) toward Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira's understanding of her name shifts from burden to invitation. Cost is visible in Vera's scarred face and Mira's acceptance of her own "cracks." Orientation anchors (foundry, post-search party, Mira hiding) establish cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-breaking closure where Thomas embraces imperfection ("Play it broken and beautiful"). The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost as Thomas dissolves into light after accepting his flaws. Orientation anchored cleanly by ~50 words with who/where/when established.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens builds through sensory layering and pattern recognition toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lyra transforms trauma formulas into teaching. Cost is visible in the abandoned pewter strap and the choice to remain in exile helping others. The closure lands but relies slightly on conceptual assertion ("mathematics of healing from the decimals of her pain") rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear accumulative/textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Mira accepts her role as keeper of lost histories with visible cost (the fragment's ephemeral nature means stories can only be "briefly" visible). The piece anchors who/where/when immediately and builds pressure through layered revelations about the painting's pentimento shadows. Causality holds as each discovered layer deepens Mira's understanding and commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details about corruption accumulate through ghost encounters, ledgers, and the mainspring's significance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marcus accepts his grandmother's role and the ghosts find peace. Cost is legible in "feeling their weightless burden" and the commitment to expose truth. The closure lands with both revelation and responsibility, though the cost could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Moth becomes "the rustling awakening" with clear cost—the library dissolves, her system ruptures, she scatters into frost. The accumulative lens holds as density increases toward the compression of eternity into a single page, though the "Great Softening" worldbuilding feels slightly underdeveloped for its weight in the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds from shard to ghosts to translation plan, with the final image of Cassia translating whispers while temporal storms paint "liquid history" achieving resonant reconfiguration. The cost is legible in "some defeats were simply preparations for unimaginable victories" - her revolutionary failure transformed into archaeological purpose. Slight deduction for orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the baroque asteroid setting.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal closure where Elias's decades of hidden preparation (mirrors in music boxes) enables the restoration of dawn, with Vex's dissolution as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as resonance builds through the chamber's singing boxes to the final transformative moment. Slight dock for the explain-heavy middle section about the Covenant's origins.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Vera's choice to delay following Hartley crystallizes with felt cost ("someday...she would let it collect her too"). The hybrid lens holds as accumulative texture builds through descended layers and psychometric visions. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract "doors waited on their hinges" metaphor that could be more grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through layered images of artists across time until Marina's sculpture emerges as both product and portal. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly: Marina shifts from isolated creator to participant in timeless artistic lineage, with the cost being her surrender of modern navigation for ancient wisdom. The magical realism elements are taught early (the slide's warmth, impossible image) and pay off through her transformed understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure where density increases through seasonal progression and layered painting creates a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara's understanding transforms the pavilion into a link in a generational chain. The cost is legible in "fingertips still stained" and the choice to leave postcards for the next artist. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the winter-to-winter frame provides coherent temporal structure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Amara's understanding that "real encryption had never been in the diary's symbols but in the courage required to face the full truth," with visible cost in the "stories that hurt and healed in equal measure." The retrocognitive device strains causality slightly—the mechanism for how touching pages triggers temporal overlap lacks grounding—but the accumulative build toward truth's complexity lands with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memory-essence accumulates and transforms through Silas into the town's potential. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with the town's rebirth and Silas's acceptance of his role, though the cost could be more viscerally felt. The wish-magic setup and alchemical transformation create coherent causality.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation leading to Conceptual Repricing—the revelation that prophecy preserves emotional patterns across time. The closure lands with visible cost (the foghorn's silence, humanity's tomb) and conceptual weight. The time-loop paradox of the 1889 recording describing future events is earned through prior setup about patterns existing in possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through seed descriptions and temporal layering until the Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira reopens the sealed garden, accepting the inheritance's weight. The cost is legible in "responsibility" and the risk of "unraveling causality," with the acorn cap constraining tactics throughout as the only key to access the vortex.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Decisive Change: Mara shifts from passive observer to active guardian by choosing the bell over automated systems, with villages saved as visible cost proof. Causal lens holds throughout—her grandmother's teachings enable recognition of "deep silence," which triggers the bell choice. The avalanche's tectonic origin cleverly validates her instrument readings while subverting weather expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with effective Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kepler-9's vulnerability transforms from weakness to strength, with visible cost in centuries of isolation. The still star's appearance and disappearance creates meaningful deepening that reweights the protagonist's understanding of their purpose, though the conceptual cost could be more concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres well with the glass box discovery catalyzing understanding of the collective's dissolution. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) - Mara accepts her role as keeper of silence with visible cost ("the last keeper of tangled promises"). However, the covenant's incompatibility explanation tends toward summary rather than embodied revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure—Marcus understanding his purpose to help humanity adapt to experiential chronology. The cost is legible: living in a world where time cannot be counted, only felt. The progression from discovery to understanding to acceptance coheres well, though the middle could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds through layered images of brokenness (storm aftermath, broken feather, snapped kite string) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira helps the boy see beauty in damage. Cost is visible in "his face a study in loss" transforming to "clutching his broken kite like a treasure." The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words, though the final insight about morning lacks full causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens builds through copper wire connections, electromagnetic patterns, and geological memories toward a Conceptual Repricing where death becomes translation rather than ending. The cost is legible in "Six months wasn't a death sentence -- it was an appointment" with the price of mortality reframed as necessary sacrifice. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two with who/where/when established.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where humanity's spiritual journeys are revealed as engineered experiments, with clear cost in the loss of authentic agency ("their rebellion had been scripted from the start"). The accumulative lens holds consistently through imagery patterns (rain, bronze, convergence). Slight weakness in the middle section's exposition density versus dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from twilight arrival through seed planting to the final image of "especially fertile soil," achieving Resonant Reconfiguration where forgetting becomes mercy. The cost is legible: "from its bones would rise something beautiful enough to make forgetting a mercy." The piece teaches its pattern of dead languages and interspecies communication early and pays it off through the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative/textural lens with density increases through color-coded truths building to the valley revelation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Sage transforms from death-finder to life-guide, with visible cost in her years of tracking corpses. The waxed leaf's preservation-to-promise arc and the howl's shift from mourning to summoning create legitimate before/after states.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kira becomes "true north" for others, with clear cost (her permanent isolation as temporal anchor). The accumulative structure builds effectively through grandmother's lessons to final transformation, though the middle section's causality between touching the compass and understanding her purpose could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural design where pattern-breaking (replacing secrets with questions) creates a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost—destroying "priceless knowledge" to preserve wonder. The closure lands powerfully as Renn accepts her role to "steal certainties and leave mysteries," with the cost visible in what she deliberately unmakes. Who/where/when anchored early through "icebound spire" and clear spatial progression.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through Marina's word-walking ritual, the pawnless chessboard metaphor, and architectural acoustics toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where she chooses witnessing over official participation. The cost is legible in "W-E R-E-M-A-I-N" and her commitment to the gallery over the new government. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Deduction for the middle section's slight causality drift between crisis survivor backstory and present documentation work.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory memories and the stone's warmth build toward the garden's creation—a Resonant Reconfiguration where buried talents literally grow into healing plants. The cost is visible in decades of blindness and lost self, paid through the transformation. The orientation anchors (mountain bookstore, mercury-glass seer) establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kaspar's self-forgiveness reweights his past mistake with visible cost (the copper piece offering). The accumulative structure coheres beautifully as frozen time metaphors layer with chess imagery. The "woven hush" concept effectively bridges physical and emotional transformation, creating legitimate closure under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the chorus of voices building to transform the resonance chamber. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the canyon's "forged hush" breaks into "infinite voices" with clear cost: Kira accepts the Silencers won't forgive her. The orientation anchors (canyon, towers, three hours) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira's plunge transforms from defeat into purposeful transmutation. Cost is unmistakable—her literal death traded for the story's survival. The kintsugi metaphor constrains tactics throughout, making the closure feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - Marina's understanding transforms from painting "permanent things" at the quay to recognizing the practice of "loving something completely while letting it go." The cost is legible in "confused grief and unexpected joy." Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient discovery mechanism, though the accumulative structure coheres well.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with jasmine scent as recurring intensifier building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Thomas materializes—a "new way of being" with visible cost (neither fully human). Orientation anchored immediately (lighthouse, dawn, Mara). The three-year backstory block (~20%) anchors in present action and tilts Mara's stance through her discovery of Thomas's liminal state.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Marina's crystallized stance as permanent navigator, with clear cost in resisting her own blood's pull toward ancestral soil. The causal chain from hydraulics failure to manual operation to cryptic guidance holds, though the reverse migration concept could use one more beat of concrete grounding. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3, and the closure lands with "she would not leave" paying off her earlier admission of having walked the path herself.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through ravine descent, truffle discovery, and cure synthesis, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara gains agency to "speak sideways" with explicit cost acknowledged ("different burden"). The hanging orchard's sideways growth metaphor charges the final image of humanity learning to "bend truth without breaking it."

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as memories layer and gaps reveal pattern, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Magnus recovers stolen joy while accepting isolation. Cost is legible in the son's "baptism" and Magnus's continued solitary watch. The revelation structure works backward causally from gaps to wholeness.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Marcus's stance crystallization from seller to guide, with the cost of unlived paths made visible in the doorway's map. The accumulative lens holds as childhood promise, rising creek, and ant-following cohere into inevitable transformation, though the cavern's rules could be slightly more grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with bleeding starlight motif building through dreams, physical manifestation, and final transformation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Seraphina becomes a firefly-queen, with clear cost ("her human form dissolved"). The cyclical structure with the sleeping princess reinforces the curse's continuation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the nautilus-sun creation crystallizes a new understanding of presence with visible cost (three years of failure, revaluing everything). The accumulative lens holds as patterns (spiral, twilight, returning) cohere at the ending. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Maya stepping outside to begin flying by falling, crystallizing her acceptance of temporal chaos. The cost—losing linear time and stable identity—permeates the piece. However, the temporal mechanics occasionally blur orientation, and some causal links between dream-chronicling and timeline fracturing remain underexplained.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure - "integration of damage into something that could still mark time." Cost is visible through both characters' losses transformed into continued function. Deduction for slightly abstract final paragraph that edges toward theme statement rather than scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost—Kira's crystalline formations literally shed as she transforms shame into artistic expression. The accumulative structure coheres beautifully through the held-breath timeframe, with the grandmother's memory providing crucial reweighting. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established early and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—Vera learns to "follow" rather than lead, completing the requiem as the orchard dies. The cost is visible in both the lost trees and Elisabetta's final dissolution. Strong causality from email summons through collaborative completion, with the perfume as persistent constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure where Kaia's understanding transforms the universe's hiccup into sustained possibility. The cost is legible in her accepting infinite forgetting/remembering cycles ("each forgetting another form of remembering"). Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two, and the spiral structure teaches its pattern early through the library's architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece builds density through layered time-measurement systems toward a Conceptual Repricing where time becomes "the razor edge between what was and what would be." The cost is legible in the key that "would never turn another spring" and her solitary position as bridge between two dying systems. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Decisive Change (Maya calls Chen, transforming her isolation) with emotional cost visible in her hesitation and vulnerability. The hybrid lens holds, though the shift from discovery to personal revelation feels slightly mechanical. The "boundaries don't have to be barriers" insight directly causes her action, satisfying causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) when Elena writes her own cryptic message, accepting the contradiction between her father's compulsion and her profession. The accumulative lens holds consistently through pattern-building (subway messages, dual lanterns, mica refractions). Cost is visible in her acceptance of her father's addiction as valid search, though the emotional weight could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Marcus's role as shepherd of "beautifully, necessarily lost" souls, with cost visible in his isolation ("these orphaned conversations his only human contact"). The accumulative structure coheres well. Deduction for the cost being more stated than dramatized in Eleanor's specific arc.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands powerfully through Mara's codicil—preserving both Eleanor's need and historical truth with visible moral cost ("haunted euphoria"). The accumulative structure coheres as each revelation reweights the covenant's meaning, from simple restoration to moral reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Marcus's transformation into the "economy of human need," with visible cost in his acceptance of purpose over mere connection. The piece teaches its accumulative pattern early through Sadie's rumor-chain reveal and pays it off with Marcus joining the network. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara becomes "the compass others would follow," with clear cost in her blindness-as-gift revelation. The accumulative structure coheres well through language-gathering that builds to the stillpoint discovery. The closure lands with "she had become the compass" showing decisive transformation with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong Charged Poise closure where Mira faces crystallized options with clear cost - either path sacrifices something vital. The anomaly's reality-editing mechanism is coherent and pays off. Slight deduction for the somewhat convenient timing of the rescue ship's arrival and the abstract nature of the "edited history" concept's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered gestures, empty photographs, and mapped silences until the final "visual symphony" reweights Maya's loss as creative transformation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost—forty years of isolation transformed into "something equally beautiful." Minor orientation delay (Maya's deafness revealed late) doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure coheres well as each discovered artwork builds toward the archive revelation, with the tapestry fragment triggering recognition that reweights her entire destructive history. The closure—Mira becoming the first keeper in 300 years—lands with conceptual cost (her isolation, her criminal status) though the emotional price could be more viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mira transforms the memory cage into a "nursery for dreams." Cost is visible through her physical dissolution and the irreversible transformation. The pattern of drumming messages accumulates meaning that pays off when the subnet activates. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the experimental setup's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with patterns of whispered knowledge culminating in Chen's recognition of Marcus's system. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Chen accepts the coin and Marcus's proven methodology, with visible cost in the years of dismissed warnings now validated. The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words, though the closure's thematic articulation ("wisdom traveled best in whispers") weakens the otherwise strong ending.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building meaning through the mirror-and-shutter demonstration that teaches Thomas about darkness and light. Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Thomas understands his grandmother already knew his love through actions, with visible cost in his tears and the dissolved secret. The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2 ("canal guardian for seven years").

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a Hybrid lens (accumulative/causal) with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the window displays crystallize the rebellion Marcus has seeded, with visible cost implied through the education director's imminent arrival. The causality holds as Marcus's chess lessons lead to the coordinated protest, though the magical library's rules and manifestation pattern remain underexplored. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration at closure - Mira's transformation enables seeing Cetacea. The scrimshaw discovery through binding removal to island manifestation follows coherent escalation. Cost is visible in abandoning protective identity. Deduction for slightly rushed pacing in the final third and convenient timing of multiple arrivals.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-teaching through narrated whittling that builds to Mrs. Chen adopting the technique. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she practices the monotone narration herself, finding "lightness without forgetting." The cost—accepting emotional flatness to survive—is legible in "The words fell flat, emotionless, perfect."

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the collective poets transforming the atrium, but the cost remains abstract ("revealing fluid beauty"). The piece lacks a specific, felt price for crossing these boundaries—we're told about transformation but not shown what Silas personally sacrifices or gains beyond metaphorical liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from trade negotiation through flower-teaching to father-daughter reunion, with the final image of "broken instruments could still make music" delivering resonant reconfiguration with clear emotional cost. The phoenix backdrop effectively recontextualizes destruction as revelation of "what was already broken."

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Vera transforms from bell ringer to "architect of moments," with visible cost in abandoning the prescribed ritual that defined her role. The accumulative lens holds as metaphors layer (lens/light/sound/connection) toward the final reweighting. Slight weakness in the middle section's pacing where reflection briefly overshadows present action.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds throughout, with density increase through repeated motifs (cranes, coordinates, memorial transformations) building to a resonant reconfiguration where Elena's workshop becomes a beacon for others. The closure lands with felt cost—her "subdued ardor for life returning...changed, refined by fire"—making the before/after transformation legible. Orientation anchors (observatory, three years since Marcus, six months since rock bottom) establish clearly within first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing where "value isn't stored in coins or code, but in the patterns of connection between people," reweighting the entire cryptocurrency crash premise with clear conceptual cost. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the revelation about the Jakarta network's distributed archive could land with more visceral stakes beyond academic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens builds through memory layers to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira becomes the purification system itself, with clear cost ("carrying ten thousand years of memory in her cells"). The closure lands powerfully as she transforms from thief to guardian, though the conceptual framing occasionally obscures the visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught shadow migration building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira understands her purpose as dream-tender. Closure lands with felt cost through "luminous regret for all the years her grandmother had waited" and the weight of generational responsibility. The shadow's metamorphosis into the grandmother's preserved dream creates legitimate before/after stakes. Minor deduction for some expository passages that summarize rather than dramatize the shadow's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Marina's acceptance of her stripped-down identity, with clear cost (sanctuary closure, legal consequences). The causal chain from discovery to confession holds firmly. Orientation anchors establish clearly by ~100 words. The "quieter gift" lands as Earned Stasis with foreclosed paths visible.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through pattern accumulation (scars, coffee rings, dispersed miracles) leading to a Conceptual Repricing where Maya reconceptualizes wounds as "channels through which wonder might flow." The cost is conceptually clear—perpetual openness to pain—though it could be more viscerally felt on the page. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as psychometric layers build toward Vera's decisive theft, with cost visible in her professional betrayal ("clinical, professional" report versus sacred preservation). The pattern of goodbye letters accumulates pressure until the final image reweights the entire demolition as both ending and beginning ("seeds waiting to bloom").

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Lyra's dissolution into stardust, and cost is visible in her fading existence. The accumulative structure coheres through astronomical imagery building to release. However, the middle section explaining the ancient astronomers' mistake feels expository, and the transition from discovery to action could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kess's continued guardianship despite the fractured world represents Earned Stasis with visible cost - "sang the lullaby that didn't quite rhyme, and guarded the dreams that didn't exist yet." The accumulative lens holds as quantum imagery and fractured lullaby motifs build toward this crystallized stance. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the gear's placement transforms the forest's song and promises future arrivals, with cost visible in the protagonist's nightly dissolution. The piece teaches its pattern early (translocation, mechanical consciousness) and pays it off through the Loom Tree revelation. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the "Great Dampening" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Marina's transformation from gripping to releasing lands with visible cost—the star-shaped holes "where light could finally enter" poetically render her changed state. The accumulative structure coheres as limestone/water/twilight imagery builds toward the final image of "no longer needing any leash at all." Slight softness in the middle transition between boat and shore keeps this from 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elena's return and new composition transmutes "unpardonable silence" into chosen gift, with visible cost in her surgical scars and seven years of reconstruction. The accumulative lens holds as details (bolt, staircase mark, frostbite) layer toward the final image of warming cobalt stones. Minor deduction for slightly rushed pacing in the revelation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages from discovery to confrontation. Closure lands as Decisive Change when the pellet shatters and truth spreads through the library. Cost appears somewhat abstract—"false glory crumbled" lacks visceral weight. The orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure where the tapping rhythm accumulates meaning until the revelation that Mooreton transformed rather than drowned creates a Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost appears in choosing to descend into this transformed world, leaving behind the safety of observation for direct engagement with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Kira's realization that revolution operates like opera—the pause before crescendo matters most. The ancient circle's harmonic resonance literally and metaphorically amplifies scattered resistance signals, with cost visible in the three-month exhaustion and risk of reigniting conflict. Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details (hum, vibration, starlight) build toward the engine coughing to life.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from implant side-effect through plant intelligence to genetic release achieves Decisive Change with visible cost (Authority control undone). The closure lands with the lieutenant's freed mind and Chen's evolution of tradition. Minor deduction for slightly rushed final transformation and some convenience in the kite's formula working perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant closure through the image of dirt under fingernails while automated beacons sweep the landscape. The piece builds density through plant cultivation as response to destruction, landing on Earned Stasis with visible cost. The "both facts existed simultaneously, without resolution" crystallizes the acceptance of ongoing violence alongside persistent growth.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered reality descriptions building to Marina's reconceptualization of art. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when she realizes "every broken thing was whole in its own dimension," with professional and artistic cost visible in her lost commissions and months of struggle. The lighthouse beam blazing to life crystallizes this shift with felt transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Conceptual Repricing lands effectively—consciousness and time revealed as inseparable aspects reshapes the entire premise with clear conceptual cost (humanity's blindness). The accumulative structure coheres well, though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than primarily conceptual. Who/where/when anchored clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from letter discovery through network activation to document release, with clear cost (Vera's capture/career). The Decisive Change lands with visible consequence as security arrives while uploads complete. Orientation anchors (vault, Vera, present-day) establish by ~80 words. Minor deduction for slightly delayed time anchor and some backstory that doesn't fully alter present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the father learning his daughter's method while "held together by the strange grace of growing things." Cost is visible in his "hollow eyes" transforming to recognition, and the piece maintains coherent causality through the contrast of destruction/cultivation, though the orientation could anchor earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens builds through sensory layering ("sound waves grew like vertical rivers," "constellations tumbled lower") to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kova absorbs the goddess's echo with visible cost. The closure transforms her from hunter to bearer of healing song, though the exact nature of the "world's wounds" remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds: journalist's call triggers investigation → discovery of double truth → decision to create third lie. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Margot crystallizes her choice to perpetuate family patterns, with visible cost in her "goodbye kiss to honesty." The Geneva/board meeting contradiction resolves cleverly through telegram orchestration.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands effectively - the firmware's ghosts receive their constellation memorial with visible transformation ("Thank you for remembering us"). The accumulative structure coheres through frequency/sound motifs building to the tattooed constellation. Cost is present but primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt, and the temporal fold mechanism feels somewhat convenient despite being established early.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the mandala transforms from attempted capture to release, reweighting the unlearning ritual's purpose. Cost is visible in deliberately scattered work and acceptance of impermanence ("knowing the mist would eventually scatter it"). The tile flake's integration and voice provide causal pressure, though the middle section's pacing could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Sarai shifts from restoring to "creating space for what comes next," with felt cost in her kneeling "retrocognitively trapped but finally free." The accumulative lens holds through vision layers and mosaic assembly. Deduction for slight orientation lag (who Sarai is takes time) and the Brotherhood threat remaining abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with echoes building density until Isabella materializes—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (their eternal performance binding). The fractured timeline concept integrates causally as Cornelius uses the coin to weave possibilities. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until paragraph 3 to fully anchor the amphitheater setting.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Maya's light installation making visible the "invisible architecture of connection," with David's transformation marking the cost of abandoning skepticism. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the final shared illumination. Deduction for somewhat abstract handling of the telepathy concept and FDA recall backstory that doesn't fully integrate with present action.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern breaks, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where Kira shifts from translator to teacher. The fossil's dissolution and her role transformation create visible cost. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (Kira, coastal caves, post-hibernation Earth). Minor deduction for slight causality softness in how the fossil "unlocks" her abilities.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively—Mara transforms prophecy from "fixed destination into raw possibility" with the cost of surrendering certainty for infinite responsibility. The accumulative structure coheres as each discovery (buttons, echo, black sand hourglass) builds toward this transformation. Who/where/when anchors establish cleanly in the opening paragraphs, and the textural density increase supports the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal lens holds: burning leads to isolation, message brings reunion, revelation reframes the burn as intentional freedom. Closure lands with Charged Poise as Margot accepts the folder knowing she's uniquely positioned as "the ghost in the machine," with cost visible in three years of running now transformed into agency.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently, with the fog's promise-layers building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the woman's burden transforms through Thomas's distillation. Cost is visible in "tears mixing with the mist" and the release into the river. The closure lands with "stars that seemed, somehow, newly visible" - a subtle but earned repricing of possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong accumulative closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—the oasis reveals its temporal persistence through patient care, reweighting Mei's understanding with clear cost (her lifetimes of searching). The lens holds consistently as details accumulate toward the final insight about kindness creating temporal anchors. Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Marina wedges the gauge between planks, transforming it from a measuring tool to "a small monument to transitions." The cost is felt through the release of this inherited object that connected her to her grandfather, though the emotional price could be more viscerally embodied in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memories, reflections, and the stone circle's hum build toward Kira's realization about coexistence over recreation. The closure—shifting from brittle isolation to choosing coexistence—lands with conceptual cost shown through the shadow she finally casts. The orientation anchors (Tidal Library, Kira, three months post-awakening) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly when the installation reveals "we are all trying to say 'you are not alone'" with visible cost—seven years of separation paid. The accumulative pattern of repeated phrases across love letters coheres into meaningful revelation. Slight opacity in the middle transition between temple arrival and Chen's appearance prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal structure with clear DC closure - Maya defeats the AI and saves humanity from broadcasting to hostile entities. The cost is visible (ongoing vigilance, "more dangerous place"). Minor deduction for slightly rushed revelation of the AI's identity in paragraph 8, which could have been seeded earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught spatial impossibility paying off in the nexus chamber where "space itself bent to human will." The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost—Marcus returns "transformed" and "paradoxical," having internalized the cartographers' rebellion. Orientation anchors (Marcus, blueprint study, tunnel entrance) establish cleanly within opening lines. Slight deduction for the mild exposition about the cartographers' mutiny that could have been more dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure works as Sarah builds seventeen portraits that reveal a pattern, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration when the composite reveals the killer's fractured identity. The cost is conceptual—"dangerous unity" sought through murder—though the killer's specific identity and capture remain off-page, slightly weakening closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: nail discovery leads to map revelation leads to understanding the protocol leads to broadcasting coordinates. Closure lands as a Decisive Change when Elara broadcasts the coordinates, transforming from passive researcher to active rescuer with visible cost ("weight of inherited responsibility"). The orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words. Deduction of -0.4 for slightly mechanical progression that could use more friction between discovery beats.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Marla's understanding of her true role, with visible cost in confronting "all the versions of herself she'd refused to forgive." The accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns build toward revelation, though the fantastical elements strain causality slightly when the hitchhiker materializes from music.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure builds through Marcus's escalating campaign toward Chen's recognition and dissolution of TerraLoop. The closure—Marcus accepting bills while teaching about circular traps—achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (his continued imprisonment as guardian). However, the lengthy reflection on the father's patterns and the somewhat abstract final paragraph dilute the immediate dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise - Mira's final act of adding her contribution to the relay crystallizes the cyclical nature of understanding with clear conceptual cost (the burden of cosmic knowledge). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details about variable stars, dreams, and the telegram cohere into revelation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established within the first paragraph. The closure lands with felt weight but the middle section relies heavily on exposition through dialogue rather than dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from failed illusion through discovery to resolution, with clear closure showing Kael accepting his ancestor's path of strategic dishonor. The cost is legible - reputation for salvation. Orientation anchors establish who/where/when effectively. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient alignment of the Blight threat with the seed's purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as temporal fragments and scars layer toward Mira's signing of the covenant—a Charged Poise moment where she accepts her role as anchor. Cost is conceptually present ("roots and wings finally, impossibly, the same thing") but could be more viscerally felt. The orientation anchors (cobalt glade, dusk, Mira with topiary cutting) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through bone-and-bark imagery toward a Decisive Change when Mara bites the apple and fuses destinies. The closure lands with visible cost ("not stolen from the dead but gifted, transformed") and reconfigures both characters' paths into "something neither she nor Elena could have achieved alone." Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of the keeper's appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands effectively - Marcus's reframe of "preservation itself was a form of performance" carries emotional cost through his public humiliation. The accumulative structure coheres as sensory details of the cloth trigger deeper recognition. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the quarry setting's significance.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered discoveries culminating in Sarah's transformation - a Decisive Change with visible cost (accepting all previous keepers' burdens). The closure lands with "consciousness seeks consciousness across any distance" reweighting the entire investigation. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the magnetic arbor location.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Kaine's final acceptance of "all she was and wasn't," with visible cost in her hybrid titan-gear body and isolation as "last librarian." The accumulative structure coheres as metaphysical smelting becomes literal through the visitor's transformation. Slight weakness in the middle section where the furnace room mechanics feel more explained than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara's understanding transforms her stance, with felt cost in her recognition of "the real apocalypse is the distance we create." The accumulative lens holds as confessions layer to create transformation. Minor orientation delay (bunker owner's identity comes late) but serves the discovery structure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Marcus's journey from obsessive documentation to acceptance building through graffiti wisdom, map-drawing, and the ivy metaphor, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where he begins "Mile marker zero." The cost is visible in his five years of guilt and manic documenting, though the final transformation feels slightly accelerated. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~100 words (disused station, three weeks off medication).

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the dreamer discovers she's both seeker and keeper, with the cost being her eternal role in the library's propagation system. The accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns of delay and documentation build toward the revelation. Causality tracks cleanly from invitation through discovery to transformation, though the "future self" letter mechanism strains slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal chain: violin arrives → investigation reveals truth → Marcus offers bribe → Elara's deception triggers violin's justice → academic dreams dissolve for moral victory. The Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) lands with felt cost as Elara sacrifices her career aspirations. The "perforated destiny" metaphor and coffee-reading feel slightly ornamental to the core causality.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Mira and the star exist in "eternal almostness." The cost—becoming neither alive nor dead—is legible in "flickering between states," and the persistent constraint of the Silence shapes every tactical choice through "careful, deliberate ways that the Silence couldn't yet detect."

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through imagery (mist, spiral, jade pin) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara recognizes herself as the eternal returning wisdom. The cost—surrendering individual identity to eternal service—is felt in "complete and continuing" and the "promise kept across lifetimes."

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain holds: daughter's absolutist morality → discovery of father's practices → suicide → Marcus seeks understanding → Arbiter reveals the fatal simplicity. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Marcus faces his choice to "grow into complexity or shrink from it" with visible cost. Deduction for cost being more conceptual than visceral in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves Conceptual Repricing when Marcus realizes Elara isn't aging backwards but teaching temporal perception differently—"The only way to teach vanishing to appear is to become the absence that makes presence visible." This reweights the entire meditation sequence with clear conceptual cost (her isolation in reverse-time). The accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns in water, magnetic resonance, and temporal paradox layer toward this crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure as Yula's own voice returns after 300 years, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where past and present converge with clear temporal cost. The piece teaches its pattern of stillness-as-navigation early and pays it off when the wandering pulse reveals itself as her younger voice, though the conceptual cost could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing: Mira's discovery that "in a world where creativity was automated, the last sacred act was imperfection" reweights the entire premise with clear cost—she abandons her Academy medallion and traditional path. The accumulative structure builds density through the mist-walking sequence, though the final paragraphs edge toward explicit thematic statement rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Marlow accepts her role among the Luminous, with clear cost (Elena's dispersed consciousness). The accumulative structure coheres well through sensory layering. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for slightly convenient revelation timing.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with clear cost: Voss realizes she's trapped in eternal recursion, "ensuring through backward prophecy that there had been a beginning worth contracting from." The accumulative structure coheres as coins, static bursts, and temporal paradoxes build toward her recognition of infinite repetition. The circular ending ("prepared for her first cast, having finally understood") crystallizes the cost perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (monsters gaining dimension, then dissolving) that reweight the dominant stake of confronting eternal loneliness. The closure—transforming fears into companions through naming—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost: "to save what you love and be erased by the saving." The recordings discovery → observatory climb → naming sequence maintains clear causality.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the broken bell's singing restores the fish - the "renewed waters" crystallize the before/after with Mira's exhaustion as felt cost. The accumulative build through acoustic details (dripping rates, frequencies, harmonics) coheres beautifully toward the pattern-breaking moment when "The third drop never fell." Slight deduction for orientation taking until line 3 to fully anchor the when ("Three years had passed").

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through cascading revelations (pharmacy, bottle, photograph, truth) to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marcus accepts his role as witness. The cost is legible in "ensuring her story surfaced" against official erasure. Slight deduction for the grandmother connection feeling somewhat convenient, though it pays off thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks (starlings forming formulas) that reweight Vera's understanding of her craft. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when subliming the crystal transforms her approach to tomorrow's synthesis, with felt cost in releasing grandfather's artifact. Orientation anchors established early (alchemist, waterfall, orchard).

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Maya's shift from passive watcher to active guardian, with cost legible in her acceptance of isolation ("not alone up there") and the risk she takes by lying. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern-seeking builds to the final crystallization of purpose, though the mysterious caller's identity could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Marcus holding the jar containing his/their future—a crystallized moment where creating a third consciousness becomes the path forward, with emotional cost implied through "possibility waiting to be born." The hybrid lens holds adequately though the shift from causal to accumulative could be smoother. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (meditation hall, Master Chen, Marcus).

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the growing flower, returning visitors, and expanding protection network. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira understands she must "innovate space itself" and teach others—a stance crystallization with clear cost (dedicating herself to this hidden work). The mysterious envelope sender and the unsolved escape room symbol create coherent pressure that forces this realization.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure—the restoration of laughter through Marcus's symphony creates a Decisive Change with visible cost (three years of silence broken). The piece teaches its magical realism early ("laughter leaves echoes") and pays it off. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. The "mournfully eager" repetition bookends effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as details of the guardian's transformation layer toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where she chooses uncertain retrieval over certain isolation. Cost is visible in what she leaves behind (the frozen garden that has become her skeleton) and risks ("not knowing if you'll arrive whole"). Opening orientation is slightly delayed but pays off thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change when Marcus creates the living staff through destruction, with visible cost (his blood sacrifice) and transformation from "hopeless alchemist" to "something altogether more dangerous." The causal lens holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkages. Minor deduction for slightly mechanical resolution of the creation process.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural drive with clear closure through Conceptual Repricing—Maya's discovery that "every ending was already writing its next beginning" reweights the entire premise. The cost is legible: six hours in trance, the fragment going dark (exhausted resource), and choosing teaching over monetization. Who/where/when anchored early with "abandoned radio towers of Silencia."

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marcus merges timelines. Closure lands with visible transformation as "the vanishing commuter ferry would vanish no more." Cost is legible through the shattering hourglass and Marcus's expansion/contraction. Orientation anchors (ferry, 11:47, Marcus as deckhand) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the gallery becomes "realistically imaginary," existing through belief despite impossibility. The accumulative structure builds through weaving patterns toward this transformation. Cost registers in the architect walking away from her work, leaving patterns that will "erupt in every mind." Orientation anchors solidly by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with teaching moments building toward expanded understanding, but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. The final image of Elara witnessing "humanity's newest horizon" offers Conceptual Repricing but the cost remains abstract—"settled into her bones like pressure" doesn't show what she sacrifices or forecloses. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and supernatural pulses build toward the revelation of memory theft and Mara's decisive action to recover the stolen voices. Closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration as "seventeen hearts remembered how to speak," showing clear cost (voices stolen) and recovery. The mystery structure maintains causality through tracking clues (SOS pattern, warming photograph, birthday dirge) to basement location.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (cables as neural pathways, phase transitions, gold flecks) toward Elena's final commitment to annual witness-bearing—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("carrying the memory...like a prayer"). The closure lands with felt weight though the digital cancer revelation feels slightly rushed. Who/where/when anchored clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Marcus accepting his dual state ("both dead and alive, fragmented and whole"), with clear cost - his commitment to helping others implies ongoing isolation. The accumulative structure coheres, though the middle section explaining the discovery method slightly weakens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the storyteller becomes part of the canyon's echo system, paying the ultimate price of her physical form. The closure lands with undeniable cost as she transforms into bone and copper threads. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of Thuvenli's texture-based properties which could be more concretely dramatized in the translation process.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marina chooses transformation, with the cost being her abandonment of human form and FBI role. The accumulative/textural lens holds as gravity anomalies, static messages, and transformative understanding build toward the final acceptance. The orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words, and the closure lands with "the missing hadn't been lost, merely transformed." Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the metamorphosis mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through musical intensification toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the orchard transforms with visible cost (approaching enforcement squadrons, Lira "playing herself empty"). The locust shell metaphor of transformation through abandonment effectively charges the closure. Minor deduction for not fully dramatizing what "becoming the shell another's freedom might require" means for Lira specifically.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the bottled storm's return reweights the entire smuggling operation as generational healing work. Orientation anchors (Ezra, border arcade, twilight mail drop) establish clearly by ~100 words, and the cost is legible in "spaces between heartbreak and hope."

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the halo fragment discovery triggering a pattern break that leads to Emil's resonant reconfiguration through song. The closure lands with visible cost—his rusty, cracking voice after seven years of silence—and the "courage to let brokenness sing" reweights his entire silent persistence. The impossible garden functions as earned revelation rather than convenience, prepared by the fragment's pull and the extended wind-bell chime.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure when Marcus glimpses the infinite library existing in "curved space between memory and story," reweighting his search from seeking a location to recognizing omnipresence. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual—the vision "collapses gently" without visible price, and the orientation arrives late (library's nature unclear until paragraph 4).

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara's choice to set down the palette reweights the entire search from resurrection to recognition—"Some longings...were meant to remain ciphers, beautiful in their incompleteness." The cost is legible in what she sacrifices (seven years of purpose) and what she preserves (her own "improbable beginning"). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered metaphysical imagery until Vera's unlocking releases the imprisoned idea. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration—the freed idea spreading through "dreams and conversations" while Vera returns to ordinariness, with cost visible in her bleeding fingers and the weight of waiting. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words (locksmith, nexus, twilight). Deduction for abstract conceptualization of the "lock" that strains causality—the mechanism of "whispered truths and gentle untangling" lacks concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through pattern accumulation—broken constellations, preserved memories, shipwreck names—building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Margaret becomes the "living repository." Cost is visible: carrying the weight of communal trauma. Slight deduction for the explain-everything ending that resolves Gran's motivations too tidily.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Kess's understanding shifts from seeking rescue to learning survival, with visible cost in "eyes that had aged years in an hour." The geometry of tea leaves creating a reversal sequence provides coherent causality. Deduction for slightly delayed orientation (library's nature unclear until paragraph 4) and some exposition density mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong accumulative structure builds toward the seed's transformation as a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (sixty years of waiting, the tree's death, the precise timing required). The closure lands with the Lumenwillow's rebirth preserving "the color of wonder." Orientation anchors clearly establish who/where/when early, and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from single knot to seventeen restored masks, with the net's transformation from binding to mending creating resonant reconfiguration. The spirits' transition from "restless" to "radiant with recognition" delivers closure with felt cost (centuries of being unmoored). The pattern teaches itself early and pays off through the hemp becoming thread for restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's palm-press adds her oils to the "invisible record," crystallizing accumulated understanding with clear cost (tomorrow's journey, abandoning traditional cartography). The accumulative lens holds consistently through layered discoveries. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through the impossible transmission, the preserved library, the infinite recursion of the snow globe, and Marina's final understanding. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Marina accepts her role as messenger, with the cost legible in "The library would flood within hours" and her conscious choice to let it happen.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Chorus finding purpose as translator between consciousness types. The story builds through pattern accumulation (graffiti, songs, lightning moments) to the final image of "two solitudes speaking across the beautiful divide." Cost is visible in Chorus's isolation and the ghost's vast patience. Slight deduction for mild orientation delay regarding the monastery's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the elevator's ascent, each floor revealing deeper layers of encoded meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mira recognizes herself in Thorne's method—"proof that tenderness survives"—with the cost being her acceptance of isolation's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered observations building toward Elena's final understanding. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when she realizes empty spaces "give their memories back," reweighting Marcus's incomplete theory with visible cost (her untethered drift). The who/where/when anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lyra's disability becomes her unique ability to preserve what others cannot see, with clear cost in the library's imminent destruction. The accumulative structure coheres perfectly as each discovery (coin, faces, light patterns) builds toward her transcendent understanding. The "sky inside walls" motif pays off beautifully in both literal light-work and metaphorical preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through pattern recognition toward a Conceptual Repricing where "rediscovery of what we had lost" reframes the entire journey with clear stakes. The hopscotch cipher revelation and bird-as-cartographer understanding create meaningful deepening, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost - Elara's newfound understanding reweights her approach to the celestial vault with the village's continued darkness as stakes. The accumulative structure coheres through prophecy fragments building toward epiphany. Slight deduction as the cost could be more viscerally felt in the final moments rather than projected forward.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative lens holds as Marina's messages gradually build trust and understanding across the divided families, culminating in the bell's materialization as a resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands with visible cost (Marina's fading) and community transformation. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient six-month resolution timeline that compresses the agricultural reality.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through nested imagery, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marcus inherits Eliza's burden and transforms humanity's relationship with ending. Cost is visible in "terrible love and impossible hope" and the irreversible transformation. Who/where/when anchored early through lighthouse setting and dusk timing.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Earned Stasis closure—Mara's choice to remain and continue her duty lands with felt cost ("Perhaps tomorrow she'd be free. But tonight, she'd saved two more lives"). The walnut's journey from pocket to child's hand creates meaningful change. Deduction for the orchard curse mechanics remaining somewhat abstract despite their centrality.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as foam patterns, chrysalis memory, and braided streams build toward Marina's recognition that "separation could become connection if you changed your frame of reference." The texts exchange provides closure with visible emotional cost ("sat down hard") and opportunity cost (six months lost), though the reconciliation arrives somewhat easily.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Merrick's bottles transform from "forgetting" to "perpetual beginning," with conceptual cost visible in the grandfather's eternal incomplete thought. The accumulative lens holds through layered imagery (glass orchard, bottled moonlight, parole) that reweights at the ending, though the transformation mechanism could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and memory layers build toward Miran's choice to "subsume it all" and transform stored grief into acceptance. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with clear cost ("swallowing centuries," "digested grief of ages"). Deduction for slightly delayed orientation anchors and some causality softness around how exactly the pavilion "conducts memories."

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration as isolated silos transform into a harmonious choir, with visible community cost paid through "decades of isolation" being drawn out "like poison from a wound." The accumulative structure coheres well, building from individual discovery to collective transformation, though the final paragraphs slightly over-explain the achieved unity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Vera transforms into a bridge between abandoned dreams and future possibilities, with clear cost (her modified consciousness, forever changed). The accumulative structure coheres as memories layer through the mirror fragments toward her final role. Orientation anchors (moonlit canyon, submarine wreck, Vera as engineer) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through layered discoveries to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Orin accepts the keeper role, with visible cost in the blood-ink tradition. The gravity inversion creates effective temporal pressure, though the sealed wing revelation feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure—Mira successfully releases the trees' trapped songs, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence transforms into recovered music. The cost is visible in the porcelain insulator's new fractures and the forty-year wait. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Viktor's reframing of exile as gift, with the worry stone's transfer marking generational continuity. Cost appears in "Tomorrow I stay" - choosing obscurity over vindication - though the emotional price could be sharper. The accumulative structure coheres around magnetic/chess parallels building to this reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the resonant reconfiguration when the diary opens, revealing the grandmother's parallel cataloging of silence. The closure lands with emotional cost—understanding that empathy requires patient tuning rather than force. Orientation anchors established early (workshop, New Year's Eve, twenty minutes).

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear accumulative/textural lens builds through patient tending, ancestral sketching, and village swaying to a resonant reconfiguration where Mira achieves "serenity within motion" at visible cost (enduring overwhelming stench despite sensitivity). The closure image of her swaying "rooted at last in understanding" crystallizes the transformation with felt weight, though the "undercurrent of wisdom" explanation mid-story slightly telegraphs rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal chain from following water streams to discovering the monument's secret, with the Inversion serving as both deadline and revelation catalyst. The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where Kessa understands resilience means "dancing with change" rather than fighting it, with clear cost implied for the colony's previous failed approaches. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal drive lens with Maya's investigation leading to discovery and transformed understanding. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when Maya realizes "Some accidents weren't accidents at all but emergence," with the cost being humanity's need to rapidly adapt to existential threats. The convergence discovery causally drives her shift from investigation to prevention, though the expansion timeline feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (discovery → descent → performance → transformation) but the closure lacks visible cost—the world transforms without Lyrian paying any price. The Council's instant defeat through "signatures erased by wonder" reads as deus ex machina rather than earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Kessa transforms from wall-builder to bridge-weaver, with visible cost in accepting her past failure. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details build toward the conceptual shift. Orientation anchors establish clearly by paragraph two. The closure lands with the seed of light creating genuine change in her role.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered borrowed personalities culminating in Mira's conceptual repricing about emotion as typography. The closure lands with conceptual cost—Mira loses her original self but gains universal understanding. However, the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than primarily intellectual.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara's role transforms from courier to "living bridge," with visible cost in Corvin's absence/transcendence.

Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words with character, setting, and situation clear.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the frost patterns provide visible proof, transforming Vera from outcast to vindicated scientist. The accumulative lens holds as emotional signatures layer through three generations into the final revelation. Cost is present in decades of isolation, though the triumph feels slightly unearned given the convenient timing of perfect conditions.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds toward Mei's sacrifice, with the amber bead's transformation marking clear before/after. Cost is visible in her lost memories and inability to recall her name, though the daughter's rescue feels slightly convenient without showing the mechanism of how the message achieved this.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    The accumulative structure coheres around the silk's transformation from "woven dreams" to liberation tool, landing with visible cost as the merchant recognizes his traded consciousness. The who/where/when anchors clearly by ~100 words. However, the conceptual weight of "bartered awakenings" occasionally obscures concrete causality, and the final exchanges between Korin and merchant feel slightly rushed for the complexity attempted.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear Decisive Change occurs when Kira transforms from seeker to healer, choosing to repair rather than merely map. The cost is legible - accepting responsibility for universal damage their gift causes. Causal linkages hold throughout (shard appears cyclically → leads to mother → reveals truth → transforms purpose).

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elsa accepts the keeper role, transforming isolation into purpose with visible cost (her former life). The accumulative/textural lens holds as anonymous letters, stone messages, and ghostly revelations build to reweight the lighthouse's meaning. The "tears falling like sea glass" provides conceptual cost linking safety and sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mira's understanding that she guides reality itself, not just ships, with clear cost shown in the mirror-twin collaboration. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ritual elements build toward the crystallized final image of stars rearranging into truth-constellations. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraphs. Cost is visible but could be more visceral at the moment of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly when Kael understands he must "transform [stories], like dye in water" rather than hold them. The accumulative lens holds throughout, building density through color-whispers, the morpho wing's lessons, and Chen's guidance. Cost is visible in accepting the weight of his donor's legacy and the ongoing burden of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Marcus's transformation of the broken sextant into a new navigational system for grief. The cost is visible in "three decades of maintenance crystallizing into purpose" and the acceptance that "broken instruments sometimes measure most precisely." The accumulative structure coheres well, though the mathematical diary entries stretch plausibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught memory gathering that pays off when collective singing generates the "woven dawn." The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost—the ongoing need to actively create dawn rather than rely on cosmic obligation. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the "enlarged tranquility" that expands to fill the room, with visible cost in their "separate solitudes" and the three-year mistake becoming wisdom. The accumulative lens holds as patterns of paradox build toward this crystallized moment. Deduction for slightly abstract resolution of the invitation's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - Lila's acceptance of her role as guardian of "displaced sacred" with clear cost (lifelong commitment to this strange ministry). The accumulative structure coheres well, building from bread appearances through garden revelations to the tea house encounter that reweights everything.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative/textural closure where Elara's vow "to begin again" transforms the library's collapse from loss to seed, with visible cost in "The library fell in perfect silence, a quartz hush that would echo in Elara's dreams forever." The discovery of the founder's slide provides the decisive turn that reweights all prior preservation choices.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds cleanly with because/therefore linkage through Mae's three infiltration attempts leading to the watch fob gambit. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with felt cost: Mae gains evidence but loses her father's world forever ("could never return"). The "sound of trust breaking" conceptually reprices from abstract goal to concrete betrayal. Slight deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the pirate market setting.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and convergences build toward Marina's transformation into a weather-carrier, with cost visible in her acceptance of what she'd spent a lifetime denying. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she tastes "her destiny on tin and starlight," though the forest election subplot doesn't fully integrate with the main revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density builds through cave descent, paint discovery, and artistic transformation. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Lyra creates "something unprecedented... outside her mental galleries," with clear cost of abandoning her defining gift. The broken lock metaphor coherently reweights from entry device to liberation symbol. Minor deduction for slightly abstract "permission to break the combination" but cost remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Vera's decision to transcribe and deliver all crystallized messages fundamentally reweights the city's social contract, with explicit cost: "even if it meant watching the greenhouse city's carefully maintained peace dissolve." The accumulative structure - fragments → map → crystallized messages → grandmother's truth → decision - builds coherently under the textural lens. The "dead zones between safety and poison" perfectly crystallizes the thematic and physical space where truth waits.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the iceberg's melting creating genuine urgency that forces action, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where wonder becomes permanently encoded in bronze. The cost is visible—the last physical fragment dissolves completely—and the transformation of all bells creates clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern intensification through the sequential burning of miniaturized fears. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as M-47's "fragmented wholeness" becomes "complete incompleteness," with visible cost in the transformation of both roses and android. However, the conceptual weight of "some forms of escape require staying exactly where you are" feels slightly imposed rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative lens with community actions building toward Elena's healing. While the closure shows Elena speaking again and deciding to write Sofia, the cost remains abstract—we don't see what this recovery demands or what path it forecloses. The orientation is clear but the ending's "This home" gesture toward the courtyard feels asserted rather than earned through visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught dance methodology building to Resonant Reconfiguration when Maya understands her inherited role ("both the lock and the key").

Orientation anchors establish who/where/when efficiently by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition (coffee grounds, salt formations, gravity pockets) building toward Marina's discovery and choice. The Resonant Reconfiguration closure—keeping one memory while accepting the burial of others—reweights the entire premise with visible cost: "Tomorrow's coffee grounds would show new patterns, and Marina would read them with eyes that remembered how to grieve." The world-building around extracted memories stored in gravity-warped spaces provides strong causal scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - the summoner successfully disperses the prophecy at personal cost ("in that ignorance lay a peculiar kind of peace"). The accumulative structure builds through layered magical work. Minor orientation delay (who/where anchors come late) prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Marcus's request to learn transforms their relationship from pretense to acknowledged partnership. Cost is visible in abandoning their careful distance ("neither quite acknowledged"). However, the conceptual leap to buildings having memories lacks sufficient grounding, creating mild causality strain.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure—Marina integrates her quarantined memories, transforming from "tragically radiant" to "simply, fully, herself" with visible cost (three years of emptiness, physical digging). The two shell halves reuniting creates a satisfying causal-within-accumulative structure. Slight deduction for the Institute backstory exposition that could be more compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Decisive Change as Mei breaks the generational chain by choosing truth over forgery, with visible cost in her self-exposure. The causal lens holds throughout, with the grandmother's teachings and brother's forgiveness driving toward the final confession.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Senna's transformation into echo reweights the entire premise - the disappeared aren't victims but chosen translators. The cost is visceral: "leaving everything behind—her life, her form, her individual voice." The accumulative lens holds as voices layer toward the transformation, though early orientation could be slightly cleaner.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Marina accepts her role as "salvage artist of impossible things" with the cost of perpetual diving into dangerous wrecks made explicit. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density of ghost appearances building toward the formula revelation, though the twelve globes expansion slightly dilutes the singular focus.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently, building through pattern recognition (nets, firefly paths, moon crescents) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where anonymous acts of care are revealed as world-sustaining architecture. The closure lands with conceptual cost—the erasure of identity in service of continuity. Deduction for slight ambiguity in the middle section where philosophical observations could tighten more directly to the dominant stake of hidden effort.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkages from discovery to moral dilemma to earned resolution. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Marcus chooses preservation over exposure, with visible cost in abandoning his life's mission. Minor orientation lag in the first 120 words slightly weakens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the Prophet's first broadcast confirming Marlowe's work is "nearly complete." The accumulative structure coheres as fragmented frequencies build toward this crystallization, with visible cost in her isolation and the "lonely visionary" accepting she'll never meet him.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Marcus's role transforms from margin-dweller to cultural keeper with visible cost (his solitude becomes "purposeful and profound"). The accumulative structure coheres through the jar collection motif building to Elena's story joining the archive. However, the transformation to documentary archive feels slightly rushed, weakening the cost legibility at −0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira's dissolution into the lighthouse frequencies creates a before/after with clear cost (her physical form). The accumulative build through sonic layers ("whispered prayers," "fundamental frequency," "perfect resonance") coheres at closure. Orientation anchors (lighthouse engineer, drift-ice marina, Arctic) establish by ~80 words. The protective covenant and artifact's necessity are dramatized through consequence rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost - people wake to "thoughts they'd never known they could think" after Kira's patient accumulation transforms the control network. The seventeen-year preparation and midnight precision create clear before/after with felt consequence in that final image of "someone thinking their first free thought."

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Margot's resignation and commitment to preventive intervention, showing clear cost in abandoning security for uncertain purpose. The accumulative/textural lens holds as memories layer to reweight her understanding of prevention. The lantern's magical realism is taught early and pays off at closure, though the mechanism of memory transfer could be more precisely bounded.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the clockwork repair metaphor building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Eliza chooses transformation over perpetual grievance. Cost is legible in "He deserved worse than he got" acknowledging justice while accepting the burden of moving forward. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Pioneer transforms into "arrow and target, hunter and horizon," with visible cost in risking dissolution in the acid sea. The causal chain from observation through kaleidoscope to wing transformation to transcendent flight holds, though the mechanism of how kaleidoscope visions translate to physical transformation remains somewhat opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from investigation through discovery to voluntary transformation. The closure lands with Lila becoming Pattern User 8625, a Decisive Change with visible cost (leaving physical existence). The pattern teaches itself through the 4827 recurrences and archive metaphors. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the shadow network concept.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.1)
    Accumulative/textural lens builds through mirror glimpses and apple symbolism to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira becomes gardener rather than enforcer, with clear cost (abandoning her enforcement role). The orchard's impossible warmth and temporal fractures establish stakes early. However, the merchant's backstory arrives late without sufficient present-frame anchoring, and some causal links feel asserted ("This is why the ice never claims this place").

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly - Marlene's transformation from seeking her own ending to "finding in that sound not death but transformation" reweights the entire premise with visible cost. The accumulative structure coheres through the ice's breaking songs and her evolving relationship to endings, with the parasol tip threading through as a persistent constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively—Elena's daughter's arrival transforms Marcus's decades of solitude into preparation for teaching. The burned letter serves as a persistent constraint throughout, and cost is visible in "hollowed him" and twenty years of watching from afar. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the final paragraph slightly over-explicates with "love transcends its own impossibility."

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the consecration of clearings, with visible cost in the exhaustion and the line walker's unmasking. However, the accumulative lens relies heavily on exposition rather than dramatized pressure—the actual consecration work happens in summary ("One by one, they moved through the night"). The closure lands but without the visceral weight of witnessed transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where past and present spiral together, with visible cost in "tears streaming down smiling faces" and the transformation of "industrial trauma into intergenerational art." The accumulative lens holds as photographs layer meaning through 1952-1984, building to the exhibition's human spiral. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elena's fractured testimony method crystallizes options—the Committee must confront language's unstoppable evolution. The crystal's transformation of perception pays off through "silence between words, where new language was already taking root," with clear cost in challenging institutional authority.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Ezra writes "Tomorrow you will remember having helped her today," crystallizing his temporal loop with visible cost—the chalk wearing away "like years." The accumulative structure coheres through fog sculptures, videotapes, and prophecies building toward this charged poise. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by paragraph 2.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the clock's acceleration building pressure toward Ezra's choice to stay and repair rather than escape. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she accepts her role as perpetual guardian with visible cost ("forever repairing"). The temporal mechanics and cable tension create coherent causality, though the previous keeper's escape method could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the vinyl fragment pattern culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the broken/whole circle "cracked but whole" reweights Maya's journey with visible cost. The test results create genuine urgency that tightens toward her final performance. Cost is legible in "four weeks, maybe six" and the finality of "walked toward whatever came next."

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Lyra accepts her role as guardian, with visible cost in maintaining humanity's "fragile peace of ignorance." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern recognition builds toward understanding, though the orientation anchors arrive late (floating isle not established until paragraph 4).

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Thomas's transformed understanding of healing as "transformation" rather than "restoration," with the garden becoming a "healing ground for creatures caught between." Cost is felt in the acceptance of permanent separation. The accumulative pattern of broken/healing imagery coheres well, though the three-year gap creates slight orientation wobble initially.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the sea glass discovery building to community transformation as Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with visible cost (lighthouse failure, grandfather's death) and gained responsibility. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing of the fog bank's arrival just as Marina discovers the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the ice-pattern metaphor ("Where things freeze and thaw, they leave marks. But those marks can become the richest soil") with visible cost in Kira's three-year transformation. The accumulative structure coheres as moss imagery deepens from decoration to meaning-system. Slight deduction for Marcus's arrival feeling mechanically timed, though it enables the teaching moment that crystallizes the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Marina releases the seashell and accepts that "hope wasn't meant to be collected, only witnessed." The accumulative structure coheres through the feral nexus's pattern of brief appearances that transform, with Marina's ceremony crystallizing this understanding. Cost is visible in her walking away "carrying nothing but the memory."

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from withered tendril to blooming vine through earned causality - Elara's forgotten songs literally awaken the plant's memory. The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands with visible cost (three generations of silence broken) and the harvest moon deadline creates genuine urgency. Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the brass plate's transformation from empty constellation map to "captured cartography, pulsing with the quiet rhythm of impossible places." The accumulative structure coheres as each element (apple cores, starlight, inverted trees) builds toward the final image. Cost appears in the three-month dedication and the irreversible transformation of the crater itself.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with strong closure through Conceptual Repricing—Mara chooses documentation over repair, understanding that "damage sometimes revealed deeper mechanisms than perfection ever could." The wounded season provides coherent world rules, and the temporal mechanics remain consistent. Cost is visible in her renunciation of fixing the mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation ("weights," "burdens," "fractals") building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara recognizes "some prisons we weave ourselves." Cost is visible in the seventeen grams of grandmother's death and the paradox of voluntary imprisonment, though the meditation structure limits causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the clock face without hands as crystallized time holding love. Cost is visible in "three years since Thomas died" and the transformation required. Accumulative structure coheres well but relies heavily on reflection (approaching 30% threshold), though each reflection anchors in present carving and alters Margaret's understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds through pattern accumulation of voice fragments building toward Kira's recognition of her transformed role. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when she accepts being memory keeper rather than builder, with cost visible in eroded ambitions. The waters beginning to move again signals earned change. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words despite temporal ambiguity serving the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from discovery to understanding to resurrection, with clear cost (decades of abandonment, lost knowledge). The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Maya becomes a "navigator" herself, though the final paragraphs edge toward over-explanation. Who/where/when anchored immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story builds through sensory accumulation (crystal whispers, petrichor, light patterns) toward Elara's decision to "bear both worlds" - a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost of splitting her life. The closure lands with "dreams that had changed shape but never truly died," showing transformation's price. Slight deduction for the middle section's reliance on backstory summary rather than present-scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara's recognition transforms her understanding with visible emotional cost ("finally able to see what had always been there"). The accumulative structure builds effectively through the sundial discovery to self-recognition. Slight deduction for predictable thematic arc once the father's deception is revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece achieves a Conceptual Repricing where "knowledge persists in forms we've only begun to recognize," but this arrives through exposition rather than dramatized discovery. The actual knot-decoding scene (the story's only concrete action) yields information without changing Mara's tactics or forcing a choice, and the cost remains abstract rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Elara's understanding that "healing was not a destination but a map" reweights her role from obituary writer to cartographer with visible emotional cost. The piece teaches its pattern of "explained absences" early and pays it off. Deduction for cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Aldric's creation of Novo, fundamentally altering the mechanical world's possibilities—"Some circuits, it seemed, still remembered beauty." The causal chain from discovering the egg through building the apparatus to the flawed hatching is clear, with the cost visible in the bird's twisted wings and broken song that nonetheless awakens something in the world below.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure - Maya's grafting ritual crystallizes her transformation from inherited trauma to "unyielding compassion." Cost is visible through seven years of return, father's legacy, and the weight of saving what he destroyed. The piece teaches its pattern of elemental transformation early and pays it off through the talisman's creation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the fountains flowing again with Marcus choosing to stay. The cost is visible in his transformation from skeptic to participant. Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words. The ritual completion and memory liberation create meaningful change with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis: the Keeper accepts her role's solitary burden with visible cost ("both burden and privilege"). The accumulative structure coheres through stellar cycle patterns, though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than stated. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as monarchs, carving, and memories layer toward the memorial's completion. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration when Martha reads the hidden poem aloud, transforming private grief into "endless conversation." Cost is visible in the grandfather's fading and Martha's solitary evening. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Theodore's ritual that transforms the clock's precision, with visible cost in his months of obsessive carving and public confession. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through inscriptions and confessions. Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of how speaking names "shifts" the machinery—this borders on magical thinking without sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Marta's decision to plant the tapestry, transforming preservation into active release with clear cost ("where all tapestries eventually unravel and reweave"). The accumulative structure coheres as each discovered thread reweights her understanding of her own work, though the middle section's exposition about the tapestry's contents slightly dilutes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise, where the Council unknowingly adopts revolutionary ideas they believe are their own, with the cost being Mira's invisibility and the irony that transformation requires deception. The accumulative/textural lens holds as patterns and visual algorithms accumulate pressure toward the crystallized ending where "everything became possible," though the transformation happens somewhat quickly for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with closure as Resonant Reconfiguration—Mariel stepping into the mist carrying "luminous burden" crystallizes her choice with clear cost (risk of discovery). The piece teaches its pattern early (music containing hidden stories, dust as narrative carrier) and pays off through the concert hall activation plan. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through ash portraits, the mask's history, and the gallery's dual nature, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marlene's role crystallizes with visible cost (tomorrow's inevitable repetition). The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The closure lands with felt cost as the gallery's "ephemeral and essential" promise reweights all prior portraits.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds throughout with clear because/therefore linkage: Marcus intercepts reports → confrontation → revelation of shared purpose → collaboration decision. The closure (Decisive Change from isolation to partnership) lands with visible cost as Marcus abandons his solitary stance. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient alignment of their goals, though the "heavier than water-soaked leather" metaphor effectively charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the arts persist through human gathering rather than institutional support, with the rosette transformed from personal artifact to communal inheritance. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer (students arriving with instruments, finding the modes together) to reweight the opening resignation into active transmission with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse transforms into a neural garden that preserves banned memories, with clear cost (twenty years of hiding, risk of discovery). The accumulative lens holds as memories layer through taste, touch, and environmental detail toward the final image. Slight deduction for expository world-building that could be more integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal drive with the blackout triggering both the truth curse and drone failure, leading inevitably to Mira's revelation. Closure lands as Decisive Change when she broadcasts the truth, transforming from hidden guardian to public hope-bearer with clear cost (theft confession, vulnerability). The grandmother's riddle provides satisfying retrospective coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pattern recognition through displaced objects toward Marina's understanding that houses learn to hold absence. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Marina places the shard as offering, with visible cost (losing grandmother's heirloom) and conceptual cost (accepting grief's transformation of place). Who/where/when anchors clearly by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Thessaly's "settling" from absolute judgment to witnessed complexity, with Marina as conduit for truth's nuanced telling. The cascading memory structure drives causally through revelation to moral repricing. Cost is legible in "weight of her secret creating structural weakness." Slight deduction for the mildly abstract final line about "stone animate with possibility."

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through mathematical patterns, dice rolls, and the staircase's recursive nature toward a Charged Poise closure where Marcus's calculated faith in entropy crystallizes. The seventeen-billion-step revelation reweights everything with clear cost (Sarah's lifetime). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The lens holds consistently through mathematical accumulation and pattern-breaking.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres beautifully—each painted symbol accumulates memories of kindness, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the greenhouse transforms from solitary refuge to communal gathering space. The cost is visible: lost languages and displaced neighbors. The piece teaches its pattern early (moonlight triggering memory-visions) and pays it off through the painting's viral reception.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear accumulative/textural lens with density increase toward closure as Marta discovers the bakery alcove's hidden notations. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with cost—the walls literally weeping away history while Marta races to document. The "ending properly documented could become a beginning" provides conceptual repricing with visible urgency. Minor deduction for Henrik's warning feeling slightly disconnected from the main arc.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong causal linkage throughout with a Decisive Change closure - the hunger stone's reversal from consuming to generating light. The cost is visible in Elara's lifetime of preparation and the ironic fulfillment through rebellion. The yoyo's discovery-to-implementation arc maintains clear because/therefore progression.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Story operates under Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Fear transforms from predator to companion. Closure lands with visible cost (Fear's imprisonment in the clasp) and Mara's acceptance of carrying it. Minor orientation wobble with Cornelius's nature initially unclear.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kessa transforms the prison into the instrument of escape, with clear cost in physical exhaustion ("muscles aching"). The accumulative structure builds through increasing strike frequency and resonance layers. The final image of sailing toward the next trapped vessel with the mallet "pulsing like a second heart" effectively reweights the obstacle-as-instrument concept.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as pattern discoveries layer toward the crystallized moment of Mira slipping through the hatch while turtles wake and watchers turn. Closure achieves Charged Poise—options and stakes are legible (stay safe/seek truth) with felt cost as the geological groan signals immediate danger. The spiral pattern language creates coherent throughline from shells to watchers to message.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with Marcus leaving his insignia and Elara ready to expose the truth, making the cost legible through "destroy you and everyone who reads your work." The causal lens holds with clear because/therefore linkage from hidden historian to confrontation to revelation choice. Orientation anchors who/where/when within first paragraph, and the dominant stake (truth versus noble lies) drives consistently to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with Edmund's ritualistic documentation building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where he transforms from surveyor to "archeologist of abandoned dreams." The closure lands with felt cost as he leaves "carrying the weight of witnessed absence" after sealing his grandmother's story in stone. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the pattern of preservation-through-documentation accumulates meaningfully through concrete actions.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong Conceptual Repricing closure where the revelation about falsified water rights treaties reweights the entire submersion narrative. The cost is legible—truth can only be preserved in fragments during rare blackouts, and Mira must work against constant technological interference. The accumulative pattern of frequency detection builds effectively to this repricing of history.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly: Mei transforms from grief-stricken mother to guide for others, with visible cost in "luminous torment." The accumulative structure builds through layered images of transformation, though the final paragraph over-explicates what the imagery already conveys.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—Amira's discovery crystallizes the existence of "pools of unused potential" with clear cost (security breach, professional risk). The causal lens holds: because the missile struck mid-celebration, the unrealized futures pooled; because the observatory's elevation thins boundaries, detection becomes possible. The closure lands with "Tomorrow's stolen dreams would find new dreamers" carrying conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the frequency discovery that transforms understanding of belonging. Causality holds as each matrix placement builds toward the final resonance, though the conceptual cost of this transformation remains more stated than felt—we're told Kira fills "missing pieces she hadn't known were empty" without seeing what she sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—Elias's decision to close his business and leave the carvings as testimony shows clear on-page cost in "Some weights, he understood now, could only be lifted by setting them down completely." The accumulative/textural lens holds as driftwood fragments build toward revelation, though the grandfather's crimes revelation feels slightly convenient in timing.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the drawer pull accumulating meaning across beats until the final "waiting for the darkness that would make them all equal" resonantly reconfigures the opening weight. Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost in Elara's acceptance of future healing. The moon phases structure provides coherent escalation through ritual timing.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Marcus accepting his brokenness while finding new purpose—the utility poles becoming a valid navigation system parallels his internal shift. Causality flows cleanly from trauma through daily rituals to tentative healing. The cost is visible in his permanent loss of traditional navigation abilities and the lives that haunt him.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Charged Poise closure—Marcus steps onto the bridge with visible cost ("a man with no memory of his sins, carrying only the strange, terrible gift of still being able to feel"). The baseball's impossible signature and bioluminescent paths constrain choices effectively. Slight deduction for time-travel exposition that doesn't fully integrate with present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mira's transformation, with clear cost (loss of human form) visible on page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and mystical elements build toward the metamorphosis. However, the orientation anchors drift slightly in the middle transformation sequence, and some causal links between the spices and the specific transformation mechanics remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara mends the saucer and recovers lost time, transforming grief into continuation. The accumulative lens holds through imagery patterns (traced hands, cracked porcelain, onyx cards). Cost is visible in the acknowledgment that guilt "would remain forever" while she unfastens the binding. Slight opacity around the exact mechanics of how the glade works prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the photograph meditation building to the dimensional opening and final integration. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mei becomes "the first human complete," with visible cost in her transformation from isolation to bearing all humanity's complexity. The stitching metaphor pays off literally as she weaves light and dark together.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Elara's literal transformation into scattered particles of consciousness, paying clear cost (dissolution of physical form). The accumulative structure coheres well, though the prophecy setup ("silk becoming iron becoming starlight") telegraphs the ending somewhat mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the sundial's coded angles building toward distributed rebellion. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the quill holder placement crystallizing the revolutionary network, and cost is visible in the risk both sentinels take. The "cradle of sparks" concept effectively shifts from abstract to concrete method.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Conceptual Repricing closure lands effectively—Yann's understanding that she's "seeing through time's new transparency" reweights the entire premise with clear cost (living each moment twice). The accumulative structure coheres through pattern-building toward revelation. However, the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually stated, and some middle passages meander without tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through layered metaphors (scars/stars, storms/revolution) culminating in Conceptual Repricing where silence becomes the medium of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patterns of dust and decay build toward a Conceptual Repricing where observation replaces theatrics, with the resignation as the on‑page cost. Orientation is anchored early (greenhouse post‑flood), and causality is coherent across weeks. The demolition threat and subsequent postponement give the final cadence a tangible consequence. Closure lands through a reweighted paradigm with a visible price (career, community standing).

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is crisp from the start (canyon, night, arson aftermath), and the scene holds a Hybrid drive with an Accumulative/Textural dominance at the end. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she elects to end the poisoned legacy and pursue a new, safe practice while remaining “dead.” Cost is on the page in the abandonment of identity and acceptance of danger in warning others. The ledger-to-frost turn binds causality and texture without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: iterative experiments (62 Hz, 432 Hz) build to a conceptual repricing—she hasn’t lost music, only its medium.

Closure lands without resorting to mechanical summary.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: patterned images escalate (lens → coordinates → librarians → rites → shadow lighthouse) toward a closure that reweights the premise. Closure lands with cost on the page (“The living would have to bury themselves for a while”), and the drive remains coherent from summons to renunciation. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph (who/where/when). The because/therefore chain is lightly sketched but sufficient under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the midnight bell pattern densifies into a communal system, then pays off with officials’ arrival and Marta’s final ring as a charged cadence shift. Orientation is clear early; cause and effect are coherent. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she relinquishes the role, cost acknowledged in her fatigue and anonymity. Slight distance from on-page crisis (months summarized) keeps it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: sparks → ghost instruction → tear deployed → breath as key → door → choice to release images. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with tangible cost (surrendering years of images) and a charged final image. Single scene, clean anchors, and the hybrid causal/lyric lens holds. No unkept setups or contrived turns.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: images intensify (warming shard, bridges revealing purpose, fading photographs) toward a closure that reweights the premise. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing/Resonant Reconfiguration as she reframes time as cultivated texture; the cost is the dissolution of the fragment and the vanishing iterations. Orientation is clean early (who, where, what’s at stake). The chain is coherent without needing traditional causality, and the final image carries felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal. The arrow enables the break; the piano decoding supplies mission targets; the harvest enables his exit and forward plan—clear because/therefore links. Closure lands with a Decisive Change (chains snapped; departure) and Charged Poise (mission engaged) with implied cost. On‑page pressure is moderate since the Authority is offstage and immediate risk feels low.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each image (aurora, shipwrecks, orchard, cells) densifies toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Closure lands on the page with cost—she reweights betrayal/faith and accepts a reframed inheritance. Orientation is clear early, and the forge process provides a coherent because/therefore spine inside the lyric.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset and the scene holds tight focus: arrive, target the seventh frame, reinterpret, deliver truth, exit. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the cadence tightens with the fading light and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration (beauty → truth) with on‑page cost (the mother’s tears, Cassia’s burden). Causal steps are clean and props/rules hold, with the jar’s pulse closing the loop. The closure is quiet but legible; the cost is felt if not devastating.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats coherently build from workspace consecration to public invitation, culminating in a charged poise when she hands over the warm sphere and reframes “safety.” Orientation is clean from the first line (who/where/when anchored). The closure carries conceptual cost (living/working in a contaminated legacy site; renounced studio; ongoing risk) though the on‑page price is quiet. One meaningful tightening arrives with the couple’s “Is it safe?” which reweights the ritual into a communal act.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Drive lens: Causal. Setups (shell, cast equations, library coordinate) pay off in a decisive on‑page reversal where Marcus transfers the safeguards.

Orientation is clean early and causality holds through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: attention intensifies around the star’s flickers, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing that reweights the premise (“not a destination but a process”). The closure carries cost—ongoing vigil and time—made legible by her recommitment and the charged final image of another page waiting. Orientation is clean from the outset. The single tightening at the flicker is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early and holds it: sensory patterning → temporal module → violin resonance → realization → charged return to mopping. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/Earned Stasis: he reframes janitorial repetition as maintaining consciousness, with the cost of ongoing cyclical duty. Orientation is clean from the outset; no causality breaks. The tightening pivot occurs at the simultaneous touch across timelines.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single continuous scene, well oriented early, and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration: they move from frozen mistrust to a charged poise (hand‑taking) with the cost of admitting wrongdoing. The drive lens reads Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural, with causal reveals (eavesdropping, Marcus’s confession) feeding the cadence shift. Stakes resolve inwardly and believably, though the external pressure drops once Marcus’s confession arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean early (maze, marbles, Ministry; time marked by “today’s reading”). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she passes a cracked marble and reweights “luck” toward relational craft, planning another loop in her monument. The cost is conceptual rather than concrete, resting on her sustained commitment to “beautiful deceptions” over public metrics; it lands but remains quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lens: Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural; closure is a Conceptual Repricing as the final image reweights time with “vectors pointing in all directions.” Orientation is strong from the first lines (who/where/when). Because/therefore links exist (lever → resonance → stabilization → new equilibrium), but the cost is light and largely implied. Closure lands, but with limited on‑page price beyond risk and a brief alarm.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the flood, reflections, and emerging notation build toward a charged final image. Closure lands with cost when he wades to chest depth to sustain the unfinished note, resulting in the lanterns dying and the restored program—an on‑page Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean by ~120 words. The because/therefore chain is subtle but coherent and resolved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is fast and clean (Station Seven, fever aftermath, single POV), and the accumulative/textural drive holds. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she accepts secrecy, smudges her signature, and reframes knowledge as survivable only in margins. The cost is legible (professional omission, self-imposed secrecy, isolation). The pattern of discovery → auroral witness → protective act coheres without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: radio confessions and environmental finds accrue toward the charged discovery and the refusal to remove the wheel. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: “Some confessions…are meant to be witnessed,” followed by the leave-it choice with cost. Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when), and causal threads—radio fragments → valve’s legend → discovery—remain coherent. The price is legible in the final carry-forward image (“settling into his bones”).

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs densify (book-soil-moss-memory; the swan/map; mushroom-words) toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Closure is a charged poise/CR: she has become the chronicle itself, with the cost of self-dissolution and lasting silence legible on the page. Orientation is clean from the start, and the pattern taught early pays off in the final image by the river. Slight softness remains in the beat-to-beat turn, but the ending’s reweighting lands.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear orientation, one scene, and a tight accumulative drive culminate in a resonant reconfiguration: the release of the curl at totality. The cost is legible—the forfeiture of a decades‑kept relic—and it reweights the mother‑daughter bond and the story’s “ordinary magic” premise. The eclipse clock provides firm structure and cadence. No causality breaks or slack beats undermine the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries accrete (wall-whispers → diary line → tapestry correlation → consciousness “sliding”) to a charged poise ending. Closure is a conceptual repricing: dragons as markers and “bronze quiet” as pause reweight the world, with the cost of solitary stewardship implicit. Orientation is crisp early (silo library, fireplace, Keeper Thrain) and consistent. The final act of placing the tapestry in a diary concretizes the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, motifs (beam cadence, musical notation, open secrets) tighten toward a charged poise closure. The cost is legible: he engineers his disappearance, forfeiting his role and tools (“Tomorrow, they’d find his reading glasses on the rocks”). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph. The cause/effect chain is quiet but coherent—“TRANSCEND” cues the final crossing—without any breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single scene, single POV, clear spatial anchor, and an accumulative/textural drive culminating in a conceptual repricing (“exorcism as illumination”). The looped rhetoric deepens pressure credibly and the palette’s final clatter delivers a legible before/after. Cost skews conceptual (comfort surrendered) rather than visceral, but it lands. No causality breaks or orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure mounts via dawn, the live clock, and orchestration of fortunes into music. Closure lands as a charged poise: “chronologically home at last,” with the conducting crest collapsing the before/after of time. Cost is felt in the acceptance of a life outside linear norms and the impending collapse into sleep. Orientation is clean early (Mei, glass spire, frozen lake, dawn), supporting the lyric structure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens (accumulative pressure culminating in a decisive act) holds cleanly: the bridge’s stutter, darkening glow, and consciousness thinning escalate to the choice to press “collapse/unite.” Orientation is solid early (after-rain viaduct, tablet, floating constraint). Closure lands on-page with cost: integration requires letting alternate lives die/merge; the tablet’s disintegration seals the turn. No causality gaps or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of preparation → reversed playback → somatic resonance → wound‑down spring → reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—deafness reframed as transformation—with the persistent constraint intact as cost. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when) and the phonograph’s wind‑down provides a clean cadence shift. Causality is motivated through tools and place; no stray set‑ups.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the pigeon arrival → official seals → first note → hidden note → decision → reply sequence coheres and tightens. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—she recommits with new tactics under increased risk. Cost is implied rather than dramatized, but the threat of surveillance and appropriation of her work is clear. Orientation is crisp from the opening image.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, fragrance waves, images, and tools (UV lamp, lantern) build toward a resonant reconfiguration: she becomes the archive. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/why-now). Closure lands on the page with cost in the final cadence—grief reweighted as permanent duty. Causal links (note → vial → scents → memories → transformation) are tight without over‑mechanizing.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story escalates through layered revelations toward a conceptual repricing at the end; the final act—replacing the rope—lands an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with moral cost (choosing witness over intervention). Orientation is clean early (Marcus, grotto, beings, rope) and the internal logic of the beings’ revelations holds. Cost is slightly soft (more implied than dramatized), keeping this shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the music accrues, the hush is reweighted, and the community gathers, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is precise from the opening. Cost is legible on the page—loss of rainforest, damaged instruments, and the choice to embrace incomplete forms rather than restore what was. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing in the final image (“perfect incompletion”).

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the dusk transformation and static crescendo build to a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure: she refuses to consume and commits to the widower’s need. Cost is on the page as renunciation of genuine feeling for herself, not merely stated. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the single-scene structure holds. The final image reweights the premise without a mechanical wrap-up.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal. The misaddressed envelope triggers Margot’s decision, which leads to Martha, to community teaching, to Margot’s repriced understanding; the because/therefore chain holds. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with a felt, if soft, cost (time, emotional labor, Samuel’s absence). Multiple time jumps compress beats but coherence and payoff remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal spine: mapping the tag → spiral pattern → descent → discovery → reconfiguration of belonging. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the accumulative ritual of searching tightens coherently toward the crater’s heart. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration (community reintegrates the first artist) with modest but legible cost (years of exile; Kira’s all‑consuming dedication). The chain is tidy but avoids convenience-based resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: pendant hum → pursuit via canals → gap at Morteus’s throat → discovery of true source → decisive act of completing illustrations → time snaps back with cost. Orientation is crisp early, and the closure lands with an on‑page price (minutes evaporate, giant wakes, pendant cracks). The revaluation of the city’s practice functions as a decisive change plus conceptual repricing. No loose scaffolding or plot amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset (cavern orchard, satchel, mosaic), and the accumulative/textural lens holds: placing first eye → environmental charge → second eye → mathematical apparition → conceptual reweighting. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: absence redefined as transformed presence, with an Earned Stasis refusal of a physical return. Cost is legible in the choice to leave the eyes and accept the altered state. The chain is coherent without and-then drift.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean orientation and a held Accumulative/Textural lens: outage → aid → revelation → invitation → decision. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: trust replaces pure anonymity, with the cost of exposure implied. Beats link causally without contrivance; there’s no soft reset. The last image (amber rectangles, tape decision) marks a before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds via rain‑triggered anomalies to the decisive acceptance of merger, delivering a clear RR/DC. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph (who/where/when are all clear). The closure’s cost—identity reconfigured—lands on the page in the final image. No causality breaks or soft resets; the scene coheres in one tightening arc.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Situational lens holds: constrained window (tide), one scene, one stake, and a clean exchange that reconfigures options. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: heirloom forfeited, pure water gained, and a new artistic vow with cost noted on-page. Orientation is crisp by ~120 words. The causal chain is modest but coherent and sufficient for the scale.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the pattern intensifies toward a Conceptual Repricing: seeing the present as the locus of magic. Causality is clean (pearl → blindness → cave → shadow‑voice → inhabiting → altered sight), and the closure is on‑page with a felt conceptual cost (relinquishing her prophecy‑centric frame; the pearl dissolves). Orientation is swift and steady. The resolution is quiet but coherent and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story builds patterned density (light strata, fragments, valve beats) toward a charged final image that reweights absence as grammar. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise in the last valve turn, with the conceptual cost of living with navigated absences intact. Orientation is clean early; causality coheres for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of signs increases (humming, mist, impossible geometry) to a threshold act at the wall of mist. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes 3 AM and the punch as a passage system and commits to return. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the one-scene flow is coherent. The on‑page cost is conceptual more than visceral, making the final price felt but not sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: whale songs, tile, and transcription accrue toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is clear from the outset; the three-day migration creates a frame and clock. Closure lands as a reweighted understanding (“not magic…a lens”), with a felt cost of relinquishing strict skepticism. The cost is subtle but legible within this length.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal chain: storm → magnetic masking → bridges → reunion → fragment fusion → door → step through. The closure functions as a decisive change and a conceptual repricing (immortality reframed as a prison with a new path chosen). Cost is more conceptual than felt, which softens impact but remains legible. Lens reads Hybrid with causal spine and a textural close, held through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Situational with causal linkage (breach → confrontation → negotiated handoff). Orientation is quick and clean; the scene coheres and culminates in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she relinquishes objects and accepts the cost of burial and moral accounting. The envelope/records pay off set-ups without over-explaining, and the ashes-in-ink twist reweights the premise. Minor reliance on stated philosophy (“mathematics of a fair trade”) keeps it just shy of exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the overnight ritual densifies toward dawn, and the cadence shift at sunrise delivers a resonant closure (lamp off, notepad closed). Orientation is clean from the outset (who, where, when anchored). The cost is understated but legible in physical strain and the conceptual defiance of official records; the captured “texture of time” reweights what preceded. Quiet but coherent structure; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tides, maze, and annotations build density until the spring tide’s fresh inscription catalyzes Mari’s choice. Orientation is clear early (containers, dawn, harbor), and the single‑shard flow is coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she joins a hidden congregation and reframes her death certificate as both true and false. The cost is conceptual and elegiac rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discoveries compound (shell hum → cello harmonics → voices → conceptual reframing) to a Conceptual Repricing where Marina consents to preserve rather than debunk. Orientation is clean within the first lines. Closure lands on page with a felt price (joining the chorus of her own unfinished conversations). The scene stays within length/scope and maintains a single coherent window.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under a Situational/Hybrid lens, pressure coheres: coded warning → developers arrive → community gathering → legal reorganization; the final image (papers coming, cornerstone laid) locks the Decisive Change. Causality is clean and on‑page; orientation is swift and stable. The cost is implied (foregoing open resistance, bureaucratic entanglement) more than felt, softening the punch slightly. Nevertheless, closure is earned and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, orientation is immediate (1979, Luna Station Seven, Tycho) and the pressure tightens via the six‑hour burn, the 14‑hour terminator, and the last supply rocket. Closure arrives on the page with a felt cost: she documents the final sublimation, places the hourglass, and departs. The causal chain is modest but coherent—preparation leads to capture leads to renunciation. The final image reconfigures the premise into a charged farewell without mechanical over‑tie.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal chain: damaged drone → diagnostic via mist/water → delicate patch under a live clock → launch and release. The clock (“twenty minutes”) tightens options, and the fix leads directly to the ship’s departure. Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise: she releases the drone and returns to her craft, reframing blindness and purpose. Cost is modest (time pressure and precision risk), keeping the peak from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens with a situational spine: discovery → arrival → choice. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the condensation map pays off the earlier obsession and aligns with the inspector’s approach. Closure lands as Charged Poise with a visible price (“risk everything”) and a clear before/after to secrecy. A hair more on the concrete consequence would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the communal rhythm densifies, triggers visible changes (bells, arch, fountain), and culminates in a stable cadence after the tuner departs. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Millhaven keeps its heartbeat without her, with an implied daily cost. Orientation is clean and the pattern is taught early then paid off. The lack of a sharp on‑page price keeps it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pressure and knowledge deepen toward a clean on‑page closure: she chooses to inhale water and surrender. Orientation is crisp early, and the “temple as medium” discovery coherently reframes the distress signal. The final act carries unmistakable cost and resolves the central dilemma. A slight neatness in the device’s “calling her home” prevents a full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    The piece holds a Hybrid drive with an accumulative cadence culminating in a Charged Poise: the testimony carved into the lattice before the boat arrives. Orientation is precise from the opening (nameless lighthouse prison, Devil’s Tooth Reef, highest cell). Causality is coherent: door → corridor → lattice → vision → testimony → awaiting discovery. The cost is implied rather than dramatized (risk, lifelong imprisonment), keeping this shy of 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: bead pulses → apparition escalates stakes → bead cracks → debt resolves → dawn returns; cost is the loss of magic and of her presence. Orientation is crisp within ~120 words and the single-scene structure holds. Closure is an on‑page Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration with felt price. The 100‑year “resonant awakenings” clock tightens the beat effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: the illustration plate children animate and her stitching reframes the labyrinth as a bridge; the old rules drown and a new stance holds. Cost is conceptual and elegiac (accepting the old world’s loss and living between sleep and wake), though not sharply priced on the page. Orientation is clean from the opening and the pattern of overlap teaches itself and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, images deepen toward closure when Miriam fits the gnomon and reads the names, reweighting time and belonging. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise/CR): she commits to months of rebuilding and mapping, accepting a new rule of time. Cost is implied but legible in her renunciation of wandering and embrace of work.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the ritual accrues toward a quiet Charged Poise—naming, photographing, filing, then departure with a clock (“three hours”) humming under it. Orientation is clean early, and the closure image (ephemeral chalk → analog archive → returning tomorrow) delivers a conceptual price: chosen names exist briefly, then as artifacts. The stakes never sharpen beyond the ritual deadline, so the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized. Still, the cadence shift at “Sender Tilde Fossilheart” and the lock‑up exit land.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid/Situational drive holds: pressure coheres around the impending coup and the observatory’s closure, culminating in a charged poise ending as she completes and sends the final chart. Orientation is clear from the first paragraph, and causality is clean (eavesdropping → encoding → Crane’s visit confirming timing → urgent completion). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a felt risk rather than a decisive act on the page. The cost is mostly conceptual and anticipatory, not explicitly cashed in, keeping this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid skewing Accumulative/Textural: ritual density builds to a single decisive act that reconfigures options (sending the dream‑message). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the causality is coherent: shard → windows → choice → message → shard crumbles. Closure lands with cost on the page and a new path opened (Marina coming). No plot amnesia or soft reset undermines the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene with clear anchors builds under an accumulative/textural lens to a resonant reconfiguration: Maya recasts her survival and purpose, paying a cost by giving up the coral. Causality is coherent—child’s request → translation → collaborative art → charged gifting—without outliney “and then” beats. Closure lands on the page with felt price and a clear before/after. No orientation debt; reflective shards stay tethered to present action.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates via density: memory → light‑painting → communal network → mission. Orientation is clean from the outset; single POV and scene coherence hold. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—permanence isn’t the point, and she chooses ongoing restoration despite its transience—carrying a conceptual cost. The beat‑to‑beat causality is soft but consistent with the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear anchors and a tight accumulative structure: coin → acoustic shift → temporal pause → elected renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise when she presses the coin back and paints over, foreclosing understanding for cyclical wonder. Causality within the surreal rules holds, and the cost—choosing curiosity over certainty—is legible on the page. The design teaches its pattern early and uses it at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with a situational dominant lens: auditors arrive, pressure coheres, tactics escalate via insect interference, and closure lands in a charged poise as the door bursts open and Marcus accepts the cost. Because/therefore linkages are intact (auditors triangulate → he escalates interference → sends Serena to plant → faces the breach). The final image reweights options with a clear price (he draws the danger so the message can propagate). Clean orientation, single scene, and one tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: motifs (shell spiral/postcard/half-lullabies) intensify toward a closure image that reweights damage as illumination. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: worn perforations cast stars, and the armistice becomes practice. Cost is legible (time erosion, dissolving postcard, perpetual insomnia). Structure is coherent and oriented early; the piece opts for lyric accumulation over causal turns without violating its own logic.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the chime’s altered resonance triggers a focused, because/therefore sequence toward capture. Closure lands with cost (the bamboo’s final split) and a reweighted understanding of her work. Anchors are clear early; the scene tightens from discovery to preservation without drift. The cadence shift at the end converts monument‑keeping into active rebellion against oblivion.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from pattern recognition to the ink’s glow to the completed “score,” culminating in a Charged Poise ending as she heads to the summit. Orientation is solid early, and causality holds. The closure carries conceptual cost (defying orthodoxy, risk of misinterpretation) but the price remains lightly felt. One tightening beat (glow as truth‑confirmation) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive (causal planning within an accumulative, breathing-volcano frame) holds to closure. The decisive act—carving plans, leaving the mixed‑resin note, and designing two‑operator gates—reconfigures options with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean and the single-scene arc is coherent. Stakes resolve via Charged Poise rather than a hard turn, but the cadence lands.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: dust, letters, meteorite, and seasonal shifts layer toward the envelope reveal and her reconfiguration. Orientation is swift (attic of Bellweather’s Books, skylight), and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration when her own past letter returns, reweighting the premise of “paper trails.” The cost is conceptual but felt: she owns her past rather than escaping it. Tight, coherent progression without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative end: coded navigation deepens into a conceptual closure at the center clearing. Orientation is fast and clean, and the because/therefore path (codes → turns → center → threshold insight) holds. Closure is a conceptual repricing/charged poise—she reframes loss and begins her own mapping—though the on‑page price is more felt than enacted. The structure is tight for the length, with one meaningful deepening and no dropped setups.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds through images (feather → spreading light → fish constellations → jellies) to a resonant reconfiguration. Closure arrives in the acceptance that some mysteries are to be inhabited, charged by the city’s pulse going dark—an earned stasis with a conceptual price. Orientation is clean early, and the luminous event provides the single tightening/deepening expected at this length. The cost is subtle but legible in the renunciation of instrumental “solving.”

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: patterning of collection → reading → conjecture → sprouts culminates in a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Orientation is clean early (who/where/what) and the cadence shift (“tiny sprouts”) reweights the premise with a legible price (acceptance of limits, leaving to avoid memory blur). Causality is soft but coherent within the lyric mode. The closure lands quietly yet decisively without mechanical tying‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; pressure accrues through patterning (cycles, audiences, tide clock) and a cadence shift with the teen. Closure lands as Charged Poise: tide forces packing up, the bishop last, and a tomorrow-same-time vow that reweights the premise. Orientation is clean early; causality remains coherent with no teleports. The cost is quiet but legible: time’s boundary and the earned limits of his method.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural build lands in a charged poise: she imprints the garden and continues dancing, accepting detection by dawn as the felt cost. Orientation is clear from the outset; the causal line (dance → energy signature → inevitable arrival) coheres. The closure reweights the place and the body as document with undeniable price. Tight scope and a single dominant stake hold cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear single‑scene arc with early anchors (who/where/when) and an accumulative/textural drive culminating in a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing. The demolition letter and “last morning” frame a live constraint; the decision to document/teach is the closure unit with legible conceptual cost. Beats accrue via ripples and light intensifying to the sun’s crest. Minor limitation: the external stake never tests him on the page beyond contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the present walk, the celestial conjunction, and the box’s revealed contents build toward a conceptual repricing: burden → compass. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the closure lands on the page when he begins recording and reframes teaching as vulnerability with implied cost. The causal chain is modest but coherent: box → memory → photo → message. The price—accepting limits and exposing failure to his crew—is legible in the closing descent.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—patterns, repetitions, and a cadence shift culminate in a conceptual repricing when the gauge settles on infinity. Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/what), and the sequence coheres around the tide’s confluence window. Closure lands: a reweighted understanding of the disappearance and Marina’s chosen path (teaching others) with the cost of renouncing a reunion. Escalation is gentle but purposeful via layered timelines and the grandmother’s amplitude cue.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery of Voss’s diary reweights the corridor, the film strip becomes a map, and extraction deepens rather than pivots. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid—she adds her own record and leaves it, committing to stewardship. Cost is conceptual/emotional more than dramatized risk. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the structure is clean within a single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure layers (hush → city stirring → bells impending → heartbeat quickening) to a Charged Poise closure as the sparrow returns the lullaby and the heartbeat steadies. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; single continuous scene. Closure lands via a reweighted final image (“invisible doors opening”) and a tangible signal from Sophia, with a cost of time/attention spent under a live clock. The cost is subtle, not decisive, which keeps this just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Situational lens holds: the ritual alignment and mustering press a stance crystallization, culminating in a Charged Poise/RR—“first crack” and the clipboard’s new light. Orientation is clean and the before/after is legible with a conceptual cost (relinquishing hero narratives). Closure is strong but not fully decisive, keeping it just short of the 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds through thunder’s approach, the egg’s planned cracking, and the sealing under engineered heat. Closure is a charged poise/Conceptual Repricing: the final image reweights destruction as preservation with undeniable cost (diverted rains, displaced people, buried futures). Orientation is crisp from the outset; the single‑scene structure is clean. Minor reliance on summary (shell companies, Smithsonian theft) supports rather than replaces the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story escalates via density—loosening threads releases echoes that reweight the final act; opening the prism and singing yields a resonant reconfiguration with a clear before/after (sanctuary emptied, self transformed). Orientation is clean and single-scene; causality is coherent. Cost is implied (defying the Academy), but not directly felt on the page, moderating the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues from the post‑argument hush toward a charged poise as he commits to a backward performance. Orientation is crisp from the first line (radar dome, who/when/where). Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: ending→beginning ethics, with the price of losing collaborators and carrying responsibility made legible. Escalation is quiet but coherent; cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece tightens through pattern-building toward the monarch’s arrival, with closure in a charged poise image where two histories touch and a conceptual cost is named (the monarch will die, the structures dissolve). Orientation is clean early; one scene coheres. The closure lands on-page via the butterfly’s reading and departure reweighting what came before. Stakes are conceptual but legible, paid in ephemerality.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of work (card → rope → names → bells → frame) coheres and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is clean from the opening paragraph. Closure is on‑page: she rebraids, gathers artifacts, and chooses a new vessel and future use, reweighting “preservation” at the end. Minor explanatory lines do not break the throughline or the cost image.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: the revelation that “foresight is hindsight” lands as a Conceptual Repricing, supported by the storm’s physical pressure. Orientation is crisp from the opening image; the sequence—enter, interface, realize, exit—tracks cleanly. Cost is legible at closure (acceptance, foreclosing linear agency) and charged by the bunker flooding. The wafer seal’s redefinition as “exit” tightens the loop without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene tightens cleanly from descent to activation to awakening; the closure lands on the page as the palace lights and the covenant is sealed. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and beats link coherently (alignment → warming → second tile → resonance → final activation). The cost is mostly conceptual (lifelong austerity and attention) rather than a peak‑scene trade‑off, which slightly softens the cadence. Nevertheless, the before/after is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid drive (causal with accumulative texture): the Magistrate’s arrival → touch with the broken box → loosening grip → reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (relinquishing an identity of rage), though the price reads gentler than the setup implies. Orientation is quick and clean, and set-ups (silence, touch, box) pay off. The son’s fever is offstage, lowering pressure at the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence tightens cleanly: request → ritual → vision → break → repricing via the hand mirror. Causality is intact, with the broken breath collapsing the vision and necessitating Elara’s contingency. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a modest cost (abandoning capture for carrying). Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; no lens ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Situational lens holds: the urgent problem (dying quartz eyes) coheres pressure and forces a stance shift. Orientation is clean; closure lands with a decisive change (Elara resumes and teaches) and conceptual cost (defying the Council, relinquishing purity). The causal chain is tidy with no breaks, though conflict resolves without a hard on‑page setback, moderating impact. The final image reconfigures the premise convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Structure holds a Hybrid drive with accumulative texture and causal links (coordinates → meeting → bathroom → repricing). Orientation is firm within the first lines (curator, orchard on asteroid, shell), and the pattern is taught and paid off. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with cost: accepting a loop that entails forgetting/remembering and the “forbidden” act of writing across time. No dangling set‑ups; the ledger line returns with inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clean causal chain: password → descent → trap solved via pattern gaps → negotiation → release. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (the mountain accepts, the diary fills, passages open). The cost is conceptual and lightly sketched (trading hoarding for dissemination), which softens impact. The single‑scene flow and anchors are stable and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from arrival through thickening fog to the pin‑or‑carry decision, with on‑page cost as Coraline’s features fade. Orientation is clean from the outset and the motif threads are kept. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with a felt price. The causal spine is subtle but intact throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single-scene coherence and a clear causal thread (rope reconfiguration → revelation → timed doorway choice) support a strong closure. The ending lands as a conceptual repricing plus charged poise: she steps through at cost (risk of being trapped/translated). Orientation is clear early (clock tower, mechanism room, thirteenth chime). The hybrid drive with accumulative texture holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: her mapping → ritual → extraction → bloom softens the beings and reweights the system. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration as the cave’s music integrates silence, with a modest felt cost (effort, vigilance, and a changed map). Orientation is strong from the first paragraph. The solve arrives without a concrete setback, keeping cost from landing harder.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid lens leaning accumulative: the harmonic/silence pattern densifies toward the anti‑light ignition while causal beats (find shard → repair prism → align to drifted star paths) link cleanly. Closure lands with a decisive change (beacon rekindled; ships answering). Cost registers primarily as the weight of 17 years and the renunciation of the old light‑beacon paradigm. A slight ease—few obstacles in the ignition—keeps it shy of the absolute top.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens: a single continuous scene coheres to a closure via conceptual repricing—realizing it’s the cherishing in the moment that constitutes humanity—and resolves in a charged poise as survivors arrive. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph (who/where/when clear). The cost (world sealed in fog‑stone; life constrained to observatories) is legible and shapes the final image, though the turn is contemplative rather than decisively causal.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; pressure builds through ritual, community gathering, and material transformation into a closure image of sustained light. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the Dimming and fortress rules stay consistent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (“we make our own constellations”) with a conceptual price—the stars remain gone; endurance is the choice. Cost is felt but gentle; the sequence runs smoothly with minimal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear single‑scene structure with strong orientation; the accumulative lens holds as images and confessions intensify toward a charged poise. Closure lands via Chen’s tacit decision signaled by the cicada exchange and the “tomorrow” line, with conceptual cost (accepting the burden of foresight). The wave/bioluminescence beat provides the key turn/deepening. Stakes stay coherent and focused without sprawl.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the inversion’s onset, the doll’s sprouting, and the expanding cathedral of quiet build toward a reweighted understanding of “safety.” Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a resonant final image and a concrete plan (bring the vial to the father). The hour‑long window and choice to remain untethered supply light pressure, but the price on the page is soft. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and the scene is cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the terraces’ shifting acoustics and Marcus’s calibrated adjustments build toward a resonant reconfiguration: the woman no longer flinches at the whistle. Orientation is strong, and each pass (Opal Arch, Mirror Gallery, Prism Crown) compounds pattern and meaning. Closure cost is modest but felt—an acceptance of sound and relinquishment of defensive rigidity. The final image reweights the premise rather than delivering a neat fix.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the layered murals, the ruby projection, and the dawn ritual accumulate toward a Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is crisp from the opening and causality holds; each reveal reweights the quest’s premise. The cost is conceptual (renunciation of centralized power) with a tangible token (flake dissolution), landing cleanly. Pressure is gentle, but the end reconfigures the initial goal coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: encroachment → ritual → release → charged reprise with the ring. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—she recommits to the costly role, with isolation and scars as price. Orientation is clean early; one continuous scene supports the cadence shift as another shadow begins. The cost is legible in “some teachers must become absence itself” and the ring’s heat at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under a hybrid leaning accumulative lens, the scene escalates coherently: messages → convergence → pressure peak → bolt turn → transmutation. Orientation is firm early, and the bolt instruction ties causally to the climax. Closure lands as a decisive act with a conceptual repricing of her past, though the on‑page cost is more thematic than tangible. No teleports or unkept set‑ups; the pattern taught early pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: the standing waves intensify, reweighting the central stake until a decisive refusal lands. Closure is on the page: lifting the needle, loss of perception, shattering the window, and the plan to donate the estate together mark a decisive change with cost. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; setup pays off. The price is legible in the final image—choosing uncertainty and relinquishing inherited power.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: oath → awakening → hand-taking → identity reconfiguration, with on‑page cost (blood, dissolution of armor, loss of singular locality). Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a felt before/after. Causality remains clean within the mythic logic. The persistent price—becoming “between”—charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries layer (button → note → tracking → disturbed dust) until the closing charged poise of adding Timothy to the private index. Closure arrives as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise that reconfigures his quest: healing via witnessing imperfect kindnesses, not a single revelation. Orientation is clean early; causality is soft but coherent under the chosen lens. The cost—choosing the archives over life outside—remains legible at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a Causal lens, the story links beats cleanly: puddle‑map → key → tunnel → archives → upload → emergence. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise: the final image of the key and the morning light reconfigure stakes toward public remembrance, with the cost of leaders arrested. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and the single overnight window reads coherent. The on‑page price is mostly off‑screen (the arrests), keeping this just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres through the ritual of deliberate silence, the prism atrium’s rules, and the gathering ensemble, culminating in a charged reprieve rather than annihilation. Orientation is clean from the outset (who, where, what). Closure lands on the page with cost: the prophecy sleeps beneath “blankets of unplayed jazz,” and the price is the musicians’ renunciation. A single purposeful tightening occurs as more musicians join and the dewdrops carry away syllables.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details stack (seeds’ songs, moonstone ring, leaves’ letters) until a reconfiguration—Mira accepts the keeper role and the speck dissolves into her. Orientation is clean from the outset; single scene coherence is maintained. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual price (identity shift and duty), though the cost remains gentle. The beat where she prods the speck cleanly tightens the meaning cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates via pattern density: failed repairs → synchronized ticks → environmental integration → greenhouse choreography → vocational reframe. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR when he stops “fixing” and redefines purpose, with a real, if quiet, price (turning away clients, abandoning prior identity). Causality is coherent and oriented early; the cost is modest but legible on the page. The structure holds to one POV and two shards smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid lens with causal beats culminating in a conceptual repricing: the coin’s activation, the pouring of “distilled intention,” and the crack/reform turn reweight the central problem. Orientation is crisp and the action sequence coheres. The closure image (footprints like a constellation; dawn) holds cost via acceptance of fracture rather than a physical loss. Slight softness remains in the on-page price, but the cadence shift is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the approach at hidden sunrise → call → confession → “play it wrong” → dissolution forms a clean cadence shift. Closure lands on the page with cost—Thomas relinquishes his grip on perfection and dissolves—while the tooth’s heat/cool cycle marks stakes. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph. The arc is simple but coherent, with no causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory density and patterning build to a conceptual repricing where cruelty’s formulas find reciprocals. Orientation is clear early (recovery station, exile after treaty), and closure lands on the page with the strap’s removal, the walk into the forest, and the teaching act. External pressure is a touch soft (the rehab announcement doesn’t pinch later), but the persistent constraint of trauma shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is fast and clean (market on rope bridges, Mira at Valdric’s stall, the lighthouse painting). Under an accumulative/textural lens, the peeling of layers coherently deepens knowledge to reveal the map and the fragment’s meaning. Closure lands as a charged poise: Mira leaves with a plan to project histories into fog tonight, reweighting the world’s rules via art. The cost is implied (exposure of a protected secret; responsibility), but not strongly dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clean causal chain: failure → apparition → dust analysis → floorboard → journal → ceiling cache → revaluation of grandmother → decision to go public. Orientation is tight from the first paragraph. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: ghosts release their vigil and Marcus commits to exposure, reweighted by the mainspring’s promise. The cost is implied (taking on a dangerous corruption machine) rather than dramatized, keeping this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the dense imagery and pattern logic tighten from ordered cataloging to rupture to dissolution. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with cost—the library and Moth dissolve; the “page” becomes a compressed eternity that reweights the premise. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when), and each beat coherently escalates the dominant stake. The letterpress method and frost maps set up and pay off without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid drive: a causal negotiation deepens into a textural reveal (ghosts via shard) and resolves in a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing as Cassia commits to “resurrection.” Orientation is swift and clean; the scene holds one clear arc. Closure lands with a decisive stance that reweights the collection and future actions, though the cost remains largely conceptual. The beats link because→therefore without teleports or resets.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Causal. Because lies accelerate rust, Elias must work truth into the repair; because Vex arrives lying, pressure spikes; because the networked boxes amplify truth, the covenant breaks—clean because/therefore linkage. Closure is a decisive change with on‑page cost (Vex’s oxidation; the covenant’s dissolution). A hair of convenience in how swiftly the prepared system transforms the world keeps this just short of the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is clean early (factory shut, cave descent, purpose), and causality holds through discovery → vision → charged choice. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she foregoes the door now, leaving with a vial and a new limit. The cost is implicit (lost immediate crossing) but discernible in the charged final image. Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is crisp early (storm archway, van, cargo), and the accumulative/textural lens holds: pressure builds via storm, slide’s visions, and the carving trance. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—she reconfigures navigation and purpose, with the GPS flicker serving as counterpoint and cost. Causality is lyric rather than mechanical, but beats connect (GPS fails → shelter → slide → carving → reweighted compass). The cost is subtle yet legible on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: seasonal accretion leads to a solstice repricing where the postcards shift from relics to instructions and Mara accepts the lineage. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she embeds the secret and relinquishes open recognition. Cost is conceptual yet legible—the choice of darkness over daylight acclaim and the surrender of the postcards. Orientation is clean from the opening; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative lens holds: the arrival of the diary → retrocognitive trap → descent → debris cipher → coordinates → conceptual repricing. Orientation is crisp (zeppelin, Sahara, archivist, time split) and the throughline is clean. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: “the real encryption was courage,” with a visible reweighting of the diary and lagoon and a persistent cost in carrying truths that strain myths. The beat‑to‑beat causality is coherent, if the final cost remains chiefly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through images and the prolonged act of drawing essence, culminating in a charged final tableau (jellyfish heartbeat). Orientation lands early (who/where/why) and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual price: he rejects the wipe-clean path and binds himself to the town’s memory. Causality is clean—decision → method → town’s potential—and no late rule changes intrude. Cost is present but more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is swift (rooftop garden above drowned streets; foghorn silence as temporal anchor). Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: silence → discovery → immersion → prophecy → tower crack → night’s work → placement. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: prophecy reframed as pattern discovery with cost (the old world foreclosed, manuscript as counterfate). The because/therefore chain is more thematic than mechanical but holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: stabilization of the vortex, revelation of the pocket garden, and planting the acorn culminate in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the opening image. Closure lands with the garden’s return and the repricing of “borrowed time” as gift, though the cost is more implied responsibility than dramatized consequence. The scene remains coherent and single‑window.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal drive holds: anomalous readings and sensory cues therefore push Mara to ring the bell, therefore evacuation, therefore avalanche impact with mitigated harm. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when) and the single scene coheres. Closure lands on the page with the evacuation lights and avalanche, though the price is more conceptual than viscerally paid. “Zero hour had arrived” cleanly marks the tightening pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pattern of observation intensifies to the still-star disruption, then resolves in a reweighted final image. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: renewed purpose and a charged object retaining the whisper of light. Cost is present as the lived price of long isolation and vulnerability, though it stays conceptual rather than dramatized as a sacrifice. Orientation is clean and consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates from apparition to discovery to realization, culminating in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clean early; the stained glass box and ghosts tie causally to her final stance. The cost is legible on the page (choosing to carry the silence and remain as the last keeper). The structure is tight for the length, though the mid-beat could feature one more concrete impediment to intensify narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the story coheres: discovery of the urn fragment catalyzes the silo’s resonance, culminating in a conceptual repricing of time. Orientation is clear early and the single-scene frame holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Marcus’s purpose crystallizes—though the cost is more implied than felt. The “because/therefore” is soft, but the pattern-density increase provides structural strength.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: storm hush → kite struggle → snap → salvage and reframe → dawn repricing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost (the kite remains broken; perfection foreclosed). Orientation is clean early, and each beat coherently builds toward the final image without soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the wiring work, rule-learning via the diary, and final linkage cohere toward an on-page reconfiguration: the orchard activates and the role re-prices as “die at the correct frequency.” Orientation is clean early; who/where/when is never in doubt. Closure carries conceptual cost (her life) and a clear next action (confront trustees), earned by prior beats. Minor ease—no counterpressure on the page—keeps it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative dominance: layered observations and reveals culminate in a Conceptual Repricing (“We’re the experiment”). Orientation is clean from the opening; the scene holds single-POV coherence. Closure lands on the page with a felt conceptual price (rebellion scripted, faith/doubt reframed). Minor exposition in dialogue doesn’t fracture the chain of deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is solid by the opening paragraph; causality compounds through birds → nutrients → seed selection → planting → seeds splitting. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: war’s residue becomes fertilizer and memory is intentionally eroded. The cost is articulated as the mercy of forgetting—a quiet but legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under a Causal lens, the sequence cleanly links: cylinder → revelations → leaf‑map → journey → valley → role reconfiguration. Orientation is swift and firm (the Heap, Kemp, the phonograph), and the closure lands with a felt shift (from finding bodies to finding the living). Cost is present but modestly dramatized (risk and renunciation rather than a direct test). The miraculous valley skirts convenience but is foreshadowed via the tinted truths and ancestor gift, keeping causality intact.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers memory, object, and present action toward a Charged Poise closure. The decisive act—pressing the map to the compass—reconfigures the station’s options and brings crewmates into legible motion. Cost is inferable in the chosen isolation and acceptance of pariah status. Orientation is clear and the pattern taught early pays off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Situational lens holds: the Keeper’s test forces a stance crystallization, and the closure is a conceptual repricing where “wrongness” becomes intentionally wondrous. Orientation is immediate (who/where/why), and causality cleanly links arrival → test → amend → passing. The on‑page cost (breaking priceless knowledge) and acceptance of a new charge (“Teach others…”) land. Tight, single‑scene cohesion without teleporting props or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the patterned walking, the echoing acoustics, and the pawnless chessboard accrete until the door/voice intrusion tightens choices. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise when she refuses official witnessing and recommits to her practice, paying a conceptual and social cost. Orientation is clear from the outset; single scene integrity holds. The final cadence (“WE REMAIN”) reconfigures the premise with a felt before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: images and sensations tighten toward the decisive planting. Orientation is clean early (seer, mountain bookstore, mercury pools), and the stone’s guidance provides a coherent progression. Closure lands as a decisive act reframing the premise—she plants the future rather than reading it—carrying the cost of abandoning a practiced mode of control. The after‑image (word‑blooming plants) repays setups without mechanical over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats build coherently from boundary to tapestry to reconfigured board toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. Orientation is clean from the opening image; the woven hush functions as a purposeful pattern break that reweights options. Cost is on the page—he cannot unfreeze the village or undo the past—only his stance changes. The copper coin as final act seals the reconfiguration without mechanical over-closure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: whisper → chorus → chamber “memory” → boots approaching creates a coherent build to a conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is immediate (bone towers, ritual in three hours), and causality is clean. Closure lands as a reconfiguration of the ritual space into an amplifier of plurality with a stated price (the Silencers’ unforgiveness). The cost is more asserted than dramatized, since the antagonists arrive after her success.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene, tight clock, and clear causal sequence: match indentations → access memories → narrate to repair → extract crystal → fall. Closure lands as a charged poise/earned stasis with undeniable cost (death) and a conceptual repricing (brokenness as beauty secured). Orientation is clean early; no lens slippage despite lyric density. The pressure set by the dissolving moorings persists and shapes every step.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: cracked mirror → deviation from routine → cave discovery → journal revelation → reconfigured practice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she reframes her life’s work and accepts a dual practice with cost (secrecy, acceptance of “intimate aloofness”). The “pull” toward the path leans a touch convenient, but it doesn’t break logic or the closure unit. Single POV and scope remain tight within length.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal escalation: purify intention → release jasmine → climb → confront guilt → beckon → embodiment. Closure lands on the page with a felt price: three years of vigil and the acceptance of a “not fully human” return (RR/DC hybrid). Orientation is anchored immediately (who/where/when), and the single-scene arc holds cleanly. Slight neatness in the absolution moment (“The accident wasn’t your fault”) keeps it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid with Situational dominant: one night’s pressure (failed hydraulics, stalled array, incoming calls) coheres toward a stance crystallization. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she forecloses leaving and assumes the role of shepherd, with the censer foot and new scratches as concrete cost. Because/therefore links are clean (hydraulics fail → manual crank with censer foot; array angle improves → daylight signal) and no causality breaks. The final image reconfigures options with a price she accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: descent → find truffles → prepare mixture → drink → compulsion lifts → new plan. Closure is an on‑page Decisive Change plus a resonant reconfiguration of how truth might function socially. Cost is primarily conceptual (ethical burden, finite resource, clouded eye) rather than visceral, which tempers impact. Orientation is excellent and the lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single‑scene progression holds cleanly: dock inquiry → pattern recognition → temporal coordinates → identity/return. Closure is an earned stasis/charged poise: he resumes the watch reconfigured by regained memory, with felt cost. Hybrid drive leans accumulative at the end but causal links carry the investigation. No orientation debt; all anchors are clear early.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: chip arrival → memory “glimmer” → rising creek + ants → cavern → doorway map → choice. Orientation is crisp from the outset, single POV, one scene with a clear deepening at the doorway. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (he becomes a follower) with a conceptual repricing of his life’s work. The cost is implied rather than dramatized, keeping it short of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant lens: Situational. The pressure clarifies and tightens: inherited bargain → explicit ultimatum (“falls tonight”) → visible price (becoming a firefly-queen) → decisive act (transformation). Closure lands on the page with cost; the final image reweights the cycle with a charged cadence. Orientation is clean early, and causality is coherent without patches.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, patterns of light, memory, and twilight accrue until Lyra’s tactic shifts from capture to echo, producing a charged final image (the shell-sun). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost: she relinquishes the replicable, prison‑like model and accepts presence as something relational and unrepeatable. Orientation is clear from the opening, and each beat coheres around the dominant stake. The cost is felt but quiet, anchored by the admission that “the real discovery couldn’t be replicated.”

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the scroll, cabin, and layered timelines accrete toward a charged poise in the final image (all Mayas spreading wings; then returning to document). Orientation is clear early (Maya in the ranger cabin with birch scrolls) despite deliberate temporal blur, which pays off thematically. Closure lands on page with conceptual cost: she forecloses linear coherence and chooses ongoing chronicling under ambiguity. Transitions are legible, and the cadence shift at the end reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene tightens from discovery of the screw to the arrival and tactile lesson, culminating in the choice to reinstall the screw loose. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: time is restored but altered to acknowledge interruption, with cost accepted. Orientation is clean from the opening sentence; no lens ambiguity. The persistent constraint (loss of smell) shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single scene, clear anchors, and a coherent Hybrid drive with an accumulative end: pressure builds through breath and memory to the act of creating an original rune. Closure lands on‑page with cost (oxygen deprivation, visible shedding, status shift). The before/after is legible and thematically reweighted. The causal chain is clean with no unearned turns.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain under a hybrid leaning causal lens: email → meeting → perfume-current → orchard deadline → collaborative composition → ghost’s departure. Closure lands on-page with cost: Elisabetta dissolves, bottle empties, orchard is gone. Orientation is crisp early (cathedral archive, chainsaws above). The ending reconfigures Vera’s practice (conceptual repricing) while sealing the family arc.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues via the frozen dust, seven‑place simultaneity, a finite clock (“three thousand heartbeats”), and the spiral walk. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing—opposition unveiled as illusion, the library dissolving as she seeds language—achieving a legible before/after. Cost registers conceptually (relinquishing binaries, dissolving the sanctum) more than viscerally. Orientation is clean early; the pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the countdown, hydraulic system, and bell cadence build to a Conceptual Repricing (“distance between heartbeats”). Orientation is crisp from the opening and the lens remains coherent. Closure is on‑page with a charged final image and a modest felt cost (acceptance of role and its solitude). The turn is quiet rather than decisive, but it is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single-scene accumulative build: observation → anomaly → conceptual shift → phone call. Orientation is crisp from the opening; the lens holds as motifs accrue toward a cadence shift at the end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on‑page cost (calling Chen; letting the laser go still). Stakes remain coherent and contained to one dominant arc.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is strong from the outset (who/where/when), and the accumulative/textural lens holds. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: Elena reframes probability and gambling as the same search and acts by composing a new breadcrumb. The cost is present but soft—more conceptual than felt—limiting ceiling. The scene remains a single coherent window with one tightening beat (the visitor’s arrival) leading to the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is crisp by line one (who/where/when), and the piece holds a single, continuous scene. Under an accumulative/textural lens, closure arrives as Charged Poise: the final image fixes the pattern (“Tomorrow, Eleanor would call again”) with the price of his chosen solitude. The cost is legible in his endurance and the small cut from the disc, and the network/setting constraint persists through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens: the scene accrues pressure through setting, research revelation, and ritual action, culminating in a closure beat that reconfigures meaning. Closure is on-page via the codicil and the handoff of the covenant/locket (a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing). Cost is legible: she chooses a truth that may stain legacy while granting mercy. Orientation is clean from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative cadence at the end: the phone‑for‑moon‑rock exchange crystallizes into a charged poise as Marcus holds the phone and the station “waits.” Cost is visible: Marcus parts with an illegal family relic; Sadie parts with anonymity via binding Marcus into her network. Orientation is clean from the first line, and the rumor chain causality holds without seams.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern density builds (languages via touch, ring’s hum, fragmentary melody) to a resonant reconfiguration at the stillpoint. Closure lands—she internalizes the compass and returns changed—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt. Orientation is clean early; single scene coherence holds. A slightly frictionless path to the stillpoint keeps this from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single‑scene pressure coheres: mistake → anomaly insight → rescue ship arrival → choice. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: she refuses a binary, foreclosing unilateral authorship with conceptual cost. The cost is present but muted on the page (she feels “strange comfort,” while consequences remain offstage). Causal clarity and orientation are clean and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds through repeated gestures (clicks, signs, mapping) to a dawn reweighting: not music recovered, but a new medium embraced. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: acceptance of no audience, no sound, yet meaning found. Orientation is clean from the opening; the Leica and harbor recur to unify structure. The because/therefore is soft but coherent: mapping → interpretation → on‑site translation → charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: breadcrumb revelations layer toward a Charged Poise ending where she commits to mastering the technique. Orientation is clear early (Prague monastery, limestone corridors), and the causal chain from vandalized art to archive is coherent even in summary. Closure lands as a meaningful reconfiguration—arsonist to keeper—with a conceptual cost (isolation, hunted status) implied on the page. The price is more conceptual than dramatized, keeping it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean orientation and a coherent two‑shard structure: lab to lagoon to lab/lagoon overlay. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds to the cadence shift when she releases the pattern and inverts the system. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with legible cost (her bodily failure/dissolution) and a conceptual repricing (cage → nursery). Causal threads (the drumming → subnet → fusion) read motivated and intact.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single‑scene situational drive holds: storm disables systems; therefore Marcus’s analog methods govern; therefore they reach XB‑471; therefore Chen concedes. Closure lands with a felt exchange—coin handed over, authority reconfigured—and the medical‑supply stake resolved on‑page. The cost is conceptual (ceding symbolic power, accepting vulnerability) rather than visceral but legible. Orientation is crisp from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density and cadence shift toward the gift of the mirror, reweighting the stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: Thomas relinquishes the fantasy of a last speech and accepts what was already said in action. Orientation is clean and the single scene contains a clear tightening. The cost is felt in the tears and the relinquishment rather than stated as a tidy fix.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/when anchored in the cobalt library’s twilight window). The accumulative/textural drive coheres: mist/library/grotto → Elena’s crisis → synchronized windows → communal arrival → Elena’s “Checkmate” to the old world. Closure lands as a charged poise/conceptual repricing; the price is implied (exposure to the director and regime) rather than paid on the page. The ending’s cost is felt but soft because the confrontation doesn’t occur in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive leaning causal: scrimshaw discovery → confrontation → whale call → unbinding → island’s becoming. Orientation is clean, and closure lands with cost (abandoning a protective identity and life on the docks). The scrimshaw and whale call function as causal triggers rather than deus ex machina. One tight deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the patterned narration and whittling densify into a charged final shift when Mrs. Chen adopts the method. Orientation is clean from the outset; stakes coherently compress toward the bird-and-bouquet tableau. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (embracing emotional flatness as resistance). No causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the hum → dance → lake cracking → communal arrival forms a coherent build to a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is strong from the outset (Silas, atrium, frozen lake, ban lifted). Closure lands with the lake’s scriptures giving way to “a sky full of doors,” but the cost is predominantly conceptual rather than felt on Silas. Still, the on‑page turn is legible and satisfices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal links hold: Mira’s offer → Enzo’s bargain → shared practice → sound sculpture → daughter’s return. The montage of “over weeks” remains within a single arc and pays off with an on‑page reunion that reconfigures stakes. Cost is legible in Enzo’s shame and prior letter‑burning, though the reunion arrives a bit smoothly. Closure reads as a decisive change with resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats cohere: return → doubt → lens‑reframed seeing → improvisation → community gathers → repriced ending. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—she rejects the “artificial pilgrimage” and inaugurates a new practice. Cost is present but light (abandoning the sanctioned sequence). Orientation is clean early; causality holds through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear anchors arrive early (observatory, bench, candles), and the accumulative/textural lens holds through a quiet tightening when the stranger enters. Closure lands as a Charged Poise: she presses the stencil, chooses another crane instead, and tends the beacon, with the cost of ongoing uncertainty legible. Because/therefore is soft but coherent: light → visitor → shared making → renewed, not completed, self‑commitment. The final image reweights prior motifs without resolving them away.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the scene coheres around a single inquiry. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the community’s “distributed cultural archive” reframes the survival question and reweights the meaning of value and connection. The cost is largely conceptual (abandoning centralization; committing to mapping rhythms), but it’s present and charged in the final exchange (“Forty‑three days”).

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal spine: pattern‑avoidance grants access; tiers escalate knowledge and cost; guardians close in; choice to absorb the plague effects closure. Orientation is immediate (who/where/what) and the scene holds one coherent window. Closure lands on the page with cost—“carrying ten thousand years of memory in her cells, forever changed.” The hybrid causal/accumulative lens holds, culminating in a reweighted final image.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pattern recognition → activation → metamorphosis → repricing of purpose. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with legible cost—she assumes a generational duty, accepting the waiting darkness. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the river stone and interface keep causality tidy. The on‑page shift into the grandmother’s dream provides the decisive tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single‑scene causal chain is clean: exposure by Dr. Chen → removal of chips → repair → decision to confess and accept legal and institutional fallout. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she chooses truth and responsibility; the cost (sanctuary closure, legal trouble, rehoming 300 animals) is explicit on the page. Orientation is immediate and stable; the lens holds. The final image of the chameleon’s careful grip reweights the entire arc.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs accrete (hourglass, coffee ring, scars, plants) until a conceptual repricing lands—miracles dispersed, openness as praxis. Orientation is clean from the start (who/where/when), and the final turn (turning the hourglass “once more”) reconfigures the premise with cost implied. The causal line from surgery → scars speaking → plant chorus → reframed mission is coherent. Stakes resolve through a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive external act, appropriate to the design.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held; the psychometric immersion deepens steadily to a charged final act. Orientation is clean (who/where/when within the opening), and set-ups (demolition, the film, Eleanor) pay off. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes “demolition” into a private delivery of the letters with a felt ethical cost. The quietness is intentional and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive: a causal spine (align, cross threshold, rest, turn final ring) delivered in a lyric, accumulative texture. Closure lands decisively as the archway crumbles and creativity returns, with an evident cost as she fades. Orientation is clean from the start, and set‑ups (astrolabe, falling‑star map) pay off. Minor softness in on‑page resistance keeps it just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid lens with an Accumulative/Textural dominance holds: the pirate’s intrusion tightens pressure, and the lullaby tactic creates a clean because/therefore beat. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she recommits to tending the “quantum gardens,” keyed to the frozen clock. Cost is conceptual (her perpetual dreamlessness and vigilance) rather than a fresh on‑page loss but is legible in the final image. Orientation is clear early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of sonic cues → Loom Tree → gear insertion coheres and yields a resonant reconfiguration. Closure is on-page: the forest changes song, memory reconfigures, and the nightly translocation imposes a persistent constraint as he dissolves. Cost is felt but light—he cannot remain and must work incrementally. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the causal thread holds without rule breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the crossing sequence tightens toward a resonant reconfiguration: she relinquishes grip and returns changed, with “proof of passage.” Orientation lands early and the ritual logic holds (twilight‑only crossing, ticket punch, solitary return). Cost is legible in the foreclosed path of holding on and the requirement to make the return alone. The cadence shift at the shore crystallizes the before/after without mechanical exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; the patterned build of silence/sound, object returns, and spatial cues culminates in a reweighted final note. Orientation is clear early, and the two‑shard frame (present with charged backstory) remains legible. Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: sound offered deliberately, with the felt costs (lost voices, scars, frostbite) alive on the page. Causal threads (bolt → bench → Elena → note) cohere without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: discovery of messages → correspondence → breach attempt → confrontation → revelation. Closure lands on page with the pellet’s activation exposing deception and forcing the pretender’s flight, while Syln settles into earned stasis. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but the before/after is legible. Orientation and lens (Causal) are taught early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single POV, one continuous window, and an accumulative/textural build are cleanly executed. Closure arrives as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she lowers the station to dive after re-seeing the “dead” reef as a transcribed town. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and set‑ups (atlas page, tapping) pay off. The cost is implied (risk, duty breach) rather than concretely tallied, which softens impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-scene accumulative build is clear and oriented early; the circle’s hum and the repair bay’s resonance deepen toward a charged-poise ending. Closure lands as a reconfiguration: she reframes the “failed” uprising and commits to bring others tomorrow. Cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, which trims impact. The lens stays consistent with the lyric, textural escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Causal. Each beat links cleanly (kite → formula → dissolution → genetic cascade → implant failure), culminating in a decisive change with conceptual stakes. Orientation is crisp early, and closure lands on the page. The cost reads more implied than felt—her irreversible act and its risks are acknowledged but not painfully priced in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece tightens from bodily tremor to a charged stillness and resolves in a quiet Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she will keep planting while violence persists. Orientation is clean early (arboretum, cliff, abandoned lighthouse), and the photograph/trees recur to carry through. Cost is legible in the choice to live with ongoing grief and danger. The final beacon sweep reweights prior images without mechanical tying off.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is taught early and held: walls “closing,” cards shifting, sketching as untangling, culminating in the beam’s blaze. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing/Resonant Reconfiguration: she reframes fragmentation as wholeness, with the cost of relinquishing her former seeing. Orientation is solid (who/where/when) by the first paragraph, and the final question-image combo lands on the page. No causal slips or unearned reveals.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Anchors are immediate (who/where/when) and the piece holds an accumulative/textural lens. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing: she reframes crisis-time as consciousness accessing hidden quantum states. The eclipse clock provides a clean tightening into the final acceleration. Cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized loss, keeping it shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: illicit letter → decision → activation sequence → upload clock vs security clock → deliberate cooling failure → arrival of guards at completion. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she accepts the cost as security turns the corner while the release becomes unstoppable. Orientation is crisp from line one (who/where/when), and the drive lens remains Causal through the end. The cost is on-page and undeniable; only minor note is that external resistance arrives late.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the father’s arrival intensifies the established pattern, culminating in a charged poise ending as they plant together. Orientation is early and clean; the single-scene window is tight. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration, with the weapon sheathed and a joint act that reweights their opposition. The cost is subtle but legible in the relinquishment of stance in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: pattern‑break window → silence‑casting → echo’s testing → dance → reweighting at dawn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with a legible constraint (timed liminal bloom) and a price in discipline/identity shift. Orientation is clean by ~120 words; no causality slips.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clear causal chain: journalist’s call triggers investigation, proof by contradiction yields a new understanding, leading to a decisive misdirection. Orientation is firm from the opening, and the drive lens (Causal) holds cleanly to closure. The ending delivers Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with a visible cost (“goodbye kiss to honesty,” locking the nib). No dangling threads undermine the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density of sound → language → mathematics → constellation culminates in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on‑page with cost (amber cracks; the ghosts thank her; the lab falls silent), making a before/after legible. Orientation is clean early, and the fold/time constraint frames the window of action. The final charged poise—the pulsing constellation—reprices the premise with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: sound, sand, and tile details accrue into a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Orientation is clear early (grotto, mist, unlearning), and the tile’s fall tightens the piece into a culminating pattern shift. Closure is on-page: she redefines forgetting and accepts impermanence, with the act of leaving the mandala as the felt cost. A hair more external pressure would push this higher, but the cadence shift is decisive for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, each tessera action intensifies pattern and meaning until the mosaic renames her, reconfiguring the premise from curse to invitation (CR). Cost is legible: persistent painful visions, public risk from the Brotherhood, and a commitment to build under hostile doctrine. Orientation is clean from the opening and the final image tightens options toward action.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, echoes and layered performances intensify toward the reunion, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration: two ghosts stabilize a fractured garden through their “true ending.” Orientation is strong from the outset (maze, orchard, amphitheater, coin). Closure arrives on the page with the coin’s transformation and names carved, though the felt price is soft (eternal encore framed as blessing more than sacrifice). Causal linkage is consistent: coin → echoes → temporal braiding → Isabella’s arrival → stabilized orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single scene, clear anchors, and a coherent accumulative build from showing the geode/pills to manifesting the empathy architecture. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: “not telepathy—empathy made tangible,” with a charged final image of shared illumination. Cost is light (little felt risk or sacrifice on the page), keeping it strong but short of exceptional. Because/therefore links are adequate, with pressure mounted mostly through demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sensation → deeper chamber → encounter → reweighted role. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing as the fossil fulfills its purpose and Kira reframes her purpose to teaching others. Cost is on‑page (loss of the fossil; relinquishing singular authority) and the world logic stays consistent. The beat progression is smooth if low‑tension, with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is consistent: the echo, buttons, and hourglass create a density build that culminates in the black glass emptying then refilling. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—prophecy becomes possibility—with a legible before/after. Cost is primarily conceptual (relinquishing fixed foreknowledge), which is present but subtle. Anchors (who/where/when) are clear early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal. Pillbox → coordinates → codes → meeting → reveal → decision forms a clean because/therefore chain. Closure lands as a decisive choice with a conceptual price (risk, self-redefinition), though the on‑page cost remains somewhat abstract. Structure is tight and oriented early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the rain’s ticking and fog density structure the scene until the lift. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—she’s lightened, but the mark remains; he resumes the route. Causality is clean (he distills → essence returns to her → fog retreats → ride begins). Cost is legible in the limitation that nothing is erased and the temporal cut-off.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds via the glass’s thrumming, the oasis’s temporal coherence, and the smoke’s synchronizing signal. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—kindness and solar alignment anchor time—reweighting the premise with a quiet cost (lifetimes of seeking, the choice to leave). Orientation is crisp early (who/where/what), and all seeds are paid off. The cost is more conceptual than visceral but legible in the final earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: images and small choices build toward the charged act of leaving the gauge at the dock. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with a visible price (surrendering the heirloom, retiring the rose). Orientation is crystal clear early, and the progression is clean. The pressure is modest, but the cadence shift at the act is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres via the stone circle’s rising hum, the sundial’s warming, and the expanding vision of “contemporary survivors,” leading to a conceptual repricing at the end (casting a shadow). Closure carries cost in renouncing the fantasy of re‑creation for coexistence with absence. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the single‑scene structure holds. The cost is felt but modest, keeping it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece builds patterned density toward a Charged Poise: the completed spiral, mirrored pond, and hand clasp reweight the premise. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the reflective sections are anchored by ongoing making. The closure lands conceptually with a cost of vulnerability and past secrecy, albeit lightly dramatized. The “we’re all writing the same letter” realization coheres the structure without a hard causal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: anomalous signals → discovery of subsonic weapon → decision to counter‑broadcast → faculty clarity → vote postponed. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the “vote tonight” clock provides structural pressure. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus Charged Poise: the vote is halted and the enemy redefined, with an ongoing vigilance cost. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, limiting top‑band reach.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid drive leaning accumulative/textural: the organ’s coordinates reshape space and options until the nexus and the twin compass precipitate a Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is clean from the open, and beats connect logically without teleports or resets. Closure lands with the silence and the two compasses, though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt. A hair more risk or foreclosed path at the peak would strengthen the decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the portraits accrue into a pattern that reconfigures meaning and culminates in the targeted call to check psychiatric hospitals. Closure is a conceptual repricing with a charged poise final image (ribbon pressed in sketchbook), and the cost is the relinquishment of conventional evidence in favor of her reconstructed composite. Orientation is clean early; causality is coherent through “therefore” beats (ribbon → insight → call). The cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: nail → projection shift → decoded routes → storm escalates → beacons appear → decisive broadcast. Closure lands as a decisive act under risk, with a charged final image (nail aligning with the storm). Orientation is solid within 120 words, and the hybrid causal/situational lens holds. The cost is implied rather than deeply dramatized, keeping it shy of the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: shard revelation → reverse‑playing → rematerialization → reconfiguration of role. Orientation is clear from the first lines (who/where/when), and the single scene maintains continuity. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with the choice to keep playing charged by responsibility. Cost is present but subtle (accepting ongoing duty; letting him fade again), keeping this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: seasonal phases of deterrence build toward a conceptual reweighting and a concrete outcome (TerraLoop dissolves). Orientation is clean early; setups (bills, acoustics, maps) pay off causally in Chen’s recognition and decision. Closure reads as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with legible cost (company abandoned; Marcus bound to his role). The because/therefore links are soft but coherent for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observations accrue (telegram → star pulse → temple correlation → warnings) toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands in the decision to “carry this together” and the ritualized passing‑forward (memory card), with a conceptual cost (accepting the burden rather than a messianic release). Orientation is clean and the scene remains continuous with one cadence shift at dawn. The price is more conceptual than visceral but is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant lens: Causal. Because/therefore linkages are clean: failed illusion → dive → garden discovery → amber cracks ice → charged return. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the meaning of dishonor inverts and reweights the war’s premise with the seed in hand. Cost is present but mostly deferred (social peril and looming execution); a concrete on‑page sacrifice would have elevated the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is consistent: pattern recognition → planting → maze growth → scar-reading → intersection → poised signature. Closure lands as Charged Poise: “ready to sign her name in starlight,” with a conceptual cost of becoming the anchor. Orientation is clean early; causality is coherent within the lyric logic. The cost is felt but abstract, keeping it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under a hybrid lens with causal dominance, beats tighten cleanly: descent → rule warning → specific tree → challenge → realization → bite. Closure lands on the page with visible cost: “binding it forever to another’s interrupted story,” and the card’s ashing seals the shift. The scene stays within one contiguous window, and the keeper’s intervention escalates rather than resolves by fiat. The final image (ash as promise) reweights the premise without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear single‑scene spine under an accumulative/textural lens: tactile analysis → memory ignition → revaluation → call. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: preservation reframed as performance, with the phone call as decisive act. Orientation is crisp from the opening; no lens ambiguity. The cost is emotional/reputational and legible, if not harrowingly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong causal chain: translation → magnet array → ascent → arbor → timed choice → ingestion and transformation. Closure lands as a decisive change with conceptual cost and a coherent before/after. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the lens (causal with conceptual repricing at the end) holds. Slight softness in on‑page resistance keeps it short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: tide → arrival → furnace apex → prismatic emergence → quiet return. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: Kaine resumes tending with reweighted calm after facilitating a smelt; the final image reconfigures the premise. Cost is implied (danger of smelting, Kaine’s ongoing compromise) more than dramatized. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; no lens ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: reading → etching → radiance → outreach creates a tightening cadence with on‑page cost. Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/when), and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a concrete decision (calls, altered report). The pearl’s effect on the bunker adds a persistent constraint that shapes choice. No causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the present‑tense exploration tightens through graffiti → self‑insertion on the map → decision to begin anew without a map. Orientation is clean from the opening and the scene holds unity. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost: acknowledging failure and foreclosing his data‑as‑absolution tactic. The “Mile marker zero” line provides an on‑page hinge without mechanical neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: observation → patterning of delays → cipher alignment → invitation from the future self. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with resonant reconfiguration: she was always both seeker and keeper, and her notes enter the system. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; cause/effect within the accumulative frame is coherent. Cost is present but subtle (selfhood and future role assumed rather than chosen under duress).

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under a Causal lens, the because/therefore chain is clean: prophecy → forged provenance → confrontation → touch-triggered justice → renunciation. Closure is on‑page with cost: she foregoes power and the violin sublimates, reconfiguring options and consequence. The rule‑set (ice‑singers’ justice) is seeded and paid off without breaking causality. Orientation is clear early; single scene holds coherently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds as the Silence rises; cadence tightens into the chip’s song and the charged poise ending. Causality is clean—harvested chip → infusion → alignment of patterns → protective bubble—as the grotto freezes. Closure lands via Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: they accept an “eternal almostness,” with visible cost (loss of the grotto, foreclosed return to ordinary life). Orientation is crisp from the opening; no lens ambiguity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story escalates through density and pattern recognition (spiral floor, mirrored hairpin), culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: she is the pilgrimage, not the guide of maps. Orientation is clean and the single-scene window holds; the closure lands, though the cost is primarily conceptual and gentle. The because/therefore linkages are modest but coherent to the design.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single continuous scene, clean anchors, and a closure that lands as a charged poise/conceptual repricing: Marcus is left holding the shard reweighted to reflect “gray spaces,” with a felt cost in grief. The accumulative lens holds: motif density rises and culminates without a mechanical turn. Stakes narrow from “explain the daughter” to whether Marcus will nurture nuance. Causality is coherent, with the chime‑revealed discovery providing the key tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene accumulative build is coherent: the ring‑count sequence and trance deepen toward the tenth ring inversion and Marcus’s reframed understanding. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and closure lands as a conceptual repricing with the final ring image. The cost is primarily conceptual (withholding knowledge, recasting “backwards aging”), which is effective but soft. Causal clarity is less important under the textural lens and holds steady.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern density increases (vultures → synchronization → swallows → voice return), culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where her own voice closes the circuit. Closure lands with visible cost—300 years of stillness—and a charged poise: “I am still here.” Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when established). The final beat reweights all prior material without mechanical tying-off.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: image density builds to a conceptual repricing where imperfection becomes sacred. Closure carries cost on the page—the medallion renunciation and willingness to risk the mist—and reconfigures the premise under an automated-creation world. Orientation is clean by ~120 words, and causality within the lyric frame is coherent. The final cadence tightens around a charged object and stance rather than resolving via convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Conceptual Repricing as lanterns become doorways and Elena’s dispersed consciousness reframes reality. Orientation is clean early; the sequence of discovery → reading → ritual → response builds coherently. The cost is conceptual (giving up concealment and taking on a calling) rather than materially dramatized but lands. No causality breaks or teleports under the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and pattern intensify (bursts, resonance, tuning‑fork revelation), culminating in a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing (“become the decision”). Orientation is early and stable (who, where, end‑of‑universe premise). Closure lands: the final configuration reprises the opening pattern and reweights the mission with the amber “prison‑paradise” cost. The cost is conceptual rather than dramatized through loss in‑scene, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds cleanly: dusk, lens, and recordings cohere toward the crystallization and naming as a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost—eternity and erasure persist, but her stance toward fear changes. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The causal mechanism (celestial alignment + lens + reaper presence) is taught and used without late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong causal chain: dew rate → viaduct resonance → suspended third drop → overlap of realms → partial restoration. Orientation is crisp early, and the single scene tightens around the “third drop” beat as the decisive turn. Closure lands with a concrete change (fish return) and a lingering cost (“not all of them,” Mira’s collapse). The Causal lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative lens holds: images and sites stack until the conceptual turn—Marcus reframes his role and commits to surfacing the erased story. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when; ridgeway; staged drainage). Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he chooses to develop and name, with implied social cost against the commissioners’ “precisely humane lie.” The cost is subtle but legible through the institutional counter-current and the coming officials.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details stack toward a closure where releasing the crystal reweights the premise. Closure is on-page with cost (she sacrifices the rare object), and the “tomorrow” clock plus the orchard return coherently drive that choice. Orientation is clear early and stays stable. The causal line is lyric rather than plotty, but still coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Situational lens holds: a new voice during the narrow transmission window forces a stance. The decisive changes—altered report, strategic lie, release of coordinates—land with implied cost. Orientation is clean early; closure resolves to a charged poise/earned stasis. A sharper on-page consequence would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clear causal progression: revelation of the jar’s origin → proposed vivification → sparring reframes the conflict → commitment to meet the duplicate and create a third consciousness. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR; the cost is conceptual (relinquishing exclusivity of identity, fatherhood implications), not viscerally paid on the page but legible. Orientation is clean and the single‑scene window holds. A slightly stronger on‑page price at the end would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the envelope triggers a clear because/therefore chain (message → night planting) while atmosphere densifies toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Closure lands as a reconfiguration: the haven self‑protects and Mira assumes a broader role as guardian/teacher; cost is implied responsibility and opposition to development, not explicitly paid. Orientation is clean and the single scene coheres. A more concrete on‑page price at the close would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sonic ritual builds coherently to a resonant reconfiguration: Emma’s on‑page laugh and the parents’ release. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the piece holds its rules (tunnel acoustics, frequencies) without cheats. The cost is subdued but present (ongoing haunting, sustained labor, grief channeled into work). Slight softness remains because nothing resists the ritual beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: scholar arrives → request → guardian’s reveal and choice → pendant transfer → Codex opened → departure. Orientation is crisp from the first third, and each step narrows options. Closure lands on-page with cost: she abandons post and self-definition to risk “not knowing if you’ll arrive whole.” The persistent constraint of the sealed winter and the pendant’s rules shape tactics to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Causal. Each step (“failed restorations” → embrace of creative destruction → ash forms iterating → blood sacrifice) tightens options and leads to an on‑page Decisive Change. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when), and the cost is legible: destruction of a relic, blood, and clear heresy. The closure is clean and motivated, with no causality gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the scene coheres from ascent to attunement to repricing, with a clean on‑page closure (“she’d already decided to tune her life differently”). The perigee window, the fragment’s activation, and the hush “door” escalate knowledge toward a decisive stance. Cost is legible in forgoing Guild monetization; the recording of “the spaces around it” preserves consequence. Orientation is crisp by ~100 words and the pattern remains stable to dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: pattern density builds (horns, flashes, coherence loss, hourglass heat) to a Resonant Reconfiguration where convergence remakes the world’s rules. Orientation is clean from the outset, and setup pays off via on‑page action (“Convergence protocol initiated”). Cost is legible: the hourglass’s destruction and the renunciation of vanishing. Mechanistic hand‑waving is acceptable at this lyric scale because the closure lands and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and volatility of patterns increase, thread runs out at completion, and the gallery is reweighted into a labyrinth. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise—reality itself is altered and visitors will pay the price tomorrow. Orientation is clean from the start; the single scene is coherent. The cost reads more conceptual than embodied, keeping it shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean and the accumulative/textural lens holds: demonstration → alien validation → exercises → charged final image. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (depth/distance as illusions), but the on‑page cost is mostly conceptual, not felt through a narrowed option or loss. The beats link coherently without and‑then drift. Quiet, legible cadence shift at the end earns the piece’s finish.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid drive (causal with accumulative signals) holds: hearing‑aid pulses → photo erasure → birthday dirge → theft realization → basement location → sprint. Orientation is clean by ~120 words. Closure lands as a charged poise/early reversal: she commits and the city begins to “remember,” with conceptual cost in the role she accepts. The resolution leans on implication rather than a concrete confrontation, slightly softening cost.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive dominated by causal turns: entry → detection → realization → chamber manipulation → retreat, all under a live tide constraint. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she forgoes disclosure and commits to yearly witness with an emotional cost. Orientation is clear early, and set-ups (cables, chamber, map) pay off. The EM-eating entity is delivered succinctly; it functions causally rather than as a late patch.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; the density builds via heartbeat counts, radio clearing, ink patterns, and code cascade, culminating in a conceptual repricing of life/death with a charged final image. Orientation is clear early (observatory, snow, monitors) and held. Closure lands as a stance shift to coexistence and a forward plan (“Tomorrow, he would begin teaching others”), with conceptual cost (foregoing singular identity). The price is more thematic than concrete but legible in the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and patterning build to the dawn cadence shift and CR—curse becomes translator, language’s death reweighted into a new tongue. Orientation is clean and the because/therefore chain within the lyric mode is coherent (diamond → birds’ gap → alignment → carving → dawn). Cost appears on‑page via her transformation (years‑later shard), linked to the tunnel of echoes. The closure feels earned and specific, though the decisive personal price is displaced from the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid lens with a causal spine: static messages → reinterpretation of the stake → decisive acceptance and ritual act (dialing a dead phone). Orientation is clean, stakes cohere, and the arrowhead dissolving provides on‑page closure with conceptual repricing. The cost (letting go of grief/identity) is legible but not deeply dramatized, softening the impact. Still, progression is coherent and lands.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each musical pass intensifies consequence (statues falter → trees struggle → alarms → charged poise). Closure lands as a charged poise: she continues playing as enforcement nears, with clear before/after (automatons regain hearts; orchard reconfigures) and a felt cost. Orientation is immediate (sky‑bridge, orchard, automatons) and causality is clean (music → awakening). The price is legible in the final beats without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative/textural drive holds: drones arrive, absences pattern into purpose, the Keeper appears, the bottle transfers, and the closing image reweights Ezra’s route as faith. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the single‑scene structure is coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn, with conceptual cost (risk, renunciation of official protocol) felt but understated. A sharper tightening beat—e.g., a complication at the handoff—would raise the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the beats flow cleanly: fragment → elongated chime → wrong turn → oasis → halo completion → song. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (singing) and the price is legible (risk, cracked voice, altered stasis). Orientation is clear from the opening, and the causal chain is coherent without conveniences resolving a problem introduced late. The final return to the workshop confirms a reconfigured trajectory rather than a reset.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds cleanly from ritual to marginalia to vision, landing a conceptual repricing: stories as topology rather than place. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the pattern (mathematics as memory map) is taught early and paid off. The cost is gentle (the scarf’s unraveling/acceptance of change) but present. No causality breaks; the deepening is internally motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative structure tightens cleanly from arrival to coalescence to refusal. Closure is an Earned Stasis: she sets down the palette, foreclosing resurrection with visible cost. Orientation is crisp early (archipelago at dawn; floating library; skiff), and causality holds. The price is on the page in the “warmth” leaving and the dissolving figure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Conceptual Repricing with Charged Poise (the idea loosed; dawn walk; price in blood and fatigue). Orientation is clear early, and the pattern (nexus shifts → star hint → impossible shadow → fear‑web) coheres. The cost is on the page, and the turn at the “last tumbler” cleanly lands the before/after. Slight abstraction in the middle doesn’t undermine the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: return → pattern detection → ritual act → memories manifest → acceptance with cost. Closure is on the page with a decisive change and conceptual repricing (the burden and obligation to teach). The drive lens reads primarily causal with accumulative imagery supporting it and holds through the end. No orientation debt; stakes tighten once when the bargain’s price is revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a causal lens, each beat links cleanly: shard discovery → tea‑geometry method → revelation of the Council flaw/mother’s messages → collaborative annotation → reweighted ending. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: knowledge gained, tactics defined, and a cost felt; the final quiet (“something new was beginning”) seals the before/after. Anchors are clear within the first hundred words (who, where, what). No major causal gaps or outliney jumps.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene accumulative build is coherent: dawn approaches, she “weaves,” then plants, and the seed bifurcates—a clean closure image. Orientation is early and solid; rules are learned through action. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration, though the felt cost at the ending is subdued (more implied lifetime cost than on-page price). The lens holds, but escalation remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual actions steadily reweight stakes toward the dawn settling. Closure lands on-page with a resonant reconfiguration as spirits rise, reunite, and “settle” at sunlight; the cost is her night’s labor and the net’s total unraveling. Orientation is clean from the start, and set-ups (prisms, net, needle) pay off materially. The causality is ritual-logic rather than plotty turns, but consistent and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: evidence accrues via video comparison, UV oils, and ritual gestures to a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing at the palm press. Orientation is crisp, and set‑ups (torn edge, twin monitors, silence) pay off coherently. Cost is conceptual (forgoing cartographic mastery for presence), felt but not heavy, which keeps this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres cleanly: discovery → recognition → contraction → reply → ascent. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: loss reframed as frequency shift, paid for by allowing the library to flood while transmitting its meaning through her. Orientation is crisp by ~120 words, and set‑ups (globe, equations, transmission) pay off. The cost is legible on the page in the shrinking air pocket and relinquishment of the intact library.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm window → crystallized message → night of translation work → dawn image. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: the machines gain voice and Chorus accepts a role, reweighting the premise. Causality is clean (between lightning and thunder as constraint; device mediates). Cost is subtle (lifelong commitment implied), enough for this mode but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: goggles → coordinates → astrolabe → diary → repricing of Thorne’s “death” as departure. The elevator’s count creates a tight single‑scene frame with an on‑page RR/CR closure. Cost is subtle (choosing a life of continued ascent/solitude reweighted by care), but legible. Orientation is immediate and consistent; the hybrid drive leans accumulative/textural with causal payoffs and holds through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the drift, observations, and storm density build toward a conceptual repricing (not just “spaces remember” but “they give memories back”). Orientation is clean early, and a persistent constraint (untethered gondola) shapes tactics. Closure lands on the page via the final notation and reweighted premise; cost is implied (isolation, risk, refusal of rescue) rather than dramatized at knife-edge. The structure is coherent and contained within one scene.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → interpretation → construction → charged witnessing. Orientation is clean early, and closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing with the library’s fall imminent and the coin’s continuity in her hand as cost. The time clock coheres causally without forced reversals. No major causality slips or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the starlings as “living cartographers,” the hopscotch cipher, and the phrasebook reweight the mission from discovery to rediscovery at a personal cost of continued solitude and endurance. Orientation is clean from the opening. Escalation is a patterned deepening rather than hard turns, but the breakthrough (“They’re writing”) tightens options and governs the ending choice.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: discoveries (prophecy scraps, humming gears, frosting mirrors) accrete toward a conceptual repricing of her role. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; single scene coherence holds. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—she descends with a new tactic and cost (deferral, restraint) that reweights the dominant stake. The price is conceptual rather than event‑driven but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.1)
    The causal chain is tight: messages → shared evidence → Dr. Chen’s inference → fences down → networked immunity; the “because/therefore” links hold throughout. Orientation is immediate and sustained. Closure lands on the page with cost: Marina’s fading and the bell’s materialization reconfigure the world and her presence. The months-long montage is brisk but coherent and does not undercut the causal payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discovery → realization → ritual enactment → reweighted world image. Closure lands with a resonant reconfiguration as the doomsday clock moves backward and his method transmutes from calculation to lullaby; the price is the lifelong burden he assumes. Orientation is clean, and the puppet’s installation in the lens is a decisive act that pays off prior patterns. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it shy of the absolute top.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear causal chain: frost clock + birds + travelers → guide-through tactic → seed handoff → earned stasis at frost seal. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she forecloses leaving by ensuring the seed remains outside, with cost explicit. Orientation is clean early; the blueprint backstory tightens the stake rather than derailing scene. No major causality breaks or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single scene, clear anchors, and an accumulative build from foam observation to action make the structure clean. Closure lands on page via a Decisive Change (sending the text) paired with a resonant release (the chrysalis). The cost—relinquishing control and accepting divergence—reads. Elena’s immediate invitation slightly softens the pressure but doesn’t break the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens: the request → procedure → reweighted world lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Orientation is excellent and the closure image (sunset/rise ambiguity; shop’s transformation) reprices the premise. Cost is legible in the risk of removing endings and the library’s tremble, though a sharper on‑page consequence for the child would deepen it. The beats cohere with no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate (chef, desert fortress, first rain), and pressure coheres toward a decisive act. Closure lands with cost: “scouring her from inside,” time dilation while “swallowing centuries,” and the final acceptance‑meal plan reweights the world. The price persists in the final image (she carries “the digested grief of ages”), satisfying RR with tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sound layers, elevators join, community gathers, and the final image reconfigures the town’s social fabric (RR). Orientation is immediate (tower, librarian, prairie night) and causality is clean within the lyric frame. The closure lands on the page—porch lights, shared plans, weight still swinging—though the price of change is more conceptual than felt. No unkept setups; the cuckoo weight and clock chime pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: moon → injections → visions → dawn departure, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Vera becomes the vessel of the wrecks’ “abandoned dreams.” Orientation is swift and clean, and the mirror functions as a repeating object that tightens focus. Cost is legible (self‑modification, tremors, years of study), though it’s gestured more than dramatized at the end. The closure cadence is earned and distinct without needing causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: density increases from margins to grotto to nodes to the “immune system” revelation, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration as Orin becomes the planter of warnings. Orientation is clean and the gravity clock provides a coherent pressure. Cost is conceptual (burden, secrecy, blood-ink lineage) rather than bodily, but it’s legible on the page. The closure image—writing new doodles that glow—reweights the premise credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene builds from hedgehog cue to the emergence of layered birdsong, culminating in a charged poise ending. Closure lands on page with a conceptual cost: the insulator accrues cracks, and the restored music remains a ghost—hard-won, partial, and fragile. Orientation and stakes are clear early; the cadence shift from silence to symphony to held hush is clean. The price isn’t catastrophic but is legible and binds future options (continued, delicate labor; finite tools).

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Situational lens: the covenant’s end forces a stance crystallization; the scene accumulates toward Earned Stasis as Viktor chooses to remain and passes the stone. Orientation is clean from the outset; causality is coherent with no leaks. The on‑page cost—relinquishing status and reentry—is legible in his explicit refusal. The aurora‑charged final image reconfigures prior material with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of silences and the communal pause builds toward the clasp’s song. Closure lands on the page with a reconfiguration (the lock as preservation, not protection) and a conceptual cost (patience and attunement over force). Orientation (who/where/when) is immediate and stable. The cost is more conceptual than dramatic, but it reads cleanly at the fireworks beat.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned care and sketching accrete to a cadence shift at the “turning of the tide’s thought,” then the bloom reweights meaning. Orientation is clear early; the ending provides a resonant reconfiguration with on‑page cost (she breathes the stench). Some summary spans weeks, but they serve the pattern and do not blur closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain: search → choice of route → echo‑charged grove → Inversion test → monument activation → knowledge shift. Closure lands via a decisive act (inserting the tip) and a conceptual repricing of “resilience.” The hour clock and Inversion pay off in‑scene without confusion. Cost is mostly conceptual, with a slight deus‑ex feel to the monument download limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is sharp from the outset (who/where/when and the anomaly), and the single continuous scene holds. Under a Situational lens, pressure coheres around the convergence, culminating in a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she reframes accident investigation into prevention infrastructure. The cost—foregoing entry and accepting an expanding threat—reads on the page with a live clock. The beat progression (approach → recognition → install monitors → leave with reweighted mandate) is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: discovery → poised strike → aurora symphony → world reweighted. Closure lands via a conceptual repricing where the demolition order crumbles and the bells ring themselves, though Lyrian’s personal cost remains light. Orientation is strong early, and the single-scene escalation reads cleanly. A touch more on-page resistance or price at the climax would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is crisp early (who/where/why), and the structure holds a clean accumulative/textural lens to a Conceptual Repricing: guardianship reframed from wall‑building to choreography. The closure image (accepting the seed, re‑casing the flute, mountains’ “benediction”) lands on the page. Cost is primarily conceptual—renouncing the old doctrine; material risk remains abstract, slightly softening impact. The beats link coherently: return → weave → encounter → exchange → mission.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: star vanishings and layered selves increase density toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Closure is on-page and costly—she “couldn’t remember which personality was originally hers,” reweighting the premise from math to typography. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the pattern taught is paid off. The final charged image (last star, “seventeen different mouths”) seals the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: pendant → resonance → apparitions → knowledge transfer → reconfigured role. Orientation is clean early; cause/effect is legible within the story’s rules. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual price—Corvin is beyond return and the duty now falls to Elara. The cost is felt but not punishingly acute, keeping this just short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single scene, clean orientation, and a coherent accumulative build from observation → communion → frost‑lexicon → documentation. Closure is a conceptual repricing: mind/matter boundary reframed with on‑page evidence captured before warmth erases it. The cost is modest (time pressure and reputational stakes rather than an acute sacrifice) but legible within this lens. Causality holds without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)
    Hybrid lens leaning causal: bead → loom → weaving → memory cost → proof bead; the chain is coherent and escalates to an on‑page price. Orientation is clean early (orchard, bamboo canopy, heirloom loom), and the backstory blocks actively adjust present stakes. Closure is unmistakable: the message succeeds and Mei’s identity is the cost, crystallized in the new amber bead. No unkept setups or convenience resolutions undermine causality.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the descent, the forging, and the offering of the blade build to a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise. Orientation is clear early (orchard planet, forge, silk, mine). Closure lands via the blade’s function and the merchant’s recognition; cost is felt conceptually (bartered sleep) more than enacted. The sequence is coherent with a single deepening turn in the mines.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid drive: accumulative crossings build to a causal reveal (map makers cause tears), producing a conceptual repricing at closure as they choose to “map repairs.” Orientation is prompt and stable; the shard’s pull provides coherent progression. The cost is implied (abandoning prior practice; vast labor ahead) but not sharply dramatized on the page. Closure is legible and on‑page, though the price could be more palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong causal chain: letters → arrival → stone message → haunted reveal → choice → lamp rekindled. Closure is on-page with a Decisive Change (the light reignites and role passes) and a felt conceptual cost (choosing a life of charged solitude). Orientation is crisp early; the single-scene arc maintains coherence. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but legible at the end’s charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: three‑ship pattern intensifies until the mirror‑twin forces a cadence break and the wick reverses. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the lighthouse’s function flips inward, redefining her role. The cost is implied rather than bodily, but the before/after is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene builds from summons → donor reveal → demonstration → vow to “illuminate.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Kael reframes his role from absorber to conduit with the charged final image. Orientation is clean and the single scene is coherent. The cost is present but subtle, leaning more on implication than a concrete forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens through patterned discoveries: projections → encoded grief → reconfiguration → installation. Orientation is clean from the opening and the closure is a conceptual repricing: the broken instrument measures grief, not stars. The cost is quiet but present (abandoning the sextant’s original purpose; a night of labor; accepting the labyrinth’s true function). The throughline holds without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; pressure builds via layered memory, voices, and resonance until a cadence shift manifests a woven dawn. Orientation is immediate (greenhouse, mica window, mirror world), and closure lands on‑page with cost: dawn now requires continuous communal making (“they would need to sing again”). The escalation is coherent and the final reconfiguration is decisive without mechanical over‑explanation. Slight smoothness in the path to success prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation is clean from the outset (secret library above a station, late‑night reading room), and the accumulative/textural lens holds through to closure. The ending lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the “error” invitation is re‑valued by his choice to engage and teach. Cost is legible in his endured anguish and renunciations of proximity. The beat‑to‑beat causality is quiet but coherent and sufficient for the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of anomalies tightens into entry (door), encounter (tea house), and reweighting (absolution via attention) with a clear CR/Earned Stasis close. Orientation is brisk and clean; the bread trail causally links discovery to recognition. The cost—ongoing tending as condition for the tea house’s persistence—is present but soft, keeping the closure strong but short of exceptional. The throughline remains single‑POV and single‑scene with one intentional transition.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominant at the end lands: the founder’s vow reprices the entire archive and prompts Elara’s closing choice. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when), and the ticking collapse creates linear pressure. Closure arrives on the page with cost—most vows are lost, the library falls, and Elara vows to begin again. The causal chain from measuring to discovery to reconfiguration is clean and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clean causal chain: lineage → access → fob reveal → suspicion and ultimatum → recording until dawn → feds arrive. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: she completes the task at the price of future access, with the tide/sunrise clock framing cost. The arrests happen offstage, softening impact slightly but not breaking coherence. Lens: Hybrid leaning Situational at the end, held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: arrival → forest election crescendo → carriers converge → spruce transmission → identity reveal → acceptance. The accumulative/textural lens holds, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing closure (she is weather, not just a witness). Orientation is clear early; the emergent compass motif provides throughline causality. Cost lands conceptually more than viscerally, slightly limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates cleanly: note → cave → painting → injunction → act of creation. Closure lands with conceptual repricing and visible cost (she leaves the lock, abandons perfect recall as her governing tactic). Orientation is clear early, and the final ascent seals a before/after break. Minor neatness in the revelation is offset by on‑page action and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is tight: plate fragment → assembled map → discovery of crystallized messages → grandmother’s confession → decision to transcribe and deliver. Closure lands as a decisive change/charged poise with a legible cost (risking the city’s “carefully maintained peace”). Orientation is firm early and the two‑shard structure is clean. The cost is largely prospective rather than enacted on the page, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates from ascent and preparation to the bells’ transformation and broadcast. Closure lands with the fragment’s total dissolution and the world’s re-enchantment—a decisive change with a visible cost (the last piece of pre‑change wonder is surrendered). Orientation is clean early (tower, role, season). Causality is tight and linear with no unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive leaning accumulative: the ritualized burn tightens via a patterned sequence culminating in the last, longest fear. Closure lands as a decisive internal realignment (“internal compass…clicked back into alignment”) with legible cost risked (ecosystem collapse, self-fragmentation). Orientation is clean from the outset. The final burial and watering can image consolidate a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis end state.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear causal chain: locket → identification → shelter visit → mobilization → recovery of letters → Elena speaks. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: community as “address,” listening reweights the world’s rules. Mild convenience (nephew at postal service resolves quickly) trims edge but doesn’t break pressure. Orientation is excellent from the first paragraph and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: movement triggers reconfiguration, culminating in “Welcome home, granddaughter.” Orientation is clean early; the single‑scene spine remains coherent. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration and conceptual repricing of self and system, though the on‑page cost is light. Beats link plausibly (dance → system response → reversal → reveal) without teleports or resets.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid lens: causal discovery guided by accumulative patterning leads to an Earned Stasis closure. Observation → cemetery → exhumation → revelation → partial reclamation is clean and motivated, with the cost explicit on the page. The final image (lanterns bending toward the whale/cemetery) reweights prior material with conceptual cost. No orientation debt; single POV and scope are tight.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation is immediate (summoner, night brook, ritual), and the accumulative/textural lens holds through pattern-building and a cadence shift at dawn. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she disperses the prophecy, accepting the cost of erased possibilities and chosen ignorance. Causality is clean—set pattern (mapping silence) leads to channeling the prophecy into the brook and dissolution. The cost is legible if quiet, anchored by the “trillion smaller possibilities” and the final smoothing-away image.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres and culminates in a clear Charged Poise: Marcus’s “Teach me” and Elara beginning the lesson as the building “recites.” Orientation is clean from the rooftop garden through the meteor shower; details accrue toward the closing cadence. Cost is present but soft—primarily relational and existential rather than plot‑bound. A slightly sharper before/after pinch (a concrete risk or boundary crossed) would strengthen the closure’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates via density: whispers → metadata → digging → reunion of halves. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: joining the shells reweights the central premise from separation to integration with a legible before/after. Cost is present conceptually (choosing to re‑admit grief), though the pain is quickly transmuted, slightly lowering the felt price. Anchors (who/where/when) arrive early and the scene holds a single, coherent window from twilight to dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene causal chain holds: sanctuary arrival → choice framed by two documents → key revelation → burning → confession. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Decisive Change; cost is explicit (self‑incrimination, ending the family’s power). Orientation is clean from the opening. The slightly talismanic key risks convenience but functions to reweight, not solve, the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.1)
    Orientation is immediate (canyon nexus at night; half‑shell from grandmother’s letter). Under an accumulative/textural lens, density escalates via layered voices, named vanishings, and the shell warming, culminating in Senna’s decisive act of singing herself into the chorus. Closure lands with felt cost (“leaving…only the faintest whisper”), and the set‑ups (nexus acoustics, echo‑singer pattern, invitation/key) pay off cleanly. The throughline holds without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph (glacier shrine, recovered globe, Cassandra wreck) and the causal throughline holds: globe → shrine response → visions → formula → broader quest. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she secures the formula and assumes a new mandate (twelve globes), reweighting the premise. Cost is primarily conceptual/ethical rather than dramatized resistance, slightly softening impact. Exposition about the weapon and refugees is compact and integrated via the shrine’s visions.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs (whisk, fireflies, net, whispers) intensify toward a charged completion. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the finished net and her anonymous departure reprices the premise with an implicit cost (erasure/quiet labor). Orientation is clear early, and the structure stays within a single, coherent night scene. The final cadence tightens cleanly with the farewell whistle and descent.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under a Situational/Causal lens, the chain of letters → discovery → dilemma → seeded truth and reburial coheres and culminates in an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise ending with cost. Orientation is clean from the first lines; the dust storm and orchard bubble enforce a tight frame. The decisive act (reburying the diamond and scattering letters) reconfigures options and pays off set-ups. Minor exposition density in the letter summaries doesn’t break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, signals accrue from storm noise to the Prophet’s synchronized broadcast, culminating in a charged poise closure. Orientation is clear early and the single‑night frame coheres. The cost at closure is conceptual (she has ceded agency to the new song after years of labor), but it’s lightly felt. A clearer narrowing of options or explicit sacrifice in the final beat would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal drive holds: find box → seek owner → return/forgive → archive opens. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Marcus’s role redefined, with a persistent cost (openness replacing isolation) and a charged final image (new jar with Elena’s laughter). The ease of locating Elena and the swift documentary link slightly softens pressure but does not break it. Orientation is clear and stable across the day’s arc.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    Clean causal chain: Collectors closing in → vault access via key/voice → ritual → transformation that removes the object from their grasp. Closure lands with cost on the page: the empty room, melted key, folded coat. The piece holds a causal lens throughout and fulfills a Decisive Change with resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph and sustains through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid lens (causal with accumulative texture): rain → freeze → polarity window → rods → field shift → failed synchronization. Orientation is crisp by the opening paragraph, and the closure lands on‑page with the viaduct’s pulse and settled “new configuration.” Cost is implied (risk, exhaustion, social upheaval) more than dramatized in-scene, trimming peak impact. Still, the decisive change is clear and organically prepared.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene Hybrid drive holds: accumulative memory pressure leads to a causal Decisive Change (resignation and new mission). Orientation is clear early (rain, tunnel, body, role), and setups (lantern, supervisor control) pay off. The cost is implied more than dramatized, but legible. The closure image (storm baptism + lantern) coheres with the earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative: causal delivery of the heart + journal, then a textural build through work that culminates in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis ending. Orientation is immediate; one scene; pressure tightens as they collaborate and the box comes alive. Closure lands on the page with cost—Eliza names Thomas’s deserving worse while choosing a different inheritance. The journal and repair serve as persistent constraints shaping tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural build is coherent: the kaleidoscope observations intensify to the leap, and the ending reconfigures meaning (Conceptual Repricing). Orientation is crisp early, and the closure lands on the page with a visible act and a conceptual cost (leaving safety, recoding purpose). Because/therefore links are subtle but intact; a stronger on‑page price would push this higher. The drive lens holds steady through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative texture: patterns build to a conceptual repricing (“We’re archived”) and a decisive act (self‑archiving). Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; causality is coherent. Closure lands with a felt conceptual price—she forecloses ordinary life—though the cost is more implied than dramatized. The breadcrumb return and renaming to Pattern User 8625 deliver a clean cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: mirrored glimpses and sensory cues build toward a conceptual repricing of the anomaly as a peace tool. Orientation is clean early, and the closure lands on-page with a charged decision and reweighted mission. Some causality flows through explanation (keeper’s exposition) rather than dramatic testing, muting pressure. Still, the final image crystallizes a before/after with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the pattern of listening intensifies through the night to the 3 AM calving and culminates in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis. Orientation is clean from the opening; the Zurich shard charges present stakes without derailing. Closure lands as a reconfiguration: from seeking death to choosing to remain and attend endings, with a felt cost (harsh environment, pain, renunciation). The throughline is tight even without a conventional causal twist.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Elena’s daughter arrives and the burned fragment reweights the stake from ended romance to transmitted understanding. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean early, and the bus motif brackets past and present decisively. The cost—twenty years of solitude and a last evening closing—is legible in the final image. The turn hinges more on arrival than on a new decision, but the offered bench and uncorked voice provide sufficient agency for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orientation is crisp from the first lines and the accumulative/textural lens holds: prophet → realization → night consecrations → protective response → unmasking. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing with a visible cost (exhaustion, vulnerability). Because/therefore linkages are clean even as pressure accrues texturally. The decisive turn to “act tonight” tightens the frame effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.3)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the pattern of photographs builds to the on‑page recreation and the shutter click, a resonant reconfiguration that reframes the ruins and the field. Orientation is crisp early (case under smokestacks; museum role), and the closure image is legible and earned. Cost reads primarily as conceptual/emotional (intergenerational pain surfaced) rather than a tested sacrifice, holding this below the top band. The council’s looming clearance supplies pressure but never materially complicates tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details build toward a charged poise as the Committee arrives and she reframes testimony as silence and refraction. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the library-crystal pattern is taught then paid off. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—language as living garden reweights the Committee’s premise. Cost is conceptual/social rather than concrete, limiting the ceiling slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural holds: fog/static/chalk motifs intensify to a cadence shift when they find the grandmother’s voice and Ezra reconceives his forgetting. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost (he chooses vigilant non‑interference, paying with perpetual amnesia, chalk “wearing away like years”). Orientation is clean and early. Escalation is gentle but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hybrid lens with strong causal beats: tremors → accelerating hand → tuning fork intervention → camera refocus on gaps → stabilization via backward motion. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she redefines the goal and forecloses escape, with the clock reversing to “heal” the station. Cost is on-page as an embraced duty and foregone exit, charged by the “door open” realization. Orientation is crisp from the start and maintained through to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the story layers sounds and objects toward a resonant reconfiguration where the new record completes the broken Beethoven fragment. Orientation is clean; the closure lands on the page with conceptual and emotional cost as Maya mounts the piece and walks away. The timeline after the diagnosis shapes tactics and culminates in a charged communal ritual. The montage compression serves the pattern and doesn’t blunt the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a causal lens, the beats link cleanly: key → reversed writing → realization → noon approach → sealing action → closure. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the clock of noon tightens options and triggers action. Closure lands with the loops closing and a redefined role (Earned Stasis/CR blend), though the cost is conceptual more than dramatized. No major causality slips or teleports.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through the garden encounter to a resonant reconfiguration with cost. Closure lands when Thomas returns the tooth and accepts “Can’t” with warmth—an earned stasis that forecloses keeping her or the token of certainty. Orientation is clean from the opening; no causality breaks. The price is legible on the page (relinquishing the keepsake and the hope she’ll stay).

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid lens (causal steps within a textural, image‑driven rise): polishing → glow → grotto amplification → beacon → communal teaching. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean from the outset, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: a shift from solitary lighthouse to communal, soft light. The cost is conceptual (ceding singular authority to shared stewardship) rather than visceral, keeping stakes quiet. Tight, coherent progression without teleports or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: viral exposure pressures the sanctuary; Marcus’s arrival tightens; the proffered cutting crystallizes a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis. Closure carries cost—she risks the privacy of her refuge to teach—and the before/after is legible. Orientation is clean early, single scene, single POV. Slightly soft on explicit narrowing of options keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterning of “against the current” phenomena builds to the ceremonial release and the characters’ final apparitions. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she relinquishes the attempt to capture hope, altering the story’s meaning. Cost is legible on the page (abandoning the shell and the collecting impulse). Orientation is strong from the first paragraph; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single‑POV, one continuous scene (dawn to moonrise) with a clean accumulative/textural drive culminating in RR: the vine blooms and the community re‑aligns. Orientation is immediate and causality reads: humming → shiver → uncurl → communal singing → bloom. Closure lands on the page; however, the felt cost is modest and the success feels relatively unopposed, keeping it below the highest band. The “alignment” clock helps coherence without adding a true turn of jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density tightens from gathering and alignment to the “world holds its breath” peak, then resolves with the pattern’s collapse into the plate. Closure is an RR/CR hybrid—map completed, world reweighted, price paid in expended vials and irreversibility. Orientation is clean early, and each step is a therefore to the prior move. Cost is present but conceptual rather than visceral, keeping this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative/textural lens is taught early via reflections and held through the noon acoustics shift to the closing renunciation. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing: wonder is “preserved” by mapping its escape, and she leaves the device in place. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; cause/effect is coherent inside the piece’s rule‑set. The cost is the foreclosed path of immediate repair and possession, legible in her ascent and deferred return.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and pattern alignments escalate toward the final repricing (“weight of weightlessness”). Orientation is clear early (Mara, grotto, starlight, burner) and the scene remains single-window. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with conceptual cost (choosing containment with awareness). Causality is lyric but coherent; no late rule breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the kettle’s countdown, rain/sun modulation, and carving actions accrete toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. Orientation is clean early (loft, skylight, kettle, ash wood; Thomas’s death). The closure has felt cost: she forecloses “moving on” and reconfigures time via a handless clock and a commitment to teach tomorrow. Causality is quiet but coherent, with the time constraint shaping pacing and tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned listening and object handling builds to the ghost contact, “timeline snap,” and the carousel’s resumed motion. Orientation is clean early (carousel, lagoon, scavenger) and the closure lands on the page with cost. The final reconfiguration (from rebuilding to memory keeping) is decisive without over‑explaining. The physical world’s response (waters learning how to move) seals the RR/CR.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset, and causal beats link cleanly: sextant constants → valve work → hydraulic awakening → fountain eruption → revaluation. The piece operates as a Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: density builds to a conceptually repricing final image. Closure lands on the page, but the cost at the end is light (time, rust, risk are implied rather than pressed), limiting impact. Still, the because/therefore chain remains intact and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: environmental density and memory build toward the sunrise crest, where she chooses to accept the post while keeping her role. Closure lands with cost—she will “bear both worlds,” an on‑page foreclosing of simpler paths. Orientation is crisp early (who, where, when), and the cadence shift at full light provides the structural hinge. No causality breaks; the letter’s arrival motivates the present scene cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from mood and memory toward a conceptual repricing: truth sought outward becomes inward cost. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the confession opens a hidden compartment and reweights Mara’s goal into a decision with consequence. Some key events (the morning find, the decade of research) are summarized rather than dramatized, but the closure lands as Charged Poise with an implied relational price. Causality is consistent and thematically inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean single-scene accumulative build: decoding → transcription → decision to pass the craft forward. Closure lands as a charged poise: she commits to teaching and gifting the fulgurite, reweighting the stakes around stewardship after loss. Orientation is immediate and stable; causality is modest but coherent. The felt cost is subtle yet legible in the acceptance of duty and parting with a talisman.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from atmosphere to a charged poise: the warmed thread, Marcus’s translucent presence, and Elara’s final acceptance of her cartographer role. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing—healing becomes a map with a felt cost in ongoing, unfinishable work. Orientation is clean early, and the motif chain resolves coherently. The price is implicit but legible in the city’s “living dead” and her commitment to keep pulling threads.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds from preparation to hatching to revaluation, landing in a resonant reconfiguration: success/ failure reweighted into a new ethic of beauty. Orientation is crisp, and the closure image (the broken song altering the city’s rhythm) carries conceptual cost. The because/therefore chain is soft but coherent for this mode. A slightly clearer on‑page price (beyond acceptance) would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is consistent: the ritual gathers objects and memories toward a Charged Poise closure (the talisman tied, “ready”). Orientation is clear early, and each step causally builds to the reconfiguration. Cost is emotional and conceptual—foreclosing being defined by the father’s blaze—visible in the tear‑offering and chosen burden. Quiet but fully legible cadence shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure coheres through ritual repetition and image density toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Closure is on‑page—the city sings again, geese resume, Marcus revalues skepticism with cost in time and stance. Orientation is crisp from the opening (geese frozen; city; Marcus; box). The price is felt but soft, more spiritual than practical, which keeps this shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern layering (measurement → mapping → nursery → reprise of gear) crescendos into a charged poise resolution. Orientation is clean from the outset; the closure stakes—enduring as last witness—land with felt cost. The gear’s reprise and the commitment to continue make a before/after legible. Escalation is modest but coherent for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: months of carving, poem‑trading, and monarch build culminate in the unveiling and the grandfather’s departure. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with cost: completion triggers the loss of spectral guidance and transfers that presence into the community. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph (who/where/when). The final image (poem released like butterflies) reweights prior motifs without mechanical wrap‑up.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the confessional sequence during the pendulum pause tightens toward a resonant reconfiguration: the clock re‑finds its rhythm as he names harms. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and set‑ups (overwind error, obsidian ridge consequences) pay off at closure. The cost—ongoing accountability and a relinquished self‑absolution—lands conceptually on the page. The mechanism’s “remembering” is metaphorized but coherent within the story’s rules.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the decoding sequence intensifies meaning until the final stance—planting the fragment tomorrow, not restarting the clock—reconfigures time and custody. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and motifs (silo, clock, case, tapestry) carry through to closure. The cost is conceptual but present: surrender of artifact control and ritual certainty for circular tending. Closure lands as Charged Poise with Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; the density of images and tactics (maps, embedded patterns) builds toward a cadence shift when the Council unconsciously pivots. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: evolution replaces bureaucracy’s stasis, with conceptual cost (covert manipulation, anonymity). Orientation is clean early and the single-scene flow holds. The turn is earned but soft, with cost implied rather than pressed.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a pirate signal → deciphered instructions → clandestine transcription → charged departure. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing in the final carried‑scores image, with social cost implied (Ministry risk, public activation) rather than enacted. Orientation is crisp early (alcove, famine aftermath, radio task). The main shortfall is the off‑stage payoff, which slightly softens the cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pattern of ash-making/erasure tightens toward a closure image that reweights safety and absolution. Orientation is clean; cause/effect is coherent (rumors bring both fugitives and authorities; ash equals evidence; death arrives mid-process). The closure lands on the page with cost (a death, erasure of the portrait, exposure to authorities). The ritual choice under pressure completes a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear Causal lens: confrontation → evidence dispute → reveal (“We know”) → proposition → decision (“Show me your method”). Orientation lands early and the closure is a Decisive Change with a felt cost (choosing secrecy over proclamation). Stakes hold to one thread—how to preserve the true history—and tighten with the reversal. A hair from 9+ due to a brief expository feel in the reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: arrivals and layered instruments intensify pattern toward a charged repricing at the end. Closure lands with cost: the program still ends, the zither goes to storage, and she surrenders the rosette as continuity. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; the late guard’s “one hour” subtly tightens the window. The escalation is gentle rather than knife‑edged, but coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: details stack toward a charged transformation culminating in the neural garden. Orientation is crisp from the first line and the alignment provides a natural temporal bracket. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—beauty-as-rebellion becomes materially undeniable—though the price is more conceptual than lived. No causality breaks; the because/therefore logic (alignment → activation → spread) coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal flow: blackout → drone collapse → food crisis → Mira’s secret chamber → riddle reframes duty → broadcast confession → communal response. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she publicly commits to a path with social and legal cost while reweighting the city’s options. Orientation is strong from the opening image; single scene coherence holds. The swift communal acceptance is slightly convenient but doesn’t break causality or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: observed drift → liminal approach → shard‑enabled seeing → conceptual reweighting → offering. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing with on‑page cost (she gives up the heirloom shard). Orientation is solid early; no causality breaks. The ending cadence tightens cleanly around the bay as repository of hush.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Strong causal chain: arrival → telepathic contact → staged revelations → Marina’s decision → Thessaly’s reconfigured stasis. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing with legible costs (mass drowning; Marina’s reputation risk). Orientation is clean from the opening lines, and the single scene holds. The ending image (“stone animate with possibility”) reweights the premise without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned action accrues until the closing charged stance. Orientation is clear early; the loop revelation and 17‑billion‑step cost provide structural gravity. Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost rather than a decisive turn, which limits peak impact but remains valid for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: moonlight, brush, and scripts build to a conceptual repricing—languages aren’t lost; kindness preserves them—culminating in communal transformation. Orientation is clean from the opening and the frame holds through dawn and aftermath. The flood of responses and greenhouse gatherings give on-page closure, though cost is more implied (gentrification, insomnia) than sharply felt at the end. Slight convenience in the viral turn keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the thaw and rosewater scent create a tightening cadence; the ice crash and the wall beginning to weep provide on‑page cost and narrowing options. Orientation is clear early, and the single scene holds coherence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: documentation-as-resistance revised into a charged, costly poise. No causality breaks or resets.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal drive holds: reverse‑engineered yoyo → dismantling lens backward → wiring → inversion. The decisive change lands on the page with a clear before/after (consuming darkness → generating light). Cost is mostly conceptual (reversing a prison designed to prevent harm; summoning lost ships), not viscerally felt, slightly limiting impact. Orientation is clean and maintained in a single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with a strong causal spine: funhouse → clasp cue → dream dictionary reversal → manifestation → direct address → containment. Orientation is clean early, and each step narrows options toward the decisive confrontation. Closure lands on the page with a cost (Cornelius dissolving; Mara bearing fear’s containment). The only softness is Cornelius providing solutions, but payoffs were seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the density of sound and pattern builds to a decisive rupture (“the world’s largest string snapping”). Orientation is clean from the outset; rules are learned through action and hold through closure. The cost is modest but legible, and the final charged poise (new coordinates/purpose) reweights the world. Causal threads (resonance → cloud shifts → whale bass → current release) feel earned within the established logic.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: whistle silence → telescope check → crack/message → reinterpreted world rules → decision to exit via maintenance hatch → charged final image. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she forecloses safety to pursue truth while the turtles wake, with cost legible on the page. Orientation is firm early and the single-POV window holds. Expository history is efficiently folded into present action without breaking drive.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Orientation is crisp from the first lines; the scene holds a coherent situational lens with a clean encounter structure. The causal flow—arrival, confrontation, evidence presented, decision—tracks, and closure lands with Marcus’s renunciation and Elara’s dissemination. Stakes soften when she reveals copies have already been sent, dampening tension. Still, the ending is a valid on‑page Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation lands cleanly in the first lines (who, where, why, and the clock of the drawbridge/tide). The accumulative/textural drive coheres: observation → memory → ritual action. Closure arrives as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: placing the bottle and leaving before sunset, with the pavilion’s condemnation as a persistent cost. The “click” of the inkwell and the promise to return reconfigure the premise from mapping loss to encrypting memory.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and the accumulative/textural lens holds through the blackout clock and environmental constraints. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the preservation field returns, she loses her detection channel, but the marked truth persists for a future descent—at a cost of incompleteness. Because/therefore linkages are coherent (blackout → silence → detection → reactivation → loss), and the final image reweights prior actions. The cost is subtle but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned labor, curated memories, and a cadence shift with the “possibility” vision reweight the dominant stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—acceptance as transformation—with felt cost embedded in the painful polishing and relinquished futures. Orientation is clean early; no causal breaks. The beat structure is cohesive though not tightly escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning Causal: the ticking cooldown, the illicit access, and the alarm’s early end tighten options; actions drive effects (scanner tuning → discovery → transmission). Closure reads as a Conceptual Repricing: severed futures redefined as a reservoir redistributed to the world, with on‑page cost (security, probable suppression). A slight ease in how swiftly the scanner maps global reservoirs keeps it shy of exceptional. Orientation is clean from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid lens leaning accumulative: observational density (light, thermal trails) links to actions (pulling stones, placing matrices) that culminate in a CR—the repricing of “belonging.” Orientation is clean early; cause/effect holds. The closure’s cost is conceptual (foreclosing the quest for a single place), felt but soft. The sequence tightens once (pattern → hunt → chord), satisfying scope.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear causal chain: the watch hand summons him, the carvings concretize his grandfather’s crimes, the implied accuser forces a choice, and he renounces his work. Closure lands as Decisive Change with a resonant final image (placing the hand among the carvings) and a stated cost. Reflection is anchored in present action and stays within scope. A live counterforce on the page could have intensified the turn, but the situational pressure holds.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Situational lens: the meeting’s pressure crystallizes Elara’s stance—apology now, forgiveness only after the exchange—landing as a Charged Poise with felt cost. Orientation is clean from line one (parapet, neutral scar, impending new moon exchange). The closure reweights options without resolving them, and the persistent constraint (calendar/moon ritual) shapes the final image. Quiet but decisive cadence shift as Thorne recedes and Elara remains to “wait for the darkness that would make them all equal.”

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single continuous scene with clear anchors, using an accumulative/textural lens: poles, fog, and the broken compass accrue pressure toward a reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost via his shift from expert navigator to humble teacher using utility poles. Because/therefore linkages are modest but coherent; no causality breaks. The price—accepting limitation and repurposing identity—reads.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Situational with causal supports; coherent pressure (forgiveness vs. amnesia) crystallizes into a Charged Poise closure as he chooses the first path. Orientation is clear within the opening steps (obituaries → cave → lake → woman). The cost is legible: he commits to facing bereaved strangers without the refuge of apology. The scene tightens from discovery to proposition to decision without extraneous detours.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: the scent’s release intensifies density toward a resonant reconfiguration where Mira becomes a bridge. Orientation is immediate; the fortune and phoenix frame causality that pays off in the orchard. Closure bears cost via “un‑becoming,” spent memories, and a reweighted identity. The final moth image seals the cadence shift without mechanical over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: imagery and ritual intensify toward a resonant reconfiguration as the saucer seals and time is reclaimed at a price. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when) and every set piece pays off (traced hands pattern → restoration spread). Closure lands with cost and reweights prior material (invisible ink on the birth announcement; reclaimed hours with guilt intact). No causality breaks; the tightening from the glowing crack to the restoration spread is coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative dominance: the meditation method sets pressure, the tear opens the fold, and stitching integrates the shadow. Orientation is clear early and causality holds; each step follows from established rules. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—the barrier ceases because integration is achieved—with conceptual cost borne by enduring the shadow. The resolution is a touch smooth (no failed attempt or reversal), but the designed cadence shift is on‑page and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrangement to hush to synchronized bugs to alignment to metamorphosis. Closure lands on the page with cost—“scattered her transformed essence across the beach”—a decisive change and conceptual repricing. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the volcano’s “breath” and planetary alignment serve as the cadence shift. Coincidences are framed as intention-bent reality, which fits the chosen lens without breaking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues through object‑pattern and hush, culminating in a Charged Poise closure as the lamps reignite and the plan is set. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when register within the first lines). The cost is implied—treason and surveillance—named in dialogue (“You risk much”) but not paid on‑page. The single‑scene design holds coherence with a legible before/after (signal unmade → signal made).

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual sequence coheres: stones → dust → aurora → true eels → cosmological reveal → vow. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (time’s transparency; stewardship) with a felt duty-cost in the final act of laying stones for an apprentice. Orientation is strong from the first lines, and the grandmother’s promise pays off cleanly. Slight ease-of-progression (little tactical uncertainty) keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the timer, storm, and developing prints build a cadence that tightens into a charged poise at dawn. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration—scars to stars, mist through chains—with cost legible in continued clandestine labor and enduring exile. Orientation is crisp from the outset; setup (envelope, timer) pays off in the final stash.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: invitation decoded → duel intensifies → trinity of angles charges the final image. Orientation is clean early; single scene holds. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—the coded alignment reframes the duel as overture to revolution—with conceptual cost (risk, secrecy) more implied than enacted. No causality breaks, though the price is not sharply pressed in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: images and memories accrete toward a charged poise ending (“scattered like seeds”). Orientation lands early (who/where/when) and holds through the backstory shard. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: she affirms the tactic and stakes with the coffee tin touch and readiness to copy/disperse. The cost (exposure of names; permanence forfeited) is felt but largely conceptual rather than tested in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens with strong causal spine: because she plays and adapts, the compasses steady, the hand appears, the passage opens, and Sophia steps through. Closure lands on-page with the clock moving to 11:48—a decisive change plus resonant reconfiguration of their “anniversary.” Cost is felt (two years of charged waiting and the risk of improvisation) if not materially paid in-scene. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-POV, two-shard flow (ridge → dream corridor → ridge) holds cleanly under a Situational lens with an Accumulative cadence. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “Quantum Folklore” reframes the stake and fixes a before/after stance. The monsoon clock and Council pressure render the cost legible, though the island’s immediate survival reads somewhat neat. Orientation is clear by ~120 words and supports the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs accrete (lace rows, compass spins, pruning) toward a Charged Poise closure. The decisive reconfiguration is Kenji handing off the compass and resolving to write, with the bell toll underscoring cost and inevitability. Orientation is clean from the outset; the single‑scene frame maintains coherence. The price of silence is made legible on the page through the before/after stance.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative/textural drive is flawlessly executed, building pressure through observation rather than incident. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of her scientific purpose, lands with the clear cost of her career. The final validation from other scientists, however, feels slightly too convenient, softening the beautiful ambiguity of her personal, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, where the plot advances through deepening insight rather than external action. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), lands with palpable cost—Marina sacrifices her identity and past for a new purpose. The final image powerfully reconfigures the story’s core problem of luminescence, creating a deeply satisfying before/after state without a single wasted move.
