  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. The final paragraph merely restates the thematic journey ("she had found what she had been searching for all along") without a specific moment of change or renunciation. No clear before/after is legible, only accumulated observation without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a true on-page closure with visible cost—Lena simply decides to leave the canyon with newfound resolve, but no path is foreclosed, no price paid, no options narrowed. The revelation about the smuggling operation functions as exposition rather than a decisive change that alters her immediate reality. The accumulative pattern-reading builds effectively but doesn't culminate in a moment where stakes crystallize with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change with visible cost - Elena discovers she can create visual music, but there's no price paid or path foreclosed. The accumulative structure builds description without meaningful deepening; her "success" arrives without struggle or sacrifice. The piece reads more as extended exposition about a concept than a story with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from package arrival to Elias becoming the library's keeper—a Decisive Change with visible cost (leaving his life above). The lens is Causal with strong because/therefore linkages. Closure lands with Elias finding "his purpose not in death, but in eternal preservation," though the cost of this transformation could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through ritual distribution culminating in Elias's public declaration—a Resonant Reconfiguration that transforms anonymous charity into collective resistance. The closure lands with conceptual cost (expanding aid despite dwindling resources). Orientation anchors effectively by ~100 words, and causality holds throughout, though the escalation through Mira's news feels somewhat mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elara's discovery that unused love exists "in the space between breaths," with visible cost in the tears and dissolution of Kwan Yin's tear. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the epilogue section (weeks later) extends beyond the natural closure point, diluting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases around the halo fragment encounters, culminating in Elara's disintegration/merger as a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost. However, the middle section's study scenes feel disconnected from the opening's immediacy, creating a structural sag between the two major encounters rather than building continuous pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a causal lens with clear linkage (discovery → retrieval → escape → distribution), but the closure lacks sufficient on-page cost—we're told about future success rather than witnessing the price of her choice. The wall demolition timing creates urgency, yet the escape feels too convenient when workers arrive "just as she slipped out." The seed vault revelation and piano key puzzle provide turns, but neither generates meaningful resistance or forces difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing when Kael discovers trust doesn't just break but reforms "stronger for having been broken." The accumulative structure builds through sensory layers and the sunken greenhouse setting toward this revelation. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral - we understand the insight intellectually but don't feel Kael paying a price for this knowledge. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by the third paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from heist to revelation, with the flower code enabling access and the moonbeams revealing hidden messages—a Conceptual Repricing that reweights Lillian's identity from thief to historian. Cost appears in her choice to preserve rather than possess light, though the transformation feels slightly convenient given the lack of dramatized struggle between competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias crafting glass vessels while processing grief, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where creation enables emotional release. However, the cost remains abstract—we see him "abandoning layers of grief" but never feel what specific loss he's releasing or what opportunity this transformation forecloses.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Charged Poise closure - Maya faces her pursuers with newfound understanding, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral. The causal chain holds (betrayal→hiding→decryption→confrontation), but the orientation wobbles initially with dense backstory dumps. The "who you thought" timeframe and Maya's exact relationship to Thorne could be clearer earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Conceptual Repricing lands effectively: darkness transforms from threat to navigable medium through the oracle's map-making, with cost visible in "people would whisper" and the isolation of her tower work. The accumulative lens holds as imagery patterns (ambered hush, marbled silence, gold leaf glow) cohere toward this reweighting. Minor orientation wobble with "storm-tossed mountain range" appearing late when only the fort was established.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Conceptual Repricing closure ("thoughts don't originate from a specific place but emerge from the relationship between observer and observed") lands intellectually but lacks visible cost. The violin dissolution into light reads as convenient rather than earned through prior causality. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by paragraph 2.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's decision to leave the lens, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The piece follows an accumulative pattern (discovery → exploration → renunciation) yet lacks the density increase or cadence shift needed for that lens. The closure gesture toward "new understanding" summarizes rather than dramatizes transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves Earned Stasis as Elias maintains his position against the coming scientists, with visible cost in his "withered state" and aging body. However, the piece lacks meaningful escalation or tightening - it's essentially a meditation without a decisive turn. The accumulative lens holds but the pressure never truly builds to force a crystallized stance beyond what Elias already believes.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with scientific discovery as its spine, but closure lacks visible cost—Aris succeeds completely without sacrifice or trade-off. The experiment proceeds through three lever pulls that build evidence, yet no meaningful resistance or complication forces a choice. The ending declares revolutionary implications but shows only "mechanically warm satisfaction" rather than a price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through completing the unfinished performance, with the program's dissolution marking visible cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds as water-stained patterns gradually reveal the ghost's code. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the closure lands with the "conversation that silence had interrupted" finally completed.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward revelation, but closure remains incomplete on-page—Elias steps into the cold toward discovery rather than achieving it. The "crystallized fragment of meteoric origin" explanation arrives through exposition rather than dramatized discovery, undermining the cost demonstration required for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver required closure with cost. Marcus discovers vague "truths" about the factory ghost shift being "far more human, far more tragic" but this revelation occurs through summary rather than dramatized event. The ending's "understanding that some truths carry weight precisely because they remain unspoken" is conceptual assertion without visible or felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the keeper returns bearing "the fragile, regenerative silence a secret etched onto their soul and their stones." The cost is legible—resisting stasis requires active anchoring through their "loose grip on reality." The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward this crystallization of purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves closure through Lila's first words, marking a Decisive Change with emotional cost visible in Maya's tears. The causal lens holds as Maya's patient music therapy approach leads to breakthrough during the eclipse. However, the three-month setup feels summarized rather than dramatized, and the eclipse's role as catalyst could be stronger causally linked.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story establishes its accumulative/textural lens through repeated phrases ("bronze quiet," "walls have heard") but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost. The ending gestures toward hope ("Perhaps someday...dragons would fly again") without the historian paying any price or making a choice that forecloses options. Pattern accumulation exists but doesn't culminate in the required on-page change or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece lacks a true closure unit with visible cost—it ends in abstract satisfaction ("knowing that today, more people would begin to see the world differently") without dramatizing any specific change or crystallized choice. The structure reads as extended exposition about the writer's process rather than a scene with causal linkage. No concrete before/after is legible; the sunrise ending merely continues the status quo with philosophical contentment.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear causal structure with decisive change - entity expelled, Sarah freed. The orientation anchors (priest, church, possession) establish quickly. Cost is visible in Sarah's suffering and the "violence done to the natural order," though Michael himself pays minimal personal price. The rhetorical trap mechanism provides satisfying causality.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the symphony's manifestation, and achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the writer "finally finds his place between echoes of yesterday and promises of tomorrow." However, the cost remains abstract—while exhaustion is mentioned, we don't see what specific opportunity or relationship is sacrificed for this transcendent moment, weakening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the tablet and viaduct creating pattern-based access to fractured timelines. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing when Elias accepts his nature as "beautifully complex," but the cost remains abstract—"knowledge" without visible sacrifice or foreclosed options. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear early, but the procedural timeline mechanics feel arbitrary rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Eleanor transforms disability into a new form of expression, with visible cost (permanent deafness). The accumulative/textural lens holds as vibrations and backward recordings build toward her teaching breakthrough. However, the causality of why backward recordings specifically create feelable vibrations lacks grounding, and the transformation happens too smoothly without sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through Elias's decision to release evidence via pigeon (Decisive Change with visible cost), following causal linkage from storm recording to conspiracy discovery to action. The drive lens reads as Causal with clear because/therefore progression, though the conspiracy revelation arrives somewhat conveniently through the found message tube rather than Elias's own investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias accepts grief as inseparable from love, with visible emotional cost (tears falling freely). The accumulative structure coheres through sensory layering. However, the transformation feels overly neat - the UV light revealing scent memories strains credibility, and the resolution arrives through discovery rather than earned choice, weakening agency.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building toward insight, but closure lacks visible cost—the poet simply gains understanding without sacrifice or foreclosed path. "Time, they realized, was not a line but a landscape" offers conceptual shift but no felt price or changed circumstance.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael's realization transforms silence into symphony with visible emotional cost (tears, family recognition). The pattern of daily practice building to evening revelation works, and the cost is legible in the family's emotional response. Minor deduction for slightly mechanical progression without sufficient pressure narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.2)
    No decisive change occurs—the client transformation completes exactly as planned without complication, and Elias ends where he began, satisfied with his work. The piece reads as extended exposition about his profession rather than a story with escalating pressure. The "half truths" concept appears only as philosophical musing, never forcing a choice or creating friction.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear causal chain from mistaken envelope to friendship to archive funding to cyclical pattern. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the "cycle continued" motif with visible cost (time, effort, sponsorship arrangement). However, the years-later jump to establish pattern weakens immediate cost legibility, and the final philosophical summary ("greatest cargo transported") tells rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative/textural structure builds from isolation through shared quest to communal belonging, with the sigil discovery providing meaningful reconfiguration. The closure lands with visible cost (Elara's solitary identity transformed) and the arbor's dedication crystallizes the change, though the middle section's pacing rushes through relationship development.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change with clear cost - the illustrator sacrifices portions of his future lifespan to restore the world's natural rhythm. The causal chain holds from discovery through investigation to resolution. Deducting for some convenience in the worldbuilding (the door conveniently marked with his pendant's symbol) and the slightly rushed final beat that could have dramatized the cost more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story establishes orientation clearly (conjurer in cavern orchard) and builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when the mosaic patterns shift to reveal a new path forward, but the cost remains largely abstract—we understand Elara gains new knowledge but don't feel what she sacrifices or risks. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer (dripping stalactites, glass eyes, mosaic patterns) but the closure lacks visible price beyond continued searching.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern and density increase toward finding the tape fragment. However, closure lacks visible cost on the page—the protagonist simply continues their established routine of helping from shadows without sacrifice or foreclosed options. The fragment discovery changes tactics but doesn't create a before/after with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's release of control reweights all prior observations, with visible cost in the "destruction in some areas." The accumulative structure coheres well, building pressure through repeated storm cycles and plant observations that culminate in her transformed approach.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the exchange serving as the decisive change that transforms Lena from trauma-haunted insomniac to purposeful witness-artist. The closure lands with visible cost (giving up the brooch that anchored her) and gains (rare pigments enabling her mission). The pattern of water imagery and artistic creation accumulates effectively, though the final gallery sequence feels slightly detached from the intimate exchange scene.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands clearly: Elara shifts from seeing futures to creating them, with the cost being her former certainty. The accumulative structure builds through shadow manifestations toward this transformation. Orientation anchors effectively (Elara, crystal cave, pilgrim's arrival). The lens holds consistently though some middle beats feel repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece accumulates thematic material but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. The ending declares transformation ("home was not just a place but a shared understanding") without showing the specific price paid. The herald's sacrifice revelation provides information but doesn't fundamentally alter Elina's options or force a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with the discovery leading to exploration leading to transformation, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Ethan accepts his new calling with visible cost (the phantom punch integrating with his hand). The closure lands with Ethan's purpose crystallized and his perception permanently altered, though the cost could be more viscerally felt. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a clear closure with visible cost—Elara's transformation from skeptic to believer happens through summary rather than dramatized choice. The piece reads as extended exposition about the tile's properties without a decisive moment where Elara must choose between competing options with genuine stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves closure through Alistair's acceptance of immortality's purpose (Conceptual Repricing), with visible cost in the collapsed escondite and his new guardian burden. The causal chain from boredom→discovery→understanding→action holds, though the revelation about Elara arrives through exposition rather than dramatized discovery. The "what happens after goodbye" question receives thematic answer but lacks concrete dramatic test.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves closure through Maya's successful forgery (Decisive Change with moral inversion), and causality holds throughout. However, the cost remains largely conceptual rather than felt - Maya faces potential consequences but no actual price is paid on-page, weakening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece achieves Earned Stasis—Elias continues his preservation work despite the town's silence below. However, the cost remains abstract ("precious textures of time") rather than visceral. The accumulative structure coheres but lacks a decisive deepening that would make the stakes feel urgent rather than contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost - it ends with philosophical assertion ("I have found my purpose") rather than dramatized change. The accumulative structure builds texture but never crystallizes into a specific moment where options narrow or stakes manifest. The poison bottle label serves as static symbol rather than active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (discovery leads to playing cello leads to understanding), achieving Conceptual Repricing when Evelyn realizes the riddle's answer lies in embracing multiple interpretations. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual without visible sacrifice—her worldview shifts but we don't see what this costs her as a myth-buster. The piece teaches its pattern of musical memory-retrieval early and pays it off, though the astronomers' debate feels convenient rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Maya discovering encoded messages and building a resistance movement, but the closure lacks visible cost—the favorable terms arrive without Maya sacrificing anything concrete. The orientation anchors (floating raft city, carnival atmosphere) establish well early. The ending attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through Maya returning the stone chip, but this gesture carries no dramatized price or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elena photographing the fireflies before their extinction, but the closure lacks visible cost beyond abstract loss. The ending states she "had done her part" without showing what was sacrificed or foreclosed. The chemical timing device serves its function but doesn't create meaningful pressure or constraint that alters her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias's repair reconnects teacher and student across distance with visible cost (the apprentice's departure). The piece anchors who/where/when effectively and maintains causality throughout. Deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution and limited escalation of pressure beyond the initial problem-solution arc.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern intensification through condensation imagery that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing—Elmsley's realization about humanity's need for origins reweights his entire quest with philosophical cost. The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3, and the closure lands with visible transformation from skeptic to believer. Slight deduction for the middle section's looser causality during the three-day journey which summarizes rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong accumulative structure with clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the town transforms from "ghost town poised before the collapse" to "sanctuary balanced on the edge of dawn." The piece teaches its pattern early (sound + pressure = restoration) and pays it off through escalating transformations. Cost is visible in the town's prior abandonment and Silas's solitary, methodical labor, though emotional cost could be more explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves closure through a Decisive Change - Elena successfully retrieves the temporal energy despite near-death. The causal lens holds with clear because/therefore linkages throughout. Cost is visible in the oxygen depletion and "burning in her lungs." Slight deduction for the convenient rescue timing that softens the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.2)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the repetitive structure builds texture but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. The ending states transformation ("finally found his voice") rather than dramatizing it through specific action or image. The "before they find the bodies" creates urgency but never pays off with actual discovery or consequence, leaving the cost abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the bride dissipates after releasing seeds, her debt repaid and Thomas reborn in the bloom. However, the piece unfolds primarily through backstory exposition (lines 7-22) rather than present-scene causality, with the actual dramatic action compressed into lines 15-29. Cost is visible but the heavy reliance on told history over dramatized beats weakens causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based transformation, but the closure lacks visible cost—the labyrinth simply becomes beautiful without Elara sacrificing anything tangible. The sleepwalking device creates causality problems since unconscious action removes agency from the central transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis - Kaelen's completion of the sundial represents both literal and spiritual homecoming with visible cost (thirty years of exile, the weight of interrupted journeys). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details layer toward the final image of alignment. The orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and causality flows through discovery-restoration-renewal without breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece achieves a Conceptual Repricing where Elara's understanding of her work transforms from service to resistance, with the mailed letter embodying this shift. The accumulative structure builds through ritual, reflection, and realization, landing on "the eternal dance of invention and rediscovery." However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—we understand but don't feel the price of this transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward Elara's revelation of the conspiracy and her coded response. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—the coup will fail through her invisible intervention, with cost implied in the "thread by thread" unraveling. Orientation anchors effectively (who: Elara, where: observatory, when: autumn evening), though the specific mechanics of "adjacent possibilities" remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with mystical elements building toward emotional resolution. Closure occurs through Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara shifts from seeking apology to offering forgiveness, with emotional cost visible in her tears and the "fractures in her understanding." The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2, and the pattern of condensation messages creates coherent escalation toward the final reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation toward Kaelen's whispered comfort as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with emotional cost (translator shifting from war work to grief counseling), but causality feels more asserted than dramatized—we're told about his mission rather than seeing it emerge through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Amelia's discovery building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the community rediscovers joy through art. The closure lands with visible transformation—"The orchard district remained wreathed in fog, but something had shifted." However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt, and the middle section relies heavily on summary ("Local historians had long dismissed...") rather than dramatized beats that would strengthen causality.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with five numbered awakenings building toward Elena's final transformation. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elena places the nickel back and gains new perception, but what she loses or sacrifices remains abstract. The "exchange" of certainty for curiosity is declared rather than dramatized with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story establishes its dystopian premise clearly but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost—the ending merely promises future action ("Tomorrow's garden pattern would signal the final phase"). The accumulative lens builds texture through resistance methods but never crystallizes into a costly choice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as the poet's verses gradually transform the shell through blossoms, with clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure where death becomes perpetual lullabies. However, orientation anchors drift (unclear who sleeps in the shell, what world this is) and the cost feels more declared than dramatized—"mortal journey" ending lacks the visceral price this rubric demands.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure—the restored chime rejoining the chorus and sounding forgotten names creates a charged moment where preservation's temporary nature is acknowledged with visible cost ("making preservation all the more essential"). The piece anchors who/where/when clearly by ~120 words. The restoration sequence builds pressure through careful accumulation, though the single complication (finding the crack) could benefit from additional tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure—Elena walks toward the chamber but we never see the confrontation or its outcome. The piece reads as setup without resolution, missing the required Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing. The drive lens appears Causal but the because/therefore linkages don't narrow options or culminate in a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's discovery of a harmonizing solution, with visible cost in the community's division and the weight of responsibility. The accumulative structure works—each discovery (envelope, adhesive analysis, inscription) builds toward the final design that transforms opposition into cooperation. However, the cost could be more viscerally felt; it's primarily conceptual rather than embodied in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara discovering the meteorite, using it to read patterns, and ultimately releasing a pigeon with it attached—a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights her past. The closure lands with visible cost (abandoning her false identity as "Elara the bookseller") and earned transformation. Minor orientation delay (who/where anchors drift early) costs some clarity but doesn't break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively when father and daughter reunite, with visible emotional cost in "tears catching the light like prisms." The accumulative structure coheres as repeated motifs (thresholds, wood grain, logbook) converge at closure, though the butterfly effect premise could anchor earlier for stronger orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Maya discovering bioluminescent creatures that mirror constellations, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing about belonging. However, the cost remains abstract—"tears welled" and "overwhelming connection" lack concrete stakes or sacrifice. The burnt feather's transformation into a map feels convenient rather than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing about disappearance as transformation, but the cost remains abstract rather than felt on the page. The accumulative structure builds through repetition but lacks a decisive moment where the conceptual shift carries visible price. "Nothing was ever truly lost" arrives without sufficient dramatized struggle to earn this wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Leo observing, planning, and executing his intervention. However, the closure lacks visible cost—the woman receives an unexpected gift with no price paid by anyone. The bishop piece transfers without Leo experiencing loss or the woman facing any trade-off, making this feel like consequence-free magic rather than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens building toward transformation, but the closure lacks visible cost - Lira gains cosmic wisdom without losing anything tangible. The anchoring to earth is framed as welcome rather than sacrifice. The nostalgia ban setup promises conflict that never materializes in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing but lacks visible cost on the page. Mara's realization about her purpose ("not just shaping glass, but helping others find beauty") is asserted without showing what she sacrifices or how this changes her concrete options. The piece is almost entirely reflection with minimal present-frame action after the stone-throwing.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the firefighter reconceptualizes his scars from "accusation" to "companion," with emotional cost visible in the child he couldn't save. The accumulative structure coheres through the box metaphor. Deduction for excessive reflection (~35%) that occasionally summarizes rather than dramatizes, though it does alter his present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change with visible cost - Elian creates his pattern installation and feels "transformed" but no concrete before/after is legible. The parallel timeline concept never materializes into testable stakes. Under an Accumulative lens, the ending provides atmospheric suggestion ("infinite possibilities") but no resonant reconfiguration with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from exploration to discovery to understanding, with the film negative serving as the decisive turning point that reframes Elara's mission. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where she accepts continuing Thorne's work, with cost visible in the "weight of legacy's burden." The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the painter's ritual building through sensory details and coded songs to a Resonant Reconfiguration where mirrors reveal alternate lives. The closure lands with melancholy separation as cost, though the "wonderful" response feels slightly underweighted for the magnitude of what she witnesses.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost—the treaty signing happens in summary ("successfully navigated," "signature added") without dramatized causality. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but fails to accumulate pressure toward a specific crystallized moment; instead it offers philosophical musings about peace. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear, but the actual negotiation—the story's core event—occurs entirely off-page, violating the requirement for dramatized closure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the ritual release, building through salt flat imagery, fractured landscapes, and rain arrival. The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Silas placing the egg as an act of honoring what was lost, with cost visible in releasing his "most prized possession" to elements. Orientation anchors clearly (Silas, salt flat, present day). Slight deduction for the convenience of rain arriving just as needed, though it's framed as unpredictable.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the sanctuary's revelation, but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara simply steps through and becomes "both lock and key." The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established early. The transformation from courtesan to "keeper of histories" occurs through assertion rather than dramatized change with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias preparing for and performing his puppet show, but lacks a decisive closure unit with visible cost. The ending merely restates his serenity and plans without transformation or crystallized stakes. While the performance sequence shows audience softening, this change happens to others, not through Elias's agency, and no path is foreclosed with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure builds toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Aris's temporary memorial structures acknowledge both loss and the importance of witnessing. The closure lands with felt cost: "carrying with them both the weight of what was lost and the determination that these overlooked histories would not disappear unmarked." The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and maintains coherence, though the midpoint could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands with visible cost - Elara commits to staying as keeper. The hybrid lens holds as accumulative imagery (aurora, ice, light) builds toward causal action (reconfiguring rope). Orientation anchors effectively by line 3, though the transition from past guilt to present action could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara transcends her limitation to experience all three temporal states simultaneously, with clear cost in her half-life quest and isolation. The accumulative/textural lens holds as imagery and motifs build toward the final breakthrough, though the middle section relies heavily on summary rather than dramatized beats.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with increasing density toward the ritual's culmination, landing a Resonant Reconfiguration as Anu transforms from observer to covenant-bearer. The who/where/when anchors establish early (ancient Babylon, palace observatory, regime change). The closure shows visible transformation with the glowing marks, though the cost remains somewhat abstract—"some powers transcended even kings" suggests safety rather than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.4)
    The closure lands (brothers reconcile through transformed music boxes) but lacks visible cost - Marcus releases lifelong resentment without meaningful sacrifice or trade-off. The brother's sudden manifestation strains causality, appearing precisely when needed without groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the final transformation, and closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration when the mirror maker chooses freedom over capture, transforming his workshop's purpose. The cost is present but somewhat abstract—the piece states the orchard will be "known for" his creations but doesn't show immediate, visceral consequence of this choice. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara's ritual bridge-building culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when she finds the seed—a gesture that reweights her efforts with hope. The cost is visible in her tears "from both eyes, quartz and organic" and the years of separation. Causality holds as her actions generate the daughter's response, though the resolution feels slightly convenient with the overnight bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts a Conceptual Repricing closure but the cost remains abstract ("The universe both laughed and wept"). The accumulative/textural lens is undermined by repetitive telling and lack of concrete dramatization. The orientation is clear but the causality between discovering the cameo and achieving cosmic understanding lacks intermediate steps that would make the transformation credible.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    The causal chain holds (diary→discovery→negotiation→rescue) but the closure lacks visible cost - Elara extracts the colleague without sacrifice or trade-off, only vague "delicate process." The rescue succeeds too cleanly without dramatized difficulty or price. While "establishing new balances in the cosmic order" suggests change, this remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with memories layering until Elara accepts her role as chronicler—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (living through others rather than for herself). The emerald card dissolving into her palm while she becomes part of "endless narrative threads" shows visible transformation with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong causal structure with clear closure - Eleanor achieves her goal of understanding the disappearances by merging timelines and meeting Croft. The cost appears in her irreversible action of temporal manipulation, though the personal stakes of this choice could be more viscerally felt. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through harmonization rather than opposition, with visible restoration of the ripple marks. The causality holds but the resolution arrives too smoothly—the energy beings' acceptance of the bloom lacks earned resistance or meaningful complication.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara rekindles the beacon, proving "coincidences were not random at all" - a conceptual repricing with felt cost ("would not last forever"). The accumulative structure coheres through glass/light/silence motifs building to the rekindling. Orientation is clear early. The cost could be more visceral at the closure moment itself.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered descriptions of memory preservation, but closure lacks decisive change or reconfiguration—Elthion simply continues work he was already doing. The final image of continuing to ensure memories aren't lost offers no visible cost or transformation from the opening state.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward the fireworks display that serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure lands with "the gravity of hopelessness had been defied" and the fortress transforms from "monument to isolation into a beacon of renewal," showing clear before/after with emotional cost. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost - Maya achieves insight about transitions but no concrete decision or action demonstrates changed circumstances. The conversation with Aris bookends the piece but never delivers the "difficult conversation" promised. Accumulative texture builds but doesn't culminate in a Resonant Reconfiguration that makes before/after legible with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with gravity inversion enabling the quest, and Elara's collection of the gilded hush creates a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt—we're told it will "transform" and "heal" her relationship to confinement without seeing that transformation enacted through concrete action or perception at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through accumulated passenger transformations—crying woman breathing out, children quieting, businessman loosening tie—with visible emotional cost paid through their unconscious release. The accumulative pattern of comfort-through-silence holds consistently, though the cost could be more sharply defined.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkage (ruby responds to waterfall → reveals murals → shows throne location → awakens succession). Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara completes her duty, but the cost remains largely conceptual—"wisely accepting" rather than dramatized sacrifice. The orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words, and the quest structure coheres, but the absence of meaningful obstacles or visible price at closure limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when the keeper abandons isolation to help another, with visible cost in "leaving behind the ashen comfort of isolation that had promised peace but delivered only loneliness." The hybrid lens holds as accumulative imagery builds to a causal decision. Orientation anchors (shadow keeper, sanctuary, 97 days) establish clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from mysterious texts to discovery to transformation, with the closure landing as a Decisive Change when pressure literally becomes diamonds. The quantum promise concept pays off mechanically on the page. However, the cost feels abstract—Maya faces no meaningful opposition or sacrifice during her quest, and the transformation arrives without genuine struggle or price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear causal structure where the modified gramophone reveals hidden truth through resonance, creating a decisive change. However, the cost remains primarily abstract - we see the document discovered but not the protagonist paying a personal price for this revelation. The closure lands but lacks visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through mystical discoveries, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Galen becomes "keeper of whispered allegiances." The transformation carries visible cost—his irrevocable change and acceptance of a burden beyond ordinary service. Orientation anchors (knight, greenhouse, searching) establish by ~100 words, and the pattern of mystical accumulation teaches itself through phosphorescent vines, crystalline fruit, and shifting ink before the climactic unsnapping.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Eleanor and Benjamin connect over the button, with visible emotional cost in both their histories. The accumulative structure builds coherently through dust patterns to human connection. However, the extensive backstory about Benjamin (paragraphs 12-20) stalls present momentum, and the final line's explicit thematic summary ("testament to how small kindnesses...") undermines the earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkages (informant's warning → Mara's journey → data vault access → successful transfer). Closure lands as a Decisive Change with the archives being saved and transmitted, creating visible cost through the security discovery. However, the resolution feels somewhat mechanical - Theodor's convenient appearance and the perfectly-timed key solution undercut the earned causality. The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage (mentor's prophecy → Ethan's mission → musical cancellation), but the closure lacks visible cost—we're told the prophecy is "hushed" without seeing what Ethan sacrifices or how his world changes. The resolution feels too neat: "victory settling over him" suggests completion without price.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based transformation and seasonal ritual. The moonstone discovery creates a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights Elara's work from routine sorting to prophecy with higher stakes. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral—we're told about "changing winds" but don't see Elara pay a specific price for this knowledge or face what she must sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Elias embracing imperfect rhythms, teaching this new approach to customers. The accumulative structure coheres well through repeated rhythm/time motifs. Cost is visible in abandoning his life's pursuit of precision. Slight deduction for the overly neat customer validation in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias creates his own zodiac coin, transforming loss into wisdom. The accumulative lens holds as imagery builds toward the kintsugi resolution. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical progression from despair to purpose without sufficient friction.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands with Thomas's liberation through laughter integration, fulfilling the causal chain. The orientation is clean (soul collector in Echo Gorge pursuing child ghost). However, the resolution feels mechanically smooth - Thomas's decades of resistance evaporate after minimal conversation, undermining the promised 73-year challenge.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.6)
    The story attempts Accumulative/Textural progression through sensory layering and trauma echoes, but closure arrives as abstract insight ("mercy was a function of time over pain") without visible cost or foreclosed path. The mathematical framework discovery lacks concrete stakes or demonstrable change in Kai's options. Orientation anchors clearly but the conceptual repricing doesn't land with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-heavy repetition of key phrases. While a Resonant Reconfiguration occurs (the narrator accepts their role), the closure lacks visible on-page cost—we're told histories flood in but see no price paid. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) remain deliberately abstract, which doesn't pay off meaningfully at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Marcus's investigation building through sensory details toward the final connection with spirits. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the mainspring barrel enables communication, fulfilling Marcus's lifelong search. The cost is present but somewhat oblique—"answers he had sought for a lifetime" suggests transformation without showing the specific price paid for this knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing toward the rupture and transformation. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the library transforms from "perfect system" to one that "breathed and awakened," with cost visible in the destruction of Eldon's life's work. However, the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt, and the "beginning of something new" softens the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the archaeological dispute transforms from binary opposition into "a constellation of possibilities," with visible cost in the "burnished sorrow of their shared history." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details about time visibility, mirror-covering, and the crystal shard build toward the final synthesis. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal drive lens with the covenant of rust creating pressure that Elias must resolve by midnight. The closure lands with a Decisive Change as music boxes are restored citywide. The cost is primarily conceptual (the threat of lost music) rather than personal, and the resolution feels somewhat mechanical—the philosopher's stone simply blazes and solves the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's transformation, with visible cost implied in "something fundamental had shifted." The accumulative structure builds coherently toward this closure, though the mysterious voice introduces late causality that slightly weakens the earned quality of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the magic lantern slide revealing visions that reweight Elena's understanding. However, the closure lacks visible cost - Elena simply walks away "forever changed" without demonstrating what she's lost or sacrificed. The transformation happens to her rather than through her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward revelation, but closure lacks visible cost—Elara gains understanding without sacrificing anything tangible. The pattern of postcards→cathedral→revelation tracks causally, yet the final "understanding" reads as pure gain without the required foreclosed path or price.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts an Accumulative/Textural lens with temporal layering, but the closure lacks visible cost on the page—publishing "unvarnished history" reads as resolution without sacrifice. The retrocognition concept creates atmosphere but doesn't force a genuine before/after change with stakes; Ellara's transformation from "solemn" to carrying "profound light and shadow" remains asserted rather than dramatized through specific loss or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elior's gradual realization building toward community action, but the closure lacks visible cost - we see him posting notices but no price paid for his transformation. The amber bottle revelation ("metaphor for contained potential") arrives too conveniently without earned causality. The orientation is clear but the final shift from solitary alchemist to community organizer needs more dramatized resistance or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's acceptance of his expanded duty, with visible cost in the prophesied city's fall. The accumulative structure builds through temporal layers (past recording, childhood memory, future prophecy) that reweight his role. However, the prophecy's specifics remain vague ("downfall of the city"), and some causality feels convenient (the wax cylinder just happening to contain his father's prophecy).

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as entropy decreases through spiral patterns until the vortex manifests, leading to Anya's resonant reconfiguration from "recorder of time" to "part of it." Cost is visible in her numbered days and the transformation from preservation to experience. The closure lands with conceptual weight as she discovers herself as the bridge between preservation and experience.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece anchors who/where/when adequately and builds accumulative pressure through weather observations. However, the closure lacks visible cost—the bell simply rings as hoped, validating Elias without sacrifice or trade-off. "The mountain itself had been trying to talk" provides resonance but no felt price for this knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elion's growing spiritual connection culminating in cosmic revelation, but the closure relies on abstract declarations ("forever changed," "knowing participant") without visible cost. The transformation from janitor to enlightened being occurs through passive reception rather than a decisive choice that forecloses alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the recluse becomes the covenant's keeper, with visible cost in accepting eternal silence and teaching others this restraint. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently as silence and unspoken communication build density toward the final transformation. The covenant's requirement revelation and box opening create meaningful tightening that forecloses speech as an option. Minor deduction for some causality softness in how other survivors suddenly understand without words at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost—Elara's understanding and decision to pass on knowledge happens without dramatized stakes or trade-offs. The orientation is clear but the ending relies on abstract assertions ("Time was hers to explore") rather than a specific reconfiguration that makes before/after legible with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. While thematically coherent about letting go and finding beauty in incompleteness, the ending merely restates this philosophy without a resonant reconfiguration that makes a before/after legible. The poet walks away unchanged, having neither transformed nor paid a price for her stance. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—just variations on the same meditation.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building from diagnosis through discovery to transformation, with clear closure showing Elias's death as the completion of interspecies connection. The cost is visible - his life exchanged for the bridge between worlds. Minor deduction for some causality softness in how quickly he masters the complex copper wire patterns and the somewhat convenient timing of completion at exactly six months.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows a clear causal path (arrival → pilgrimage → revelation) but the closure lacks visible cost—Elian simply "understands" without sacrifice or trade-off. The transformation happens through assertion ("finally free from his doubt") rather than dramatized struggle. The who/where/when are established early, but the stakes remain abstract throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with the battlefield-to-garden transformation carrying visible cost through decades of patient work. The accumulative structure coheres well through seed-scattering to final flowering, though the time jump to "years later" slightly weakens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based revelation building to Resonant Reconfiguration at closure - the reunification reweights "distance into closeness" with visible cost (the wasteland journey). The phonograph grooves as both literal and metaphorical paths create strong causality. Orientation anchors establish clearly by line 3. The "Home is not a place, but a truth shared between hearts" risks thematic echo but is earned through the concrete journey.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece lacks a decisive on-page change or genuine cost—Elara begins alone sketching stars and ends the same way with only an abstract realization that "true north had been within her all along." No causal linkage drives this insight; it appears unmotivated in the final line. The world-building about "the shutdown" remains vague backdrop without affecting present choices. Under an Accumulative lens, the repetitive meditation on isolation and purpose fails to build density or create a meaningful pattern break at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change - Kael restores the fractured timeline using the sundial, with the cost being his transformation from thief to guardian of mysteries. The causal chain holds: wrong sky → climb spire → place chess pieces → find sundial → mend reality. However, the master's convenient arrival and immediate exposition about the sundial's purpose weakens the earned quality of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the single pawn materializes, reweighting absence through presence and validating Elara's memory work—"The single pawn seemed to pulse with the life force of all its missing companions." Cost is legible in her acknowledgment that she "couldn't save everyone's memories, only select examples." The accumulative lens holds as patterns of walking literally spell meaning into existence, though the Chinese text intrusion disrupts the ending's flow.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Maven discovers home is "not a place at all, but the connections between places." The accumulative structure builds through stone discovery, feather texture, and nightly rituals to this crystallized understanding with clear cost (years of searching). The orientation anchors early and the textural lens holds, though the "substituting reality" revelation feels slightly unmotivated.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost on the page - the prince simply offers reconciliation without the tutor paying any price or making a decisive choice. The story violates the single-scene requirement with unexplained transitions between the tapestry work and entering the labyrinth. Causality breaks when the prince appears suspended yet conscious, and time restarts without clear mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.7)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens building toward tomorrow's ritual, but closure fails to land on-page with a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration. Elara's smile and knowledge that she "succeeded" is declared rather than demonstrated through a specific cost or transformation. The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2, but the promised confrontation with authorities never materializes in scene, leaving the stakes untested.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Conceptual Repricing closure lands with Marcel's realization about transforming brokenness through "golden joining," and the accumulative structure coheres as each scar reveals another memory fragment. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt—we understand his transformation intellectually but don't feel what this new understanding will demand of him going forward.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias finding his own forgotten artwork, which reweights his relationship to memory and art with visible emotional cost (tears, trembling). The causal chain from wrong turn to cave discovery to finding the shell works, and the closure lands with "temporary eternity" as a precious balance. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the accumulative lens holds as details build toward the final synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through the whisper's success, but the cost remains abstract—we're told of "tears of screaming tenderness" without feeling what Elias sacrifices or risks. The sister's reception lacks causal grounding (why does she suddenly feel this connection now?). The orientation is clear but the accumulative build doesn't sufficiently charge the final connection to make the cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through the navigator finding "purpose in guiding others through the geography of loss," with accumulated pattern of ships returning home. The accumulative structure coheres through moon phases, nightly calls, and signal responses. Cost appears as "so many had been lost" and the navigator's scarred body, though the personal price remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from isolation through ritual to discovery, with the second glass eye providing a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights Elara's journey from self-protection to potential healing for others. The cost is visible in her tears and years of isolation. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation (the empathy virus context comes late) and some expository passages about the textbooks that slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the borrowed memories building density toward Elias's final gesture of release and connection—a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (his isolation transformed). The orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words, and the pattern of memory accumulation teaches its logic early. The cost could be more explicitly visceral at closure, though the "isolation transformed into connection" carries conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through Decisive Change - Elias transforms from passive observer to active cartographer of his own life, with the cost being his comfortable isolation. The causal chain from package to cavern to transformation holds, though the mystical elements strain believability. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly, and the because/therefore linkages track from inciting incident through resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration - the queen returns transformed with new understanding of her role. The causal chain from dreams to journey to revelation holds, though the cost remains more implied than visceral. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara reconceives her art from preserving light to capturing transformation, with the secret acting as catalyst. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and repeated imagery (spiral, ember, light) build toward this conceptual shift. Cost appears in her need to "revalue everything" and approach her craft "differently," though the secret itself remaining unnamed slightly weakens the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases and pattern breaks that reweight Elias's relationship to mortality and time. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis—he continues chronicling knowing every grave is also a cradle, with the cost visible in his "bittersweet recognition." Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by ~100 words, though the temporal confusion is intentionally part of the character's state.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the connection between two women finding purpose in transitions, with emotional cost visible in Elara's "heart lighter than it had been in months." However, the accumulative structure lacks sufficient density increase or pattern break to fully justify the emotional payoff, and the resolution feels somewhat predetermined rather than earned through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through ritual details toward successful transformation despite crystallization threat. The closure lands with visible cost—scars becoming "stories of caution and resilience"—and the quill tip falling signals perfect execution. Minor deduction for slightly soft causality around why the platform tilts "unnaturally."

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story achieves closure through Decisive Change—reconciliation and forgiveness occur on-page with visible emotional cost ("tears tracing clean paths"). The causal chain holds: perfume releases scent → enables manifestation → allows apology → achieves forgiveness. However, the cost feels somewhat abstract; while tears appear and the orchard's destruction looms, the personal price Eloise pays for this reconciliation remains understated compared to the magnitude of her original betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the witness gathering cosmic truths, but closure lacks visible cost—the final unification happens without sacrifice or trade-off, just completion. The "resounding hush of completion" attempts resonance but feels unearned without dramatized struggle. Orientation remains vague throughout (who is this witness, what destroyed the universe), violating the 120-word anchor rule.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where Arlo reframes time's purpose from commodity to presence, with the cost being his conventional relationship to measurement. However, the reversal mechanism lacks concrete causality—why does the mantle clock key make a hydraulic clock run backward?—and the transformation happens too smoothly without dramatized resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's understanding shifts from intrusion detection to "mutual guardianship," with clear before/after legible in her changed relationship to the strangers. The accumulative lens holds as details build toward this reweighting of meaning. The cost—letting go of defensive isolation for vulnerable connection—is conceptually present but could be more viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.4)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration ("something like peace") but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The piece teaches its accumulative pattern through repeated imagery (candle lantern, subway scrawls, probability) but the final transformation from academic pursuit to "pilgrimage" lacks a decisive on-page price. Elena's realization about "beautiful uncertainty" arrives without dramatized struggle against her need for mathematical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the glass harmonica disc as a recurring motif building toward Elias's shift from haunted isolation to "harmonious" connection. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where wrong numbers transform from intrusions into opportunities, with emotional cost visible in "no longer felt haunted but harmonious." However, the cost feels more stated than dramatized—we don't see Elias struggle with or resist this change in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the archivist's final night of analog preservation before digital transition, but the closure lacks decisive change—he simply walks away after completing his ritual. The "regenerated covenant" concept remains abstract philosophy rather than dramatized transformation, and while atmospheric pressure builds, no clear cost lands on the page beyond accepting inevitable change that was already decided off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from loneliness to rumor-spreading to community formation, but the entire middle section (rumor spreading) occurs in summary rather than scene. The closure lands conceptually—Archie discovers connection comes through sharing stories—but lacks visible cost on the page. The orientation is clear early, but the time-jump structure ("Three days later," "By week's end") distances us from dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with sensory density building toward the stillpoint discovery. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elion finds internal peace, but the cost remains abstract—"tears fell" and "emotional landscapes" don't show what specific path he's foreclosing or what price he pays for this wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's successful correction of history, with visible cost in her three years of guilt. However, the resolution feels too neat—Sarah's discovery happens off-page, and the mechanism of "contingent relationships" remains abstract rather than dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—the final image crystallizes Elias's role as forgotten listener with palpable melancholy. The accumulative structure coheres as silence transforms into music across multiple encounters. However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral, stated rather than fully dramatized through concrete loss.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through Maya's transformation, but the closure lacks visible on-page cost—we're told she rebuilds libraries but don't witness the actual struggle or sacrifice required. The accumulative structure through following artistic clues coheres, but the "years passed" summary deflates what should be the story's most crucial beats of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Elena's drumming patterns building toward the climactic reunion. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the sound wave garden transforms into their shared dream-lagoon. The cost is present but somewhat abstract—"auroral sorrow" and "temporary" knowledge—rather than a visceral price that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Marlo's whispered directions accomplish what Vance's shouts cannot, with visible cost in Vance's renewed curiosity. However, the stakes feel modest - proving a point about communication methods lacks the weight needed for higher scores, and the "who/where/when" anchoring arrives late (not fully clear until "9:30 PM").

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through light manipulation, but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost. The visitor "turns away, the secret still unspoken but somehow transformed" provides no legible change or price paid. The piece teaches its pattern (weaving light/shadow) but never tests or transforms it through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost—Arthur faces no consequences, sacrifices nothing, and the transformation happens without resistance. The accumulative pattern builds adequately but the final image ("fellow thinkers ready to make their own moves") lands as assertion rather than earned change with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through scrimshaw discovery, emerging text, whale calls, and final dissolution—each layer reweighting Mara's relationship to her constrained life. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Mara's transformation into the disappearing island resident forecloses her shore-bound life with clear cost: "the other dock workers would speak for years of the morning Mara vanished." The pattern of revelation-through-discovery maintains causality under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through ritualistic repetition toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the performer becomes "a mirror in which others saw their true reflections." The happiness mandate backstory effectively constrains present choices and the dried flowers anchor temporal layers. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract final cost—"remade hush settling over the land like forgiveness" gestures at transformation but doesn't fully embody the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the poet's journey building toward transformation, but the closure—becoming a "bridge between seen and unseen"—lands as abstract assertion rather than dramatized change with visible cost. The transformation happens through telling ("the poet felt themselves changing") rather than concrete action that would make the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with botanical arrangements building toward the courtyard's transformation and dual awakenings. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when both Elara and Gideon receive unexpected gifts - she regains color vision while he finds beauty in imperfection. The cost is visible in the "bartered" exchange and Gideon's acceptance of his aging. Orientation anchors effectively by line two with clear who/where/when.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered discoveries, but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost. The ending merely continues the pattern of discovery without reconfiguration—"tomorrow would bring new questions" avoids rather than pays the conceptual or emotional price of her revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.4)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the piece achieves textural density but fails to deliver a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. The ending summarizes transformation ("had found her true calling") rather than dramatizing a specific moment of change or crystallized choice. The pattern teaches itself but doesn't culminate in a concrete final image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where two minds joining to solve the mystery reweights Elias's solitary project, with the measuring tape's inheritance adding generational weight. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page—we understand the responsibility but don't feel its price. The accumulative structure coheres well with repeated imagery (rain, skylights, cards) building density toward the ending revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara merges with the archive, paying the cost of her individual identity to preserve collective memory. The accumulative structure coheres well, building from physical approach to consciousness merger. Cost is visible in "she would never be the same" and her transformation into a "vessel," though the emotional price could be more viscerally felt rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through repeated observations of the shadow's evolution until the recognition scene creates a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's understanding transforms from professional duty to personal mission with visible emotional cost. The "luminous regret of understanding that comes too late" lands as genuine closure with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost—Elara's "way forward" remains abstract without a specific choice or renunciation that forecloses options. The betrayal setup (con revealed three days ago) provides context but the present-frame lacks concrete pressure that would force stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara discovering integration over excavation as her healing method. While the closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing (healing through honoring rather than opening), the cost remains largely abstract—"forever changed" without specific visible price. The orientation anchors (tower, dawn, post-anesthesia) establish setting but the causal mechanism of how she got there remains unexplained, creating a soft gap.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward Elena's decision to project the stored emotions. A Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when she understands her role as conduit rather than mere projectionist, with emotional cost visible in her tear. However, the closure lacks a decisive physical act or clear foreclosure of options—she simply continues what she was already doing with new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's shift from drowning in voices to channeling them, but the cost remains abstract - "shadowed rapture" and "bittersweet knowledge" lack concrete price. The accumulative lens holds but the transformation occurs through exposition ("she now understood") rather than dramatized action, and the closure's "reborn" state feels unearned by the preceding ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the frozen chess clock ticks to 00:01, crystallizing the guard's transformation from dreamless observer to active dreamer with visible cost (his fractured existence across timelines). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through repeated imagery of glowing dunes, sparks, and archives. Minor orientation issues in the opening ~120 words (unclear spatial/temporal anchoring) apply -0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Kaelen accepts his expanded consciousness, with the mechanical forest revealed as his mental landscape. However, the cost remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt—we understand he's exploring dangerous territory but don't see what he sacrifices or risks losing through this transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration when the guides discover their true purpose shifts from ferrying passengers to awakening courage. The broken leash enables this journey with clear causality, and the cost appears as accepting responsibility for courage-awakening. However, the transformation feels somewhat predetermined rather than hard-won, and the conceptual cost remains more implied than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as details (bolt, discoloration, names) build toward the resonant reconfiguration where singing breaks the fortress's silence-for-safety bargain. The cost is legible in "unpardonable silence" and the risk of losing sanctuary. Minor orientation delay (bellhop's identity/role clarifies gradually) doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing when Elara discovers the pretender is her own fear, but the cost remains abstract rather than felt on the page. The accumulative structure coheres through repeated phrases and library dissolution, yet the final revelation lacks grounding in earlier concrete details that would make this self-discovery inevitable rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Marina's realization about Earth's cycles serving as closure through Conceptual Repricing. However, the cost remains purely conceptual without visible stakes—Marina faces no trade-off or foreclosed path when accepting her witness role. The revelation about "paths disappearing" arrives through internal reflection rather than dramatized discovery despite the torn atlas setup.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration through spiritual transformation, but the cost remains entirely abstract—"ready to reignite not just a rebellion, but a revolution of the spirit." The stone circle appears without causal connection to the spaceport setting (coincidence resolution), and the protagonist's transformation occurs through passive reception rather than choice under pressure. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but fails to accumulate genuine pressure or extract visible cost from its mystical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with discoverable linkages (telepathy leads to cave, cave to embryo, kite to decoding). The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Maya accepts both heritage and innovation. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral - we're told about "reconstruction" but never feel what was lost or what Maya sacrifices to achieve this synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure coheres around Maya's journey from frozen trauma to active release, with the photograph's letting-go serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost. The "pearl of stillness" concept effectively bridges internal and external worlds, though the piece sometimes tells what it has shown ("an embodiment of how life continues").

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Eleanor's perspective on fragmentation shifts from problem to artistic method. However, the cost remains largely conceptual—"beautiful pain" and "luminescent ache"—without concrete sacrifice or foreclosed options. The accumulative pattern builds through color/thread imagery but the transformation happens too smoothly, lacking the resistance that would make the change feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the eclipse, ink patterns, and temporal research building toward the climactic displacement experiment. The Decisive Change occurs when the tracker physically dissolves into temporal patterns and returns transformed with new understanding. Cost is visible in the "dangerous fluctuations" of vitals and the physical toll, though the conceptual repricing of time's nature could land with more weight.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain is solid: power fluctuation → discovery → internal conflict → decision → action → acceptance of consequences. Closure lands with Elena's choice creating irreversible change and accepting the cost ("prepared to face the consequences"). However, the cost remains somewhat abstract - we know she risks "cryonic suspension or worse" but don't see immediate concrete consequences manifesting.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. The ending merely shows Rhiannon completing "another day's work" without any transformation, crystallized choice, or reconfiguration of stakes. Under an Accumulative lens, the density doesn't meaningfully shift, and no pattern breaks to create resonance—the story ends exactly where it began emotionally and situationally.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration when the fisher captures the goddess's echo, with cost visible in the transformation of both fisher and cosmos ("transformed by its sacred purpose"). However, the accumulative/textural lens relies heavily on abstract concepts rather than concrete pressure, and the "timeframe when patterns broke themselves" lacks specific temporal anchoring that would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Eleanor gathering evidence toward a revelation, but the closure lacks visible cost—she simply makes a phone call with confidence. The "orbits of regret" transform to "orbits of justice" but this conceptual shift carries no dramatized price or sacrifice, failing the cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong resonant reconfiguration lands with clear emotional cost - Elias moves from tortured guilt to peaceful acceptance through hearing his daughter's lullaby. The accumulative structure builds texture through laboratory details, amber imagery, and sound motifs. Minor orientation wobble with "Yesterday" creating temporal confusion, but the closure's transformation of "meteor hush" from emptiness to stillness carries genuine weight.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the sand mandala patterns building density until they make the grotto's whispers coherent, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where chaos becomes accepted wisdom. The closure lands with visible cost as Silas dismantles his creation, though the extended denouement with new visitors dilutes the impact slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the renaming ritual that transforms the plaza from ruins to "potential," with visible communal witness as cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and memories build toward the climactic naming. However, the transformation feels somewhat abstract—"the plaza respond to his words"—without concrete physical or relational change that would strengthen causality.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with Resonant Reconfiguration closure—Silas dissolves into mist after healing the timeline, with visible cost (giving his spectral essence). The fractured timeline provides coherent pressure that builds through singing/weaving metaphors, though the mechanics of timeline repair remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Maya discovering the geode's healing properties, but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. The ending declares transformation ("the affectionate skeptic became a believer") without showing Maya actually using the protocol or demonstrating its cost. The piece reads more as extended setup than complete arc.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with Maya's discovery leading to understanding her purpose, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she accepts her role as translator of the hibernation's mysteries. The closure lands with conceptual cost—she must carry this burden of knowledge—though the emotional price could be more viscerally felt. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the warehouse transforms from solitary to communal space. However, the cost of this transformation remains conceptual rather than felt—Elara pays no visible price for sharing the prophecy or changing her role. The accumulation of buttons and wisdom-sharing creates pattern but lacks the decisive tightening that would make the stakes undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through repeated snow codes, mist imagery, and the pillbox's evolving significance, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Aleksandr accepts his fractures as "maps rather than failures." The closure lands with clear emotional cost—leaving behind his crucible and accepting permanent damage. The who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2, and the pattern of morning rituals creates coherent pressure toward crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.2)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the story achieves atmospheric density but lacks a decisive reconfiguration with felt cost. The ending merely completes a routine ritual—"The palimpsest promise was kept for another day"—without showing what was at risk or what changed. The closure reads as Earned Stasis but the "cost" remains conceptual rather than visible on the page, failing the cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered discoveries (glass revealing timelines, flowers responding to kindness, bees stirring). The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing as Kael understands resistance as "loyal memory of love," though the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page—he resolves to return and share wisdom but pays no immediate price.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara discovers her grandmother's practice of reflecting light for Jim, reweighting the bitting gauge tooth's meaning. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. However, the coincidental meeting with Jim strains causality, and while the closure lands emotionally, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, with motifs (brass sundial, atomically reflective surfaces, stone circle) building toward Elena's acceptance of coexistence over control. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elena finds independence through connection rather than isolation—lands with conceptual cost (abandoning her species' need for dominion). However, the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually stated.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara discovering inspiration through the art installation, qualifying as a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost remains abstract—"she would never write another letter that didn't contain this truth" lacks visible price. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 4, but the closure relies on declaration rather than dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves closure through Decisive Change (broadcasts stop, community healing begins) with clear causal linkage. However, the cost remains abstract—we're told about "cosmic significance and earthly terror" but don't see Elara pay a concrete price for her interference, and the week-later epilogue dilutes the immediate impact.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain holds and reaches a Decisive Change when Elara steps through the portal, with clear cost (leaving her world behind). However, the revelation that "The vital key was not a physical object but a passage" arrives as exposition rather than dramatized discovery. The closure lands but the cost feels more declared than viscerally earned through the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage from ribbon discovery to guest list analysis to final deduction, but the closure lacks visible on-page cost. The confession happens off-page in summary ("led to a confession"), violating the requirement for on-page closure with felt consequence. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear early, preventing further deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    The causal chain from decoding journals to activating hidden technology holds, but closure lacks visible cost. "With a deep breath, Eli initiated the sequence" shows decision without price - no sacrifice, loss, or foreclosed option. The story ends at activation rather than consequence, making this more setup than resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story presents a mystical vanishing followed by Elias's ascension but lacks causal linkage between events—the hitchhiker disappears without setup, the glass flake appears without explanation, and Elias's transformation occurs through magical convenience rather than earned choice. The closure (Elias ascending to another dimension) reads as Conceptual Repricing but the cost remains abstract ("luminous disbelief that would heal every wound") rather than felt on the page. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode but pattern accumulation doesn't build sufficient pressure toward the transcendent ending.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story follows a clear accumulative structure building toward Elias's realization about paths and starting points, with adequate closure through Conceptual Repricing. However, the piece spreads across multiple temporal layers (present negotiation, three years earlier, subsequent months) without sharp transitions, creating orientation drift. The closure lands conceptually but lacks immediate dramatic cost—Elias's "peaceful resolution" feels unearned given the startup's failure. Who/where/when anchors wobble between circus train office scenes and summary passages.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.2)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost—Elara simply "feels satisfaction" without sacrificing anything concrete. The accumulative pattern builds adequately but the ending summarizes wisdom gained ("some knowledge was meant to be discovered...together") rather than dramatizing a costly choice or renunciation. The piece teaches its dream-to-telescope pattern but doesn't extract a price.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (failed trick → vortex entry → plant ritual → truth revealed → mentor freed) but the closure lacks visible cost—the druid simply accepts the truth with "warlike serenity." The revelation about the mentor's glamour arrives without sufficient setup or consequence. While technically complete, the ending's "some truths are worth any price" rings hollow when no price is actually paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with mystical world-building, but the closure's Conceptual Repricing ("dreams and reality were not opposing forces but complementary ones") arrives through exposition rather than dramatized cost. The covenant's restoration happens through ritual description without visible stakes or trade-offs. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara successfully trammeling the escaped memory, with visible cost in her bartered destiny. However, the accumulative/textural lens lacks sufficient density increase—the memory confrontation resolves too smoothly without meaningful complication. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Marcus authenticates the cloth and feels "something besides shame," with the cost being his confrontation with painful memories. The accumulative structure works as details about his losses layer toward this moment. However, the explicit statement "discovering purpose after loss" in multiple places undermines the subtlety, and some causal links feel mechanical ("the disastrous auction house collapse" backstory).

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story operates in Accumulative/Textural mode but fails to deliver closure with visible cost on the page. The ending—Elara feeling "less lonely" and being "part of an unbroken continuum"—is purely reflective without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that makes before/after legible. The journey begins but nothing crystallizes; we have setup without payoff, preparation without transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a decisive closure with visible cost. The ending ("all wandering tales eventually find their way home") offers philosophical satisfaction without dramatized change or price paid. The monthly ritual completes but nothing fundamentally shifts—the librarian continues their cycle unchanged, with no path foreclosed or option narrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the inspector discovering the pearl, absorbing its power, and accepting a new mission—a Resonant Reconfiguration that transforms her purpose. The cost (bearing others' abandoned hopes, feeling their weight) is stated but not fully dramatized through struggle or sacrifice. The transition from bunker to surface world works, but the transformation happens too easily without meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elena's acceptance of grief at the hidden river, with visible emotional cost (tears joining the river). The accumulative structure coheres as bathroom graffiti leads to the underground river discovery. However, the orientation wobbles slightly with the unexplained "市政府 papers" and the brother revelation comes late enough to briefly destabilize comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a true closure with visible cost—the protagonist simply walks away with knowledge gained, no path foreclosed. The orientation is clear (dreamer, forest, seeking library) but the ending offers no Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt consequence. "The knowledge they had gained was now their secret to keep" summarizes rather than dramatizes any transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from threat to solution, with the violin's propagation serving as a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost—the original violin becomes a "silent shell." The coffee-reading provides motivated discovery rather than coincidence. Minor deduction for the slightly rushed transition from reading to action without showing Elara's decision process.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with ritual repetition building toward preservation of memory. While the closure shows completion of the preservation ritual, the cost remains abstract—we see Elara add another soul to her collection, but there's no visible price paid or path foreclosed, only continuation of established pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.7)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara climbing, entering the grotto, and achieving understanding, but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. The ending assertion that she "had become the source herself" is conceptual without dramatized change or price paid. Orientation is clear but the transformation lacks causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elian's momentary vulnerability and philosophical acceptance, with cost implied through "the weight of all the consciences he had hired out." However, the accumulative structure lacks sufficient density increase or pattern break to fully charge the ending. The fisherman's offstage resolution weakens causality, and Elian's arc from detachment to brief vulnerability needs stronger pressure to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Maya's understanding deepening through the stone-throwing lesson until she achieves the paradoxical insight of "vanishing to appear." The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Maya "seemed to fade, her presence intensifying even as her physical form lessened," with Elien's decade-return providing visible cost. However, the transformation feels somewhat abstract despite the concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration with Kael's transformation, but the cost remains entirely abstract - we're told he "navigates without moving" but never shown what he sacrifices or how this changes his options. The accumulative/textural lens could work, but the piece lacks density increase or pattern breaks that would reweight the dominant stake. The orientation is clear but the closure lacks visible, felt, or conceptual cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with Elias's discovery of the texts leading to his forbidden journey and ultimate transformation. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias brings authentic magic back to the standardized world, with visible cost in his rejection of automated systems. However, the middle section rushes through the journey without sufficient pressure buildup, and the transformation happens too easily once he removes his pack.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the key tag's transformation serving as the decisive change that opens the portal to self-understanding. Closure lands with visible cost (the permanent mark) and reconfigures Hemingway's relationship to his gift. The library revelation provides earned insight though the pacing accelerates somewhat abruptly in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure lands as a Decisive Change - Loran interprets the coin pattern to broadcast humanity's evolutionary signature for universal rebirth. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2. However, the cost remains somewhat abstract ("evolutionary signature") rather than viscerally felt, and the resolution feels convenient without sufficient prior setup for this specific solution.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern intensification through naming acts that crystallize fears. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the reaper transforms from collector to namer, with emotional cost visible in "cloak no longer seemed as heavy." Orientation anchors (reaper, observatory, dusk) establish cleanly within first lines. The piece teaches its naming-as-healing pattern early and pays it off, though the cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure with the bell's restoration enabling cosmic rebalancing and the sea's renewal. The causal chain from understanding dripping patterns to rebuilding the bell holds logically. Cost is visible in the mage's "brittle devotion" and tireless work, though the final warming of his powers edges toward convenient resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as memories and artifacts layer toward Thomas's crystallized purpose to "transform individual memories into shared history." The closure achieves Charged Poise—Thomas stands ready with evidence to challenge the official narrative, with professional cost implied. The photograph discovery sequence builds causally, though the aunt connection feels slightly convenient. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the ritual building toward transformation, but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara simply succeeds without forfeit or price. The piece teaches its magical system (starlings, crystal, blue flame) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration where she achieves balance, yet the "before the final transformation" frame promises a larger change that never materializes on-page, weakening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.2)
    No clear closure lands on the page - the story ends mid-transmission without decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing. The accumulative build toward "urgent message" and "determine everyone's fate" never crystallizes into a specific cost or foreclosed path. The pattern of vigilance continues without transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.4)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Maya transforms from numbness to feeling, but the cost remains conceptually stated ("no longer numb, smiled") rather than embodied through specific sensation or sacrifice. The accumulative build through complementary opposites coheres, yet the final transformation lacks the visceral price that would make it undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.2)
    No decisive change occurs—Elara plants a seed and sketches ideas, but these actions don't foreclose options or exact visible cost. The story accumulates descriptive moments without causal linkage ("she noticed the package," "she examined the seed," "she planted it"). The ending's "reminder that innovation flows through orthogonal approaches" is pure thesis statement, not earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Silas creating a sound ritual that culminates in hearing the ghost giggle—a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights his grief. The cost (accepting absence as "sanctuary for memory") is conceptually present but lacks visceral weight. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the guardian transcends dimensional boundaries, with visible cost in leaving the garden "not abandoned, but transformed." The accumulative structure coheres as magical intensification leads to dimensional permeability. However, the transformation sequence from "The garden brightened" onward accelerates without sufficient intermediate pressure, and the cost remains more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story delivers a Decisive Change with visible cost—Elias transforms the crozier and breaks his family's pattern of preservation. The accumulative/textural lens holds as successive approximations build toward transformation. The cost is somewhat abstract ("the hopeless had never been his nature but merely his training") rather than viscerally felt, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara successfully tunes the fragment and awakens the city, but the cost remains abstract ("knowledge that every conclusion contains the seed of a new start"). The accumulative lens builds through layered descriptions yet lacks a decisive tightening that would foreclose options or exact visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through timeline merger with visible cost (Liam becomes a "permanent transient"), and the accumulative/textural lens holds as mystical details build toward convergence. However, the orientation anchors arrive late (ferry's nature unclear until paragraph 3), and the causality of how touching hourglasses triggers the merger lacks concrete mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's realization that "connection wasn't something to be discovered—it was something to be created." The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as dream-patterns intensify toward the eruption and reunion. Cost is visible in years of separation and the void he's tried to fill, though the resolution's emotional tidiness diminishes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Kael's methodical development of edge geometry building toward validation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when his calculations prove correct, reweighting the benthic city's isolation with new purpose. Cost is primarily conceptual—the city's transformation from isolated to connected—though emotional cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands with Decisive Change - Elena prevents a tragedy by solving her grandmother's decades-old warning. The causal chain from hearing aid to photograph to predator is clean. Cost is visible in the transformation of Elena's role from passive tracer to active protector, though the resolution feels slightly convenient with security's timely arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    Story follows Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward Elara's ritual completion and commitment to continue. The closure lands as Earned Stasis—she accepts her role despite costs—with emotional price visible in her acceptance of eventual transformation. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2, and the tidal window creates effective constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where the narrator reframes their death as transformation, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page. The accumulative/textural lens holds but lacks density shifts or pattern breaks that would create meaningful escalation. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear orientation and a Resonant Reconfiguration closure when the diamond reveals the reborn language. Cost is present but somewhat abstract—decades of dedication without concrete sacrifice shown. The "tears streaming" moment provides emotional weight but lacks the visceral price that would elevate beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Aris documenting cryptid transformations, but closure lacks visible cost—the flint arrowhead developing patterns is ornamental rather than forcing a trade-off. The piece accumulates observations without a decisive change or reconfiguration that makes before/after legible. Who/where/when anchors clearly by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: locust shell discovery → orchard journey → sapling theft → world transformation, with a Decisive Change closure where beauty literally transforms the mechanical world. The cost is visible (the orchard's release, the living statues' pursuit) and the transformation irreversible. Minor deduction for some causality softness around how exactly playing violin calms stone statues through "heart rhythms."

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's successful delivery of the bottled storm, with visible cost in the risk taken and the separation it addresses. The causal chain from mailman-smuggler to weather-carrier to hope-deliverer holds coherently. The final image of a girl watching the storm while trusting her father's return reweights the opening's danger into earned hope.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through magical discovery leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where silence transforms into creative power. The closure lands with the carpenter creating magic from "misting hush," but the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt—the twenty years of silence pays off thematically yet lacks immediate dramatic price at the transformation moment.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, building from library description through hyperbolic geometry to stories taking physical form. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Margaret connects permanently to living stories, though the cost (losing the scarf) feels more symbolic than visceral. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara discovers her sister has become "part of the light," reweighting all prior sunrise captures with new meaning. The accumulative structure builds effectively through photography-development-discovery beats, though the mysterious book's appearance feels somewhat convenient despite serving the textural design.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with mystical elements building toward the mental unlocking. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the woman's idea transforms from imprisoned to "transformative, boundless, free," with cost visible in the dissolved hair strands and the weight of suppressed potential. The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words, though the mystical crossroads setting intentionally blurs ordinary reality.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through star charts leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration when memories return. Orientation anchors effectively by line 3. The closure lands on-page but the cost feels abstract—"decades of research" is stated rather than felt through specific sacrifice or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Prisha stands her ground rather than walking backwards, validating the archivist's teaching through embodied change with clear cost (his permanent exile finding purpose). The accumulative texture of shadows, shards, and tea leaves coheres meaningfully. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the "reversible exile" concept's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the seed transforms to cast rainbows, with implied cost ("give pieces of oneself"). However, the transformation mechanics remain vague ("weaving between worlds") and the cost isn't viscerally felt on page. The accumulative lens holds but the magical elements lack consistent rules - what exactly constrains this power?

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elena's act of unraveling the net, which grounds the spirits and releases Jacob's secret, with visible cost in the accumulated suffering she absorbs. The accumulative/textural lens holds consistently as silence and fragments layer toward the final transformation. The orientation anchors (mask restorer, prism sanctuary, fisherman Jacob) establish clearly by ~100 words, and causality tracks cleanly through the unraveling sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara discovers the chapel is a celestial phenomenon, reweighting all prior searching. The accumulative structure coheres as each discovery layer (video footage patterns, celestial alignments, torn map significance) builds toward this reconceptualization. However, the personal cost remains primarily intellectual rather than felt—Elara gains understanding without sacrificing her prior worldview or facing genuine loss.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where Elara's understanding of death shifts from ending to "frequency shift," with emotional cost visible in her tears and melancholy. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details build toward this realization. The orientation is clear by ~100 words, and the snow globe's transformation provides a concrete marker of change.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through graffiti exchanges, but closure lacks decisive cost - their connection continues without visible sacrifice or foreclosed paths. The ethereal realm setting delays orientation anchors past 120 words without clear payoff at closure (-0.5 applied).

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ascent structure provides clear progression and the decryption discovery creates a resonant reconfiguration, but the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The captain's absence and Elira's lack of concrete stakes beyond curiosity satisfaction prevent the closure from achieving the weight it attempts. Who/where/when anchors clearly by floor two.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver genuine closure with cost. Elena simply continues her work with new understanding, but nothing changes—she was already doing this research, already believed her theories, and faces no consequence for her suspended state. The "spooled wholeness" concept and cloud consciousness remain abstract assertions without dramatized proof or price.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara's discovery transforms her artistic practice with visible cost (the library's imminent destruction). The coin discovery causally enables her final masterpiece. Slight deduction for the cost being more situational (demolition) than arising from her choice, though the urgency effectively pressures the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where random elements (hopscotch, starlings, trapped light) reveal themselves as an ancient navigation system. However, the cost remains abstract - "the enormity of his find" - without concrete stakes or sacrifice. The accumulative structure coheres but the revelation arrives too smoothly, lacking the friction that would make discovery feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - Elias joins ancestors in "eternal rhythm of repair" with visible transformation of the library. The accumulative lens holds through repeated phrases building density. Cost is present but could be more visceral - we see the transformation but don't feel what Elias sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the community's transformation from crisis to renewal, with the watering bell discovery as the pivotal turn. However, the cost remains abstract—"brambled hope" and "tangled roots" suggest difficulty without showing specific sacrifice or loss. The accumulative structure coheres around the ghost's guidance leading to collective action, but the ending's "forever thriving" undercuts the promised complexity of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively—the lullaby successfully vouchsafes the next cycle, with the puppet head's "beautiful flaw" as the necessary vulnerability. The cost is legible in Elias's exhaustion and the "terrible rhythm" he must endure. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the middle section's abstract mechanisms ("threads of fractured starlight") slightly dilute the visceral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias reframes his curse as blessing, but the cost remains abstract - we see effort but no concrete sacrifice or price paid for using the device. The causal chain (find blueprint → assemble device → save travelers → find purpose) is clear but mechanical. The orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara reframes separation as potential for reconnection, with the cost visible in her acknowledgment "I need to atone." The accumulative structure works well through scientific/natural imagery building to insight. Minor deduction for the slightly rushed final third where multiple epiphanies stack without sufficient breathing room.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres as the vendor moves from isolation through preparation to customer arrival, with the closure landing as a Resonant Reconfiguration about where stories "become possible." The glimmering parole's seven-day constraint and the vendor's century of confinement establish clear stakes. Cost appears in the "mindfully scattered" fragments and the price of "quantifying absence," though the emotional weight could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Kael descending to the pavilion and transforming memories, but the closure lacks visible on-page cost—we're told his "heart lighter" without seeing what specific price he paid or path he foreclosed. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear early, and the pavilion discovery provides a turn, but the ending summarizes transformation ("Hours passed...finally Kael emerged") rather than dramatizing the decisive moment with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.8)
    The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost - Elena succeeds without sacrifice or meaningful opposition. The story summarizes meetings and transformations rather than dramatizing pivotal moments. The accumulative structure builds some texture but the final image of Elena holding the restored weight doesn't reweight prior material with felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands as the engineer becomes permanently changed, able to bridge "abandoned dreams and their realization" with visible cost of identity blurring and permanent "quaking reverie." The accumulative/textural lens holds through density increases and pattern breaks. Minor deduction for soft orientation (canyon location vague) and some conceptual abstraction in the transformation mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves closure through Elara completing her mission and accepting future responsibility (Earned Stasis), but the cost remains abstract—"weight of renewed responsibility" without concrete sacrifice. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details build toward the grotto sequence, yet the gravity inversion mechanism feels more like convenient plotting than earned causality. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara absorbs the sculpture's music and begins "the work of redemption." The accumulative structure coheres well. However, the cost remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally felt, and the transformation lacks a decisive before/after that would elevate the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as Elias realizes the mountains wanted "recognition" not "restitution," transforming his exile into studentship with clear cost (loss of former life/status). The accumulative pattern of correlating magnetic pulses with chess moves builds effectively toward this reweighting of his situation.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elara building frequencies to unlock the diary, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where she discovers validation and a new calling. While the closure lands with her tears and shifted purpose, the cost remains primarily emotional without concrete stakes—we never learn why this specific diary matters or what Elara sacrifices to obtain it.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing closure where the corpse flower's true nature as "guardian" and "living library" reweights earlier material. However, the cost remains largely abstract—Elara gains knowledge without sacrificing anything concrete. The accumulative pattern holds but the revelation arrives through summary ("The plant's true nature became clear") rather than dramatized discovery, weakening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through Decisive Change when Arion discovers the arrow tip's true nature and gains knowledge to transform agriculture. The causal chain holds and orientation anchors are clear. However, the cost remains largely abstract - "knowing that Verdantis would thrive" lacks immediate, felt consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost - it ends with Elena settling in to review findings, promising tomorrow's understanding rather than delivering transformation now. The accumulative texture builds atmosphere effectively but never crystallizes into a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing that would satisfy closure requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure builds coherently toward the "sculpted hush" as a Resonant Reconfiguration that transforms collective perception. The closure lands with conceptual cost ("tears of joy flowed freely"), though the personal price to Eira remains oblique. The piece teaches its synesthetic pattern early and pays it off through the bell-ringing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Eldrin's shift from seeking control to understanding healing, with visible cost in his tears and months of exile. However, the accumulative structure depends too heavily on backstory blocks (~25%) that summarize rather than dramatize the guardianship failure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with Thomas's arrival triggering the empathy transfer that generates Elara's data, leading to a Conceptual Repricing where emotion becomes quantifiable algorithms. The cost is conceptual—human feeling reduced to equations—though the emotional price remains oblique. Minor deduction for the orientation taking until ~150 words to fully anchor the workshop setting and Elara's role.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres through the pendant's repeated "vibrating sympathetically" motif, building to Ayla's transformation. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as she shifts from delivering objects to awakening wonder, with visible cost in the "hollow space against her chest." The phrase "across the fade from memory to myth" attempts poetic compression but remains opaque, slightly weakening causality.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing (objects preserve complete memories, not just emotions) but the cost remains abstract. The revelation unfolds through passive observation of frost patterns rather than earned through struggle or choice. Orientation is clear but the accumulative build lacks sufficient density shifts to fully justify the revelatory ending.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres well: sounds vanish → bead pulses → journey through puzzle pieces → restoration of sound. The closure lands with visible cost ("The bead stopped glowing entirely, having given all its energy") and achieves resonant reconfiguration as "silence is not absence, but a different kind of presence." Orientation anchors (Elara, bamboo forest, forgotten orchard) establish clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkages from discovery to transformation to community recognition. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Orion's new purpose reweights his former meekness, with visible cost implied in trading "silence, time, and very essence." However, the cost remains somewhat abstract—we don't see what losing his "essence" actually means in practice, weakening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative structure builds texture through parallel world glimpses, creating a pattern of cyclical jumps that reweight the protagonist's fragmented identity. The closure achieves Charged Poise—standing before the mysterious door with determination burning—but the cost remains more conceptual than visceral, stated as "determination burned brighter" rather than showing what was sacrificed.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively through discovery of sea glass, letters, and stone stacks, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias joins the keeper tradition. Cost is visible in his acceptance of loneliness transformed into connection. The orientation is clear early, though the middle section's pacing could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost - it ends with Elara simply continuing her routine. The accumulative structure builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a meaningful change or reconfiguration. Who/where/when anchors are established, but the piece reads more like extended exposition than a story with pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Kaelen's discovery building through observation and experimentation to a Conceptual Repricing about narrative magnetism. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Kaelen's realization changes his understanding but doesn't foreclose options or exact a price. The orientation is clear but the piece reads more as extended reflection than scene with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Samuel's consciousness aligns with the trees' perspective, reweighting his understanding of sorrow from burden to resilience. The pin drop triggering the sextant's activation provides causal linkage. However, the transformation lacks visible cost—Samuel gains wisdom without sacrificing anything concrete, and the "mundane miracle" arrives too conveniently through coincidence rather than earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through repeated swaddling and song-weaving toward the final dawn-tapestry. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with communities awakening, though cost remains conceptual ("bound by responsibility yet released") rather than viscerally felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves Earned Stasis as Eleanor refuses the gathering with acknowledged cost, but the accumulative/textural lens lacks density shifts or pattern breaks that would reweight stakes. The closure lands conceptually but without felt pressure—Eleanor's "peace" arrives through reflection rather than dramatized friction that forces her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Eliza's absolution and her leaving bread for others, with visible cost in abandoning the tea house "one last time." The accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer toward meaning, though the critical letter's content arrives through summary rather than dramatization, weakening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure (discovering preservation is possible) qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost - Elias simply realizes he can save the vows without sacrifice or trade-off. The accumulative structure coheres but the "hope" at the end arrives without earned causality from his measurements.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain through Eliza's calculated deceptions to break the truce, with each false start building toward the final betrayal between Malachi and his lieutenant. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when she captures the "sound" in the watch fob, though the conceptual cost of destroyed trust could be more viscerally felt rather than observed.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the skeptic accepts their role as weather carrier, with visible cost (the ring dissolving into skin, inherited responsibility). The accumulative lens holds through sensory layering and pattern convergence. Deducting for slight orientation delay and some causality softness around the forest elections concept.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Rhodes returning to hidden work and reclaiming creativity, but the closure lacks visible cost—we're told he's "rectified" without seeing what he sacrifices or risks. The pattern of memory and artistic suppression accumulates but the final "homecoming" assertion replaces dramatized transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves Charged Poise—Elara stands ready to depart with map and fragment, options crystallized, cost implied but not yet paid on page. The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward this moment of readiness. However, the actual journey and Repository remain future tense, weakening immediate closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through the sculpture's creation and community adoption. Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's death triggering unprecedented colors, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on-page. The piece teaches its pattern of transformation through resonant light, yet the final "symphony of truth" lacks specific embodied consequence—we're told of transformation without witnessing its price.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Unit 734's fragmentation—a clear before/after with visible cost (original form slumps inert). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as magnetic shifts, rose wilting, and android fragmentation build toward the transformation. Minor causality wobble with the fears-as-fuel mechanism, but closure lands with undeniable sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the locket mystery gradually revealing community connections through collected stories. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Leo realizes the locket "belonged to everyone" and the letters heal the community—a genuine reweighting with social/emotional cost visible in families discovering lost connections. The pattern of dawn courtyard gatherings and storytelling accumulation holds consistently, though the resolution's emotional cost could be more viscerally rendered rather than summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story reaches a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara unlocks the laboratory's secrets, but the cost remains abstract ("what we hide can become our greatest power"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as she builds through dance sequences, yet the closure lacks tangible stakes—no clear path is foreclosed, no price visibly paid. The orientation anchors (sunken laboratory, Elara as code breaker) land clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara discovers the crystal archive containing her brother's memories, with visible emotional cost ("Tears filled Elara's eyes"). The accumulative structure builds coherently through ritual, investigation, and discovery, though the whale's connection to the gravity pockets could be more causally explicit. The closure lands with "nothing was ever truly lost, only transformed" earned through concrete discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through repetition ("quiet brook," "nocturnal haven," "terrestrially cosmic"). While it achieves Earned Stasis (the prophecy is hushed), the cost remains abstract—we never learn what the prophecy threatened or what the summoner sacrifices, making the closure feel weightless despite atmospheric density.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Clara inheriting the seal and understanding her heritage, with implied cost of generations of lost knowledge. However, the accumulative structure relies heavily on exposition rather than dramatized pressure, and the "agreed upon lies" element feels forced rather than integral to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly as Elara transforms isolation into independence by becoming the archive keeper, with visible cost in bearing "quarantined memories that were hers alone to bear." The accumulative structure builds through crystal resonance and memory surfacing, though the father's protective motive arrives somewhat conveniently without sufficient groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows a clear causal arc where the mysterious key enables Elias to find and amend his original forgery, achieving redemption through confession—a Decisive Change with visible cost (blood signature, ending isolation). The orientation anchors early and the lens remains causal throughout, though the key's sudden dissolution into light strains plausibility without setup.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration - the singer's melancholy transforms to "bittersweet melody of acceptance" with the child spirit's choice creating visible change. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral, and the accumulative pattern relies heavily on repetitive phrasing ("while the universe hummed its secret song" appears 5 times) that feels mechanical rather than purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost—Elara simply places the globe back after completing her task without transformation. The orientation anchors arrive late (wreck-diver and ghost whisperer roles unclear until told). The revelation about insurance fraud creates plot movement but Elara's own arc shows no meaningful change or price paid for her intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    This accumulative/textural piece achieves a Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist's philosophy crystallizes through pattern recognition, but the cost remains oblique—we see appreciation without visible sacrifice or foreclosed options. The piece teaches its meditative pattern early and maintains coherence, yet the "before/after" change lacks the decisive weight needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story reaches Charged Poise—Maya stands ready to act with crystallized options—but the cost remains abstract ("fate worse than liquidation") rather than felt on the page. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details about the stillpoint accumulate toward Maya's realization, though the closure lacks a decisive present-tense action that would strengthen the before/after shift.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost - Elias simply continues his work while events unfold below, creating Earned Stasis without meaningful foreclosure. The piece reads as extended exposition about his role rather than dramatized causality; no concrete before/after change occurs in his situation or stance. The accumulative lens could apply, but density doesn't meaningfully increase toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens builds through sensory captures toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where shared music bridges generational divides. The closure lands with visible transformation as "the room transformed into a chorus of shared memory," though the cost could be more explicitly embodied beyond the poet's contentment with poverty.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clear causal chain delivers a Decisive Change (ritual succeeds, intruders defeated) with visible cost (accepting family burden). However, the resolution feels mechanically convenient - the ritual works exactly as intended without complication, and "forever changed" is asserted rather than demonstrated through specific transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. The mapper continues their work as the sun rises, but nothing fundamentally changes—no path is foreclosed, no price is paid, no stance crystallizes under pressure. The piece reads as extended exposition about a revolution that will happen rather than dramatizing a pivotal moment within it. The orientation is clear but the entire narrative exists in a state of anticipation without reaching its promised transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Maya decides to expose corruption despite career risk, with the lantern linking historical and contemporary liberation. The cost is clear—her career jeopardy—though the immediate stakes of the investigation resolution feel somewhat abstract rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Father Michael's decision to leave the heart broken as testament to ongoing work, with visible cost in his retirement savings spent on the house. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details about the heart, the shop, and the priest's ministry cohere toward this final stance. The orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and causality tracks cleanly through the reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure (ringing the unheard bell) qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration but lacks visible cost - the achievement feels predetermined rather than won. The accumulative structure coheres but the "who/where/when" anchoring arrives late (floating workshop detail in line 2).

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages as Elara discovers each clue, but the closure lacks visible on-page cost - she downloads evidence and disappears, but we don't see what she sacrifices or loses. The ninety-second breach window creates urgency but the consequences remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with the crystal's reconstitution enabling navigation "with understanding rather than fear," showing clear cost through Elena's unconventional method. The accumulative lens holds as imagery builds toward the final transformation. However, the "weighted breath" repetition and some causality softness around how exactly the vintage mirrors enable reconstitution prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through repeated water/ice imagery and the parasol tip's evolving meaning, culminating in Elena's reconfiguration from death-seeker to life-embracer. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (abandoning her euthanasia plan), though the transformation occurs through abstract insights rather than dramatized pressure. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 3. The piece teaches its reflective pattern early and maintains coherence, but relies heavily on telling pivotal realizations ("understood that her loose grip on reality had been a gift") rather than showing them emerge through scene.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.2)
    No decisive change occurs—the sentinel ends exactly where he began, sitting in the pavilion with vague intentions about helping others. The story violates causality by looping through identical reflective beats without progression. Closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing about "spaces between people" but this realization lacks visible cost or foreclosed options. The piece reads as pure accumulation without the required density increase or pattern break.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost. The ritual completes successfully without transformation or price—"their task complete" arrives without earned change. Orientation anchors (who the line walker is, what the prophet represents) remain vague throughout, violating the 120-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration - the gathering proceeds exactly as planned with no complications or turns. Causality is weak: people simply arrive "drawn by rumors" without dramatized motivation. The ending states that "another piece of the great puzzle had been solved" but shows no actual transformation or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver meaningful closure with visible cost. The ending assertion that "the reticent scholar saw not an ending but a beginning" provides no decisive change or reconfiguration—the scholar continues exactly as before. The heavy repetition of key phrases creates loops rather than accumulation, and no concrete price is paid or path foreclosed at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands when the prophet finally hears and accepts the ephemeral "sound of growing older" before it fades—a moment of Charged Poise that crystallizes his lifelong search with visible emotional cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds as fog, driftwood markers, and chalk drawings build toward this sonic revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration - the cameras now capture previously invisible phenomena, with cost implied through "luminous ache" and "too profound to fully comprehend." The accumulative lens holds, though the transition from problem to solution could tighten. Who/where/when anchored clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the broken vinyl transforms from painful memory to "holy relic," with the son's acceptance marking the decisive change. The piece teaches its pattern early through sensory accumulation (lavender, cedar, music). Cost is visible in "first moments without him" and the son holding the fragment. Minor deduction for slightly abstract final lines about "ordinary magic."

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain (key unlocks knowledge → shadows revealed → new understanding) but the closure lacks visible cost—Elara gains knowledge and a doorway without sacrificing anything concrete. The "sealed awakenings" reveal happens through mechanical completion of loops rather than earned struggle. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Eleanor's acceptance of mystery over certainty, with visible cost in abandoning her scientific worldview. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and garden imagery build toward the final boundary dissolution. However, orientation anchors arrive late (the Wembley estate maze isn't clearly established until line 4), and the "substitute body" backstory creates initial confusion about what actually happened to Arthur.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure works - Elara's earthbound existence transforms from restriction to unique vantage point with visible cost (her abandoned space dreams). The accumulative structure coheres through the sea glass discovery and its transformation into "star maps." Minor deduction for slightly late orientation of the grotto's physical location relative to her workshop.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from wandering through reclaimed spaces to the final transformation of pendant into living moss. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the pendant's metamorphosis, with clear cost (surrendering grandmother's gift). The spiral pattern effectively links observation to healing methodology. Minor weakness: the months-later coda feels slightly mechanical in tying up the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page change or meaningful plot movement—the novelist stands at the nexus, reflects on his journey, and... continues standing there with newfound peace. No causal linkage drives the transformation; his epiphany arrives through abstract realization rather than dramatized event. The "final chapter" framing suggests closure but we witness neither the act of writing nor any concrete choice that alters his situation. Cost remains entirely conceptual without visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, building from discovery through research to communal restoration. The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands with communal transformation ("They had remembered who they were"). However, the personal cost to Elara remains abstract - we see effort but not sacrifice, limiting the closure's full impact under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres as the alchemist builds toward igniting the flash-paper, with clear closure when starlight is captured and hope restored. However, the transformation feels mechanically inevitable rather than costly—"the world could finally exhale" arrives without dramatized struggle or genuine risk of failure. The piece teaches its pattern but the stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through Elara's methodical mapping of light patterns, culminating in the timer's restoration. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when "echoes would remain" for future generations, with cost visible in the weeks of patient work. Causality holds as each discovery builds toward understanding the mechanism's true function. The orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the weaver's reframing of their trapped existence, with clear anchoring by ~120 words. The accumulative/textural lens holds as burdens literally calcify into geological forms. Yet the cost remains more conceptual than felt—we understand the weaver is "boundary-lessly trapped" but don't viscerally experience what they sacrifice or endure in this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently with density increase through layered memories and the kettle's temporal frame. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Clara's acceptance of simultaneous presence/absence, with visible cost in the "rust-hued peace." The orientation anchors clearly (loft, afternoon, Clara alone). Deduction for some causality softness in the middle sections where reflection dominates action.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through collected story fragments that physically manifest as a bridge. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the carousel restarts and "fractured stillness" transforms to "liquid peace," with clear cost in the camera wheel's sacrifice. The orientation anchors (lagoon, carousel, Cyrus) establish by ~80 words.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Maya discovering the sextant and restoring power, but the closure lacks visible cost - she simply succeeds without sacrifice or trade-off. The "equation for hope" resolution feels unearned as no actual equation or specific breakthrough is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Elias moves from defeat to renewed purpose, with the cost visible in his thirty years of abandonment. However, the bear's role disrupts causality—its appearance and "knowing look" feel imposed rather than earned. The accumulative texture builds effectively through crystal sounds and memories, but the magical realism element isn't sufficiently prepared.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or meaningful closure—Elara finds the journal exactly as planned, reads it, and decides to continue her grandfather's work without visible cost or foreclosed options. No causal pressure builds; she encounters no opposition or complication. The ending merely restates the opening premise ("dismantling lies") without transformation or earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the gift of knotted rope and revelation of the weavers' language, with visible cost in the grandfather's lost knowledge. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details build toward understanding. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. The closure lands but could benefit from sharper cost articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the traveler's decision to write his own obituary. This Resonant Reconfiguration lands with emotional cost visible in lines like "mapping territories of his heart he had avoided exploring since the palace had fallen." However, the cost remains primarily internal without external stakes, and the accumulation relies heavily on reflection rather than present-moment pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: prince attempts to restore beauty using the egg → device temporarily transforms the palace → transformation reverses → prince gains understanding and renewed determination. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (the failure and reversal of transformation). The lens reads as Causal with clear because/therefore linkages, though the final shift to determination could use stronger causality from the failure itself.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Maya's successful protection of the grafted roses, transforming destruction into preservation. The accumulative/textural lens holds as repeated images (black sand, foreign coin, grafts) build meaning toward the closure. However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—we see successful protection but limited price paid. The piece teaches its pattern of transformation symbols early and pays them off, though the emotional stakes could sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story delivers a clear Decisive Change (fountains restored, memories freed) with visible transformation cost under an Accumulative lens. The breadcrumb progression and stained glass box discovery create coherent escalation, though the magical resolution arrives somewhat mechanically through inherited keeper words rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story follows a mission-delivery-return structure but lacks a decisive change with visible cost. The civilization receives light, but we see no concrete transformation or price paid. The closure reads as another iteration in an endless cycle rather than a moment that forecloses options or crystallizes stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.2)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through butterfly migration and ribbon knotting patterns. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the completed monument transforms grief from individual to collective, with villagers experiencing "thundering calm before it." However, the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt—we see the transformation but not what Elias sacrifices to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure lands with Alaric's transformation and community restoration, but the inscriptions appear as deus ex machina guidance rather than earned discovery. The piece follows a predictable redemption arc where magical carvings provide exact philosophical instructions. Cost exists but feels declared rather than viscerally experienced through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the revelation of sacrificial love that reweights Elias's understanding. The closure lands as Conceptual Repricing when "sacrificial rather than romantic" transforms the meaning, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost. Elara simply completes her map as planned without transformation or price paid. The accumulative structure builds description but never crystallizes into a moment where options narrow or meaning shifts—she ends exactly where she began, just with ink on paper.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; it ends exactly where it began with the copyist continuing her broadcasts unchanged. The accumulative structure repeats information without building to a crystallized moment of cost or transformation. The "story famine" context arrives too late (line 22) to establish stakes early.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elena's artistic contemplation building toward acceptance of impermanence. The closure—understanding that safety lies in process not completion—qualifies as Conceptual Repricing but lacks visible cost beyond philosophical acceptance. The rocking chair's cessation bookends effectively but the middle accumulation feels static without clear pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost - it ends with Milo continuing what he's always done rather than making a choice that forecloses options. The accumulative texture builds through repeated mentions of sedimentary layers and preservation, but without a final reconfiguration that makes before/after legible. The orientation is clear but the promised "agonizing" never manifests as dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.2)
    The piece lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost - it ends with abstract summary ("legacy wasn't just in the notes") rather than a concrete scene showing transformation. The story operates in Accumulative mode but never crystallizes into a specific moment where Eleanor faces a choice or pays a price. The gift of the rosette happens in summary without dramatized weight.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the seed planting, but causality is weak—the celestial alignment provides convenient timing without earned consequence. The closure gesture (planting) carries symbolic weight but lacks visible cost beyond dirt on knees. No clear before/after transformation occurs; Elias ends essentially where he began, just having completed a predetermined action.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's truth-telling bridging "wonder and routine," with visible emotional cost in the supervisor's tears. However, causality weakens when the Bureau agents suddenly appear with perfect timing and the riddle, and the blackout's cause (supervisor's despair) feels retroactively explained rather than dramatized through prior clues.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Aria's ritualistic collecting building toward understanding, but the closure—her realization about love leaving traces—lacks visible cost or meaningful reconfiguration. The revelation doesn't alter her tactics or foreclose options; she simply continues her walks with new knowledge that doesn't change her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with effective closure through Conceptual Repricing—the diver gains "better questions" rather than answers, reweighting the value of uncertainty. The revelations cascade effectively through telepathic visions. Cost is primarily conceptual (abandoning academic certainty) rather than viscerally felt, and the diver's transformation lacks a decisive on-page choice that would elevate the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens but fails to deliver clear closure with visible cost. The return to the casino feels like convenient reset magic rather than earned transformation. The mathematical "rupture" mechanism is asserted without dramatized mechanics, and the final bet's stakes remain vague—we don't know what he's betting on or what he risks losing.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost - it ends with the painter planning tomorrow's work without any transformation or price paid. The accumulative texture builds atmosphere but never crystallizes into a moment where options narrow or stakes reconfigure. "Tomorrow night, she would begin anew" suggests infinite repetition without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density increase and pattern break (lens reveals dormant life, triggering thaw). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the bread/lens/baker combination reawakens cultural memory with visible cost (months of decline, lost daughter). The "spark igniting the long darkness" lands with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing as Esme unlocks the stone and reality shifts from "fixed construct" to "fluid potential." Cost is visible in the decades of preparation and her defiance of "warning chimes of sanity." The accumulative structure builds coherently toward this transformation, though the final shift could land with more visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing closure where fear's "greatest weakness—its misunderstanding of endings and beginnings" reframes the entire journey with visible transformation cost. The accumulative/textural lens holds as paradoxes layer toward the final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors clearly (carnival funhouse, post-resuscitation), though the middle section's abstract philosophizing slightly weakens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.2)
    No decisive change occurs on the page—the story presents a static portrait of routine without a closure unit. The accumulative lens could work but lacks the required density increase or pattern break that would create resonant reconfiguration. The ending merely restates the status quo ("obstacles into instruments once more") without visible cost or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal structure with clear closure - Kael's transformation from seeker to guardian constitutes a Decisive Change with visible cost (accepting eternal burden). The revelation sequence follows clean because/therefore logic. Slight weakness in the convenience of the shell cracking exactly when needed, though the pattern-language setup partially earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain holds adequately (letter leads to station, station reveals evidence, evidence confirms conspiracy), but the closure lacks dramatic cost - Eleanor simply collects evidence without facing opposition or paying a price. The discovery of the ledger arrives too conveniently. While the truth is "rescued," there's no on-page consequence or resistance that would create genuine closure tension.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the surveyor's final understanding of himself as "digger not of earth but of the spaces between moments." The cost—his solitary dedication to preserving others' dreams while questioning measurement itself—is felt but could be more viscerally dramatized. The accumulative structure coheres but lacks one sharp moment of crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing as Elias's understanding of his role shifts from indexer to "bridge between past and present," with the cost being his entire sense of identity and purpose. The accumulative structure works through discovery layers, though the final transformation feels somewhat declared rather than fully dramatized—"a new illumination had begun" tells rather than shows the weight of change.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres around dream-recording and grief transformation, with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure when releasing the lantern brings both ascension and grounding. However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral - "tears of relief and sorrow" and feeling "grounded" don't sufficiently dramatize what's lost or transformed, weakening the before/after legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story follows a Causal lens but lacks a true closure with visible cost—Elias successfully harvests potential and plans to continue, but nothing is lost or foreclosed. The piece reads as the opening chapter of a longer work rather than a complete arc, with the "transformation" being merely additive (gaining power) without sacrifice or genuine change.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands with Maya's recognition as "both the seeker and the missing piece," establishing clear before/after through accumulated cosmic patterns. Cost remains primarily conceptual—"millennia" of waiting—rather than viscerally felt through Maya's specific sacrifice. The accumulative structure coheres through star trail patterns building to frequency recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Martin discovers his grandfather's carving, reweighting his entire career of erasure. However, the cost feels more declared than visceral - we're told about tears and reconciliation but don't feel the weight of years lost. The accumulative lens holds but the final transformation happens too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the exchange of apology/forgiveness, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt—we don't see what either character sacrifices or risks. The causal chain from drawer pull exchange to emotional resolution feels mechanical; "synchronizing through moon phases" appears without establishing how it actually "creates openings in hardened hearts."

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elena's kayaking ritual serving as frame for reflection on her navigational fall from grace. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she reframes herself from "broken navigator" to "student of the sea again," though the cost feels more declared than dramatized—the rejection letter creates pressure but the resolution lacks visible price for this stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure attempts a time-loop revelation but lacks visible cost—the protagonist simply accepts becoming the time traveler without struggle or sacrifice. Causality breaks when the baseball appears with no explanation of how the loop began. The orientation anchors (underground lake, post-procedure state) arrive clearly but the "why" of this journey never coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building through ritual preparation to the conjuring climax, with clear closure as Eliora achieves connection but must accept its temporary nature. The cost is legible - she transforms herself irreversibly to bridge worlds briefly. The fortune cookie setup pays off thematically, and the phoenix-as-catalyst frames the possibility space well.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the cartomancer discovering "where lost time accumulates," but the closure relies on conceptual revelation ("lost time accumulates...in the present moment") without on-page cost. The ritual with cards and saucer creates atmosphere but doesn't force a choice that forecloses options with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the dimensional crossing. Closure lands with Eli crossing the threshold (Decisive Change), though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned observation builds to a conceptual repricing where the final butterfly emergence reweights her life’s aim. Orientation is crisp early; the closure lands as a quiet, resonant reconfiguration with a lightly felt price. The scene lacks a decisive turn, but density and motif reprise provide closure. Cost is implied rather than dramatized, keeping this below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative/textural dominance: the frost patterns accrete meaning, yielding a conceptual turn (minerals/smuggling link) and a decision to act. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when). Closure lands as Charged Poise—she leaves the canyon with a reconfigured mission—though on‑page cost remains conceptual. The single scene holds coherence and maintains a clean arc.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: she explores, observes heat patterns, and arrives at a conceptual reconfiguration—visible music as answer to silence. Orientation is clean early; one scene, single POV. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing image (case now “a vessel of possibility”), but the cost is soft and mostly retrospective. The path from intention to success lacks a resistive turn, keeping stakes cerebral.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain: package → coordinates → dive → library → assembly → beacon → role shift; the drive lens reads Causal. Closure lands with a Decisive Change to “keeper,” but the on‑page cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized. Middle beats (acquiring the sub, entering the library) proceed with little resistance, trading tension for momentum. Still, the final reconfiguration is coherent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    Situational lens with a clean on‑page decisive change: Mira’s news tightens pressure, prompting Elias’s dawn declaration to expand operations. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the bell motif coheres the structure. Cost remains conceptual (increased risk and scarcity) rather than embodied in a hard choice with immediate loss. Still, the before/after is legible and lands.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: breath intensifies image → realization → object dissolves → epilogue consequence. Orientation is clean from the outset; the two-shard structure (viaduct night, weeks later) is legible and coherent to closure. Closure lands as conceptual repricing with a felt, if soft, cost. A stronger on-page test or constraint would elevate the causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative lens holds: discovery → first rupture → obsession → return → activation → merger. Closure lands on the page with cost as she begins to disintegrate, a resonant reconfiguration that reweights her pursuit. Causality is coherent and prop‑driven (halo fragment + geometry), though some mid‑story learning is summarized rather than dramatized. The final convergence moment reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain: arrow → bench keys → vault → crew arrives early → escape with partial haul → later consequence. Closure lands with a cost (most seeds lost when the wall comes down), fitting a causal lens with a brief epilogue shard.

Orientation is anchored early; lens reads Accumulative/Textural and holds through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: images of melt, breath, heat, and reuse build to a quiet reconfiguration as he whispers “we thaw.” Closure lands on the page with a felt cost—the relinquishment of frozen grief via the finished globe and its placement. Orientation is clean and the sequence coheres; the causality is steady if understated. The turn is more cadence shift than plot pivot, but it reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single‑scene situational drive holds: hiding → decrypting → time tightening → approach of hunters → charged poise at the doors. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (she chooses vulnerability as tactic) with a credible cost implied in the imminent confrontation. Orientation is clean and the causal chain is legible, though the decrypt’s payoff remains deferred (mother’s location matters conceptually, not yet in action). Solid coherence; one deepening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens from star-flicker to star-vanish and reweights the stake as guidance over prevention. Orientation is clean early (oracle, tower, storm, last star), and the ending constitutes a clear conceptual repricing with cost. Causality is lyric rather than plotty, yet beats connect through purposeful returns (pebbles, booklet, hush). The closure image (glowing sketches of darkness) is on-page and charges the new path forward.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single‑scene accumulative build lands a Conceptual Repricing when the violin dissolves into light and the directives go silent. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and beats link coherently (object → contact/visions → performance → integration).

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: discovery → revelation → ethical decision → new practice. Closure lands via Earned Stasis/renunciation with a soft cost (foregoing power) and a reconfigured communicative tactic. Causality is simple and a bit convenient (hidden chamber, abundant lenses), but coherent. The cost at the end is felt conceptually more than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds via recurring acts (polishing/placing marbles) toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: he sets a final marble and affirms mystery over measurement. Orientation is clean and the closure lands conceptually, with cost implied in aging and in the refusal to submit to quantification. Escalation is subtle, hinging on the cereus bloom and impending visit rather than a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Structure is coherent and causal (lever 1–3), ending in a quiet conceptual repricing as she reframes the bird’s behavior and her calling. Orientation is clean; the scene holds one dominant stake. Cost at closure is minimal—proof is achieved without resistance—so the cadence shift lands softly. The chosen lens reads Hybrid with causal steps toward an accumulative, reflective finish.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece coherently builds from discovery to performance to apparition to dissolution. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the hush transforms from oppressive to peaceful as the code is “played,” with the program’s loss as cost. Orientation is clean from the first sentence; cause‑felt linkages (find → interpret → play → dissolve) hold. The cost is present but understated, keeping it shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of margins, smudges, and coordinates coheres into a Charged Poise closure as he steps into the cold. Orientation is clean early; causality is consistent with world rules. The cost is present but muted (illness residue, sorrow weight), and the ending is a poised launch rather than a decisive turn. Nonetheless, the escalation from discovery to departure lands.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure holds as a single-scene accumulative build: tunnel → object → radio confession → vision → repricing of the “ghost shift.” Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with the final image (cooling wheel, dawn) signaling a before/after in stance. Costs remain largely conceptual, softening impact. Orientation is clean from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the anomaly’s stillness prompts a tactical choice (origami portal) leading to a preserved bubble and a return that reweights meaning. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: the keeper refuses absorption and inscribes a symbol, carrying the cost as a secret. Orientation is clean and the sequence holds causally. The cost is quiet rather than sharp, but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is crisp and the causal line is clean: plan the eclipse → create a shared ritual → Lila speaks. The closure is a decisive change on the page with a felt cost in its fragility (“might close again”). The accumulative atmospheric build tightens under a live clock to the cadence shift at totality. No dropped setups or teleporting information.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the tapestry → diaries → cosmic link accrues toward a quiet Charged Poise ending. Orientation is clean (odd historian, reclaimed silo library, single POV) and the throughline remains coherent. Closure lands as endurance/charged purpose rather than a decisive turn, with the cost implied (post-dream isolation), not dramatized. The reveal of dragons maintaining the axis is a conceptual reweighting rather than a plot change.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.9)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: patterning of fortunes → distribution → dawn delivery → response letters yields a quiet RR/CR closure. Orientation is sound from the outset (lighthouse, restaurant, bay). However, the closure’s cost is faint—no decisive narrowing of options or sacrifice on the page. The causal chain stays mostly declarative and reflective rather than enacted under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    Hybrid drive with causal dominance: each step (loops → paradox question → painted symbols strengthening the anchor → strategic silence) produces the next. Orientation is solid from the first lines, and the closure is an on‑page Decisive Change (entity dissolves; anchor settles). The visible cost is light—success comes without a clear price beyond exertion and risk—tempering the ceiling. Still, the chain of cause→effect is clean and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates via layered images and sensory motifs toward a charged crescendo. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the closing Earned Stasis/Charged Poise lands with on‑page cost (collapse into the chair). The nautilus and dawn’s light serve as throughlines that tighten cadence and pressure. The closure feels inevitable within the lyric pattern rather than causally twisty.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Structure is clean: a single scene with one transition into the fractures and a return; causality from rain + eclipse + tablet is consistent. The drive lens reads as Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant at the end, culminating in a conceptual reweighting (acceptance). Closure is present but the cost is modest and largely internal. Orientation is stable from the opening and the eclipse clock coherently pressures the sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: discovery → experimentation → communal teaching coheres to a resonant reconfiguration at the end. Closure lands in the final image of her teaching with the backward record and “filament of hush” binding the group—a before/after is legible. Causality is clean (needle → reverse play → felt hush → instruments → students), though costs remain largely conceptual. Orientation is clear from the outset (who/where/when) and held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is crisp early (courtyard at dusk; surveillance threat), and a Causal/Situational drive holds: find tube → verify conspiracy → choose to broadcast. Closure lands with the released pigeon (Charged Poise toward Decisive Change), though the on‑page cost is largely conceptual. The beats connect cleanly without teleports or resets. One scene coherence is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is steady: layered scent revelations and the orchid’s timed bloom deepen pressure. Orientation and timeline are clean; the midnight chime and orchid transformation provide a defined cadence shift. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he embraces grief’s cohabitation with love and reopens his life with cost acknowledged. The causal chain is modest but coherent and paid off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the rope‑mandala densifies until the closing realization reframes time as landscape (Conceptual Repricing). Orientation is crisp early (poet, grotto, starlight, energy beings’ altered sky). Closure lands, though the cost is more intellectual than felt. The structure is coherent but lacks a sharper on‑page price.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the piece builds ritual and sensory pattern until a cadence shift at the bonfire performance. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the “chronic hush” is reframed as latent music, with a felt emotional cost of loss. Orientation is clean; props and space are consistent. The cost is soft (no hard trade‑off), but the final image holds.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece builds processual density toward a quiet closure as he completes the transformation and leaves with “genuine fulfillment.” Orientation is clean and the pattern holds, but escalation is minimal and the closure’s cost is more conceptual than felt. The final image reweights the premise (authentic fulfillment via counterfeit feelings), yet the price (erasing “last remnants” of the client’s state) is not dramatized as a true loss.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative lens holds: mistaken envelope → meeting → coffee → sponsorship → digitized archive → cyclical reprise with the locket. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise (the locket now housing three photos and an open slot), though the cost is mostly conceptual. Orientation is clean despite mosaic time jumps. The causal line is coherent if gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Causal. Proposal → group forms → search tactics → discovery → reinterpretation → dedication lands a clean RR/CR closure. Cost is present but soft (treacherous terrain, exhaustion, vulnerability) and could be sharpened. Orientation is strong from the outset; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Strong causal chain: disturbance → time‑sculpting investigation → crystalline map → tower → cage → sacrifice/shatter → restored cadence. Orientation is immediate and steady; the giant’s nap functions as a ticking clock that tightens options. Closure is decisive and on‑page with cost (collapse, life shaved off). The causal lens holds cleanly through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The ritual’s density builds—eyes awaken, time slows, mosaic rearranges, a fleeting mentor image—culminating in a resonant reconfiguration (a new configuration and path) with conceptual cost (hope as risk; loss persists). Orientation is solid throughout. The closure lands quietly but cleanly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the pattern of clandestine routines intensifies until the tape fragment reframes the mission, culminating in a Charged Poise—planning an indirect reveal. Orientation is solid early (crawl space under the library, pre‑dawn outage), and beats track cleanly from find → recognition → plan. Closure lands as a stance crystallization with conceptual cost (visibility vs. concealment), though the price remains implied rather than tested on the page. The causal thread (fragment contains schematics that could fix the failure) is convincing but lightly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning causal: storms → anomalous leaf → failed controls → decisive release; the chain reads cleanly. Closure lands on-page with cost (“destruction in some areas”) and a reweighted stance. Time jumps (“weeks passed”) compress but don’t undermine coherence at this length. Orientation is strong from the outset and the throughline holds.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the discovery → offer → hesitation → exchange forms a clean tightening with an on‑page price. The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: insomnia yields to purpose, the brooch recontextualized at the center of her studio. A brief time‑jump (“visitors eventually came”) stays coherent and supports the final image. Stakes and causality remain legible without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates through density and pattern shift: overlapping shadows → inhabitation → harmony change → role redefinition. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: from foreseeing to co-creating, with a clear before/after. Cost is present but soft (loss of clairvoyant certainty), yet legible in the reweighted stance. Orientation is clean and the one-scene arc maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece layers visions and objects toward a reweighting: the herald’s sacrifice reframes exile and return. Orientation is clean from the opening (“ivory harbor after rain”) and the recurring valve coheres causally. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the community’s stance shifts from anger to sorrow to peace, and the valve’s final placement charges the ending. The cost is emotional and communal rather than decisional but is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, motifs (cracks/arrows, vault, ticket punch) escalate toward a Charged Poise closure: he accepts an ongoing quest as the vault flickers. Orientation is clean early (Ethan in tunnels, abandoned rail lines), and cause-effect threads hold (object → doorway → vault → fortress → translation → decision). Cost is present but conceptual rather than visceral (integration with hand, foregone full exploration). The structure is coherent single-scene with one cadence shift when time runs out.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean early (tower, whales, tile), and the piece coheres as discovery → attunement → shared sanctuary. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: Elara opens the tower, reweighting solitude into communal memory. The cost is soft (risking skepticism, surrendering solitude) and largely implied rather than dramatized, limiting the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orientation and causal flow are clear, and the closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a concrete step (portal) and abandonment of the sanctuary. However, much of the pressure is told rather than dramatized; the mutiny remains largely observed. The cost is implied more than felt, keeping the decisive change modest. Lens: causal with a CR ending holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a Causal lens, each step (“waiting actively” → guard’s break → key → safe → seal → stamping) coheres cleanly to a decisive outcome. Closure lands with the forms completed and the return of the ink pot, with cost (risk of job/charges) made explicit. The plan proceeds with minimal complication, but the tightening is sufficient for this length. No orientation debt; props and information pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the approach of dawn tightens to the hum’s refracted moment, then resolves in a charged ritual (notations, gold leaf). Closure reads as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—he recommits to the duty with a felt cost of solitude and restraint. Orientation is clean and the single cadence shift is legible. Cost is present but subdued, keeping it short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens is taught early (palimpsest, tides, containers) and held through to a Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is clean, and the ending reweights the premise: identity as lived exchange vs. paperwork. Cost is legible—ongoing erasure and solitude accepted as the price of the chosen path. The structure lacks a sharp mid-scene turn but achieves a meaningful cadence shift toward an earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is solid from the stormy approach through the observatory interior, and object returns (seashell/cello) provide a coherent build toward the realization. The sequence—play → memories → debate → synthesis—reads as a purposeful density increase culminating in the reweighted premise. Cost is understated, landing more as a stance shift than a sacrifice, keeping this short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal hybrid leaning causal—discovering the code therefore reorganizing tactics therefore swaying terms; closure lands with the posted notice and Maya’s symbolic renunciation. Orientation is immediate (Neptunia, carnival, corporate emissaries), and the throughline holds. Several key developments occur offstage or in summary, slightly diluting on-page pressure, but the Decisive Change plus resonant final act is legible. Cost is present (sleeplessness, risk, anonymity, relinquishing the stone), if modestly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the live clock (dawn) and the dissolving grain build toward a clean Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she gets the images as the creatures vanish. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and set‑ups (timing device, vantage, extinction stakes) pay off on the page. Cost is legible in the final beat as beauty disappears and the mining team’s arrival reframes the scene. The linearity is intentional and coherent, if a touch predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation is immediate (depot at dawn; blind repairman; drone arrives), and the causal spine holds: diagnose → patch → confirmation text → ship departs. Closure lands with a modest cost via time pressure and effort, yielding a quiet RR/causal finish. The ticking clock (maiden voyage) could tighten further on the page. No teleports or rule breaks; scope fits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure holds as a single‑POV arc with a clean before/after: outpost investigation → journey → discovery → report. The closure is a conceptual repricing charged by the final condensation image and the decision to compile proof. Causal links exist (falcon → coordinates → trek), though pressure is gentle and largely uncontested. Orientation is strong early; the hybrid causal/textural lens stays coherent through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clear: step-strike cycles progressively restore the town, culminating in the sustained final chord. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/what/why) and the single-scene structure is coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with town-wide response, though the cost is largely time and focus rather than a sharpened sacrifice. No unkept setups or causality leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant causal chain is clean: vial fit → door opens → capture → escape; the oxygen clock supplies persistent constraint. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (she secures the temporal vial) with cost legible in the alarm and ascension pain. Some convenience (perfectly shaped depression, swift deciphering) smooths friction and slightly lowers felt risk. Lens: Causal, held through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: repeated motifs accrue toward a Charged Poise closure (“found his voice… to whisper the truth”). Orientation is secure early (lighthouse prison; son of the boy who cried wolf). The closure costs are implied (urgency “before they find the bodies,” forfeiting the father’s script) rather than dramatized. Coherence holds, but the felt price at the end is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is immediate and the accumulative/casual chain is clean: midnight alignment → bead pulses → embodiment strengthens → she chooses the seeds → bead crumbles → bloom appears. Closure lands on the page with cost as the bead disintegrates and she fades, repaid debt achieved. No causality breaks or teleports; the greenhouse’s binding constraint persists through the end. The brief epilogue with the groundskeeper consolidates consequences without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the labyrinth blooms and reweights the sacred space with social consequence (village pilgrimage) and personal cost (fatigue). Orientation is clean from the outset (wharf weaver, harbor, canyon), and the recurring plate→sleepwalk→sewing pattern tightens into the luminous finale. The causal chain is soft but coherent for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the pattern of discovery and assembly coheres, culminating in the sundial’s first new shadow and Kaelen’s aligned inner shift (a resonant reconfiguration). Orientation is clean from the outset and the artifact’s progression provides a gentle, legible tightening. The cost is primarily emotional and devotional rather than contested, but it’s visible in labor, offerings, and the relinquishment of exile-identity. Closure lands clearly, if quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds through ritual detail to a reweighting at the letter drop. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing of her work’s purpose, with a gentle cadence shift. The noon deadline and chalk message add coherence but generate little causal tightening. Cost is implied rather than distinctly on the page, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under a primarily Causal lens, beats track: perceived anomaly → recognition of conspiracy → tactical plan embedded in the chart → outcome forecast. Orientation is clean early (observatory, season, role), and the internal logic of coded delay tactics holds. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration (quiet sabotage over heroics), but the cost at the end is conceptual rather than felt. Several pivotal moves (disruptions) are summarized rather than dramatized, reducing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure mounts via condensation messages (apology → images → confession). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a felt cost in relinquishing the demand for a fuller explanation, culminating in “I forgive.” Orientation is solid early; causality is coherent. The cost is present but soft, keeping it just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: detail density builds from coral to smudged lines to the whispered promise, landing in a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is firm early (hospital atrium at twilight; Kaelen and Lina). The cost is conceptual/emotional—accepting reconfigured presence in loss—which is legible on the page. A clean single-scene cadence shift occurs in the final placement of the coral.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the because/therefore chain (find fragment → light‑develop → exhibition → communal response) coheres and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration. Cost is light and mostly conceptual (labor, skepticism), but a before/after is legible. The montage spans several beats—more than one transition—yet remains clear and purposefully cumulative. The final image reweights the premise without a decisive act, which suits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the nickel’s sonic reflections prompt sequential “awakenings” that deepen perception and culminate in a Conceptual Repricing (“art as frozen music”). Orientation is clean from the first paragraph and the closure lands on the page when she replaces the nickel and reframes her practice. Causality is lyric rather than mechanical, but the pattern is taught and paid off. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, yet present in her renunciation of prior certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: tactic layers (linguistic, horticultural, entomological) build toward a charged poise in the greenhouse. Orientation is clear early and the closure image (“pure, untaxed thought” before tomorrow’s signal) lands with conceptual cost. However, escalation occurs largely in summary (“authorities began taxing dreams...”), not through a present-tense turn with consequences. Closure holds, but the tightening is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: postcard → lullabies → blossoms → defense against darkness → legacy. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the poet dies and the shell “keeps singing,” with the postcard pinned overhead—cost is legible. Orientation is clean from the first line. A single deepening turn (darkness threatens; the poet sings louder) tightens stakes without breaking the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a light causal spine—finds crack → restoration ritual → return and chorus. Orientation is clean early (opal library, deserted marvels, single POV); closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the names sound again with a felt cost (the acknowledged inevitability of fading). The phonograph/light procedure fulfills the setup and pays off on-page. Quiet but coherent arc.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from archival labor to a breakthrough and a charged walk to the chamber. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she steps toward confrontation before treaties, with a visible potential cost (reputation, failure at the brink). The structure is clean and anchored early; causality is simple but intact. The absence of an on‑page decision by the leaders keeps the close quiet rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing as she commits to the seasonal-lake design and leaves a future-facing “encrypted compassion” note. Orientation is strong early; the adhesive discovery and inscription accumulate meaning. The decisive change is intellectual and preparatory rather than contested on the page, with limited cost. Still, the before/after—uncertain search to resolved plan—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, patterned images (dust, trails, skylight, meteorite) build toward a clear on‑page turn: the written invitation and ceremonial release. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the throughline holds. Closure functions as a Decisive Change with a Resonant Reconfiguration; the price—a return to vulnerability after past winters—reads but is implied more than tested. The seventh‑Thursday timestamp tightens the structure effectively without breaking the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is quick and coherent (Elara, prism terrace, post‑“butterfly effect”), and the patterning of thresholds, logbook, and wood grain densifies to a cadence shift. Closure lands via a charged crossing (RR/CR) when “Home” appears and she steps through to her father. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized, but it’s legible through the long liminal wandering it forecloses.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: discoveries stack toward a conceptual repricing at sunrise. Orientation is strong and the closure lands via the feather’s transformation/map and reweighted cosmology. Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than a felt, narrowing constraint. The throughline holds, but escalation remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: images and motifs (crater glass, seeds, cheerful gloom) build toward a Conceptual Repricing—disappearance as metamorphosis. Orientation is solid from the start, and the closure is legible on the page. Causal tightening is light; the bird’s seeds function as a gentle hinge rather than a pressurized turn. Cost is conceptual rather than felt, keeping the ceiling moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orientation is crisp (who/where/when) and the single-scene structure holds. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece tightens via the selection → approach → music cue → handoff sequence. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: Leo relinquishes the bishop and confirms his mission’s success through the woman’s reaction. The cost is modest but legible; escalation remains gentle rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of cosmic/memory imagery intensifies toward the anchoring and inscription. Closure lands on the page with cost—anchoring as decisive change and earned stasis—and the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is clean (who/where/when) and causality is coherent (speck → aperture → anchoring → inscription → dissolution). The throughline is tight for this length, with one meaningful deepening rather than multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is clean from the outset and the accumulative/textural lens holds: dawn routine → prism draw → pond‑reading → resolve. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise (she reframes purpose and returns to work), but the on‑page cost is soft. The scene’s progression is coherent and singular, with one meaningful cadence shift at the pond. Crisp, if low‑pressure, structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene accumulative design holds: ridge ascent → handling the box → reframing its meaning. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: the box shifts from failure to companion, foreclosing his prior self‑accusation. Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks. The cost—living with scars and relinquishing salvational heroism—is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the density builds (constructing, wiring, gauge activity) to a resonant reconfiguration when the needle points at Elian and then outward. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: possibility is subtly reordered and charged. Cost is implied (“next steps would require courage”), not concretely paid on the page, keeping it just shy of top tier. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.7)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: discovery → diaries → film development → conceptual shift. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and pledge to continue Thorne’s work, but the cost is mostly conceptual, not concretely paid on the page. Orientation is solid, and the two-shard transition to the lab is clean. Escalation is coherent, if soft.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, culminating in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis at the bell’s fade. Orientation is clean early (who, where, morning timing), and the bell‑clock provides a crisp structural hinge. Closure lands on the page: she achieves the reveal then relinquishes the connection with a felt cost. Escalation is more density/cadence shift than causal turn, but it coheres and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: after signing, Elian reconceives peace as daily practice and leaves the clipboard as a charged witness, with cost articulated (a lifetime of solitude/compromise, visible cracks in the alliance). Orientation is clean and the single-scene arc coheres, though pivotal beats (the actual negotiation turns) are elided into summary rather than shown. The ending’s cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the walk → placement → rain cadence shift lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a felt cost (relinquishing his “most prized possession” knowing it won’t hatch). Orientation is clean from the first lines, and the pattern builds toward a coherent final image. Coincidence (rain) complicates rather than resolves, fitting the lens. Stakes remain narrow but cohesive, with the closure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the patterned ritual escalates to a closure beat: the final thread unbinds and she enters the sanctuary. The before/after is legible (bounded by fate vs. integrated freedom), but the on‑page cost is mostly conceptual rather than felt. Orientation is clean early; motif teaching (“between sigh and smile,” winter meridian) pays off at closure. A stronger price—loss or foreclosed path shown in the scene—would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: dome prep → bar performance → dawn reflection. Closure lands as a quiet reconfiguration (renewed stance), with cost implied via the mentor break and controversy. Causality is clean, but turns are mild and mainly conceptual. No orientation debt; anchors are clear early.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → ritual construction → charged release as the monarch departs. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (charged poise): “We see you” plus the wing‑beacon and the heartbeat’s brief harmony against inevitable dissolution. Orientation is swift and clean; cost is on‑page (signals will dissolve; Aris must depart). The throughline is cohesive without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: card → braid reconfiguration → illumination → names appear → choice to remain. Orientation is immediate (icebound sanctum, single POV, present-time descent), and the closure lands on the page with a felt cost (self-exile as keeper). The Hybrid lens tilts Causal at the end, and no steps violate established rules. Slight ease-of-success lowers pressure, but closure still reads decisive and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: storm pressure, ritual, and dream‑logic build to a cadence shift where she attains a “trinity of perception.” Orientation is clean early (bunker, forest, storm), and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act. Cost is implied (half her life consumed), but the ending’s on‑page cost is light. The pattern holds and pays off, though stakes remain mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: ritual preparation → activation → covenant marks → dawn/arrival creates a coherent build. Closure lands on‑page as a decisive change (the glowing symbols) with a charged poise against Nebuchadnezzar’s approach. Causality is intact and clean within one scene; equinox timing and approaching army compress the window. The cost is present but soft, more conceptual/social than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hybrid causal/accumulative structure holds: Elara intervenes → tactile “listening” → ancestral visions → repaired pin → brother’s appearance → reconciliatory image. Closure lands with a Decisive Change and charged final image, though the cost is more stated than dramatized. Orientation is clean and the pattern of reappearing objects coheres with the sanctuary’s rules. The brother’s sudden manifestation leans on world logic, bordering on convenience but within established premise.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, with closure as a resonant reconfiguration—the sextant becomes a navigator and he renounces capture. Orientation is clear early (workshop, orchard, twilight), and the pattern (breath/process → transformation → vision) holds. The cost is conceptual (relinquishing capture and taking on a new purpose), felt but subtle rather than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is crisp early (abandoned cathedral with orchard; mender with a quartz eye). The closure lands through a resonant reconfiguration: footprints/vanished ribbon/left seed reweight her project with real stakes, and her watering with tears shows cost. The turns are quiet and off‑stage, but the because/therefore chain of her actions → bloom → seed sustains coherence under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; the pattern of orchard→bathroom→research chamber intensifies until the resonance surge and reconfiguration of meaning. Closure reads as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: he embraces stepping beyond temporal boundaries as monitors confirm activation. Orientation is clean early (who, where, what), and causality holds at this scale. Cost is implied (“risk everything,” mind not meant to perceive all), but the price is not concretely dramatized at the end, tempering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clean causal chain: diary → negotiation → access → extraction → reconfiguration. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing (gaps as doors; lessons as prisons; Elara’s renewed vow), though the cost is more conceptual than felt. Orientation is early and strong; the single POV and one-scene flow hold. The lightness of on-page consequence keeps it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates coherently from deck to ballroom to greenhouse, culminating in the tree and memory flood. Orientation is solid early (who/where/why), and the emerald card functions as a clear throughline. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: she accepts the role and its cost as the card dissolves into her palm. The cost is present but more thematic than materially pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear causal chain: discovery → verification → braid reconfiguration → merge with Croft. Orientation is solid and the single-scene window holds. Closure lands with a Decisive Change, but the price is underplayed—warnings are cited yet no cost is felt at the moment of merging. The causal lens holds, but the absence of on‑page consequence limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.5)
    Structure is coherent: disturbance → investigation in the Ice Sanctum → conjuring in the convergence center → reconfiguration and aftermath. The causal chain holds under a Hybrid/Accumulative lens, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration as beings harmonize. However, escalation reads smoothed; obstacles never threaten failure and the cost at closure is soft. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/what) with one steady drive.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid lens (accumulative texture with a causal peak) holds: daily star‑work accumulates until the decisive alignment rekindles the beacon. Orientation is clean and the ending lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual repricing of “coincidence.” Cost is present but soft—“would not last forever” is more elegiac than exacting. Still, the before/after is legible and earned by prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the piece tightens through a cadence shift from observatory to forecourt to vow, landing in a charged poise as he commits to remain and write. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when); the rule‑set (crystals whisper post‑rain, solidified fog) holds consistently. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration—his purpose crystallizes and he accepts the cost of staying; cost is modest but legible. The lack of a sharper external turn keeps this below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece moves cleanly from approach → discovery of the coded mosaic → tower performance → reweighted final image, with a legible Resonant Reconfiguration (the fortress and mood transformed). Orientation is strong early; causality is intact. The cost at closure is soft (personal risk, expended craft), and escalation favors lyric intensification over blocked options.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the pause densifies into a Conceptual Repricing where funding scarcity reweights her method. Orientation is clean from the start, and the closure lands in her renewed stance and the cicada‑charged final image. The cost remains conceptual (embracing uncertainty and constraint), not dramatized through a concrete loss, which keeps it just shy of the highest band. Still, the because/therefore texture of reflective beats coheres to a meaningful end.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds via patterned silences, time window, and ascent culminating in a cadence shift at the trellis. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she captures the gilded hush and returns with a reweighted relationship to “below,” with the cost of leaving the hush felt. Orientation is clean early (bunker, anomaly, plan), and set‑ups (vessel, training) pay off. Escalation is smooth rather than hard‑turn causal, but coherent and purposeful for the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Charged Poise/Earned Stasis as he recommits at the next whistle with awareness that “all peace is temporary.” Who/where/when are anchored early, and the arc coheres as he initiates, sustains, and re‑primes the healing soundscape. The cost is conceptual and light rather than dramatized; still, the cadence shift with dark clouds and renewed readiness lands. No causality breaks, but pressure remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain: gem → waterfall → orchard → layered murals → map → tree → descent → throne activation. Orientation is clean early; the clock tightens the sequence. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she activates the throne for another, not herself. The cost is modest, and the elevator reveal edges toward convenience but remains set up by the tree recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: recurring images (ash, threshold, ring) densify until the decisive act (three knocks/step through) reconfigures options with cost. Causality holds cleanly: pulse → decision → ritual → door → student, with the sanctuary and fading threshold providing stakes. Closure lands on the page; the cost—abandoning isolation and risking pain—reads. Orientation is clear from the opening and supports the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clean causal chain: glitchy texts → descent → discovery → activation → diamonds. Closure lands on the page (Decisive Change), but the cost at the climax is light and obstacles resolve smoothly. Orientation is solid early, and the single‑scene flow holds. Coincidental guidance (texts) drives the plot but is established enough not to break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain: tuning the gramophone produces resonance, which triggers the ceiling glow and opens the hidden compartment, delivering decisive knowledge. Orientation is crisp from the start (who/where/when are clear), and the single‑scene structure holds. Closure lands as a Decisive Change (truth obtained), but the cost is deferred and mostly conceptual; tomorrow’s council is off‑page. The drive lens reads primarily causal with light accumulative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: study → ritual → unsnapping → vision → repriced self. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/incipient vow, with an implied cost (burden of knowledge, duty shift) rather than a concrete loss. Orientation is clean early; no causality breaks. The cost could be sharpened at the ending image to edge higher.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence—button → dust patterns → file/photo → months-later reunion—holds clean causal coherence. Orientation is clear early; the two-shard structure pays off in a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive act. Closure lands with conceptual and emotional cost (shared loneliness reweighted by connection). Escalation is gentle but sufficient for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. Stakes and anchors are clear quickly; the sequence (patrol escalation → puddle map → lagoon access via key → transfer under alarms → escape) tracks cleanly. Closure lands on the page: the archive is liberated/transferred as alarms close in, a Decisive Change with a conceptual cost (exposure, pursuit). The cost could be sharper on the page, but the chain of “because/therefore” holds without contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: a performance builds toward a cadence break where silence cancels the prophecy. Orientation is clean and the closure is on‑page (the stillness after the final note). Cost is conceptual/emotional rather than material but legible. Causality is simple yet coherent: prophecy → inverse performance → hush.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the speck’s arrival tightens focus, enabling the decode and culminating in the warning and placed monument. Orientation is clean; single-scene containment holds. Closure lands as a quiet resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn, with only a light cost implied. The because/therefore chain is modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative dominance: discovery → following → descent → chamber → reconfiguration lands cleanly. Closure functions as a conceptual repricing: harmony with uncertainty replaces precision as the governing aim. Causality holds, but the price of change is soft—risk in the descent is briskly handled and the vocational cost is largely asserted. Orientation is strong from the outset and stays stable across the greenhouse-to-cavern transition.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal flow: failed search → acceptance → plan → forging → new coin → reframed purpose. Closure lands as a Decisive Change/Earned Stasis hybrid; he forecloses the path of recovering the original by creating his own and accepting loss. Cost is present but light—the centuries‑old stakes are reweighted rather than confronted. Orientation is immediate and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds: harp distortion → tooth amplification → trail → cave → confession → laughter → release. Orientation is clean from the first lines; props introduced early are paid off. Closure lands on the page with Thomas’s dissolution—Decisive Change—with a conceptual price (Elias shoulders the ache/legacy). The cost is more tender than harrowing, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres as sensory density and charged objects converge on a CR: mercy reframed as function/time and intention. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the strap activation in UV light is a taught setup with payoff. Cost is legible on the page through bodily re‑entry into trauma and endurance as tactic. A touch of explicitness in the thesis slightly softens the reconfiguration’s mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: patterning through the fragment, market, and painting densifies toward the final unfastening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with histories “flooding” into the present, though the on‑page cost is implied duty rather than felt loss. Orientation is clean and the two‑shard structure (childhood → present) coheres. The final act is earned by prior signals, but the lack of friction keeps it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is strong early, and the scene holds a clear because/therefore chain to the timed silence and engagement. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he uses the device to bridge and accept his role. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, softening impact. Still, the structural tightening around 4:17 functions cleanly under a mostly causal/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the density of motifs (frost, press, vial, rustling pages) crescendos to the implosive rupture and a Charged Poise/RR closure. Orientation is clean from the opening and the sequence escalates coherently. The cost is explicit (“perfect system…could no longer contain infinity”) and the before/after is legible. Minor softening: post‑rupture agency becomes observational, but the reconfiguration still pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the temporal storm, the mirror‑covering, and the act of composition build to a Conceptual Repricing: history becomes a reimagined, plural construct. Orientation is clear early (Chronos, shard, storm-night), and the flow is one scene into dawn with a legible before/after. Cost is conceptual and social rather than dramatized harm, but the on‑page handoff and astonished reception ground the change. A single deepening—not a turn—delivers enough closure for the form.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when), and the ticking clock structures escalation cleanly toward a decisive change at midnight. Causality holds: hum → resonance → stone blazes → rust recoils → city-wide restoration. The key soft spot is the low cost and the expository leap about the rust’s origin, which sidesteps a harder on-page test.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the three “hinged awakenings” deepen pressure coherently toward a Conceptual Repricing: the compass guides to a state, not a place. Orientation and causality are clean (auctioned compass → cliffs access → crevice → lagoon → awakenings → study reprise). The closure lands on the page, though the cost is more conceptual than felt. The two‑shard structure (cave, then study) resolves cleanly to a single reweighted meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when), and the structure coheres as a single continuous scene that deepens through the slide’s visions. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: a “deeper navigation system” supplants technological reliance; cost is light but legible as a reweighted stance and a leaving-behind of the familiar. Escalation is primarily density of image rather than causal narrowing, which fits the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure holds cleanly: studio obsession → triggering postcard → cathedral examination → realization → return with a new plan. The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, culminating in a conceptual repricing where environment transforms light and meaning. Closure lands on the page with a reweighted premise and a clear before/after in her artistic approach. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized, keeping this strong but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative end: letters → diaries → seventh volume retrocognition → lagoon parley → answers → publication. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: she reframes the diaries as an intergenerational bridge and acts on it (publication), with the lagoon exchange as the pivotal turn. Costs are implied (psychic toll, entrapment) more than dramatized at the close, softening the landing. Orientation is clean and pattern is taught early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: reflection → conception → public action. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing and nascent earned stasis: he rejects the wish‑built comfort and commits to the harder communal path by posting notices and stepping into leadership. Cost is implied rather than dramatized, but the before/after is legible. Orientation is clean from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Causal—immersion → prophecy → decision. Orientation is clear early (orchard atop skyscraper, foghorn silence, archives) and held. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: he redefines his task with a felt cost (burden and impending fall). The cost is conceptual more than enacted, but present in the final image’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single‑scene accumulative build is coherent: ordering by dormancy → spiral completion → vortex manifestation → repriced final image. Orientation is crisp by sentence two (who/where/what she’s doing), and the lens holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (mortality reframed through contact with time). A slight explanatory patch on entropy risks telling, but does not break the cadence or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues from atmospheric signs to the bell’s autonomous strike. Orientation is crisp early; the rerouting “switch” sets a direct causal path to the outcome. Closure lands on the page with a charged final image (the bell’s single note) and a conceptual price (risking older tech over standard systems). The cost is understated but legible through isolation and professional defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a steady pattern (work → empathy → call) culminates in a conceptual repricing as Elion steps out and returns transformed. Orientation is clean; the yellow glass threads the structure and the decisive act is legible. The closure’s cost is implied (abandoning tools, risk), not deeply dramatized, which tempers impact. Still, the before/after is clear and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: recurring images (hives, box, ghosts, silence) condense into a decisive cadence shift on the anniversary night. Closure lands on the page as an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration: the box opens, a golden bee dissolves, and the recluse accepts keeperhood with the cost of silence. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the pattern taught early pays off cleanly. The cost is conceptual but legible in the final beats with travelers.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: discovery → suspension → decoding → adoption of the method → purpose clarified. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: she reframes timekeeping as weaving and teaching. The causal trigger (sudden timelessness) is serviceable but lightly motivated, and the on‑page cost remains modest. Orientation is clear early and maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: description and motif density build toward a cadence shift at the kite snap and the journal’s closing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (acceptance/renewal) with a conceptual cost—letting go. Orientation is clean from the first sentence (poet, lagoon, after rain). The cost remains subtle but legible in the child’s loss reframed into her poetics of surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: the month‑by‑month build tightens toward a charged final image. Orientation is crisp early and causality holds (diagnosis → diary → remodel → awakening → death). Closure lands on the page with cost through the orchard’s activation synced to his final breath. A single deepening rather than multiple turns, but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the patterned journey (footprints → door → pedestal) culminates in a closure beat where he relinquishes the amber and reinterprets the pilgrimage. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the single scene progresses cleanly. Cost is present but conceptual and gentle (relinquishment of a treasured object and identity stance). The closure is on‑page and legible even if the external pressure is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds through iterative acts—journey, seeding, song, tactical pivot—toward a charged dawn and a years-later payoff. Causality holds: the bird-call pivot (“The western hollow first”) meaningfully redirects tactics, and depletion of pods tightens options. Closure lands with a reconfigured world—recovery of garden/reef—though the price is modest and partially offloaded to summary. Orientation is clean from the outset (coachman, jetty, twilight; post-reef timeline).

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. The chain—riddle → leaf-filtered decoding → markers → coordinate reveal → course correction → reunion—holds cleanly and the closure lands as a conceptual repricing/resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is solid from the opening and the recurring object integrates the rule set. Cost at closure is more implied (ordeal and renunciation of safety) than dramatized, keeping it out of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece runs on an accumulative/textural lens and lands a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: she reframes “true north” as internal. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when and the “shutdown”). Closure cost is conceptual (enduring isolation as duty) but light. Structure is linear and steady with one cadence lift near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Hybrid leaning Causal: the chess swaps open passages; the king aligns stars; placing the lid repairs the sky—clean because/therefore links. Closure is a Decisive Change (sky corrected), but cost is minimal and the mentor’s expository arrival softens pressure. Orientation is crisp and the one-scene structure is tight. A stronger on-page price at the finale would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned walking, echo-responsiveness, and the gallery’s charge culminate in the pawn’s appearance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis blend): she recommits with the cost of selective memory preserved on the page. Orientation is early and stable; causal threads are lyrical but coherent. The cost is legible in her acceptance that many will remain unpreserved.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: stone → feather → nightly seeding → thunder → nexus reveal. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (home as connection), but the on‑page cost is soft. Orientation is clear, and the pattern is taught and paid off. The causal braid is gentle but coherent for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid drive with a causal spine (decoding → bell → door → prince) supported by an accumulative cadence shift (thunder to bell to restart). Orientation is crisp from the outset; the ticking lull anchors time and tactics. Closure lands on page with cost as time resumes and pardon is accepted. Slight neatness in the mechanism (tapestry fully fixes, door appears) keeps it short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the ritual clock and repeated echo/refraction pattern build toward a charged final image. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: she has “broken the singular apart,” accepts potential judgment, and the echoes reweight the premise. Orientation is clean early, and pattern holds. The cost remains implied rather than tangibly paid on the page, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual tracing and narrated memories build to a conceptual repricing where uncertainty becomes preparation. Orientation is clear early (observatory dome, floating workshop, acid sea) and persists. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost rooted in past losses and endurance, though the price is more implied than freshly exacted on the page. One coherent scene with a measured cadence shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Hybrid with Accumulative dominance: present-tense discovery deepens and reweights his long-held promise; causally, the wrong turn leads to the cave, to the shell, to the renewed painting. Orientation is clean and the two-shard structure is controlled. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the shell reframes his vow and catalyzes the masterpiece, with cost carried by years and grief. Escalation is modest but coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative drive holds: intent → whisper → sensed return → captain’s repricing. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when the captain concedes the soft approach. The cost is largely conceptual/emotional, not dramatized as a sacrifice. Causality is clean within the fable‑like logic.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the midnight call, moon peak, and ship’s arrival tighten toward a Charged Poise closure (“Welcome home”) with a felt, if modest, cost (heat, solitude, accumulated losses). Orientation is clean from the outset; the pattern (calls → building → guiding) holds and culminates without contradiction. The closure reweights the cycle—endurance with cost—rather than delivering a decisive turn, which suits the design. Stakes are tested on-page by the approaching vessel and the censer’s intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single‑scene structure is clean, causally coherent (ritual → occlusion → second relic → reframed understanding), and anchored early. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the relics’ purpose shifts from blockade to recalibration, with a tangible before/after in her sensory relief. Cost is quieter but present (risk of authorities, years of isolation, the price of belief/action). The second eye is convenient yet functions as a charged reprise rather than a deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative: image density and pattern (mist, dock, flower, memories) build toward a charged reprise at the dock. Causality coheres: stranger → flower → borrowed memories → gap‑based inquiry → return and offering. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he mirrors the gesture, reweighting his isolation with cost (opening himself to another’s grief and letting it go). Orientation is crisp from the outset; the two‑shard structure across days remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    The causal chain is clean: package → intuition → ants → cave → symbolic doorways → chosen crossing → altered return. Orientation is solid and the single‑POV arc holds; the closure is a decisive change with a legible before/after. The cost is present but light, framed in realization more than conflict. No key setups are abandoned; the chip and promise pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under a Causal lens, the sequence flows: warning → clandestine departure → climb → grotto revelation → reconfigured return. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: she returns to duty with a secret wellspring and altered stance. The cost is implied (defying counsel, physical risk) rather than materially tested in-scene, keeping the turn quiet. Orientation is clear from the first lines and consistent through the ridge-to-grotto arc.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the whispered secret reweights the premise from preserving light to capturing transformation, with a clear before/after stance. Orientation is clean early, and the pattern (scientific lyricism accruing toward a shift) holds. The cost is implied (a new art, altered friendship, abandoning prior method) but not concretely priced on the page, keeping it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure mounts via pattern—symbols glow, aurora rises, soaring through timelines—toward an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure. Orientation is clear early (Elias, cabin, post‑grave vision), and the final reconfiguration—returning to the pen—registers as a stable before/after. Cost is conceptual/emotional more than concrete, limiting peak impact. Causality is coherent inside the dream‑logic container.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the fog, drip, and object accrue toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara reframes her loss through connection. Orientation is clear early; scene stays single‑window with one tightening beat (the return of the screw) that reweights meaning. Cost is largely conceptual—continuing without smell—rather than a fresh on‑page price. Closure lands as charged poise rather than decisive change, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: preparation → rune attempt → platform tilt triggers panic → crystallization onset → ritual counter → successful completion. Orientation is clean from the opening (who/where/when), and the time pressure of the oncoming storm narrows options. Closure lands on the page with cost: she nearly crystallizes and forgoes breath until the quill’s shed tip confirms success. The final cadence (exhale, crystal cylinder, storm breaking) seals a before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative cadence at the end: careful setup → apparition → brief communion → orchard activity breaks the moment. Closure lands as a charged poise: apology accepted, reunion ends, incomplete sheet remains as cost. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; props and rules stay coherent. The clock’s intrusion provides the decisive tightening that seals the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and cadence tighten as the witness approaches the center, the dictionary glows, and the final page fills. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: witness/library/dictionary unify into a single hush, reweighting selfhood and reality. The time constraint (“the universe’s hiccup”) provides a clean narrowing window. Cost is implied in the self‑annulling union, legible if not viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the counting backwards sequence deepens pressure and reweights meaning, culminating in a conceptual repricing (“Clocks measure what we give them”) plus a small, on‑page cost (renunciation of conventional use). Orientation is clear early; the one‑scene flow is coherent. The closure is quiet but legible, with the key and station’s rituals reframed. Slightly reduced impact from a gentle rather than urgent pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene window, clear anchors, and a coherent accumulative drive culminating in a conceptual repricing: intruders to predecessors, tool to key. The ending image—fingers nearly touching across a permeable barrier—lands as a charged poise with a legible reweighting. Cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatic, but it’s on the page. Causality holds through the iterative laser adjustments and reciprocal gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → contemplation → reframed mission → earned calm. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (probability as uncertainty to live with, not a code to exploit) and feels paid for by the father thread. Orientation is clean from the first line; one continuous scene with a brief off‑page shard (subway). Cost is palpable but soft, rooted in accepting limits rather than solving a problem.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The call arrives, conversation deepens, and the cadence shifts from isolation to openness; closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration with an implied cost of vulnerability. Causality is modest but coherent, with motif‑driven turns (disc vibrates → he engages → later he awaits wrong numbers). The cost is more implied than enacted, keeping this shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the twilight‑to‑night cadence tightens toward a quiet Charged Poise/Earned Stasis as he turns away from the jetty. Stakes are coherent (last analog act before digitization), and the ending image carries visible cost. Orientation is immediate and stable. Minor reliance on reflective assertion doesn’t undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid causal/accumulative design holds: rumor launched → network activation → public uptake → Archie’s realization that the cure is the sharing. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the moon rock’s “powers” are false yet generative, with a social/ethical cost present in the fake. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; the mosaic of rumor handoffs feels coherent and purposeful. Some turns happen off-stage, but causality remains intact and focused.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece steadily intensifies through sensory/melodic density until the stillpoint’s silence reweights meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he gains an internal compass; tears signal cost. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), with continuity of a single scene. The causal chain is more atmospheric than event-driven, but the cadence shift at the circle is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lens: Causal, with a quiet accumulative undertone. The action (writing the contingent suggestion) leads to the next-morning effect; structure holds as a one-scene plus a brief shard. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she accepts incremental correction over erasure. Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional, not materially tested, which limits peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: gestures, camera, and gathered witnesses intensify into a charged final image. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a palpable cost—the gift persists while he vanishes from memory. Orientation is clean from the opening; the single‑scene progression is legible. Slight softness in causal turns keeps it just shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative end: a causal trail (artworks → message → restoration) culminates in a resonant reconfiguration (choosing preservation over erasure). Orientation is solid and the closure lands on page with cost implied (“She never returned to the world above ground”). However, multiple time jumps and montage compress the middle, softening moment‑to‑moment pressure. Still, setup pays off coherently without teleports or rule breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: drumming creates the four‑minute blackout → corridor unlock sequences → tower performance → lagoon manifestation → systems return. Closure lands as a charged poise: brief reunion achieved with the cost of imminent loss and institutional pressure. The Hybrid lens holds (causal spine with textural crescendo in the garden). No orientation debt; anchors are early and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under a mostly causal lens, the because/therefore chain (storm → acoustics → whisper plan → Vance’s shouts swallowed → successful relay) holds cleanly. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: proof achieved, Vance’s stance wobbles, Marlo consolidates power by adding a map. The cost is light and mostly implied (risk of inspection; operational sabotage vibes), which tempers impact. Orientation is strong from the outset with time and place anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single continuous scene with clear anchors and a coherent accumulative/textural drive culminating in a charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the secret remains unspoken but reweighted, the visitor’s burden eased, and the final star pattern seals the exchange. Cost is conceptual and quiet but present (withholding/change without declaration; dawn as a soft clock). The progression from first patterns to spiral to final star reads intentional and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clean causal chain: hearing students’ unspoken doubts → grotto amplification and plan → covert organizing → synchronized displays → communal reawakening. The closure is a decisive change (town discourse shifts), but the cost is soft—no concrete risk, sacrifice, or loss is dramatized at the end. Orientation is strong and lens coherence holds. The montage breadth slightly thins pressure near the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Global Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure lands as a decisive transformation and resonant reconfiguration with cost. The chain—finds scrimshaw → text appears → whale call → detachment → island’s rise → dive—coheres and culminates on the page. Cost is legible: she leaves her shore-life behind and is taken with the island. Orientation is clear early, and no causality breaks mar the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: repeated ritual acts and turbine sound accrete toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. Orientation is clean from the first lines and the scene stays continuous. The final “remade hush” and chosen equilibrium reconfigure the premise with a conceptual cost (life of endurance under judgment). The closure lands, though the cost is more conceptual than felt in a single tightened beat.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: approach → hum/glow intensify → paraphrase → transformation → quiet transfer of energy. Orientation is clean from the outset (poet, atrium, frozen lake), and the closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with a conceptual price (burden of purpose). The cost is more implied duty than loss, so the cadence lands softly rather than decisively. Still, the “colonnade silent/energy transferred” image provides a clear before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the placement of the last stem and the courtyard’s “inhale” provide a clean cadence shift that delivers closure. The chain—arrangement → awakening → offering the reed tongue → Gideon’s reconfigured stance—holds causally in lyric mode. Cost is gestured (loss of craft reframed), though it lands more as idea than felt consequence. Orientation is crisp early, and the single‑scene window remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: setup → activation → miners’ resonance → charged final image. Closure functions as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—the object as vessel—yet the cost is mostly conceptual, with little felt price. Orientation is clear from the outset. The single meaningful tightening is the device’s activation and discovery beat.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the piece builds pattern (jewelry, stencil, origami, thin curtains) toward a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early, and closure lands as a charged poise—Elena as guardian whose work reconfigures grief’s meaning. Cost (ongoing loss) is legible but mediated, with no decisive on‑page turn. The structure is coherent and purposeful, if gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the scene accrues method, inheritance, and setting detail until the visitor’s revelation reframes the project (Conceptual Repricing). Orientation is clean from the outset; cause/effect (arrival → hesitation → confiding → collaborative insight) holds. The final responsibility note provides conceptual cost, though it’s more implied than dramatized. Structure is coherent for the length with one primary tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: her patternless method intensifies images until the irrevocable merge. Orientation is clean from the outset and progression is legible through deepening activity and visibility of the atoms. Closure lands with cost (“she would never be the same”) and reconfigures the premise into a living archive. Causal links are soft but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned observation → anomaly documented → approach → recognition → transformation. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/role), and the closure lands on the page with cost (luminous regret and altered understanding). The river stone and moonbeam focus the final cadence into a resonant reconfiguration. Slight reliance on summary across nights trims causal tension but doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Runs cleanly under an accumulative/textural lens, moving from misted night to dawn as the inner calculus reweights trust. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: she chooses a vigilant, compassionate path with eyes open; the cost (loss of prior innocence and partnership) is legible. Orientation is solid from the first lines. The quiet turn is modest but precise, with the chameleon’s shed and the lifting mist tightening cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominance: images accrue (hourglass, rings, whispers) until a map resolves and a tunnel opens. Closure reads as a Conceptual Repricing and quiet DC (returning the miracle), on the page via pressing the wall and descending. Orientation is clean from the outset. Cost is a bit soft, but the structural throughline holds and pays off with the emptied hourglass.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: the psychometry reading intensifies until the realization that the love is stored “in the liminal spaces,” culminating in the choice to project the letters. Closure reads as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise with on‑page cost (bittersweet recognition, vow, threading the projector). Orientation is early and clean (vintage projection booth, red light, film), and there’s one effective cadence shift when the projectionists appear. Stakes resolve without contradiction, though the cost remains largely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ritual builds density until the cadence shifts and the voices cohere. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: rest becomes “listening differently,” with a felt price (what she missed while drowning in noise). Orientation is clear early and remains stable. The archway and instrument reprise in the final image for a clean on‑page close.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: train → dune → archive → offering → tick. Orientation is clean early; the pattern of motifs pays off at closure with a Resonant Reconfiguration as time nudges forward and presence replaces diffusion. Causal strands are light but coherent (charm lock → stabilize archive → alignment). Cost is subtle (commitment/vulnerability), not robustly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory patterns (wind tones, gear warmth) intensify toward the nexus and then reprice reality in the sleep shard. Closure arrives as a conceptual reconfiguration—forest as projection, gear integration—with coherent two‑shard structure. Cost is implied (loss of prior reality’s solidity, surrender to dream‑driven travel) but not strongly felt on the page, limiting the ceiling. Orientation is clean and the throughline is intact.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive is clean: ticket-stamp → heating pull → waterfall portal → dragon chamber → return with reweighted purpose. Orientation is strong from the opening; the pattern is taught and held. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (they become ferry guides of courage), though the on-page cost is gentle rather than acute. No causality breaks; the sequence is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean: discoloration → bolt → etchings → realization of the fortress’s price → choice to sing. Closure lands on-page as a decisive act, with a conceptual cost (endangering protection) legible in the reconfigured stakes. The accumulative-textural hum-light-snow motif tightens coherently to the final image. The cost remains more implied than tested in consequence, keeping it just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing when the pretender is revealed as her own fear, with the library’s dissolution and the pellet’s final light registering cost. The pattern of messages, the library’s degradation, and the focused ritual supply a clean cadence shift. Some beats are summarized (weeks to months), but the pattern holds and the cost is legible at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: clues accrue (atlas, satellite data, tapping pattern) until a conceptual repricing lands (“Earth returning to a pre‑industrial state”). Orientation is swift and coherent, and the present‑tense observation frame is steady. Closure is on‑page with felt cost (foreclosed human “paths,” her role narrowed to witness). The structure is simple but purposeful, with one clean tightening during the sleepless discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the hum/light intensify toward a resonant reconfiguration where she accepts a role (“reignite… a revolution of the spirit”). Orientation is clear early; the scene coheres in one location with a steady cadence shift. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR, but the cost is modest—mostly the relinquishing of the old lens (opera glasses) and the implied burden, not a concrete price on the page. Still, the pattern of discovery → threshold → embrace is coherent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under a Causal lens, the chain (elusive key → kite → decoding → spoken words → opening) holds and lands with an on‑page Decisive Change. Orientation is clean and the single POV window remains coherent. The closure’s cost is thin—no evident sacrifice or narrowed option beyond time and effort—so the ending reads satisfying but low‑friction. The reveal/retrieval arrives smoothly rather than under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: ritual details accrue toward the anniversary scene, where she releases the photo. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis with visible cost—she relinquishes the talisman and stands in charged poise on the cliff. Orientation is clear early; single POV and scope are tight. The beats cohere without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the thread‑sorting deepens pressure toward a resonant reconfiguration where “broken” becomes “transformed.” Orientation is clean early (who/where/what). Closure lands with a cost—the ache remains, revalued as fuel. Stakes stay internal but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orientation is solid from the start (who/where/when), and the causal chain is coherent: eclipse window → ink geometry → deliberate entry → displacement → return with cost. The closure functions as a conceptual repricing supported by on-page consequences. The hybrid lens holds, with causal beats carrying to a thought-turn ending. Stakes remain singular and resolve without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation is swift and clean: who, where, and what are evident early, and the through‑line from discovery to leak to charged aftermath holds. Under a Situational lens, pressure coheres and culminates in a decisive act, with cost legibly implied (“Soon the Federation would come”). The closure is a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: the act is done; she waits under threat. Minor neatness—the upload occurs without complication—keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the piece builds a pattern toward a quiet closure (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise) as she finishes work and affirms her path. Orientation is clean, and the recurring sandbag and roses culminate in a reweighted final image. Cost is soft—more conceptual than dramatized—so the closure lands modestly rather than decisively. The single-scene coherence holds but lacks a pressing turn.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterned actions thicken into a capture and a cadence shift as the garden settles. Orientation is early and clean; single scene coheres; setup → net → descent → securing is legible. Closure lands (echo caught, world subtly reweighted), though the price paid is conceptual rather than viscerally felt. A touch more on‑page consequence at the end would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.7)
    Orientation is crisp early (observatory, call, files), and the causal lens holds: assume innocence → work evidence → find the frame → call. Closure arrives as a Charged Poise decision with dawn as cadence shift, though the investigation leap is summarized (“finally had it”) rather than dramatized. The price is implied (taking on power), not concretely felt at the end. Still, the because/therefore chain reads coherent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is clean: letters → amber medium → firmware recalibration → tether → time fold → lullaby → reconfiguration. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: stillness replaces emptiness with felt cost (tears, the decade of ghosted cries). Orientation is crisp early (who/where/goal), and the single‑scene scope stays tight. The cost is primarily emotional rather than a trade‑off, keeping this just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure holds as a continuous scene that accrues pressure toward a communal repricing of “order” vs. “unlearning.” The causal hinge is Silas’s adjustment of the sand patterns, which reconfigures the grotto’s whispers for the crowd and defuses the zealots’ threat. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with a visible renunciation (impermanence embraced). Cost is subtle but on‑page; the lens (accumulative/textural with situational pressure) holds.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece tightens through image density toward a resonant reconfiguration when the name is spoken and the plaza “responds.” Orientation is solid early; the single scene holds. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—renaming reweights ruin into potential—though the cost remains conceptual more than felt. The crowd’s silent witness and the charged tessera support the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern is taught early (song as temporal stitching) and paid off as echoes weave ribbons and restore the sanctuary. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the first lines), and the throughline (before dawn or the orchard withers) coheres. Closure lands on the page with cost: the garden is restored and Silas allows himself to dissolve. The causal thread is simple but consistent, with no unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: observation → synchronization → geode projecting network patterns → devised protocol → charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (skeptic to believer in human capacity) coupled with a concrete plan. Cost is implied (long night, risk, brother’s ongoing harm) rather than sharply priced on the page, keeping it just short of higher bands. Orientation is strong from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    Orientation is crisp (who/where/when) and the causal thread (explore → discover → touch → visions → mission) holds. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: her role reweights the world’s mystery, and the final image (fossil warm in pouch) seals the shift. Cost is light and mostly implied; danger and trade‑offs aren’t tested on the page. The single scene meets scope but avoids a decisive pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: discovery → method → deciphering → communal spread. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (fate into possibility), but the cost at the end is faint. Beats link coherently, largely via “therefore” from the echo’s response to the button sequences. The final transformation is summarized rather than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: recurring images (mist, snow codes, pillbox) accrete to a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis close. Closure lands when he repurposes the pillbox and reconceives “fixing” as building around fractures, with a felt cost (foreclosing the fantasy of repair and the spy’s old identity). Orientation is clear early; single scene coherence is strong. The price is subtle but legible in the acceptance of irretrievable losses.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the ritual proceeds as the gutters tick down, culminating in a conceptual reweighting (“crossing places…neither here nor there”) and earned stasis. Closure lands via completed knot + stopped gutters + dawn departure. Cost is soft (a thumb prick and ongoing vigilance), limiting impact. Orientation is clear early (coachman, tollhouse, fog, crossing), and the single‑scene window is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around iterative image-turns (glass, smoke, flowers, bees) that build to a Conceptual Repricing: resistance as “loyal memory of love” and present re-suturing of timelines. Orientation is clean, single scene holds, and the final cadence crystallizes the thesis on the page. The on‑page cost is modest (time, stamina, commitment), which slightly softens the landing.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; the piece layers images and echoes (rose petal, harbor, tool) toward a Charged Poise at dawn. Orientation is clean and the progression (impulse → journey → alcove → legacy reveal → reflective labor → dawn) holds causally. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—Mara accepts a role—with cost implied in endurance and a shift of self. The elder’s appearance is a mild convenience but complicates and deepens rather than solving the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring images (sundial, hum, mirror) density‑build toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elena aligns with the library’s rhythm. Orientation is immediate and stable. Closure lands with the sundial’s no‑shadow image and the internal clock, though the cost (relinquishing control) is more articulated than dramatized. One coherent cadence shift, lightly taxed by abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/why), and the build from temple → installation → nest culminates in a Conceptual Repricing: the “thread” becomes mindful attention, with a vow that reweights prior work. The closure beats land on the page (“she would never write another letter that didn’t contain this truth”), but the price remains more implied than dramatized. A single firmer tightening of options would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a Causal lens, the sequence is clean: modification → activation → destabilization → interference → signal stops → social effects. Orientation is firm early, and the decisive change is on‑page (monitor goes dark) with an epilogue shard showing consequences. Cost is present but soft; the piece frames future danger more than an immediate price. Still, the closure reads earned and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under a primarily causal lens, each beat flows: arrive → calibrate → hum → device glows → air thickens/transfixion → portal opens → choice to cross. Closure is a Decisive Change with a Conceptual Repricing (the “key” is a passage), and cost is implied by treason risk and leaving home. Orientation is clean from the outset. The price is felt but not maximal; the communal stakes remain mostly prospective.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.5)
    Under a causal lens, the ribbon → mask design → custom order → assistant chain is coherent, if telescoped. Orientation is strong and the scene holds a single throughline with one tightening (documents arrival leading to the focused deduction). Closure lands via the stated confession, but it occurs off‑page, muting cost and diminishing the decisive turn’s felt impact. The drive stays legible, though the payoff is partly summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal chain: decoding stanzas → nail as key → hidden controls → initiation. Orientation is crisp from the start; the lens remains Causal through closure. The ending lands as a Decisive Change/Charged Poise with implied cost (activating dormant tech, challenging consensus), though that cost could be more concretely priced. No broken set‑ups or convenience resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through pattern recognition (pixelation → glass flake → scaffold language) culminating in the ascent. Orientation is clean early (mountain pullout, construction site, hitchhiker’s disappearance). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he accepts the invitation and steps onto the scaffold, committing to cross. Cost is implied (leaving the known world) but not deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: motifs (money, compass, map, territory) build toward a conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is strong early and the mosaic timeline remains coherent. Closure lands on-page with cost: the company unwinds, creditors, and Elias leaves the train. Escalation is modest but sufficient for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset (observatory, night into dawn, Elara’s role), and the piece holds a single continuous window. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern intensifies toward a conceptual repricing: stars → glyphs → healing language unlocked via collaboration. Closure lands as a quiet reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn; the cost is soft—more relief than sacrifice—which limits impact. Still, the beats link coherently from telegram cue to collaborative decoding to final dawn image.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Strong causal chain: failed trick → vortex entry → expanding circles → blood‑fed seed → ice consumed → identity revealed and mentor freed. Closure is on‑page with cost, combining a decisive act (blood, spell‑unbending) and conceptual repricing (truth as identity, mirror logic). Orientation is clean early and sustained. The lens holds causally through to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single‑scene arc holds under an accumulative/textural lens: the ritual intensifies, the clipping becomes a maze, the center yields a realization that reweights the premise. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—dreams and reality meant to coexist—tied to the protagonist’s action. Causality is ethereal but coherent within the rules taught early; no orientation debt. The cost at closure is more conceptual than felt, softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single‑scene structure is clean: approach → confrontation with the escaped memory → absorption into the card → restored balance. Under an accumulative/textural lens, details intensify toward a ritualized closure (Earned Stasis), with on‑page cost implied by her bartered destiny and ongoing vigil. The causal chain holds, but the struggle is brief and consequence is more stated than felt. Closure lands, though the price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, details accrete toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: the scrap’s identification and the “evidence bag” moment reweight the dominant stake. Orientation is crisp early; causality holds through goal-directed scrutiny to a low-key closure. The cost is legible: embracing worth beyond market value after public failure. Quiet but cleanly executed structure within a single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece coheres: reflection and detail build toward a Charged Poise closure (boarding with the pulsing seed). Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and the final image reconfigures her solitude into lineage without tying off the quest. Cost is present (mentor’s departure, burden accepted) but remains more implied than viscerally felt. The throughline from spirit’s exit to embarkation reads clean and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the tide-triggered ritual culminates in a synthesized identity and a reweighted final image (“keeper and kept”). Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the ritual’s beats accrue coherently. Cost is present conceptually (ruined/altered texts, self-dissolution) though not sharply dramatized, keeping this just short of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence (discovery → comprehension via seashell → acceptance → mission) coheres and culminates in an on‑page RR/CR. The crown’s “weight” and the invisible burden suggest cost, and the final mission reframes the premise. Orientation is immediate and clean. Cost could be sharpened further on the page, but the closure unit is legible and decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens with causal spine: graffiti clues → tunnel → hidden river → music ritual; closure lands as an on‑page resonant reconfiguration. Cost is legible in the surrender to grief and the relinquishing of numbing (tears joining the river). Orientation is strong and the single scene tightens cleanly toward the subterranean discovery. No major causality gaps or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: images and rules accrue (watch cycles, fog threshold, living stacks) to a resonant reconfiguration at exit. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the power of the unsaid and a transformed stance, with the watch’s change and fading library charging the final image. Causality is coherent beat-to-beat, though the price is soft (urgency more than loss). Orientation is clean early, and the single-scene window holds.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    Drive lens: Causal. Coffee‑reading predicts destruction; therefore she pivots to propagation via harmonic resonance; therefore the violin fractures and seeds a living legacy; therefore the Empire receives only a husk—a clean on‑page RR with felt cost. Orientation is immediate (observatory, midsummer, agents tomorrow), and the closure price is explicit (original scarred, essence hidden). The chain holds without gaps or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: density and ritual deepen until a cadence shift at completion and shelving. Orientation is clean early; the throughline (capture → infuse → preserve) is coherent. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as she completes one soul and resets to guard the threshold, though the cost is more conceptual than felt. No causal missteps, but pressure remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: ascent → grotto → central chamber → realization → descent with a charged reprise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing (she becomes the source), present on the page. The cost is soft—acceptance rather than a trade‑off—yet legible within the piece’s quiet design. Orientation is solid early; pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Situational with accumulative texture. Orientation is immediate; the lighthouse, dawn, and profession are clear early. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he advises, the fisherman shifts, and Elian recommits to his role at a visible emotional cost (“cloak of doubt slipped slightly… then he prepared to welcome the day”). Causality is modest but coherent: chime sequence → advice → client movement → internal recommitment.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the lesson escalates through trance → stone/ripples → blindfold removal → grotto reveal → vanishing attempt. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Maya embraces the paradox and begins to vanish; Elien pays with time (“payment for wisdom shared”). Orientation is clean and causal beats are coherent. The cost is legible but weighted more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of signals (crows → recess → resonance → activation) coheres and culminates cleanly in a reweighted ending (Kael gone; the arrowhead as guide). Orientation is strong from the first line (who/where/what), with one continuous scene and a single dominant stake. The closure carries cost on the page—his disappearance—and ties to earlier set-ups. Minor convenience in the birds guiding him is justified by the established rule-set and prior vision.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under a Causal lens, each beat follows cleanly: archival discovery → mist walking → finding keystone → unstrapping → activation → return with reconfigured stance. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: he renounces standardized magic and brings back a new mode of presence. Cost is on-page (forbidden ritual, shedding sanctioned gear), though consequences remain largely implied. Orientation is anchored within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the causal progression—key found → lighthouse door → library revelation → marked return—holds cleanly. The piece reads under an accumulative/textural lens with a coherent RR/CR closure: the vow and the marked palm reweight the world. Setups (lanterns, key, color-sound) pay off in the final image of multicolored lamplights. Cost is legible on the page, even if modest.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    Drive lens: Causal. We get a clean sequence—filter static, cast lots, interpret spiral, choose to broadcast—leading to a Decisive Change and mild Conceptual Repricing (“the universe folds to begin again”). Orientation lands early, and the scene stays contained. The closure’s cost is underdeveloped; the choice reads consequential but not felt as a sacrifice, keeping the effect strong but short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: naming accrues into a reconfiguration, culminating in the crystallization and the lighter departure. Orientation is early and clean (observatory at dusk; reaper alone), and the closure lands on‑page with a felt cost (accepting loss, renaming grief as Solitude). The old recordings set the present motive without causing a structure wobble. Stakes resolve through a resonant cadence shift rather than a plot turn, appropriately at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal drive holds: dripping pattern → understanding → reconstructed bell → sea stirs. Orientation is crisp from the first sentence; the single scene deepens toward a timed realignment. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change (the sea’s return), though the price paid is primarily effort and faith. Setups (dripping as countdown, bell as anchor) pay off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    Hybrid drive with a causal turn: label → photos → aunt revelation → decision/action; the closure is a Decisive Change as he mobilizes to rewrite the narrative. Orientation is clear from the opening, and the ending’s dawn image closes the arc. Cost is mostly conceptual (risking status, admitting complicity) rather than dramatized; still legible. The two‑shard structure (ridgeway then cabin/action) is clean and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single scene, clean orientation, and a coherent accumulative/textural drive culminate in the transformation. Closure lands (she achieves harmonization and secures the transformed crystal), but cost is minimal and the beat sequence lacks a decisive pressure turn. The starlings’ method is set up and paid off without contradiction. The structure is sound yet low‑tension.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, refrains build pressure toward a closure beat where the seeker transmits an urgent message after recognizing emergency protocol and anomalies. The before/after rests on a conceptual repricing—old patterns no longer apply—culminating in action with implied cost. Causality is simple but clean; no teleporting props or resets. The price remains more conceptual than felt, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.1)
    Hybrid drive holds: situational pressure (the rewrite wave) converges with causal action (the vivification through opposites) to produce a CR/RR closure. Orientation is swift and clean; the pedestal/label stakes are clear. The cost—embracing pain under a ticking temporal wave—is legible on the page. The legal battle is off‑stage, but the on‑page closure is earned enough for this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the storm → seed → examination → planting → design plan sequence builds to a conceptual repricing: creativity as cultivation with time and rarity. Orientation is strong and the closure lands quietly with a felt (if mostly implied) price of patience and noncommercial choices. Escalation is mild, but the pattern teaches and pays off. The ending’s charged poise is present, though risk remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece tightens via density and cadence: the orchestrated roar → woven echoes → the single giggle → the earned quiet. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: he cannot restore laughter; he can remember and consecrate absence, with felt cost. Orientation is crisp from the outset (tunnel, house, hourglass) and the pattern taught early pays off at the final image. The turn is subtle rather than decisive, but fully legible.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece escalates via density and pattern—mist waves, light porosity, pendant warming—toward a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: home reframed as a carried state and the step forward. Orientation is clean; closure lands, though the cost reads more conceptual than materially exacted. Coherence holds from first image to last.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid lens (causal attempts within an accumulative lyric frame) holds: shimmer → three‑minute glow → “penny drops” → final ritual. Closure lands as Decisive Change plus Conceptual Repricing: the crozier is reborn, foreclosing mere restoration and revaluing tradition. Cost is legible in dissolving the old form and releasing the family’s mandate. Orientation is clean from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single scene, clear anchors, and a coherent accumulative build toward a charged alignment at lunar perigee. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the city hums awake and meaning is repriced (“beginning in every ending”). Cost is modest (a renunciation of assumptions) but present. Beats link cleanly without teleports or reset.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is clean: ferry vanishes at dusk → spectral grotto → radio coordination → convergence sequence → merged vessel. Closure lands (Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration) with the hourglass filling and the ferries becoming one. Cost is present but conceptual; success faces little on‑page resistance, muting consequence. Orientation is crisp from the first lines and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from crafted illusions to collective unconscious eruptions to contact and a conceptual repricing of connection. Orientation is clean, the single transition into the fever dream is legible, and closure lands on the page. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than a concrete price, keeping it below the highest band. The because/therefore chain is light but coherent for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.0)
    Orientation is clean early, and the accumulative lens holds: method → meditative sessions → external confirmation → recalibration. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise with the anchor link, but the decisive confirmation happens offstage and cost is light. The arc is coherent but relies on summary beats over on‑page turns. One meaningful tightening is present but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: pulse → garden → child → predator link → security → calm device → photo repriced. Closure lands as a hybrid Decisive Change/Conceptual Repricing: the child is saved and the photograph’s meaning is reframed. The price is mostly conceptual/emotional (the grandmother’s failed warning finally answered), not materially taxing. Orientation is solid early; single scene coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, with a Situational clock; closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she completes the night’s crossings and recommits to return. Orientation is crisp from the opening and the ticking tide constrains options. The ritual cadence intensifies toward the Codex’s “sigh” and the shore reclaiming the door. Cost at climax is primarily conceptual/relational and somewhat off‑page, keeping the close strong but not crushing.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres to a single scene where the ink ritual yields knowledge and reweights purpose. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: existence reframed from curse to altered life, with solitude as implied cost. Orientation is clean and the shard/ink patterning pays off. The causality is light—more a guided reveal than a pressured turn—keeping it short of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive is coherent: long ritual → pattern break → object reveals language. Orientation is crisp early, and the closure occurs on the page with the diamond’s voiced sentence. Cost is present as decades of effort and a vanishing tongue, though it’s more conceptual than acutely dramatized in-scene. The birds’ unprecedented pattern is a coincidence that functions as a cadence shift rather than a deus ex machina under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: observations about metamorphosis, the arrowhead, and lunar alignments build toward a reframed mission. Orientation is clear early (who/where/why), and the closure is a quiet conceptual repricing. The cost at the ending is more conceptual than on-page felt, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is clean: shell → orchard → statues → sapling → escape → transformed city. Closure lands via the uprooting and a resonant final image (crystalline vines climbing the bridge), with a modest on‑page cost (guardians stirring, the shell crumbling). Orientation is solid and the lens reads primarily causal with lyric coloration. Escalation is functional but largely smooth, with few frictions or reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Situational, held—coherent pressure from a risky handoff in a surveilled space tightens when the guards enter. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the shift change/payoff links to prior observation. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/RR: bottle transferred, risk endured, rain echoing the bottled storm reweights meaning. Cost is felt (exposure risk), though largely avoided, which caps the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure is coherent and causally legible: fragment → impulse/door → oasis → chimes → song → carousel awakens → fragment dissolves. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the carpenter reclaims voice and purpose, paid for by surrendering the fragment and the protection of silence. Orientation is solid early; single POV and scope stay within guardrails. The lens reads Accumulative/Hyrbid with causal throughlines, held cleanly to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: pattern density increases (arrangement → glow → threads → transfer) to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when), and the closure lands on the page with cost (the scarf dissolves; the library reconfigures). Causality stays coherent under the story’s rules; the seven‑book hyperbolic gateway pays off consistently. The price persists as a changed state—memories transferred, library rearranged.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: discovery of the book → altered shooting approach → vitalization reveals a map → conceptual repricing (sister as light). Orientation is strong and the closure lands with cost via acceptance and reconfigured goal. The causal thread is soft but intact; coincidence (the book appearing) complicates rather than resolves since Elara must still execute the method. The ending’s cost is emotional rather than decisional, but it’s legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual → threshold → mental chamber → starlight thread → release → dawn. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the idea is freed and the lock of hair dissolves, reweighting the opening image. Cost is present but light (the sacrifice of the hair/key and implied psychic expenditure), which tempers impact. Orientation is clean from the outset and the single scene maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is swift and clean, and the causal chain holds: study → alignment of seventh shape → visions → reinterpretation → reclamation. Closure lands on the page via a decisive act (touching each mushroom) and a conceptual reframe of “thieves” as preservers. The cost is largely retrospective (decades lost) rather than felt in the peak beat, trimming impact. Still, the sequence is coherent and satisfying at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: motifs (shadow, shards, tea geometry) accrue toward a charged poise where Prisha stands firm and the archivist accepts purpose without return. Orientation is clean and the single‑scene flow coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with cost—remaining exiled yet fulfilled through teaching. Escalation is gentle, but the cadence shift around the shadow’s activation and the door’s test provide enough tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-scene accumulative design is coherent, with a clear before/after: the seed is reweighted to cast rainbows and is stowed to await a future sprouting. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she completes the weaving, accepts guardianship, and pays a conceptual price. Orientation is immediate (pruner, parapet, waterfall) and the method escalates through focused acts. Cost is more implied than dramatized, keeping it shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominance holds: unraveling generates an “interlaced hush” that culminates in spirits settling and Jacob’s confession. Causality is clean (unravel knots → release whispers → deepen hush → final knot → stillness → confession). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: unrest reweighted into peace and Elena’s gift repriced from burden to asset. Cost is implied rather than visceral, keeping it just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern recognition and map alignment culminate in a conceptual repricing: the chapel is celestial, the secret meant to be experienced, not mapped. Closure lands via a charged poise/earned stasis as she repairs the map to honor the divide. Orientation is clear early; the causal thread (footage → pattern → constellation → decision) is coherent. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than practical, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; Closure: Conceptual Repricing via “home” as frequency and the snow globe’s altered final image. Orientation is clean from the outset and the pattern of images coheres. The cost is legible (a reweighted understanding that alters her purpose and entails letting go). The supernatural cue (plane vanishing) is consistent with the established metaphysical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    Structure reads as accumulative/textural: the pattern of storms, graffiti, and the plate coheres toward a quiet RR (charged poise) ending. Orientation is firm early (who/where/when are legible), and the motif web lands in the final image. Closure is a steady-state harmony rather than a decisive change, with conceptual cost (loneliness alleviated) more implied than felt. Causal steps are mostly told rather than turned in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the floor‑by‑floor structure tightens toward the light‑through‑goggles reveal and the decision to keep the secret. Causality holds: prior observation → new tactic → transformation → choice. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with an implied cost of secrecy and complicity. Orientation is clear early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single‑scene, tightly oriented, with an accumulative/textural drive that coheres. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing when the cloud “conversation” mirrors her mentor’s last flight and she reframes isolation into charged purpose. The cost is largely conceptual (professional risk, continued peril) rather than dramatized action. Still, the final image is legible and reweights the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the discovery of the indentation → safe → coin and the time pressure create a coherent build toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when) and the closure cost—demolition proceeding as she finishes—lands. The coin’s sudden perfect fit is convenient but thematically grounded and doesn’t break causality. The final image crystallizes a before/after without needing a hard reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern recognition layers through hopscotch numbers, phrasebook symbols, and murmurations toward a realization. Orientation is clean, and the closure is a conceptual repricing (mapping luminous pathways). However, the cost at closure is thin, with no constraint or irreversible trade‑off felt on the page. Causality holds, but the sequence reads more assembled than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single scene with clean orientation, causal beats (find pedestal → open box → repair heart) under a hybrid lens with an accumulative, lyric cadence at the end. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the repaired heart awakens the library and reweights Elias’s quest into belonging. Cost is conceptual (renunciation of treasure/claim-mindset for service), not deeply painful but present. No causality breaks or teleporting setups.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Hybrid leaning causal: messages → reexamination → watering bell → revitalization → ritualized remembrance. Structure is coherent, but much is summarized, so the decisive turn (discovery and use) lacks on‑page cost or friction. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—communal identity reframed—without a felt price at the end. Orientation is clean; escalation is logical but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation is clear early (Elias, hidden lighthouse at dusk, clock chamber), and the accumulative/textural lens holds. Pressure coheres from approach to ritual to the clock’s stutter, culminating in the spindle’s soft acceptance—an on‑page closure with conceptual cost. The cost is mostly implied (continuing duty, exhaustion) but legible. No causality breaks; the nested ritual causes the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a causal lens, the because/therefore chain is clean: blueprint → assembly → labyrinth entry → impressions laid → travelers rescued → power spent → reconfiguration of duty. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: he accepts guardianship with a tangible price (spent power, ongoing patrol threat). Orientation is firm from the start, and no set-up is left unpaid. The only softness is that opposition (birds/frost) rarely bites hard enough to threaten reversal on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    Structure is clean: argument → nature walk → insight → phone call → aftermath, with a coherent accumulative drive. Closure lands on the page via the call and a reconfigured stance that carries forward into changed work and routine. Because/therefore linkages hold and no teleporting turns appear. The felt cost is modest but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the scene builds through ritual preparation to a conceptual repricing—stories begin in the unsaid—paired with the door’s creation and the first customer’s arrival. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the world rules are internally consistent. The closure is legible and on‑page, but the cost is conceptual rather than acute, softening its impact. Still, the parole constraint shapes tactics and the final beat reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is coherent: rain → tidal pools → discovery → descent → transformation → emergence. Closure lands with cost (trembling hands) and a Decisive Change (a lighter heart), and the pavilion’s rules stay consistent. The main shortfall is a largely generalized treatment of the memory content, which softens the climactic specificity. Orientation is solid from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Drive lens reads primarily causal with accumulative texture: discovery of the weight → multilingual outreach → revived talks → communal rebuilding → symbolic closure. The structure is more montage than scene, and escalation is mostly reported, softening the felt cost at the end. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration via the re‑chained weight, but the price paid is implied rather than legible. Orientation is clear early, but the piece spans multiple meetings without a focused hinge scene.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: preparation → activation → deepening → reconfiguration, culminating in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis blend (“permanently changed,” quaking reverie now a state). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). Closure lands with conceptual and emotional cost tied to the device and mind. The causal thread is light but coherent for a lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain is coherent: manuscript cues → threshold ritual → entry → puzzle activation → timed exit. The live clock and the final “seven minutes” tighten the structure. However, key turns (solving the combinations) are told in overview, dulling the sense of earned progression. Closure is achieved with conceptual cost (duty resumed) rather than a hard on‑page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: sensation → memory‑music → resolve, ending in a Charged Poise image (insulator humming, tools raised). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the throughline is coherent. Closure lands with a felt emotional cost and a credible next action, though the turn is gentle rather than decisive. No causality breaks or teleports.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Conceptual Repricing as the covenant is reinterpreted and enacted via the stone. Orientation is solid early, and the three-day clock coheres the build. The final act (placing the stone as the phase begins) lands the change on the page, though the cost is conceptual more than visceral. Causal threads are minimal but coherent within the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single‑scene accumulative build is coherent: forks → layered frequencies → clasp click → conceptual reframing. Orientation is crisp early (workshop, night, fireworks clock), and closure lands with a concrete act plus a reweighting realization. Cost is light but legible as a directional pivot of vocation. Causality is intact and motivated through method rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure is coherent and anchored early; the accumulative/textural lens holds as pattern and scent density build to the blue‑lit reveal. Closure is a conceptual repricing: the “corpse flower” redefined as guardian library, reweighting Elara’s goal. The cost is soft (time, isolation, risk suggested rather than dramatized), which keeps the ending from fully tightening. Nonetheless, the before/after is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is clean and the causal chain holds: Hour of Inversion → water-road navigation → First Arch → echoes → realization. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (understanding the arrow/seed) but the on-page cost is soft. The single-scene structure stays coherent with one tightening at the First Arch. No major teleports or rule breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    Single‑scene accumulative build is coherent, with orientation established early and a steady drift from survey to hypothesis. Closure reads as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: the phenomenon reweights the investigation as reality‑bending with societal cost implied. The cost on the page is muted (unease, isolation) and the escalation remains modest, limiting impact. Still, the because/therefore chain of noticing → modeling → hypothesis holds.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive is consistent: the ritual intensifies through patterned strikes toward the “sculpted hush.” Orientation is firm early (who/where/when), and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration. Cost is conceptual rather than felt, limiting the peak’s force. Nonetheless, the final hush reweights the premise on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound, arrangement, and vision density build toward a reconfiguration where power is repurposed for healing. Orientation is early and clean, and the ritual sequence escalates coherently. Closure lands on the page with cost (grief released, relinquishment of old stance, object reweighted). No causality breaks; the because/therefore of the ritual’s stages reads motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single‑scene coherence holds: knock → induction → transfer → data → dismissal. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR: she accepts ethical cost and doubles down as another star vanishes. Orientation is strong early, and cause/effect is clean. The price is legible (Thomas’s distress, her chosen isolation), though not crushing.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is immediate and clean; the accumulative drive coheres toward the handoff. Closure is on-page (Ayla gives the pendant to the elder) with a felt cost (hollow absence) and a new stance. Causality holds—elderly traveler encounter yields a shortcut, journey culminates in transfer. Stakes track, though turns are gentle and risk remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, observable phenomena (frost patterns intensifying to full scenes) steadily reweight the central stake. Orientation is clean from the outset and the scene stays contained. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the rules expand from emotions to memories with an implied cost to prior certainty. The lack of a concrete on‑page consequence limits the ceiling but coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid with an accumulative dominant: patterning around silence/amber escalates into the jigsaw‑sacrifice method, culminating in on‑page activation of the ancient shoot and a reversal of silence. Closure lands with cost: memories relinquished and the bead’s energy spent then reborn, reweighting the premise. The rummage‑sale puzzle appears abruptly yet functions as a coherent mid‑turn rather than a rescue. Causality holds through the internal logic of sacrifice empowering transit and release.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lens: Causal. The sequence—discover silk → trade → empowered repairs → communal reliance—tracks cleanly, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a final image under the arches. Cost at closure is conceptual rather than felt; the bargain’s price doesn’t bite on the page beyond declaration. Orientation is solid; scope fits, but much is told in overview rather than scene.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patterned transitions intensify toward the dream‑door, then deflate into a charged refusal as the shard dims. Orientation is clear early (abandoned repair bay; shard as vector), and set‑ups (forbidden weaving, cyclic spontaneity) pay off in the closing image. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis with an evident constraint (power spent; revelation deferred). Some middle beats are told in montage, softening causal tightening, but the ending image still reconfigures options with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean orientation and a coherent accumulative structure: lamp fails → search → discovery → tradition → recommitment. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—he joins and vows to protect the chain—reweighting the lighthouse’s purpose. Cost is present as an embraced duty and guarded secrecy, though the external ship‑safety threat defuses quickly. The lens holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid drive leaning Accumulative: the piece tightens from pattern (nightly ritual) to a specific test (guiding refugees through a hidden channel). Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—she recommits despite the risk of prophecy, with a felt responsibility cost. Causality is adequate (her actions steer ships), but the price is more conceptual than dramatized. Orientation is clear and the single-shard structure holds.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual observation → applied craft → realized pattern → poised sharing. Orientation is crisp early (floating tea house, rope ladder, prisms) and the closure unit is a conceptual repricing: story-magnetism reframed via iridescence, plus the operational dye breakthrough. Cost is implied—self-limitation and careful revelation—rather than dramatized, but the final image consolidates the pattern. Causality is associative yet coherent, with no broken links.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong accumulative/textural design: storm, acoustics, moonlight, resonance frequencies, and the oak board layer to a Conceptual Repricing when the sextant draws light in. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/what) and the single‑scene window holds. The decisive shift reframes the stake—sorrow as resilience, sanctuary as purpose—cleanly on the page. Cost is more conceptual than felt, registering as relinquished premise rather than a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the song intensifies, the greenhouse and window respond, and the final weave reconfigures the realm. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration (release after duty) and a conceptual cost. Orientation is clean from the outset. The escalation relies on crescendo rather than hurdles but remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single‑scene structure with a live clock (11:45 to midnight) creates a clean situational frame. Closure lands as Earned Stasis when she refuses the gathering, writes the note, and hands it to the member. Causality holds: invitation → reflection → decision → act. The on‑page cost is gentle, leaning contemplative rather than pressured, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: patterned noticing → tea ritual → letter → reweighted bread closes with cost. Orientation is clear and the single-scene frame holds; the letter reveal functions as the tightening. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (absolution and the choice to leave the bread). Slight telliness around the offstage discovery keeps it from higher.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: measurement → revelation of resilience → decision to create new slides. Closure lands as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis, with renewed resolve to preserve vows. The cost at the end is light and largely prospective (“painstaking” work), which mutes impact slightly. Orientation is crisp from the outset and remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: each manipulation triggers the next beat (seeded suspicion → forced message → exposure), culminating in the charged poise moment when the watch fob captures the silence. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and remains clean. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (truce broken, violence imminent) tied to Eliza’s choices. The price is more social than personal, slightly limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single scene, single POV, clean orientation, and a held accumulative/situational drive culminating in a Decisive Change: the skeptic becomes a carrier. Causal threads (ring vibration → approach → storm man → aurora “result” → choice) cohere, and the ring dissolving provides on‑page cost. A global cutaway (“All across the world…”) skews expositional but doesn’t break the closure. The price—foreclosing the skeptic’s prior stance and assuming responsibility—lands in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: past events propel him causally to the cave, while the ending lands as a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is swift and clean; the causal chain (discovery → retrieval → repainting) holds. Closure arrives in the act of repainting and in the charged final image, with an emotional cost in relinquishing critics’ approval. Stakes and turn are modest but coherent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid drive (situational + causal): the map discovery and the postal plate alignment produce a clear “therefore” that culminates in the decision to go. Orientation is clean; props and rules set early return with function. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she commits to a dangerous, honesty‑only path, with conceptual and social cost legible. Stakes remain mostly anticipatory rather than directly tested on the page, trimming the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: discovery → creation → communal adoption → elegiac finale, with a clean Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing in the final spectrum pulse at her death. Orientation is clear and causal links are intact. The cost is legible as a life poured into work, though key turns are relayed rather than staged, softening immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under a hybrid lens (causal spine with an accumulative cadence), the escalation from destabilizing magnetosphere to controlled burn miniaturization tracks cleanly. Closure lands with cost on the page: the original body is inert while the garden lives through distributed selves. A few mechanics (miniaturization, chaos containment) are hand-wavy but consistent within the established world logic. Orientation is strong from the outset and held through to the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: dawn vignettes and gathered anecdotes tighten toward the mailbox opening and communal reprise. Closure is a conceptual repricing—the locket reframes as communal memory—and it’s on the page. Causality is serviceable but softened by convenience (key appears late with minimal friction). Stakes remain modest and mostly social/emotional, yet coherent to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.3)
    Hybrid lens (mainly causal with lyric accumulation): rolls → dance → systems awaken → Lydia appears. Orientation is clean from the outset, and a closure unit lands as the lab reboots. The cost is thin—no real sacrifice or foreclosed path—so the ending functions more as Conceptual Repricing than decisive change. Still, the sequence coheres and pays off established methods.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: ritual → readings → excavation → crystal → reburial produces a coherent because/therefore flow while the density of images escalates. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: she reframes loss and adopts a sustainable practice (reburial, mapping pockets). The cost is conceptual—she cannot retrieve, only visit—made legible at the crystal and sealed by reburial. Orientation is clear from the opening, and the two‑shard structure (workshop to beach) holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece coheres: density and patterned imagery build toward the wing absorbing the prophecy and the crane’s release. Orientation (who/where/when) is established early and holds. Closure lands on the page (prophecy contained and dispersed), but the felt cost is light and the outcome never seems in doubt. The single-scene structure stays clean with one decisive cadence shift near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers weekly teas toward the rooftop interrogation and lineage reveal. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with the seal’s transfer and a conceptual repricing of Clara’s “gift” as inheritance. Orientation is clean; causality is gentle but coherent. The cost (secrecy, demolished heritage) is present but understated, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres through cadence and density: twilight → resonance activation → memory surge → role acceptance. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the set-ups (shell, crystals, dawn threshold) pay off. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a legible price (guardianship burden, relinquishing “pure skepticism”). Cost is clear but not punishing, keeping this shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal chain: mysterious key → hidden decree → written addendum → blood seal → departure. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with implied cost (confession, consequences) and a clear before/after. The key is a convenient catalyst but is seeded early and pays off logically. Scope and single scene are well managed without temporal confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates through progressive disclosures to a clean on‑page closure: the child’s choice and the singer’s reconfiguration. Causality is coherent—seashell murmurs → recognition of threat → soothing song → offered choice → decision—and the final image reweights the premise. Cost is present but subdued (her identity reoriented, the shell’s silence), fitting the mode. Orientation is solid from the start, and the scene holds as one continuous window.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the piece builds through patterned dream fragments toward a reweighted ending where the captain is released and the truth is public. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—stasis earned by exposure without accusation and the captain’s peace—though cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized. Orientation is clean and the two-shard structure (dive → shrine/dream-work) holds. Much of the plot unfolds in summary, which softens the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual → moon paths → parapet → return, culminating in a quiet Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is strong from the outset (cabin by river, nets, tea ritual). Closure lands as a charged reprise (tea whisk, dawn, fading paths) with a conceptual cost (choosing appreciation over explanation). The cost is subtle, not acute, keeping the ceiling below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV and orientation are clean; the causal chain (search → letters → realization → decision) holds. Closure functions as a Charged Poise decision to conceal and resist, with cost implied (corporate threat) rather than enacted. The dust storm and orchard’s response provide a timely tightening, but escalation remains modest and largely summarized. Lens reads Hybrid leaning Situational at the end, coherent if not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: storms → decoding → prophet’s emergence → Elias’s clarified role. Orientation is crisp early, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he accepts “translator” over “leader,” with the vigil persisting at a price. The cost is felt, if quiet—continuing isolation as the prophet takes the crowds. Escalation is primarily informational and tonal rather than event‑driven, but it holds and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: morning discovery → charged capture → communal release leading to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early) with one tidy transition to the senior center. Closure lands in the room’s transformation and the poet’s quiet witnessing; cost is subtle (relinquishing his find, emotional expenditure) but present. Slight softness in on-page price prevents a higher score, not a break.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clean causal chain: broadcast → sprint → key/door → tuning fork → ritual → intruders repelled → vow. Orientation is strong from the opening image, single POV, one continuous scene, and the drive lens remains causal through closure. Closure lands on‑page as a Decisive Change (protection renewed; intruders neutralized) with a light price signal (physical strain, assumed ongoing duty). Escalation is linear and efficient, if a touch easy.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: details build toward the moon‑zenith hum as confirmation and beginning. Orientation is strong early (who/where/when) and the single scene flows into dawn. Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise—confirmation of theory and a start—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt, limiting impact. No causal breaks, but pressure never meaningfully narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal spine is clean: overlooked detail → lantern opened → note reveals corruption → choice to act despite risk. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when) and maintained. Closure lands as Charged Poise with a legible cost (“jeopardize her career”). External resistance is mostly implied rather than embodied, but does not harm the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres cleanly: shop arrival → examination → moral reframing → renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he refuses repair, choosing the heart’s silence as a living burden. Cost is legible via foregone repair and the prior, weighty action (buying the house) that reconfigures the heart’s meaning. Orientation is crisp and no causal seams show.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain: find arrow tip → kaleidoscope transliteration → hidden chamber → bell strike. Closure lands on the page with a resonant final image (inaudible note, felt vibration, acid sea’s pause). The cost is conceptual—solitude of an unheard achievement—rather than dramatized materially, limiting peak impact. Orientation is strong from the outset; the single scene holds.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong causal chain: 731 pattern → restricted sectors → fabricated credentials → access → discovery → alarms → flight. Closure lands with on‑page cost (alarms, career/freedom jeopardized) and a decisive change of state (she has the evidence and goes underground). Orientation is solid early (role, setting, task) and held. The only minor limitation is low resistance in the breach itself beyond the ticking validation window.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Structure coheres under an accumulative/textural lens: the ritual gathers density and culminates in the crystal’s reconstitution on the page. Orientation (who/where/when) is clean early, and the method via mirrors is seeded and paid off. Closure lands (crystal restored), though cost is light and elders’ pressure remains offstage. The because/therefore chain is modest but intact through the ritual focus.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the piece layers ice/wind/parasol motifs toward a closing reconfiguration where she decides to stay. Orientation is clean early; the cadence shift lands when the “fold in patience” reframes her initial timeline. Closure is a resonant renunciation with conceptual cost (foregoing the death she came to claim), though that cost remains mostly implied. The single-scene continuity and tight focus support the ending’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/textural lens: recurring motifs (pavilion, bus, letter) build toward a Conceptual Repricing where solitude is revalued. Orientation is clear from the opening and remains stable. Closure lands in a quiet, earned stasis/CR: he redefines connection without proximity, accepting cost. The causal chain is largely associative, not event‑driven, but coherent for the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pattern intensifies (murmuring → light circle → harmony → charged silence) to a quiet closure: echo preserved, calling accepted with cost. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis—continuity accepted despite isolation—with a clear before/after (pre‑consecration vs. after storage). The cost is stated more than enacted, softening impact. Structure holds one scene cleanly with a single deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative/textural drive is coherent: preparation → assembly → communal connection → closing circle. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (the factory reframed from decay to resilience and the group linked), but the cost is soft. Orientation is clean early, and the ritual pattern is taught and kept. The lack of a sharper tightening limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the scene densifies toward the crystal’s pure tone and the conceptual repricing (preserve → translate). Orientation is clear early (library at dawn; scholar; crystal). Closure arrives on-page with the resonant tone image, though the cost is largely conceptual rather than dramatized. Causality is soft but coherent within the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern tightens through arranged markers → chalk drawing → emergent hum, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clear from the opening and the props pay off (arch, chalk, driftwood). Cost is legible: he secures the sound only to lose it, and he departs alone. The closure image (beginning the markers for home) locks the before/after without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of tremors → attunement attempts → outdoor listening → filter restructuring coheres and culminates in a clear RR/CR. Orientation is clean early (observatory, tremors, clock). Closure lands on-page as tremors subside through alignment rather than force. The price is subtle (a reframing of method and limits) rather than visibly paid, which tempers peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single‑scene accumulative design is clean: family arrival → music enactment → charged object transfer → death → soft cadence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the son holding the shard, the music bridging denial and acceptance, with death as the paid cost. Orientation is solid from the first paragraph, and set‑ups (vinyl, “no tears,” scent) pay off. The pressure tightens without a hard turn, consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal throughline is clean: loops closed → key engaged → shadow‑map → doorway and conceptual answer. Closure qualifies as a conceptual repricing with a charged poise for the next journey. Cost is implied (becoming a beacon, isle trembling) rather than paid on the page, softening impact. Orientation is strong from the outset (who, where, when) and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the scene coheres and tightens from tooth placement to apparition to exchange, landing in a Charged Poise closure. Causality is intact (tooth circle → vibration → emergence → dissolution), though resistance is gentle. Cost registers conceptually as surrendering certainty rather than via concrete jeopardy. Orientation is clean early; scope fits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: repeated craft acts and images build to a resonant reconfiguration where her purpose is reweighted (earthbound yet star-sharing). Orientation is clean early; the grotto, sea, and workshop are stable anchors. Closure carries conceptual cost in the refusal/acceptance of spacefaring dreams, legible in “no longer felt weighed down… but lifted by what she had made possible.” Pressure remains gentle, limiting upper-band eligibility but not closure validity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and patterns (spiral, moss, hush) densify toward the offering, then the coda seals the reweighting. Closure lands on the page via an Earned Stasis/RR: she relinquishes the pendant and forecloses a path, with the environment charging the choice. Orientation is clean from the outset; single scene plus a brief epilogue stays within scope. The cost is legible in the final act and image.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring mist, shell, and vow build to a Resonant Reconfiguration when he solemnizes the manuscript and reads the final paragraph. Orientation is clean (who/where/why established early) and the end reweights the premise. Cost is largely conceptual/identity-based rather than dramatized with consequence, but the before/after is legible. Structure stays within a single scene with reflective braids that pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under a causal lens, the vine’s vision → deadline → research → device → performance sequence holds and pays off. Closure lands with a decisive change: the village remembers and resumes sacred practice. The cost is mostly effort and urgency, not a sharp on‑page sacrifice, which slightly softens the cadence. Orientation is clear early and remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual density builds to the sealing and the orchard’s transformation. Closure is on‑page (Decisive Change: starlight captured; environment renewed). Orientation is clean early; the single scene sustains. Cost is asserted rather than paid, softening the end’s impact under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pattern‑gathering builds to the mechanism’s awakening, which reconfigures options (the harvest resumes). Orientation is clean early (who/where/season), and the through‑line holds. Closure lands on the page with the cavern thrumming and echoes returning; cost is implied (weeks of labor, season’s wound) rather than dramatized at the end. The beat sequence is coherent but low on decisive jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the ritual sequence deepens from king to farmer to self to civilization, culminating in a conceptual repricing at closure. Orientation is clear from the outset; single POV and scene are coherent. Cost is legible in the ongoing obligation and the delicate handling of the self‑burden. Slightly soft pressure, but closure lands on page without a causal break.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: kettle as clock, rain patterning, and carving density build to a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. The cost—ongoing grief accepted as practice—lands on the page when she places the lion with its “brothers” and names it “Here and gone.” Orientation is crystal‑clear early and never falters. The closure is resonant if quiet; a touch more pressure would have pushed it into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive with causal dominance: find wheel → harness → images → bridge → confrontation → dissolution → carousel restarts. Orientation is strong early, and the sequence pays off with an on‑page Decisive Change (wheel sacrificed, time re‑aligned) that carries cost. A single, clean tightening move (word‑bridge to the ghost) keeps coherence. The negotiation resolves swiftly, but without breaking logic or robbing the ending of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under a causal lens, the chain is clean: discovery → decision to restore power → labor → switch throw → lights → sextant inscriptions reprice the premise. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the scene holds as one continuous window. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (terminal reframed as navigation of hope), though the on‑page cost is modest. The payoff honors set‑ups without teleports or late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the crystal hum, dawn light, and bear’s presence intensify toward the offering of the watch and the decision to return to craft. Closure lands on the page with cost—the relinquishing of a sealed relic and the acceptance of risk—and reconfigures the premise. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when within the first lines). No causality breaks; the cadence shift near the end feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: arrival → search → coded journal → conceptual repricing with the sundial. Orientation is clean and single‑scene. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing (realizing the city’s history is constructed and choosing to train others). The cost is conceptual and forward‑loaded rather than dramatized on the page, keeping it out of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece tightens through hours of patient decoding to the transfer of the knotted rope. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who, where, when) and causality is clean (compliment → watch/listen → fulgurite → trust → gift). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he earns entry through attention, with patience as price. Cost is gentle but on‑page (time, cold, humility), enough at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: details and motifs densify until the choice to write his own obituary reconfigures meaning (RR/CR). Orientation is clean (who/where/when established early), and the palace thread persists as a constraint in the final image. Cost is legible in facing long‑avoided grief and culpable absence. Minor declaratives don’t undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal chain is tight: assemble → activate → transformation → fade → realization and renewed plan. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/earned stasis with visible cost (temporary beauty, failure, and a harder future path). Orientation is clean from the opening image; single scene coherence holds. The device failing sustains pressure rather than resetting it.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues from the advancing fire to embers landing, then releases as the cloud migration passes. Orientation is clear and the two shards (garden action → lagoon reflection → station) remain coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—garden saved, legacy repurposed—though the on‑page cost is soft. Causal links are present but secondary to cadence and motif.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    Causal chain is clean: breadcrumbs → false pedestal → starlight key → window → box → imaginative release → fountains revive. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (city reawakens, role assumption), but the price is mostly conceptual. Orientation is strong early, and the single-scene arc holds; the window-to-box turn is convenient yet set up by the breadcrumb logic. Tight and legible, if a little too easily won.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: prepare → transit → deliver → return, with a quiet RR/CR landing as the being carries hope that patterns might break. Orientation is clean early (nebula garden, gear, sonar) and closure is on-page. Cost is conceptual—eternity with yearning—rather than dramatized sacrifice. The arc lacks a tough turn or narrowing that would heighten consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: patterns (ribbon, butterflies, poems) intensify toward a resonant reconfiguration as the monument is completed. Orientation is clean from the outset; the greenhouse/migration clock coheres. Closure lands with cost and repricing: mentor’s role ends, ribbon nearly gone, and the monument reframes grief as collective. Causality is soft but consistent with the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal flow is solid: inscriptions → realization → call for help → collective repair → bell rings. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change and a resonant final image, and the cost is legible in the relinquishing of solitary mastery. The afternoon’s swift communal success feels slightly convenient but stays within the short form’s allowances. Orientation is clear early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Conceptual Repricing paired with an Earned Stasis (guarding the truth). The clock’s zero → hum → decoding → revelation sequence coheres, and the final reset reframes the cycle with a new understanding. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (“sacrificial rather than romantic”), modest but present. Orientation is clear early (cobalt silo, chess clock, tapestry) and remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure gathers around the suspended moment before writing, culminating in a charged completion. Orientation is immediate and clear; the scene maintains a single window and stake. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: she writes the map and accepts vigilance, but the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized. The “cracks forming” gives a light on‑page tightening without a reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear single-POV arc with an accumulative lens: prep → broadcast → reflection, closed by a charged poise image (dust whispering on). Orientation is strong from the opening (copyist, alcove, radio) and the world‑rule is taught early. Closure lands conceptually rather than causally; the cost is mostly stated (danger, censors) not stress‑tested in the present. Still, the ending reweights the premise with a coherent before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece coheres around the mask’s completion and the rocking chair’s deceleration, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing realization (“no safety in completion”). Orientation is clean early; single‑scene unity holds. Closure lands with felt conceptual cost: accepting process over completion as a loss of imagined security. The turn is quiet but legible and earned by repeating craft beats that tighten toward display.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation is crisp early (sewers under a post-plague city; Council above), and the accumulative lens holds. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he places the cog among treasures, reaffirming preservation over erasure. The cost is implied (risk of the Council, social isolation) rather than enacted on the page, which softens impact. Structure is single-threaded and coherent with one meaningful cadence shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: patterned returns (library, rosette, “subtracting noise”) accrue toward a Charged Poise closure as she gifts the rosette. The before/after is legible—she yields leadership while preserving the lineage—with a conceptual cost (relinquishment; the risk of traditions fading). Causality is mostly summary‑driven but coherent; the closure image lands. The price is felt more conceptually than viscerally, limiting upper‑band potential.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single‑scene accumulative build is clean: greenhouse, alignment, planting, then a charged final image. Closure lands via a quiet, earned stance—he plants now under a narrow celestial window, foreclosing inaction with a conceptual cost. Orientation is solid early, and the causal rhythm (preparation → alignment peak → planting) holds. The cost remains more conceptual than felt on the page, preventing a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.7)
    Causal flow is clean: blackout → anomalies → riddle → keycard access → transformer damage → supervisor confrontation → reframing at closure. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (honesty as bridge; tech/wonder repriced). The riddle solution comes a bit conveniently, softening pressure. Still, the ascent provides a single meaningful tightening and the final image pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the ritual repetitions gather until the lighthouse glow and felt vibration reweight meaning. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—the shard lets her perceive a hum of attachment, redefining “alive houses.” Cost is soft but present as acceptance of presence-as-echo and the mortality it implies. Orientation is clean and the cadence shift at the glow beat is decisive for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the revelations build from instruction to experiential immersion, culminating in a conceptual repricing where “answers” yield to better questions. Causality within the mode is clean: acceptance permits access to the ampoule’s contents, which reconfigures understanding. Closure lands on-page with a legible before/after in stance. The cost is primarily conceptual rather than situational, but it is present and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a Causal lens, the chain is clear: study → fracture discovery → placement of chipped die → rupture → second-chance bet. Closure is an on‑page Decisive Change with a resonant re-entry to the bar and an enacted choice. Orientation is clean from the start; the two-shard structure holds. The cost is more conceptual than embodied at the peak, keeping it just shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a steady build (moonlight → daydreams → mural → dawn) and closes on a quiet Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing as her belief crystallizes. Orientation is clean and the single‑scene window holds; however, the closure’s cost is soft (insomnia, solitude) and the ending assurance borders on pre‑told. One meaningful cadence shift occurs at dawn, but it lacks a sharp narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a causal lens, the beat chain (lens → recognition of “movement” → ritual application → warmth → thaw) tracks cleanly. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: the thaw begins and the city’s options reconfigure. The cost—lingering dread, cultural fray—remains present, though not deeply cashed on the page. Orientation is immediate and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal throughline is strong: low tide window → puzzle resistance → insight about counter‑clockwise spin → activation → world shift. Orientation is established early and maintained; single‑scene progression is clean. Closure lands as a decisive change/conceptual repricing, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt, which blunts impact. Still, the “click” and tidal return create a crisp cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: paradoxes, mirror, clasp, and luminance tighten toward a conceptual repricing that redefines death as transformation. Closure lands on‑page as the funhouse dissolves and luminance moves into the veins—a visible shift with conceptual cost (relinquishing the protective fear narrative). Orientation is clean from the opening line; single scene coherence maintained. The cost reads more metaphysical than lived, limiting peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, orientation is crisp and the sequence coheres: blue hour → cloud threat → musical intervention → dawn rest. Closure lands as an earned stasis/charged poise: the storm skirts them and she retires, the cycle continuing at a cost of vigilance. The causal suggestion that sound diverts the storm is present but lightly asserted. Cost is felt but soft, limiting punch.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain is clean: whistle pattern → shell response → chamber → journal/evidence → revaluation of watchers/gate → new purpose. Orientation is solid and the closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a credible earned-stasis choice. The cost is present but mostly conceptual and summarized in the journal block, diluting immediacy. Still, the final nod to the watchers coheres the lens and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. Each step (letter → architectural matches → carved initials → ledger) tightens knowledge toward a concrete discovery. Closure lands with the ledger’s revelation, a Conceptual Repricing that reframes the official narrative with a visible social cost. The cost is more conceptual than felt, but it’s present and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The scene tightens from observation to recovery (wresting the box) to a charged ritual (placing his own note), closing on a poised return tomorrow. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: his role shifts from surveyor to custodian of human longing, with the inkwell’s weight as cost. Causality is clean, though the price remains primarily conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: discoveries accrue (sealed scrolls → hypothesis → maps/journal confirmation) toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Orientation is strong and the lens holds; the blackout constraint coherently drives tactics. Closure lands via his decision to “readjust his life’s work,” though the cost is primarily conceptual rather than dramatized. Because/therefore chains are present but soft; escalation is more cumulative than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: workshop → journey → basilica placement → felt release. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with visible cost (“final dream” released; tears). Orientation is clean early and the single stake tightens toward the act of letting go. The beat sequence is simple but purposeful and holds its pattern through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.3)
    Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: window from cooling breakers → descent → pool → absorption → return/transformation. Structure holds as two shards with one transition and a legible before/after (tool and self reweighted). However, the closure lacks a visible price—no obstacle tests the mission—so the decisive change reads conceptual more than hard‑won. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/mission), and setups pay off without teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; patterns and density build toward a resonance event that reweights meaning. Orientation is crisp early, and the sequence from launch to convergence to pull reads as coherent escalation. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: belonging reframed and the chip’s “missing pieces” recoded through her. The cost is mostly conceptual (surrendering tool‑primacy to self-recognition), which tempers impact.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene builds via repeated returns to the carvings and watch hand until the grandfather’s piece appears, delivering a clear Conceptual Repricing with cost. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the single scene coheres. The closure image—pairing the two watch hands and the decision to shut the business—lands on the page with felt consequence. Causality is simple but intact; no unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single scene, coherent stakes, and an accumulative drive that tightens around the moon‑timed ritual to apology/forgiveness. Closure lands on the page via a decisive verbal exchange and a reweighted symbol (drawer pull), with a conceptual cost (relinquishing grievances). Orientation is crisp from the outset. The causal chain relies more on ritual cadence than conflict turns, but it holds.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: present‑tense paddling + charged object + pattern break (dolphins) create a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clear early; the closure’s cost—accepting career loss while adopting a humbler practice—is legible. Escalation is modest and largely interior but coherent at this length. A sharper on‑page test of her new stance would raise impact.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure holds: newspaper → tunnels → leftmost choice → meeting younger self → signing completes the loop. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing/charged poise: accepting a self‑created loop of empathy with an implied cost of repetition. Causality is coherent enough under a hybrid lens, though pressure feels soft. The cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: ritual preparation → transformation → brief contact → fade as spices diminish. Orientation is crisp (who/where/when) and the single-scene structure coheres. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she accepts the limit and carries a sustaining bond; the cost is the necessary parting. Cost is slightly soft but present on the page (“as the moon reached its zenith… the connection began to fade”).

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: ritual density builds to a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis—time cannot be controlled, only inhabited. Orientation is clean from the outset; the saucer and cards pay off in the shimmer/wind/dissolution turn and the epilogue reweights earlier images. On‑page cost is the foreclosed path of “fixing” time, legible in the final vow. The structure is tidy but cohesive, with one meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the density of ritual detail (tear as needle, shimmer-map, meditation chamber) coheres toward a decisive opening and crossing. Orientation is clean early; the through-line from preparation to final stitch is tight and paid off. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (dimension opens; Eli crosses) and a felt cost (abandoning the ship/body-world). Minor softening: escalation is mostly unopposed, but the risk of collapse preserves enough pressure for the cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the alignment, beach hush, and prophecy build toward a Conceptual Repricing: Ian becomes an agent of transformation by relinquishing his prized objects. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the closure cost is on-page. Coincidence is thematic rather than a crutch. The turns are soft but coherent and earned by pattern rather than plot machinery.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure lands as a Charged Poise: power returns and the finished sundial quietly reweights the field; conceptual cost (risk of discovery) is legible though not paid. Orientation is clear early, and the throughline from blackout to covert completion is coherent. The causal tightening is modest, relying on mood rather than a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is consistent: stones → pulses → eruption → reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the opening image, and set-ups (math sequences, eels, dust) pay off. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the dust integrating and the visions reframed. The cost at the ending is modest but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the storm, timer beeps, and mask‑slip window build toward a Charged Poise closing image. Orientation is crisp from the first lines (who/where/when and regime pressure). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she claims voice and intent—but the cost is conceptual rather than dramatized, keeping it below top tier. The beats link coherently without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.6)
    Drive lens reads Hybrid with a light causal spine (decode → coordinates) layered over a textural motif of “dignified chaos.” Orientation is clean and the single-scene structure holds, but escalation is modest and cost at closure is low. The decode lands, then the piece diffuses into demonstration and a tidy exit; the final shift is more affirmation than decisive change. Closure resembles a conceptual repricing without palpable price.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat adds density—tin → seeds → banned words → rebuilding—culminating in a charged poise as he seals the tin and recommits. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise; the cost (eroded memory, ongoing risk, chosen endurance) is legible. Orientation is clean early and sustained. The structure lacks a singular decisive turn, but the final reprise reweights the stake effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal chain is coherent: failing compasses → impending shutdown → clock anomaly → researched method → archive descent → projector portal. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: stepping into the liminal “space between moments” and the promise to return reweights time and grief. The cost at closure is more conceptual than felt on the page; risk and sacrifice are implied rather than made undeniable in a single charged image. Orientation is strong early and the single-POV window holds.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.9)
    Drive lens: Causal. Because/therefore links are clean (dreams → waterfall → stone circles → song → awakening), and closure lands on the page with the ancestors’ voices and the monsoon’s onset. The cost is mostly conceptual/psychic (weight of generations, lingering doubt) rather than enacted, but the before/after is legible. Orientation is crisp early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density and ritual steps lead to a Charged Poise/RR closure as the needle points to his heart and glows. Orientation is clean early (islet after rain, glass case, bonsai, compass) and the sequence of moves coheres. The cost—voicing truth and reconfiguring grief—is legible on the page. It’s a quiet escalation rather than a sharp causal turn, but consistent with the lens.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively. The structure builds through a series of observations, increasing the density of meaning around the central theme. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing where Elena's worldview shifts, with the cost being the foreclosure of her old professional life, which is felt rather than explicitly paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story establishes a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) drive and achieves a Decisive Change for closure. However, the central causal link is critically flawed; the leap from seeing patterns in frost to deducing a complex mineral smuggling operation ("her artistic process could reveal the location of valuable mineral deposits") is massive and unearned. This makes the pivotal moment of discovery feel like a convenient epiphany rather than a logical conclusion, weakening the entire structure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mood that culminates in a Conceptual Repricing of "music." The structure is coherent, with clear setup and closure. The primary weakness is the lack of a meaningful tightening or reversal; the progression from attempt to success is linear and frictionless, making the final earned stasis feel more like a foregone conclusion than a hard-won change.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal drive. The plot progresses logically from the inciting incident (receiving the package) to the resolution. The closure, a Decisive Change where Elias accepts his new role, is on the page and reprices his life's purpose with the cost of his former existence. The transition from the surface world to the library is efficient, though the convenience of the submarine captain is a minor contrivance that slightly softens the cause-and-effect chain.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain under a Causal lens. The inciting incident (Mira's news) leads directly to the Decisive Change (the public declaration), which lands on the page with a clear conceptual cost—the shift from covert survival to overt, riskier solidarity. The structure is tight, orientation is immediate, and the closure provides a powerful, earned reconfiguration of the community's future.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a two-shard structure that works well for its reflective nature. The driving lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of where love is stored—lands with a clear, felt cost as the tear dissolves. The mystical causality (breathing -> projection) is internally consistent and serves the story's logic without feeling unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean two-shard structure, with a clear transition and logical progression. The final Decisive Change—Elara's disintegration into the garden—is a powerful, earned closure with a legible cost. The reappearance of the halo fragment feels slightly convenient, but within the story's reality-bending rules, it functions as an acceptable catalyst for the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.5)
    The causal structure is sound and the closure, a Decisive Change with cost, is legible. However, the plot's progression hinges on significant coincidences—the key being a specific childhood song, the message-arrow also being a perfect lockpick—which undermine the narrative's credibility and tension. The resolution of the central puzzle feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is well-established, and the story provides a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the closure is weakened by soft causality; the sound "began to change" on its own, an external event that grants Kael his epiphany. A stronger ending would have rooted this change in his perception or a decisive act, and the cost of his long obsession is not felt sharply in the final, gentle resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens, with the heist logically enabling the workshop revelation. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR) that lands on the page with a clear conceptual cost: the reframing of Lillian's identity and purpose. Orientation is established immediately, and the two-shard structure (station, workshop) is handled seamlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure effectively, building thematic weight through recurring images rather than a causal plot. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, is earned and potent; the shift from "dramatically declaring" to a whispered "we thaw" provides a decisive cadence change that makes the internal shift legible. The felt cost of his "emotional winter" is well-established, making the final moment of release impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain within a single scene, moving from hiding to discovery to a climactic confrontation. The closure is a well-executed Charged Poise, crystallizing the stakes and the character's new stance. However, the structure is heavily reliant on a large backstory dump that summarizes the inciting incident rather than dramatizing it, which slightly weakens the narrative's foundation even if the present-moment causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, where the oracle's purpose crystallizes and the meaning of "endless night" shifts from an ending to a canvas. The cost—the permanent loss of the old world symbolized by the final star's vanishing—is tangible and gives the final image of the glowing map its profound weight. Causality holds perfectly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and internal pressure toward a single, transformative event. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR), as Unit 347's understanding of consciousness is fundamentally rewritten. The cost—surrendering its analytical stability—is legible in the line "surrendering to the looped timelines rather than analyzing them," and the change is confirmed on the page. The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the story's length and ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    The plot follows a clean, compelling causal chain: finding the lens leads to understanding doodles, which leads to the map, the hidden room, and the final choice. The closure, a Decisive Change in strategy and a Conceptual Repricing of "silence," lands with the felt cost of renouncing a powerful shortcut. The structure is nearly flawless for this length, only slightly weakened by summarizing the outcome in the final paragraphs rather than leaving it in a moment of Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot isn't a causal chain but a deepening ritual that builds toward a resonant final state.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a commendably clear and effective Causal drive, with each action logically leading to the next. The closure is a strong Decisive Change, as the protagonist proves her theory and finds a new purpose, a change that lands with conceptual cost on the page. The structure is nearly flawless but is capped below 9.0 due to prose artifacts that dull the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural drive. Orientation is immediate and clear, and the structure builds logically toward the climax. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), as the final peaceful hush provides a palpable 'after' state. The cost is legible in the dissolution of the antique program, an artifact whose purpose has been fulfilled, providing a satisfying sense of finality.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story uses a strong Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens, where a causal chain of discovery builds toward an atmospheric resolution. The structure is tight and the orientation is immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot advances through a deepening of knowledge and atmosphere rather than causal conflict, moving from anomaly detection to immersion and retreat. The closure is a model of Earned Stasis (an RR form), where the keeper rejects the temptation of preservation to return to their purpose, with the cost felt in the return to the "river's roar." The origami swan mechanism provides elegant, non-prosaic causality for the transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean, effective accumulative/situational structure, building pressure toward a single, decisive moment. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure—Lila speaking—is a Decisive Change that lands with palpable emotional cost on the page, earned by the protagonist's gentle, persistent efforts culminating in the catalysing event of the eclipse. The causality is soft but coherent and appropriate for the story's aims.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot progresses through a steady layering of discoveries—vibration, tapestry, diaries—that deepens the central mystery without causal breaks. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the final understanding of the dragons and the axis redefines the historian's purpose and the meaning of the "bronze quiet," landing with the felt cost of cosmic loss and loneliness. The structure is elegant and effective for the story's length and aims.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal/Accumulative structure, with each discovery logically building toward the next. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Eleanor finds a new stasis as a teacher, is earned and lands with a legible cost (the permanent loss of her old life). The plot is slightly weakened by the convenient, un-foreshadowed arrival of the students, which feels more like a concluding tableau than an earned narrative beat.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain of events under a Causal lens, leading to a Decisive Change on the page. The structure is sound, with a chance discovery effectively initiating the climax. However, the closure is weakened by a conceptual, told cost ("burdened... by the responsibility") rather than a viscerally felt or dramatized one, which keeps the ending from achieving maximum impact.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, moving from a clear setup to a well-defined climax and closure. The final Conceptual Repricing, where Elias re-frames his grief, is legible and earned with the felt cost of accepting that memories will both "haunt and comfort him."

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows a clean two-shard structure with an effective time jump, leading to a strong Conceptual Repricing for its closure. The final image of the locket with its empty space is a powerful, resonant symbol of a future commitment. The plot's reliance on the coincidence of a mistaken envelope is acceptable as an inciting incident rather than a resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal structure, with a clear inciting incident, rising action, and a decisive change for closure. The progression from an individual's ache to a group's shared history is logical and well-paced for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an effective Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through ritualistic detail toward a clear closure. The ending is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the shifted patterns and renewed hope reframe Elara's future options with the felt cost of continued emotional risk. The structure is tight, well-paced, and perfectly suited to the story's length and ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot is elegantly constructed with a clean causal chain: the power outage enables the search, which leads to the discovery of the fragment, which triggers a memory and realization, culminating in a decision. The closure is a well-executed Charged Poise, as the protagonist resolves to act, reconfiguring the stakes (risk of discovery vs. fulfillment of purpose) with a clearly felt cost. The structure is flawless for this length, holding the Causal lens from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story uses an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through observation until a decisive choice is made. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with a legible cost ("destruction in some areas"). However, the frequent use of time compression ("weeks passed") slightly softens the causal chain, making the progression feel more like a summary of an arc than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The structure adheres to an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through imagery and culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration. The discovery of the brooch provides a solid inciting incident, and the exchange serves as a meaningful turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds pressure not through causal decisions but through a steady intensification of atmospheric and supernatural phenomena. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing, as Elara's entire understanding of her gift is reconfigured, with the cost being the loss of her cherished predictability. The final image lands this shift with undeniable force, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively. The structure, built on accumulating fragments and "staggered" revelations, is coherent and serves the story's purpose.

The causality of discovery (valve -> vision -> diary -> understanding) is sound and propels the narrative to its resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear, linear progression under a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens. The closure, a Decisive Change leading to Charged Poise, lands on the page with a felt cost (his old life becoming memory). However, the plot relies more on a sequence of magical discoveries than on choices that narrow options, making the progression feel passive at times.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, successfully building a mood toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the tower becomes a sanctuary. The closure lands on the page, but the felt cost is soft; Elara's sacrifice of solitude and skepticism is more of a gentle evolution than a priced decision. The structure is coherent for its length, though it lacks a sharp, decisive turn, relying instead on a gradual deepening of understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story's causal structure is strong and logical, moving from inciting incident to a clear resolution. The closure is an effective Conceptual Repricing where Alistair's understanding of his existence is re-framed with a legible cost—the relinquishing of his specific hope to reunite with Elara. While some plot points like the amulet's origin feel convenient, the overall architecture is sound and well-suited for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, with each step of Maya's plan leading logically to the next. Orientation is excellent, and the scope is perfectly controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive perfectly. There is no traditional plot, but the structure of layered reflections and observations builds coherently toward the final closure—a powerful Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist accepts their new form of existence. The cost is the permanent loss of their former, documented self, a price made tangible in the final lines. Orientation is established immediately and held throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens with a strong sense of progression: arrival, discovery, interaction, resolution. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the meaning of the "universal riddle" is re-evaluated, changing the protagonist's entire worldview. The cost is legible—her professional identity is "forever changed"—and the structure is perfectly suited to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story adopts a summary structure, compressing what should be weeks or months of action into a few paragraphs. This approach bypasses the "because/therefore" tension of a causal chain, making the final resolution with the junior council member feel convenient and unearned. While a Decisive Change occurs, its foundation is built on synopsis, not scene.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens. The setup (mission, timer) leads directly to the execution and climax (photographing the fireflies as the timer runs out). The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: Elena succeeds in her mission, but the cost—the permanent loss of the species—is made undeniably clear, re-framing the value of "progress." The plot structure is flawless for this length, with every beat contributing to the final, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure is simple but effective, moving from problem to diagnosis to resolution.

The causal chain of the repair itself is perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is elegant and effective, employing an Accumulative/Textural drive that builds momentum beautifully. The plot progresses logically from hypothesis to confirmation and discovery.

The final image provides a perfect, resonant conclusion to this structure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens successfully, building pressure through repetition rather than causal turns. The structure is simple and elegant, moving from diagnosis to treatment to resolution. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis, is achieved on the page with a clear before/after state for the town. The only notable flaw is the brief, un-signaled POV shift to "Persephone," which momentarily breaks the established focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's Causal lens is expertly handled, with a clean, linear progression from problem to high-stakes choice to resolution. The closure is a decisive change—obtaining the temporal sample—with a clear, on-page cost (near-drowning and the temple sealing forever). The plot is perfectly scoped for the word count, delivering a complete and satisfying arc without a single wasted beat.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. It builds pressure not through causal events but through layered repetition and thematic intensification.

The cost—facing the consequences of the "bodies" with his own truth—is clearly felt, making the ending both earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is elegant and effective, moving from stasis to a catalyzed climax and resonant denouement. The closure, a Decisive Change leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands with a palpable cost—her own existence—that feels both tragic and fulfilling.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through Elara's persistent work and the villagers' growing concern. The structure is clean, moving from discovery to transformation.

The structure is simple, elegant, and appropriate for the story's aims.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens from discovery to action, with the inciting incident (impossible galaxy alignment) leading directly to the climax (completing the tapestry). The closure is a Decisive Change, set in motion on-page. However, the resolution's causality is soft; the assertion that "small disruptions... could unravel the entire conspiracy" feels convenient and under-dramatized, lessening the impact of the final earned action.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure effectively. Orientation is swift and clear. The plot builds emotional density through a series of magical intensifications that lead to a Resonant Reconfiguration for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building Elena’s transformation through a sequence of five "awakenings." The structure is clear and holds through the ending. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR), where Elena's worldview is fundamentally altered at the cost of her professional certainty, sealed by the on-page action of returning the nickel. The rapid, almost mechanical succession of awakenings slightly tempers the feeling of an organic journey.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an effective Accumulative/Textural structure, building a dense and compelling world of resistance that culminates in a clear moment of Charged Poise.

The tightening of pressure—the expansion of the tax to dreams and memories—provides a sufficient causal trigger for the "final phase."

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly. The structure is simple but elegant, building pressure through gradual transformation rather than causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building insight through a series of discoveries. The closure is a clean example of Charged Poise, as Elara crystallizes her solution and prepares for the coming debate. However, the causal chain relies on a series of convenient discoveries—the envelope, the adhesive's specific contents, the easily found inscription—that feel more like a fortunate sequence than a struggle against resistance, slightly weakening the plot's structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building meaning through associated images. The closure—a Decisive Change in restarting the service, which also functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration of her identity—is strong and lands with felt cost.

    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and resonant images toward a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where Maya redefines belonging as a connection rather than a place, lands with a clear "before/after" state, and the transformed feather provides a tangible outcome with felt cost (the end of one quest, the start of a new, vast one). Causality is elegant and image-driven, from the feather to the dome to the final map.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building thematic weight through layered imagery toward a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal structure is complete and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration for Leo—lands with a clear, felt cost (the bishop piece). The plot is coherent for this length, though the perfect, frictionless execution of the plan relies more on summary than dramatized tension.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building intensity through a sequence of resonant images toward a powerful closure. The final beat is a perfect example of Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), landing on the page with a clearly defined and thematically resonant cost—the sacrifice of mobility. This closure feels both inevitable and earned, representing a masterclass in structural control for a short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building a sequence of images that lead to a Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The closure lands on the page, and the conceptual cost—a heavier, more sacred understanding of her work—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story effectively uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional and atmospheric density toward a clear closure. The Resonant Reconfiguration of the box from "accusation" to "companion" is a legible on-page change with a felt cost—the accepted weight of his trauma. The structure is simple but flawlessly executed for its purpose, with no causality breaks within its reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is excellent. The plot builds through a coherent ritualistic sequence from setup to a resonant climax.

    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and the weight of history rather than causal turns. Orientation is immediate and clear. The structure is a single, effective continuous scene, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the meaning of "peace" is reframed as a continuous practice. The cost—a lifetime of solitude and the burden of future vigilance—is legible and felt in the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing. The coincidence of the rain does not resolve the core problem but instead acts as a catalyst for the character's internal shift, which is appropriate for this narrative lens. The closure lands with a clear, felt conceptual cost—the acceptance of permanent loss—as Silas "listened for birdsong that would never come. And in the silence between thunderclaps, he heard it anyway."

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The plot progresses not through causal events but through the successful accumulation of ritualistic actions, leading to a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where the sanctuary is revealed as a "state of being," lands with a clear conceptual cost of severing past connections, making the structure feel both intentional and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a legible accumulative structure (preparation, performance, reflection) and lands a clear closure of Earned Stasis, with the cost of the mentor relationship framing the narrative. The drive lens is consistently accumulative/textural. However, the progression is severely hampered by extreme, verbatim repetition of key phrases, making the structure feel more circular and declarative than forward-moving, even for a non-causal design. This repetition weakens the sense of an earned journey to the final stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building pressure through imagery and reflection rather than causal events. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, where Aris's internal cadence momentarily harmonizes with a cosmic rhythm, providing a felt shift with a clear emotional cost—the weight of being the last witness. The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the story's length and ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is elegant and effective for its length, operating under a clear Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift and atmospheric. The plot advances logically to a Decisive Change (the names are preserved) that flows into a Resonant Reconfiguration (she becomes the keeper), with the cost of her old life made explicit. The causality, while mythic, is internally consistent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure toward a Conceptual Repricing (CR) at closure. The storm and the ritual effectively escalate the narrative toward the climax. The primary weakness is the lack of a legible cost associated with the breakthrough; Elara achieves her goal without a visible trade-off or sacrifice in the final moment, which softens the impact of the otherwise successful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, moving from setup to a powerful climax with excellent pacing. The Accumulative/Situational drive lens holds perfectly, with the approaching army providing situational pressure that brings years of accumulated research to a head. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, landing with a clear, felt conceptual cost on the page as Anu transcends his mortal concerns.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear causal sequence under a metaphysical lens, and the closure lands on the page. However, the pivotal causal link—the "cellular memory" vision—is introduced late and functions as a near deus ex machina, weakening the resolution's earned quality. The cost of releasing the "protective" resentment is not made tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens to great effect, building a single, continuous scene with escalating magical intensity. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the sextant is transformed from a tool of capture to one of navigation, and the mirror maker's purpose is clarified. This lands with a clear conceptual cost—abandoning the astronomer's stated goal—and reconfigures the character's future, which is a very strong ending for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an effective Accumulative/Textural drive, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The final image of the missing ribbon and the new seed provides a legible before/after shift in emotional stakes, with the cost being Elara's renewed vulnerability and the uncertainty of waiting. The structure is clean, and the symbolic causality holds perfectly within its chosen lens, earning its quiet, powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story successfully employs a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural) structure, moving from discovery to a decisive internal choice and culminating in a clear Conceptual Repricing. The closure lands effectively, transforming the protagonist's state with a felt cosmic cost ("the universe both laughed and wept"). The causal chain from reflection to action is legible and fitting for the story's length and philosophical aims.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a Causal lens, but the progression is frictionless, reading more like a synopsis than a dramatized narrative. Pivotal moments—the renegotiation with the guardians and the climactic rescue—are summarized, weakening their impact. The closure achieves a Decisive Change (scholar rescued), but it lacks a legible on-page cost, rendering the victory emotionally unearned and the final shift in cosmic balance purely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere towards a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The cost—her "trapped freedom"—is legible in the final paragraph. The inciting incident, the unexplained appearance of the swatch card, feels slightly convenient, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, but the closure—a Decisive Change—lacks any felt or conceptual cost, which severely undermines its impact. The "fables of absence" are set up as warnings, yet the resolution is a clean, cost-free success, which deflates the narrative tension retroactively. The final line acts as a summary, explaining the plot's success rather than allowing the moment to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    The plot is logically structured with a clear causal chain leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration for closure. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds. However, the denouement shifts into summary, with "Days passed" and "Years later" compressing the aftermath and weakening the on-page impact of the otherwise earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens from problem to resolution. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure, a Decisive Change (beacon is lit) followed by a Conceptual Repricing (re-understanding the world), is on-page and earned. The cost is subtly but clearly established in the fragility of the solution—"The fragile light... would not last forever"—which adds a layer of poignant reality to the hopeful ending.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure, moving from observatory to forecourt, builds atmospheric pressure that culminates in a potent Conceptual Repricing—Elthion's vow reweights his entire purpose. The closure lands with the clear, felt cost of his solitude and the weight of his task.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural drive, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration of the emotional landscape. The closure lands effectively, establishing a clear before/after state. However, the plot's central mechanism—the "note in mosaic" discovered through a specialized "ambient awareness"—reads as overly convenient, weakening the causal chain leading into the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively. The structure is sound: an external pressure point leads to a period of reflection that culminates in a clear Conceptual Repricing. The closure, where Maya re-frames her research and prepares to speak, lands with a felt conceptual cost—the embracing of uncertainty. The internal causality is strong and the final Charged Poise is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure is simple, linear, and perfectly suited to the length, building from confinement to a transcendent climax and returning with a transformation. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, where the final image of the doll and the vessel lands with a clear conceptual cost—the reluctant return to earth—and redefines the protagonist's future relationship with her confinement.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens successfully. The structure builds density by showing the effects of Elias's work on various passengers. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration: the arrival of storm clouds provides a conceptual cost, reframing his success as beautiful but temporary ("all peace is temporary"), which lands with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal lens, with each action logically leading to the next. Orientation is established immediately, and the plot progresses without any breaks in causality. The closure, a form of Charged Poise where the throne is awakened and the heir's arrival is imminent, is earned on-page with a clear conceptual cost for Elara (renouncing power for stewardship).

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is exemplary for this length, operating on a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens. It builds a powerful textural state of isolation, which is then decisively broken by a clear causal chain (ring pulsates -> duty recalled -> choice made -> action taken). The closure is a strong Decisive Change with the felt cost of leaving the sanctuary, landing cleanly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clean, Causal structure from inciting incident to a Decisive Change at the climax. The progression is logical and easy to follow. The primary weakness is the legibility of the cost; the resolution feels more like a pure reward or catharsis, with the physical danger she faced being the risk rather than a price paid for the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's Causal lens is impeccably maintained, with a tight, logical progression from setup to resolution. The closure is a clean and effective Decisive Change—the discovery of the parchment—with the cost felt in the "weight of the moment." Orientation is immediate and clear, and the single-scene structure is perfectly suited to the length, making this a structurally flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and knowledge that culminates in a single, decisive action. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration into Charged Poise, is legible and on-page, establishing a clear before/after state for Galen. The felt cost—an irrevocable alteration of his soul and perception—lands effectively, making his new purpose feel weighty and earned within the story's compact scope.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a strong, clean Causal drive lens where each discovery logically enables the next. The structure is a simple two-shard design (discovery and meeting) that works perfectly for the length. The closure is an effective Resonant Reconfiguration, landing on the page with a clear, felt emotional cost rooted in the characters' shared histories of institutional solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    The plot follows a clear Causal lens, but its progression depends on two significant conveniences: the magical puddle-map and Theodor's perfectly timed appearance with the final piece of intel. These moments weaken the story's causality, making solutions feel granted rather than earned. The closure, a Decisive Change with a clear cost (becoming fugitives), is effective, but the path to it is paved with too much good fortune.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration into Earned Stasis, is achieved on the page with a clear and felt cost articulated in the final lines. The narrative progresses through an intensification of atmosphere and sensory detail, culminating in a cadence shift that feels both earned and inevitable under this lens. This is structurally very sophisticated for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building from routine to a moment of heightened significance. The structure is sound for its length, with a clear inciting incident (finding the moonstone) and a resonant closure (a Resonant Reconfiguration where her state is altered). The final image of the monument provides a strong, quiet cadence that successfully concludes the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story executes a strong Hybrid (Accumulative-to-Causal) structure, culminating in a clear Conceptual Repricing. The discovery of the natural clocks provides a potent, on-page closure that re-weights the entire premise with a tangible conceptual cost—the death of Elias's lifelong philosophy. The plot progresses logically within its fabulist framework, with the magical compass serving as an effective, if convenient, catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional pressure toward a clear closure. The final image provides a legible Conceptual Repricing of the artifact's value and a Resonant Reconfiguration of the protagonist's emotional state. The cost—the permanent loss of the original and the acceptance of failure—is felt, making the structure sound and effective for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes a clean and effective Causal structure, with each beat logically following from the last. Orientation is established immediately, and the plot progresses from pursuit to discovery to resolution without any gaps in causality. The closure is a clear Decisive Change, earned on the page with a legible, albeit subtle, felt cost for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive with precision, building internal pressure toward a clear and earned closure. The final Conceptual Repricing, where mercy is reframed as a mathematical function, is a powerful reweighting of the entire narrative. The structure is tight, purposeful, and the psychological cost of reaching the conclusion is felt on the page, satisfying the 9+ gate requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. Its structure—a present frame containing a dense reflection that charges a final, decisive action—is elegant and effective for this mode. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist's purpose is crystallized, and it lands with the clear, felt cost of accepting a generational responsibility. All structural components are sound and serve the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a tight, logical causal chain under a Hybrid lens that becomes Causal at the climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), lands with a clear conceptual cost as Marcus accepts his "calling." All setups—the flickering light, the 4:17 PM deadline, the horologist's backstory—are paid off effectively, culminating in a resonant final image that reconfigures the character's future.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building density toward a powerful climax. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where the library's static perfection is the cost of living knowledge, is legible, earned, and lands with resonant finality. The structure is exceptionally well-suited to the story's length and ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens beautifully. Pressure builds from the political dispute and the unique environmental threat (temporal storm), culminating in a single decisive action. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the concept of "truth" is re-framed, and the "after" state is made legible in the final paragraph with a clear, conceptual cost—the loss of certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with a solid structure and on-page closure (a Decisive Change). However, the resolution's scale feels unearned; the leap from fixing one specific music box to saving all music across the entire city is causally thin. This deus ex machina element, while thematically resonant, weakens the plot's logical integrity at the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The structure is logical, and orientation is handled well. The primary weakness is the legibility of cost; the transformation is presented as wholly positive, lacking a felt price or a foreclosed path that would give the closure more weight and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural structure, moving from a concrete problem (lost) to a conceptual discovery and resolution. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of Elena's place in time, is legible and earned within this lens. However, the inciting incident—finding a "magic lantern slide"—leans on convenience, and the felt cost of her transformation is quite soft, lowering the overall impact.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure—a two-shard sequence leading to a single point of insight—is ideal for this length. The closure is a clean and earned Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the meaning of the quest and the postcards is reconfigured with a felt cost of time and singular focus, making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story fails the fundamental scope requirement for a short piece by presenting a summary spanning weeks rather than a continuous scene or two shards. The structure is a series of "and then" statements ("After the letters were found," "Opening the seventh volume," "On the zeppelin's viewing deck this morning...") that report plot points instead of dramatizing them. While the closure lands conceptually, the narrative path to it lacks the causal, scene-level pressure required for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building reflective weight toward a clear Conceptual Repricing (the reinterpretation of the bottle) that motivates a Decisive Change (posting the notices). The closure lands cleanly on the page with a legible conceptual cost—embracing difficult work over passive hope. The structure is elegant and effective for a contemplative piece, with a clear before/after state change.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and interiority until the prophecy provides a decisive cadence shift. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Elias's purpose is re-forged with a clear conceptual cost—the burden of knowledge. The final image of him at his desk crystallizes this new, heavier stance. Orientation is immediate and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The plot progresses not through causal events but through the intensification of a ritual, building pressure toward a single manifestation. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing where Anya understands time as herself—is earned and lands with resonant cost. The structure is elegant, and orientation is established immediately and held throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building pressure through atmosphere and anticipation rather than causal events. The structure moves from setup to a charged waiting period, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final image—the mountain speaking through the bell—reconfigures the story's reality and vindicates the character's life's work, providing a resonant closure with a clear, felt cost of a lifetime of isolated dedication.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive exceptionally well. The structure builds from routine to a catalyzing event ("a call") that prompts a decisive action. The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing where Elion's worldview is transformed, with the cost—abandoning his instruments and former understanding—legibly paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building meaning through a sequence of observations that cohere into a powerful final understanding. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), is executed with precision: the recluse accepts their role, foreclosing the path of language, and the conceptual cost is made tangible in the final scene. The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the story's meditative pace and thematic goals.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density of understanding toward a strong close. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, where Elara’s purpose and relationship to time are redefined, with the felt cost being her new responsibility. The final image of the warm fragment and bending shadows provides a powerful, on-page cadence shift that makes the new reality tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the central causal link—the snapped kite string causing a burst of inspiration—feels asserted rather than earned. The "before" state of creative stasis isn't strongly established, so the "after" of a dam bursting lacks impact. The closure lands, but its motivating turn feels like a convenient external metaphor rather than an inevitable development.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story demonstrates excellent structural integrity under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The six-month timeline provides a clear and compelling framework, leading to an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The cost—Elias’s life—is paid in the final beat, making the orchard's transformation feel earned and resonant. Causality is seamless from the inciting diagnosis to the final, transcendent moment.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is clean and effective for the story's length, adhering to an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The journey to the tower builds pressure through recurring images, leading to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The cost—the shedding of Elian's skeptical identity—is legible and earned by the story's internal logic, making the closure strong.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the closure is significantly weakened by summarizing the resolution. Instead of dramatizing the garden's initial success or leaving the reader with a powerful image of incipient life, the final two paragraphs jump years ahead to explicitly state the mission was a success. This robs the on-page action of its climatic weight, turning the ending into an expository epilogue that tells rather than shows the Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story demonstrates a flawless Causal drive lens; each discovery logically and immediately precipitates the next action, creating a tight, propulsive structure. The closure unit is a powerful combination of a Decisive Change (arrival) and a Conceptual Repricing (the meaning of "home"). The felt cost of the arduous journey and long separation makes the final reunion earned and resonant, satisfying the rubric's highest standards for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural structure. It establishes orientation effectively and builds toward a valid Conceptual Repricing at the end, where Elara’s understanding of her role shifts. The cost—her ongoing isolation and the burden of her duty—is felt throughout, making the final re-framing of her purpose a resonant closure for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with a satisfactory Decisive Change at the end. However, a minor but distinct causality flaw occurs when the queen piece is "revealed" after Kael was said to have brought "these pieces" with him. Additionally, the master's convenient appearance to deliver exposition weakens the protagonist's agency in the final discovery, feeling more like a narrative device than an earned development.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, culminating in a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The appearance of the pawn is not a causal plot twist but a deepening of the story's central mystery and a reweighting of Elara's mission. The cost—the understanding that she can only save fragments—is made explicit and felt, providing perfect closure for this narrative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, building from discovery to practice to a final, resonant revelation. The closure is an effective Conceptual Repricing, reframing the protagonist's entire goal. The cost is legible: the simpler, tangible goal of a physical "home" is foreclosed in favor of a more profound, abstract understanding. Causality is solid, with each discovery (stone, feather) logically enabling the next step.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story effectively uses a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens. The sustained, patient work of decoding accumulates pressure and meaning, which then causes the labyrinth door to appear. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where the protagonist realizes redemption was an internal state all along, and the cost—forty years of penance—is well-established and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure toward a clear closure. The structure is simple but effective for this length. The ending achieves a potent Charged Poise, where Elara’s final act reconfigures the narrative space, and the cost—her freedom or life—is palpable and accepted on the page. The plot progression is logical within this textural framework, escalating from quiet sessions to a public, final defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens masterfully. It builds emotional and thematic density through a series of reflective beats, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands cleanly, re-contextualizing forty years of uncertainty as a necessary cost for this final clarity. The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the story's internal focus.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story employs an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, where the emotional and thematic weight builds toward a resonant climax. The plot structure (quay-discovery-quay) is elegant and perfectly suited to the length. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where Elias re-evaluates his life's work, lands with palpable emotional cost and provides a deeply satisfying conclusion without needing a complex causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional pressure toward a single test. The structure is elegant for its length, using a brief multi-POV switch (Track C compliant) to confirm the outcome without breaking Elias's focalization at closure. The closure itself is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR): the rules of connection are rewritten, and a new, bittersweet stasis is established with a felt cost of continued separation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building a potent ritualistic atmosphere that culminates in a resonant final image. The structure is a single, continuous scene that effectively intensifies toward its close. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), is achieved on the page through the ship's signal and the navigator's rare smile, with the cost of past losses providing a palpable emotional backdrop. The narrative logic is sound and well-suited to the story's length and aims.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through ritual toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands on the page with a clear reweighting of the story's premise and a legible emotional cost. The structure is weakened by the climax, which hinges on the coincidence of finding a second glass eye, an event that triggers the resolution rather than arising from the protagonist's direct causal action.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) drive, closing with a resonant Resonant Reconfiguration. The structure is clean and orientation is strong. However, the causal link between Elias's investigation ("observing gaps") and the resolution ("the borrowed memories had finally resolved") is weak; the understanding feels more like it arrives with time than as a direct result of his actions. This softens the plot's connective tissue, making the climax feel more arrived at than achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly for its length. The plot unfolds through a series of resonant images and intuitive leaps, cohering perfectly at the climax. The closure is an excellent example of Conceptual Repricing: the "doorway of decisions" is reframed, and the cost of paths not taken is made tangible before a final choice reconfigures the protagonist's future. The structure is elegant and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with a legible Decisive Change at the end. However, a key plot point—Maera's arrival—is resolved by coincidence ("I had a dream, too"), which lessens the feeling of earned progression. While the structure is sound and orientation is clear, this convenient mirroring softens the causality at a pivotal moment before the main trial begins.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the secret redefines Elara's entire art, landing with a clear conceptual cost (the loss of her old purpose). The narrative builds atmospheric pressure effectively toward this final, transformative image, making the shift feel significant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. It builds pressure through a dense layering of memory, disorientation, and mystical atmosphere, leading to a powerful internal climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, is achieved on the page with a clear, felt cost: the acceptance of a fractured existence in exchange for profound understanding. The story's internal logic is impeccable under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is excellent for an Accumulative/Textural lens. The single, continuous scene builds emotional pressure effectively, leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. Elara's internal state is reweighted with a felt cost (the acceptance of her past), making the quiet closure powerful and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a tight, causal structure under a Hybrid lens. The setup, escalation (platform tilt), and closure are linked flawlessly, with each beat raising the pressure on the next. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis, lands with a palpable sense of release and cost on the page ("Exhaling at last"). The piece perfectly adheres to the single-scene scope, with the approaching storm serving as an excellent narrative clock.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and emotional weight toward a clear closure. The ending is an effective Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the apology is exchanged, but the "incomplete composition" provides a final image of partial healing with a legible, felt cost. The structure is simple but perfectly suited to the story's length and emotional goal.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, culminating in a resonant Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where all elements unify, is both legible and earned, with the cost being the witness's dissolution into a new whole. The plot progresses through a steady intensification of its core concepts, perfectly aligning with its chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building to a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure is clear, and the cost is legible in Arlo's vow to change his relationship with his tools. However, the causal link between the physical action (seeing water flow backward) and the profound philosophical insight feels slightly asserted rather than fully earned through a process of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR). The closure, where the meaning of "intrusion" and "security" is fundamentally re-weighted, lands with clear conceptual cost. The causality is one of dawning realization rather than direct action-reaction, which fits the chosen lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot progresses not through causal events but through an intensification of internal pressure, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where Elena finds peace in uncertainty, lands with a clear and palpable conceptual cost—the renunciation of mastery—making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story uses a Hybrid (Accumulative-Causal) lens effectively. The structure is clean: a state of textural stasis is broken by a causal event (the call), leading to a decisive internal change. The closure lands on the page with a clear, felt cost—the dismantling of Elias's "fortress of solitude"—and the story's internal, semi-magical logic remains consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure adheres perfectly to an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional density toward a powerful final image. The closure, a form of Charged Poise, is earned and resonant; the archivist's final actions create a clear "after" state, poised for the coming change. The cost—the loss of his professional world and the bittersweet weight of memory—is palpable in the closing lines without being overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and compelling causal chain under a Causal lens. The two-shard structure, moving from planning to execution and observation, is effective for the scope. The closure is an excellent example of Conceptual Repricing: the final realization that the cure was the process, not the object, lands with the clear, felt cost of his continued anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural structure, building sensory and emotional density towards a decisive climax. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of Elion's grief and blindness, lands cleanly on the page with a felt cost (cathartic tears). The causality is one of intensifying perception leading to internal change, which holds perfectly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean and logical Causal lens, where the initial error leads directly to the corrective action and its subsequent confirmation. The closure unit—a Decisive Change (the timeline is altered) and a Resonant Reconfiguration (her acceptance of her role)—is present on the page. The primary weakness is the lack of a legible cost; the resolution is a clean success with no trade-off, sacrifice, or new complication, which undercuts the stated gravity of her power.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural structure, building from a quiet observation to a collective experience. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where the harbor's silence is re-contextualized as music and Elias's ephemerality is given poignant meaning. The single, continuous scene is well-handled and fits the scope, creating a focused, lyrical progression. The cost of his gift (being forgotten) is legible and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story fails the fundamental structural requirement for its length, presenting a multi-year summary instead of a continuous scene or two focused shards. Plot points like "For weeks, she followed the artistic trail" and "Years passed" compress what should be dramatized events into exposition, fatally undermining narrative tension. While the causal chain is logical, its execution as a synopsis makes the closure feel unearned and weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. It builds pressure by layering details of Elena’s internal state, the world's rules, and her plan, culminating in a powerful closure. The ending is a perfect Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the dream lagoon is manifested, reweighting the future with hope at the explicit cost of being temporary. The causality is impeccable within its chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot demonstrates a pristine causal chain under a Causal Drive Lens, where every setup is paid off with precision. The closure, a Charged Poise, is expertly handled: Marlo wins the immediate conflict, but the cost is "Vance's renewed curiosity," establishing a tense, forward-looking stasis. The structure is tight, efficient, and perfectly suited to the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through repeated actions and atmospheric density. Orientation is clear, and the structure is coherent for its aims. The closure unit, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the visitor's secret is transformed, is legible but softened by the assertion "somehow transformed," which lacks a concrete on-page image to fully land the cost and change.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where the town's mindset is altered, is legible and earned by the protagonist's actions. However, the scope of the change—"the town had been changed forever"—feels disproportionate to the single event, slightly undermining the credibility of the otherwise well-structured plot.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The plot progresses through a sequence of resonant events—finding the object, deciphering it, hearing the call—that build pressure toward a powerful closure. The final image of Mara disappearing with the island constitutes a clear Decisive Change with a felt cost (her entire former life), landing as a potent Resonant Reconfiguration. The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural structure, culminating in a resonant Conceptual Repricing where the performer finds "equilibrium." The orientation is immediate and clear. The only minor weakness is the compression of the community's arrival into summary ("People now traveled..."), which slightly lessens the impact of the final turn by telling rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building atmospheric and sensory pressure toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the climax. The closure, where the poet is transformed and the colonnade falls silent, provides a legible before/after state. However, the on-page cost is weak; it's stated ("the weight of their new purpose") rather than dramatized, slightly undermining the earnedness of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building potential energy effectively toward the climax. The closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change for both characters. However, the causality of Elara's own awakening is absent; it arrives as a convenient, symmetrical gift that isn't part of the established barter, softening the story's logic of trade-offs and felt cost for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and conceptual weight toward a clear closure. The ending is a valid Conceptual Repricing, where the protagonist's understanding of the world is fundamentally altered. The structure is simple but elegant for a vignette, moving from a philosophical premise to a specific, resonant demonstration that makes the "before/after" state of knowledge legible.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a portrait of purpose found through ritual. There is no traditional plot, but the structure is coherent, moving from past trauma to present meaning. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Elena has transformed her relationship with grief, landing with the felt cost that "her heart still carried the weight of loss."

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Causal drive. The visitor's arrival is a clear inciting incident leading directly to the collaborative breakthrough. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing, where the visitor's final line re-frames the project's purpose from predictive to preventative, landing with the felt cost of immense responsibility. The structure is perfectly scaled for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building density and intensity toward a powerful closure. The final Conceptual Repricing—where Elara becomes a living part of the archive—is an excellent, earned transformation. The cost, the loss of her former self, is made explicit and felt on the page, satisfying the rubric's highest demands for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, building from observation to a potent Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The closure, where the anomaly is revealed as a loved one, lands with the clear, felt cost of "understanding that comes too late." The causality is sound and the progression feels earned, leading to a powerful reconfiguration of the story's world and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully executes an Accumulative/Textural structure within a single scene. Orientation is clear, and the internal reflection builds steadily toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "trust," lands on the page with a felt cost—the acceptance of a difficult "life's work" instead of a simple resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, where a series of symbolic discoveries cohere into a final realization. The closure unit—a Conceptual Repricing followed by a Decisive Change—is clear and has a felt cost (abandoning a lifelong identity). The structure is sound for its length and mode, effectively building a sense of mystical discovery that pays off in the final action of entering the tunnel.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully executes an Accumulative/Textural drive. The plot is an internal deepening of a psychic state, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Elena's understanding of "unused love" is transformed. The closure lands on the page with a clear, felt cost—the "single tear" and the weight of "bittersweet sacrifice"—as she takes on the role of releasing these emotions.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building from a state of overwhelming input to a Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure is earned on the page, with the cost—"bittersweet knowledge of all the vision she had missed"—providing a legible and poignant 'after' state. The single-scene structure is focused and effective for this internal transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully. The structure is a simple, elegant progression from journey to resolution, anchored by strong imagery. The closure unit is superb: the Decisive Change of the clock ticking from midnight to 00:01 provides a concrete, on-page marker for the guard's internal shift, a Resonant Reconfiguration of his entire being. The cost—the loss of his defining static identity—is felt, not stated, making the ending powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    The structure follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building a series of insights that cleanly lead to the final closure. The closure itself is a strong Conceptual Repricing (the rainforest is his mind), which redefines the entire story with a clear conceptual cost. The plot is logical and efficient, with each step motivated by the last, successfully executing its modest scope.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure is a simple, elegant journey that builds atmospheric pressure toward a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The final image of the guides carrying the sleeping dragons redefines their purpose with a felt cost of new responsibility, making the before/after state legible. Causality is symbolic (the heating punch) but consistent within the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a Hybrid (Accumulative dominant) drive lens flawlessly. The plot progresses from a concrete discovery (the bolt) to an accumulation of understanding that forces a final choice. The closure is an on-page Decisive Change—the act of singing—that reconfigures the story's world with a clear, felt cost (sacrificing the sanctuary's protection). The structure is elegant and economical for its length, with every beat serving the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural drive that works well, building pressure through the library's decay and the increasingly urgent messages. The final Conceptual Repricing (CR) provides a strong, legible closure with a clear cost—the forfeiture of a preconceived destiny. However, the causal link between the final message ("harbors another's heart") and the leap to "he is my fear" is slightly tenuous, relying on a jump in logic not fully seeded on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly, building observations and reflections toward a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost—the erasure of humanity's paths—and effectively reweights Marina's entire purpose. Orientation is immediate and clear, and the single-scene structure is perfectly suited to the contemplative, discovery-focused plot.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a final transformative moment. The closure, a Decisive Change in the character's purpose, lands effectively with the felt cost of new responsibility. However, the inciting incident—the appearance of the ancient stone circle—arrives without setup, feeling more like a convenient discovery than an earned turn, which slightly undermines the structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, with a logical sequence of events leading to a decisive closure. However, the plot's central turning point relies on a major coincidence: "A sudden gust of wind lifted an abandoned kite... sending it tumbling toward her." This deus ex machina provides the key to the resolution rather than the protagonist earning it through ingenuity or struggle, significantly weakening the causal chain's integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure builds density through Maya's established ritual and philosophy, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration at the end. The closure—releasing the photograph—is a decisive act of renunciation with a clear, felt cost, perfectly reweighting her relationship to the past without needing external plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is a strong example of an Accumulative/Textural drive, where pressure builds through symbolic density rather than causal events. The discovery of the box is a clean inciting incident, and the closure is a well-executed Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist's understanding of her reality is fundamentally re-weighted. The cost—abandoning an ideal of perfection—is legible in the final paragraph, making the before/after state clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story exhibits a flawless causal structure for its length, moving from setup to experiment to consequence without wasted motion. The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing, where the tracker's understanding is fundamentally altered. The cost of this transformation is made tangible and legible on the page through the character's physical distress and dangerous vitals, fulfilling the requirements for a high-impact ending.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, operating on a clean and compelling Causal lens. The plot moves logically from inciting incident (discovery) to a Decisive Change (the upload) that lands with a clear, felt cost. The final beat achieves a powerful state of Charged Poise, making the closure both resolute and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building a portrait of a person, place, and philosophy. The structure is sound, spiraling from a wide view into a specific, representative action before expanding back to a thematic statement. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), reaffirming her chosen path. The cost—the ongoing effort to maintain order against a chaotic world—is felt, making the quiet ending earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive with precision. The structure builds density and atmosphere toward a clear climax without relying on traditional causal turns. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), is achieved on the page with a legible conceptual cost—the permanent alteration of the fisher, the garden, and the constellations. The final image of the humming rail spike provides a potent, earned conclusion to the singular action.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows a clear Causal drive, but the central cause-and-effect chain is summarized, not dramatized. The critical process of investigation—"Hours passed as Eleanor worked...each contradiction revealing another layer"—is elided, forcing the reader to accept the outcome without evidence. While the closure is a decisive change in knowledge, it feels unearned because the pivotal work happens off-page, weakening the entire structure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story follows a flawless Causal lens, where each step logically propels the next. The discovery of the letters provides a clear inciting incident that alters the protagonist's options, leading to a climax and a Decisive Change (from haunted guilt to quiet relief) with a legible emotional cost. The structure is immaculate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure toward a well-executed climax. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, as the meaning of "unlearning" is transformed for the community. The cost is made tangible when Silas disassembles the mandala, reinforcing the theme of temporary meaning. The structure is nearly flawless for this mode and length.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional and thematic weight toward its climax. The structure is simple but effective, moving from discovery to a central ritual. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands with a clear conceptual cost: the act of renaming offers potential, but the immense, tragic reality of the ruins remains undiminished, making the hope feel fragile and defiant.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens. The plot is perfectly scoped for the length: a clear problem, a single continuous scene of action, and a decisive change for closure. The cost—Silas pouring his essence into the song and finding final rest—is legible and earned on the page, making the resolution powerful and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively. It builds pressure not through a strict causal chain but by layering observations: the pill recall, the static shock's effect, the geode's properties, and her somatic responses. This culminates in a strong Conceptual Repricing at the end, where her worldview shifts. The catalyst (static shock activating the geode) is a bit convenient, but the internal logic holds for the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean, logical Causal structure from motivation to discovery to resolution, with clear orientation. The closure unit provides a Decisive Change as Maya accepts her new role. However, the associated cost is abstract and presented as a net positive ("renewed purpose"), which weakens the impact of the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, where the plot advances by gathering pieces (buttons) to form a new understanding. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of the warehouse's purpose, lands clearly. However, the inciting incident relies on a convenient discovery ("impossible until she noticed the collection of lost buttons"), which softens the causal chain and feels less rigorous than a top-tier piece requires.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure is a single, focused scene that builds atmospheric and emotional density toward a clear closure point. The ending is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Aleksandr's internal stance shifts decisively, with the felt cost of accepting his past and the difficult future ahead. The causality is emotional and symbolic, which is perfectly suited to the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's Accumulative/Textural structure is exceptionally well-executed, using the ticking of the rain gutters as an elegant and organic frame. This device provides a clear beginning, middle, and end to the scene, building a quiet tension that pays off perfectly at closure. The final action—tying the knot as the dripping stops—provides a clear and resonant Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the boundary is secured for another day at the cost of his perpetual vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building a series of resonant images that lead to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, Kael's resolve to become a steward, is earned and on the page. The implied cost of this new responsibility is legible, making for a structurally sound and effective narrative arc within this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is simple and elegant for its length: setup, journey, encounter, and revelation. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where the meaning of the bitting gauge tooth and Mara's purpose are reconfigured with a felt cost of accepting a quiet, inherited duty. The coincidental meeting with Jim is permissible under this lens as it serves to crystallize the story's accumulated meaning rather than solve a causal problem.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through layered imagery and internal states rather than causal events. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing, as Elena's understanding of "independence" is re-framed. The final image of the shadowless sundial provides a resonant on-page reconfiguration with a felt cost—the acceptance of her long, painful journey. The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the story's length and aims.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a coherent Accumulative/Textural structure, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the closure lacks a legible, on-page cost. Elara's epiphany is presented as a pure gain, and the price of her former life is confined to backstory, weakening the impact of her transformation by removing any sense of immediate trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clean Causal lens, with a clear setup, execution, and consequence. The closure, a form of Charged Poise, lands effectively, repricing the stakes for humanity. The primary weakness is the final few paragraphs, which devolve into a summary of events ("Over the next week...") rather than ending on a resonant, in-scene image, slightly undermining the dramatic tension built during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal structure is strong, holding a clear Causal lens from the setup to the final beat. The closure, a combination of a Decisive Change and a Conceptual Repricing (the key is a passage, not an object), lands with a clear, felt cost. The logic is only slightly weakened by the convenient appearance of previously unseen pillars, a minor contrivance in an otherwise solid structure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.8)
    The causal chain is logical but severely compressed, leading to an unearned and abrupt conclusion. The story's greatest weakness is its closure; the critical final beats—the reconstruction, confrontation, and confession—are summarized in a single sentence. This violates the principle of dramatizing pivotal moments, telling the reader the outcome instead of showing the resolution on the page, which significantly undermines the entire narrative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens: decoding the journals leads directly to finding and activating the hidden controls. The structure is heavily front-loaded with backstory, which weakens its narrative efficiency but doesn't break the causal chain. The ending provides a strong Decisive Change as Eli initiates the sequence, with the cost of "overwhelming responsibility" felt on the page, satisfying the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where a sequence of surreal observations builds pressure toward a decisive shift. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts the invitation to cross over, lands cleanly on the page with the felt cost of leaving his known world, providing a legible before/after state. The structure is tight and purposeful for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building toward a strong Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final realization and the action of boxing the currencies provide a clear, costed closure (the company's failure). The mosaic structure, shifting between the present, backstory, and summary, is handled effectively without losing orientation. The plot's main weakness is that the startup's unwinding is summarized rather than dramatized, slightly softening the causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    The causal structure is sound and well-paced for the story's length, adhering to a clear because/therefore progression. The closure, a Decisive Change where collaboration unlocks the inscriptions, is legible on the page with a clear conceptual cost. However, the arrival of the telegram feels overly convenient, functioning as a *deus ex machina* that provides the exact clue needed without being earned by prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    The plot follows a strong Causal lens with a clear sequence of events leading to a Decisive Change. However, the closure is weakened by an illegible cost. The druid's blood offering is a momentary gesture with no lasting consequence, and the acceptance of the final truth is too serene to register as a significant price, which undermines the narrative weight of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure is sound for its length, following a coherent single scene under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing, where the visionary's understanding of the covenant shifts. However, the final beat lacks a strong, felt cost; the resolution is a clean release from a burden, which softens the impact and prevents the story from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. It builds pressure through atmosphere and ritual focus rather than causal turns, leading to a legible Resonant Reconfiguration at the climax. The closure, where balance is restored and Elara resumes her vigil, lands with the felt cost of her "bartered destiny," fulfilling the requirements for this lens and length perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive perfectly. The structure builds density through reflection, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marcus's internal landscape is re-priced. The closure lands cleanly with a felt cost—the re-engagement with painful memories—and the final image of the inhabited "echo valley" makes the change legible and earned. The lens holds, and the closure is flawless for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively. The structure builds thematic and emotional weight toward a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the end. The final image of Elara on the vessel, feeling purpose as the seed pulses, crystallizes the stakes and her internal shift with a clear felt cost—the acceptance of a dangerous, millennia-long responsibility. Causality is sound within this lens; her intellectual discoveries directly motivate her departure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, coherently structuring the librarian's ritual. The closure is a successful Conceptual Repricing, landing on the final image of the synthesized self and the reweighting of identity. However, the plot unfolds as a serene, cyclical process without a meaningful tightening of pressure that narrows options, limiting its structural dynamism.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a series of potent images that culminate in a Conceptual Repricing of the protagonist's role. The closure lands, and a felt cost is present in the "weight" of the invisible crown. However, the causal chain is weak; the transformation is a magical bestowal rather than an earned result of the character's choices under pressure, which softens the impact of the final change.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural drive, gathering symbolic weight that pays off in the final scene. The plot is simple but causally sound, with each discovery leading to the next. Closure is achieved through a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, as Elena's acceptance of her grief creates a new, earned stasis. The cost—the raw pain of truth without medication—is made tangible in the final image of her tears joining the river.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building pressure through atmosphere rather than strict causality. The structure is clean: a setup leading to a single transition into the core scene. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing where the dreamer's understanding of words is reweighted, with the cost being the loss of access to the library. The intuited arrival of the "second fateful letter" is a slightly weak pressure point, but the watch's vibration provides the necessary on-page urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clear Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) drive, culminating in a superb Resonant Reconfiguration for its closure; the cost is legible and the ending reweights the entire narrative. The inciting incident, however, relies on a coffee-stain vision that feels slightly too convenient and specific, weakening the causal chain that leads to Elara's brilliant insight. The structure is otherwise flawless for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a flawless Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory and emotional intensification rather than causal turns. The structure is an elegant ritual arc, culminating in a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). The closure, where Elara returns to her perpetual vigil, lands with the felt cost of her endless, redemptive work, making the final image powerful and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively. The structure is a simple, linear progression—ascent, arrival, realization—that serves the internal journey well. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing, where Elara's understanding of contentment shifts from a "source" to a state of being. The cost is the abstract but felt price of abandoning a simpler quest for a more complex truth, which is legible in the final paragraph's reframing of her role.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, where thematic elements and imagery build toward a resolution. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, lands effectively on the page as Elian re-evaluates his work and himself, with the felt cost being the emotional "weight of all the consciences." The narrative logic is sound and fits the length perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a Conceptual Repricing, which is a solid structure. However, the closure is significantly damaged by the final line ("payment for wisdom shared"). This introduces a new world rule and character stake at the last second, breaking the established causal logic of the scene and feeling like an unearned twist.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clear and effective Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through resonant discoveries rather than causal conflict. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "navigation" where Kael transcends his physical form, is earned and lands with a legible cost. The plot is focused, moving from the initial premise to its mystical conclusion without deviation or structural flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, with each beat logically following from the last. The structure—a two-shard sequence with one transition—is well-suited to the length. The closure is a clear Decisive Change, as Elias rejects the automated system, with the cost felt in his renunciation of conformity. The plot is concise and lands its ending with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and mystery toward a resonant climax. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration; Hemingway's vow is made visible in the multicolored lamplight, providing a legible and satisfying "after" state with the felt cost of a new, lifelong responsibility. The structure is elegant and effective for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clear, functional structure for its length, with a setup, a moment of rising tension, and a decisive climax. The closure is a Decisive Change (DC) with a felt cost represented by the consumed worlds. However, the pivotal moment of understanding—interpreting the spiral as rebirth—feels like an unearned epiphany rather than a logical conclusion derived from the complex process described, slightly weakening the causal chain at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building emotional pressure toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The reaper's internal state shifts from passive grief to active purpose with a legible emotional cost. The structure is clean and effective, with the only hairline flaw being the inciting incident ("old recordings"), which is mentioned once and then abandoned, feeling slightly less integrated than the rest of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through the mage's obsessive focus rather than external reversals. The structure is clean and effective for the length, with a Decisive Change at the end that is well-established. The closure lands with a clear "before and after," though the felt cost of the mage's effort could have been more viscerally rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal drive. The progression from label to journals to photos to personal connection creates a tight chain of "because/therefore" events. The closure is a strong Charged Poise, where Thomas's purpose is reconfigured with a clear, felt cost—the transformation of his quiet, respected role into one of public confrontation. This structure is flawless for the story's length and ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a single, coherent scene that successfully culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (her internal state of balance). The structure is clean and orientation is immediate. The primary weakness is the legibility of on-page cost; the transformation feels mystically destined rather than earned through a tangible sacrifice or trade-off in the final moments, thinning the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure toward a clear closure of Charged Poise. The inciting incident (the message) leads directly to the final stance (the decision to transmit), and the cost—the burden of convincing others—is legible. However, the structure leans on repeating entire sentences as refrains, which feels more mechanical than lyrical and slightly weakens the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a strong, continuous Causal lens within a single scene, moving from a clear goal to a climax and resolution. The closure is a Decisive Change for both Maya and the brain, achieved with a legible on-page cost (embracing pain). The external pressure of the "rewrite" effectively frames the central action, creating a tight and coherent structure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully uses an Accumulative/Textural lens to build toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where Elara's renewed commitment to an unconventional path is made concrete by planting the seed, is legible and carries a felt conceptual cost. While the inciting incident is coincidental, the internal causal chain of the meditation holds together well for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Instead of conventional plot turns, it builds emotional and sensory density until a final cadence shift—the phantom giggle. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist's relationship to his grief is altered with the felt cost of accepting permanent loss.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building pressure through atmosphere and internal state rather than causal plot points. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the idea of "home" is re-evaluated with the felt cost of dissolving a singular identity. The inciting incident (the pendant warming) and the climax (engaging with its energy) are clear, and the story’s brief, focused structure is perfectly suited to its length.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) drive. It accumulates failures through successive approximation, leading to a causal insight ("the penny dropped") that enables the on-page Decisive Change. The closure is strong, with the transformation of the crozier creating a legible before/after state, and the cost is felt in the destruction of the family heirloom and the character's sorrow. Orientation is immediate and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is established efficiently, and the narrative builds pressure coherently toward the lunar perigee. The closure is a successful Conceptual Repricing, where understanding the cosmic cycle is the payoff, and the cost—the mental discipline to let go of all knowledge—is legible and earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear and effective Hybrid (Accumulative->Causal) structure, building a textural, atmospheric journey that culminates in a decisive, causal choice. The closure is a strong Decisive Change (the timelines merge) with a legible conceptual cost—Liam becoming a "permanent transient." This final state is a potent reconfiguration of his identity, and the plot progression leading to it is logical and well-paced within its fantastical rules.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure effectively toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands on the page with a reweighting of the central stake. The causal link between the gallery's "collective unconscious" and finding his specific sister feels slightly convenient, a minor leap in logic that softens an otherwise solid structure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story follows a clear and logical causal chain, and the closure provides a satisfying conceptual repricing. The primary weakness lies in the climax's execution: the validation of Kael's life's work arrives via an off-page report. This passive resolution, where the protagonist is told he succeeded rather than succeeding through direct action in the final moments, undercuts the dramatic tension built up.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens from the inciting pulse to the final resolution. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of the grandmother's photograph and hearing aid, is strong, resonant, and occurs on the page with a clear felt cost (the resolution of a decades-old fear). The structure is sound, with a single, clear tightening of stakes that drives the narrative forward without any breaks in logic.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is exemplary for this length, using a situational/accumulative lens perfectly. The tidal clock provides a clear, effective frame, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—is earned and lands with palpable cost in the final lines about her unresolved grief for her brother and Dr. Thorne. The narrative builds pressure texturally towards a resonant final image, fulfilling its chosen mode without flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, leading to a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) at closure. The 'before' (seeking a fix) and 'after' (accepting a new existence) are legible, and the cost—the forfeiture of a physical life—is felt in the final, quiet act of making coffee. The structure is elegant and effective for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    The accumulative structure is a strong fit for the story's textural lens, building patiently to an on-page closure where the language is reborn. The causal link at the climax, however, relies on the convenient arrival of a never-before-seen bird pattern, which feels more like a magical key than a victory earned against escalating, direct opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building toward a strong closure. The ending delivers a clean Conceptual Repricing, where Aris's mission is re-evaluated with a clear, felt cost—the forfeiture of professional vindication. The structure coherently spans several months, which works well for this reflective, vignette-style piece.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, logical Causal-to-Accumulative Hybrid structure. The inciting incident (finding the shell) leads directly to the climax (uprooting the sapling). The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration, showing the new state of being. The cost is slightly understated—the crumbling of the shell is symbolic but lacks a visceral price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure with a strong Causal lens. The plot escalates logically to a tense climax and resolves with a Decisive Change. The primary flaw is in the closure's final sentences, which introduce a confusing new element ("her father's promise to return"), diluting the established mother-daughter focus and weakening the on-page cost's legibility by adding an unearned, off-stage component.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is highly effective. It purposefully builds atmosphere, introduces a catalyst, and escalates to a lyrical climax that reconfigures the character's state. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration, with the transformation of the halo fragment into a wind bell providing a tangible correlative for the internal shift. The causality is magical rather than logical, but it remains internally consistent and serves the story's aims perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. It builds atmospheric and conceptual density toward a well-defined climax without relying on conventional causal turns. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the scarf is sacrificed and integrated—lands with a clear, on-page cost. The internal logic of its speculative physics is established and held, making the impossible feel earned and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens. The discovery of the book is a well-placed inciting incident that directly enables the climax and closure. The ending delivers a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR), reconfiguring the protagonist's understanding of her sister's fate with a clear felt cost—the final acceptance of physical loss. The structure is tight and purposeful for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure follows a ritual logic that builds atmospheric pressure toward a clear Decisive Change at the climax—the idea is freed. The closure lands with a legible on-page cost: the lock of hair, the story's central tool, dissolves into starlight, signaling the expenditure of its power and the completion of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes a strong Accumulative/Textural structure, where decades of observation culminate in a single, decisive insight. The closure is a clear Decisive Change, happening on the page, with the thirty years of loss providing a powerful, felt cost that makes her final wholeness earned.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story operates under a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered imagery and demonstration rather than strict causality. Orientation is established immediately. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (RR), where Prisha's Earned Stasis (not walking backwards) provides the "after" state, re-pricing the archivist's exile as a purposeful, effective act. The cost is his continued separation, now framed as a source of strength for others.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    The structure effectively follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure toward a single resonant act. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis/Charged Poise, is legible and consistent with the story's mystical logic. However, the stated cost ("give pieces of oneself") remains a conceptual assertion rather than a tangible, felt price on the page, which slightly softens the final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural drive. The plot is a single, focused ritual that builds pressure texturally through the creation of the "interlaced hush." Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands effectively on the page as the spirits settle and Jacob's secret is released, providing a clear before/after state with a felt cost (emotional labor) and reward (peace and minor healing).

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, layering clues until the final, elegant Conceptual Repricing. The closure, where the "whispered chapel" is revealed as a celestial event, is a powerful re-framing of the entire quest. The cost is clear—the physical place cannot be reopened—making the final shift in understanding both earned and poignant. This structural integrity is the story's greatest strength.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through observation toward a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final image of the changing snow globe provides a resonant on-page closure with a clear conceptual cost, fully realizing the story's premise within the established rules of this world. The structure is elegant and efficient for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a state rather than a causal chain of events. The structure is sound for a vignette of this length. The closure is a successful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Elara and the ghost achieve a stable, harmonious connection that also confirms their isolation from the wider world. The cost—a private symphony only they can hear—is legible and resonant in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, using the ten-floor ascent as a structural container for reflection that builds to a climax. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: Elira's understanding of servitude, duty, and privacy is re-weighted with the felt cost of carrying the captain's secret. The final image of her descending with this new "silent promise" makes the before/after state perfectly legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through observation and reflection. The structure is clean: a single, continuous scene with a clear inciting incident (string breaks) and a powerful closing beat. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where her status as "stranded" is re-framed as being in the "perfect position," landing with the felt cost of her physical peril and years of professional struggle, making her discovery both a vindication and a trap.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens from initial goal to discovery to a transformed final action. The structure is a tight, single continuous scene, and orientation is established immediately. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing, where "mirroring the sky" is redefined, landing with the felt cost of the library's imminent destruction. The plot feels both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a strong, legible Causal lens, with each step of the discovery logically following the last. The closure is an effective Conceptual Repricing, as the world of natural phenomena is reframed as a system to be mapped and harnessed, fulfilling the protagonist's drive. The plot's primary weakness is a reliance on convenience, particularly the unexplained presence of celestial navigation symbols in a "polyglot's phrasebook."

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates successfully under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a mythic atmosphere that culminates in a potent Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure, where Elias joins his ancestors, provides a clear before/after state with the felt cost of subsuming individual ambition into a collective legacy. The causal logic is symbolic but internally consistent, and the structure is clean and effective for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.4)
    The story is structured as a summary or fable, not a dramatized scene that unfolds under pressure. This "and then" sequencing violates the scope requirements for a literary short story, reading more like an outline. While the causal chain is clear, it lacks the tightening and earned closure that comes from showing events rather than recounting them over generations in a few paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. Orientation is immediate, and the structure builds pressure through ritualistic intensification rather than plot turns. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the clock's rhythm shifts to accept the lullaby—is achieved on the page with a clear, felt cost in Elias's exhaustion, making the "before/after" state of the cosmos palpable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal lens, with each beat logically following from the last. The closure, a Decisive Change in Elias's worldview, lands effectively with the cost of the nut's spent power. The plot's primary weakness is the high degree of coincidence in the inciting incident, where Elias finds both the unique, undiscovered power source and the forgotten blueprint detailing its exact use simultaneously, just as a crisis emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens leading to a Causal action, and the closure (Decisive Change) lands with a felt cost in the act of atonement. The inciting incident (argument) is off-page but its effects are clear. The primary weakness is structural; after a strong, contained scene in the ravine, the ending devolves into a summary montage ("As the weeks passed...") which dissipates the narrative tension and tells rather than shows the long-term resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive beautifully, culminating in a valid Conceptual Repricing (CR). The structure is a clean single scene, with clear orientation. The closure, where the vendor redefines their quest and opens the door, lands with a felt cost—the century of confinement that was necessary to gain this perspective. The cause-and-effect is conceptual but coherent under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is a clean, effective arc for this length, following an Accumulative/Textural lens that deepens the central emotional state. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure provides a decisive change in Kael's internal state ("heart lighter") with a legible on-page cost ("hands trembling"), making the resolution satisfying and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows a simple, linear "and-then" structure, summarizing events rather than rendering them in scene. This compression of time ("By the fourth meeting...") bypasses all potential for tension. While the closure (a Resonant Reconfiguration) is clear, it lacks a legible cost; the community is healed with no sacrifice, setback, or lingering friction, which undermines the resolution's emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (the engineer's permanent transformation) with a clear, felt cost—the blurring of identity and the assumption of a new "weight." The simple progression (prepare -> activate -> experience -> transform) works effectively at this length, and the final image lands with conceptual force. Orientation and causality within this mode are handled well.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear and logical causal chain, with a well-defined setup and a Decisive Change for closure (the seeds are awakened). The structure fits the scope requirements perfectly. However, the plot's momentum is hampered by significant repetition in the second half, where core concepts and motivations are restated rather than developed, making the structure feel padded.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), is achieved on the page as Elara's purpose is renewed and reweighted by the emotional cost of the music she absorbs. The final lines crystallize this moment of readiness, its cost legible in her tears and the weight of "history's whispered melodies."

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story effectively uses an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure toward a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the climax. The closure, where Elias re-understands his exile as enlightenment, is on-page and carries the felt cost of his former life. The structure is tight, adheres to its internal logic, and lands a resonant final beat that reconfigures the story's premise.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens beautifully. The structure is a single, clean scene culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing when the diary's purpose re-contextualizes Elara's entire life's work. The closure lands with a clear, felt cost—the foreclosure of her old goal—and the final image resonates perfectly. The causal chain is one of increasing resonant density, which is expertly handled.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, with knowledge building through doodles until the climax. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of the flower's nature leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration of Elara's purpose, is clear and lands on the page. The primary weakness is the legibility of the cost; the transformation from personal ambition to communal stewardship is presented as a pure gain, lacking a felt sense of sacrifice or a foreclosed path, which softens the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, but the plot progression relies on convenient discoveries rather than earned ones, particularly the sudden activation of the arrow tip. The closure, a Decisive Change in knowledge, is achieved without any visible cost or trade-off. The unearned, purely positive resolution ("Verdantis would thrive for generations to come") significantly weakens the narrative structure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through the methodical collection of data. The structure is sound, moving from initial survey to a climactic realization. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, shifting the mystery from a logistical problem to a physics-defying phenomenon ("mass unconsciousness"), which lands with a felt, unsettling cost. The plot progression is logical and serves the mystery well.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmospheric pressure toward the final reconfiguration. However, the closure is weakened by the absence of a legible cost. The resolution—"Tears of joy flowed freely"—presents a frictionless transformation, which undermines the stakes. A story of this nature requires a felt price for its magic, and its absence makes the ending feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story effectively uses an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through the methodical ritual. The structure is clean, with clear orientation and a Resonant Reconfiguration at the end that redefines the protagonist's purpose. The cost—confronting his painful failure through visions—is legible and directly linked to the final change, making the closure well-earned within this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a tight, logical Causal lens from the knock on the door to the subject's flight. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), as Elara recommits to her work with new data, accepting the cost of her isolation. The final image of the vanishing star provides a resonant structural echo, confirming the closure lands with undeniable force.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building its world and theme through a sequence of resonant moments. Orientation is handled well, and the closure—delivering the pendant and experiencing an internal shift—is structurally sound with a legible cost (losing the pendant). However, the plot is a simple, linear journey that lacks a significant tightening; events demonstrate the theme rather than creating escalating causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and internal pressure toward a single, decisive climax. The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing (CR): the protagonist's initial theory is not just proven but fundamentally re-scaled, with the cost being the obsolescence of her life's work as she knew it. The structure is simple, well-suited to the length, and the perceptual causality (environment -> method -> revelation) is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure effectively toward a valid Conceptual Repricing at the end. However, the plot relies on a significant coincidence—the sudden appearance of the rummage sale box. This "magnetic draw" is a weak causal link that undermines the structure's integrity, introducing an arbitrary element into an otherwise mythic progression.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clean Causal lens from inciting incident to a decisive character change at the close. The primary weakness is that the climax—Orion repairing the fractured arch supports—is recounted in summary rather than shown as a full scene. This lack of dramatization at the moment of highest tension lessens the impact of his earned power and leaves the cost ("his very essence") feeling somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through a series of increasingly significant glimpses into other realities. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist's path is momentarily blocked (the shard is spent, the dream lost), but their stance is reconfigured with greater resolve. The cost—a lost opportunity and drained resource—is legible and effectively sets up future stakes, fitting the length and scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The plot unfolds not through sharp causal turns but through a deepening of atmosphere and knowledge, leading to a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration for the protagonist. The closure, where Elias joins the tradition, lands with a clear felt cost—his simple solitude is replaced by a shared, aching kinship—and the final image is charged with this new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure by deepening the protagonist's abilities and responsibilities rather than through a strict causal chain. The structure is clean, moving from one night's routine to the next with a clear intensification in the middle. The closure is a potent form of Charged Poise, crystallizing Elara's new status as a prophet with the felt cost of uncertainty, making for a resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens effectively, building observations and insights toward a final, earned shift in understanding. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where Kaelen's framework for "narrative magnetism" is fundamentally reweighted. The cost is the loss of a simple, mechanistic formula in favor of a more complex, empathetic truth, which is subtly but legibly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Accumulative/Textural structure is effective, building density towards a potent Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands with a clear "before/after" on the character's purpose. However, the climactic trigger—a chain of a pin drop, condensation, and a perfectly resonant cup—leans heavily on coincidence, slightly undermining the sense of earned discovery even within this resonant structure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is an excellent example of an Accumulative/Textural lens. It builds pressure not through causal turns but through the intensification of a single, continuous action. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), is on-page, has a clear felt cost (the keeper's memories), and provides a satisfying cadence to the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story effectively uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building internal pressure toward a clear closure moment. The final action of writing and delivering the note provides a legible on-page Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Eleanor crystallizes her stance with a felt opportunity cost. The structure is coherent and sound for its internal focus.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building atmosphere toward a final revelation. The closure unit—a Decisive Change in Eliza's internal state—is on the page, but its causal foundation is soft. The cost is tied to a past guilt that is introduced too late to feel consequential, weakening the 'before/after' legibility of her absolution and making the ending feel somewhat emotionally convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear and logical Causal progression, and the ending achieves a valid Decisive Change as Elias shifts from archivist to restorer. However, the closure is weakened by an insufficiently felt cost. The discovery of a solution comes too easily, and the final tone of unambiguous hope undercuts the weight of the "painstaking" new burden he must undertake. The resolution lacks the price that would make it truly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and compelling causal chain (Lens: Causal). The setup is clear, the protagonist's plan unfolds in logical stages, and the climax is a direct result of her actions. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where she successfully captures her abstract prize at the cost of unleashing violence, is executed on the page with a powerful final image that recontextualizes her "collection," satisfying the core drive with a felt, if externalized, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is a superb example of an Accumulative/Textural drive, building sensory and conceptual density toward its conclusion. The closure, a combination of Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing, is executed on the page with a clearly legible cost: the choice to "converge" forecloses the "comfort of skepticism." Causality is handled effectively through the intensification of sensory phenomena, making the final confrontation feel both inevitable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional weight toward a clear closure. The structure is sound for its length, with a functional inciting incident (the cleaning lady's discovery) leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration (the reclamation of his art). The ending lands on the page with a legible, felt cost—the integration of sorrow into creation.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain leading to a well-executed Charged Poise closure. The inciting discovery of the map is coincidental but serves to complicate, not resolve, making it acceptable for this length. The final image of Elara packing for a journey based on a reconfigured understanding of her quest provides a resonant and costly "after" state.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens appropriate for a fable, culminating in a legible Conceptual Repricing at the protagonist's death. The structure is coherent in its life-summary approach. However, it completely substitutes summary for scene; the plot is a sequence of "and then" statements, lacking the because/therefore causality that creates narrative drive. While functional as a myth, it fails to dramatize any pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.4)
    The plot is impeccably structured under a Hybrid (Situational->Causal) lens. The external pressure of the magnetic shift provides a clear inciting incident that drives a tight, logical chain of events. The Decisive Change at the end—the android's transformation and the garden's survival—is a direct result of its choices and lands with a perfectly legible on-page cost (the inert original body).

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.5)
    The accumulative structure effectively builds a communal history, and the final conceptual repricing provides a resonant closure. However, the plot's central mechanism relies on a significant coincidence: Mrs. Henderson producing the key at the perfect moment. The thematic justification ("someone who listens would follow its trail") feels like an attempt to patch a deus ex machina, weakening the causal chain that leads to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and context toward a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) at its closure: the secret language is her own. This moment successfully reweights the entire narrative with a felt conceptual cost—the decades spent searching for something that was hers all along. However, the structure is slightly weakened by the final two paragraphs, which feel like an epilogue that summarizes the aftermath rather than letting the powerful closure image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story follows a clean and compelling Causal lens. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands with a clear and felt cost: Elara finds her brother but cannot have him back, accepting a new role as a memory keeper. Every step, from the whale's arrival to the coffee grounds to the crystal, is logically connected within the story's speculative framework, making the final discovery both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building intensity effectively toward its closure. The final action—releasing the crane—provides a resonant reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) that is legible and has a felt cost in the form of intense, focused effort and subsequent relief. The narrative arc is complete and satisfying for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, building layers of mystery toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The structure is sound for its length. However, the final reveal of a shared heritage feels somewhat convenient, serving as a deus ex machina to explain the initial connection rather than an earned consequence of the characters' actions and choices.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure is a clean, single-scene ritual that builds pressure toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The final image of Elara accepting her role as archivist lands with a legible cost—the burden of the memories—making the before/after state change clear and earned within this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, culminating in a Decisive Change with a felt cost. However, the inciting incident—the arrival of a magical key that conveniently fits a non-existent lock and dissolves a stone wall—is a significant deus ex machina. This convenience undermines the integrity of the causal chain, introducing a magical solution to a grounded, human problem, which weakens an otherwise solid structure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.0)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure holds: a situation is introduced, deepened, and resolved with a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure is clear and the core narrative sequence is logical. The plot, however, feels frictionless and thin, as stated threats like "webs of intrigue" and "multiple forces converging" never manifest as tangible obstacles, making the resolution feel preordained rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective two-shard structure with a strong Causal drive. The plot progresses logically from discovery to investigation to resolution without any breaks in causality. Closure is achieved on the page through a Decisive Change (the spirit's release) and a Resonant Reconfiguration (the globe clearing), with the cost felt by the descendants, making the ending earned and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    The structure is an excellent example of an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building a philosophical state through ritual and observation. The progression from cabin to parapet and back creates a coherent narrative frame. Closure is achieved through a Conceptual Repricing, where the philosopher's worldview is deepened and affirmed, with the cost being his willing solitude and embrace of ephemerality. The structure perfectly serves the story's contemplative aims.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story follows an exceptionally strong and legible causal chain, progressing from mystery to investigation to revelation. The closure is a clear Decisive Change (a new mission) that is a direct result of the preceding actions and carries an on-page, understood cost (danger to her life), perfectly fitting the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building to a resonant closure of Earned Stasis. Orientation is swift and clear. The primary weakness is the lack of a significant tightening; the news from the surface deepens the context and validates the protagonist's work but does not force a new, higher-stakes choice or narrow his options. The plot is a confirmation, not a causal progression born from crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, effective Accumulative/Textural structure for its length, with a clear setup, inciting incident, and resolution. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where the atmosphere of the senior center is transformed, landing on the page with a felt cost—the poet's affirmed but solitary role. The causality is sound and serves the emotional arc well, making it a structurally solid piece.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Causal drive lens is executed flawlessly with a clear because/therefore structure from inciting incident to resolution. Orientation is immediate and effective, and the plot escalates logically toward a single, decisive climax. The closure, a Decisive Change paired with a Resonant Reconfiguration of his duty, lands with a clear, felt cost ("forever changed"), making the structure highly effective for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is excellent. The story builds atmospheric pressure toward a single, decisive moment of confirmation. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the viaduct’s hum validates the mapper's theory, shifting the story from a state of waiting to one of imminent action, with the cost of a decade's work felt through the character's dedication.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from discovery to decision, and the closure lands with a felt cost (career risk). The structure is undermined by a significant coincidence at its core: the historical artifact containing a clue to a contemporary crime stretches credulity. This convenience weakens the inciting incident, even though the subsequent progression is logical.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, Causal lens within a single scene, leading to a potent closure of Earned Stasis. The decision not to fix the heart is a decisive change in stance with a clear conceptual cost. The plot is slightly marred by the symbolic convenience of the heart stopping on the exact day he found the ex-wife, which feels more like magical realism than earned causality within an otherwise grounded story.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean and logical causal chain under the Causal lens: the discovery of the arrow tip necessitates transliteration, which leads to the kaleidoscope, providing directions that result in finding and ringing the bell. The closure is a Decisive Change (ringing the bell) that lands with a resonant reconfiguration of the glider's purpose. The cost is conceptual—the immediate recalibration of yearning—which is legible and earned by the story's premise.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes a clean, causal plot structure. The inciting incident (noticing the numbers) logically progresses to the climax (the illegal access) and a valid Charged Poise closure where Elara becomes a fugitive. The narrative moves with purpose and the stakes are paid on the page. The structure is effective and well-paced for the length, with the central turn hinging on a character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean, functional structure for its length under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens. The setup (broken crystal), development (recollection of the mirror method), and closure (reconstitution) are causally linked and legible. The final image of the completed crystal provides a clear Decisive Change that reconfigures the settlement's future, landing with a felt sense of accomplishment against the elders' skepticism, which serves as the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and resonant dialogue rather than causal plot events. The structure is clean, moving from a state of despair to a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands with a clear, felt cost—the forfeiture of the "easy" peace she sought in exchange for the uncertainty of a new beginning.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural structure effectively. It establishes its core images and concepts early, repeats them to build a meditative rhythm, and concludes with a clear Conceptual Repricing where the meaning of the letter, the station, and his purpose are reconfigured. The closure lands with a felt cost—the acceptance of loneliness as a necessary condition for his calling—making the before/after state legible and earned within this reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Orientation is immediate, and the narrative follows a single, coherent ritualistic arc. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis for the preserved wisdom), lands with a clearly stated conceptual cost, making the before/after state change legible and effective within its own mystical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot moves from preparation to ritual to a final resonant image, effectively building atmosphere. The closure is a well-earned Resonant Reconfiguration, where the group's shared experience reweights their pain with a felt cost of ongoing effort and shared vulnerability, landing cleanly in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building density of insight toward a powerful closure. The final beat delivers a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) as the scholar's purpose shifts from preservation to translation. This re-weights the entire narrative with a felt cost—the burden of a new, unending duty—and the final image of the crystal makes this shift resonant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere toward a resonant closure. The ending achieves a form of Earned Stasis, where the prophet's success is charged with the cost of its own ephemerality ("before it slipped away"). While the caretaker's appearance borders on coincidence, it functions as confirmation rather than resolution, preserving the integrity of the prophet's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clear causal path from problem to resolution, and the closure lands with a resonant conceptual cost. However, the central causal link—the moment of discovery—is weak and unearned. The "method, by the sound of a leaf falling" is an abstract assertion that functions as a deus ex machina, weakening the otherwise solid structure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for its length, operating as a single, continuous scene under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands with precision and palpable cost as the therapist reframes "reunification" and "flawless goodbye." The before/after state of the family's grief is made legible through the charged final image of the son holding the vinyl fragment, earning the high score.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Causal drive lens is executed flawlessly, with a clear because/therefore progression from goal to method to outcome. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, lands with decisive force. The cost is legible: her focused quest is over, replaced by a vast and daunting new reality, making the final moment a strong example of Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural) lens, building atmosphere and thematic resonance toward a definitive closure. The ending is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the reunion redefines the relationship and stakes. The cost—exchanging certainty for mystery—is tangible and on the page, making the before/after state legible without a simple resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds density through craft and memory, leading to a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure, where Elara's limitation is repriced as a "unique vantage point," lands with the felt cost of her original dream being permanently foreclosed, making the final stasis fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through observation and reflection towards a clear closure. The final act of placing the pendant constitutes a valid Conceptual Repricing with a felt cost—the relinquishing of a family heirloom. The structure is coherent and the final image lands with resonance, though the epilogue-like final paragraph slightly over-explains the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is highly effective. Orientation is immediate, and the piece builds emotional and thematic density toward a powerful closure. The final act—placing the seashell on the manuscript—provides a tangible focal point for the Resonant Reconfiguration, landing the internal shift with a visible, felt cost of years of struggle being re-contextualized into peace. The lens holds perfectly through to this final, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clean, Causal structure with a clear inciting incident and resolution. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the community's identity is restored, is legible. However, the plot progression lacks friction; Elara conceives a plan and executes it flawlessly. The resolution feels convenient and lacks a tangible cost, which weakens the impact of the final change.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot is the ritual, and it progresses with a clear, intensifying logic from setup to a decisive on-page closure. The final transformation of the orchard serves as a Resonant Reconfiguration with a clear before/after state, and the felt cost is the immense concentration and the risk of total failure. The narrative is tightly focused and structurally sound for its length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through the steady accretion of observation rather than causal turns. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the timer awakens, is earned and lands with a satisfying cadence shift. The plot is elegant and economical, with the "before" (broken silence) and "after" (thrumming echoes) states made perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The plot is a ritual, building in weight and significance until the final burden triggers a Conceptual Repricing (CR) that recontextualizes the weaver's existence. The closure lands on the page with a clear "before" (trapped) and "after" (connected), and the cost is the weaver's continued, lonely service. This is a sophisticated and effective structure for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot progresses not through external events but through the intensification of an internal state, anchored by sensory details. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), is masterful; the final image of constellations in the rain reweights her entire experience with a palpable felt cost—the acceptance of a permanently altered peace.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate, and the plot builds through the collection of components (wheel, stories) toward a clear climax. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where the lagoon's currents align with time—is earned, visually potent, and carries a felt cost in the surrender of the camera wheel. The causal logic, while fantastical, is internally consistent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clean Causal lens with a clear setup and payoff. However, the closure is significantly weakened by coincidence. The discovery of perfectly relevant "coordinates and equations" on the sextant piece at the exact moment of success feels like a deus ex machina. This convenience undermines the "earned" quality of her conceptual breakthrough, making the resolution feel contrived rather than a result of her own ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, effectively building atmosphere and memory to precipitate an internal shift. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, is achieved when Elias offers the watch, a clear on-page action that solidifies his change in stance. The cost is the thirty years of regret, now reframed as a catalyst for his future, which lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, building atmosphere and thematic weight toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands effectively, redefining Elara's mission and reweighting the meaning of the sundial. The cost is the felt burden of her new knowledge, making the before/after state legible and earned within the story's quiet scope.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, executing a single, continuous scene with powerful focus. The Accumulative/Textural drive builds pressure through sustained observation, shifting to a Causal trigger with the fulgurite reveal. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, is earned and lands cleanly on the page with a felt cost of time and the weight of the new journey, making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly, building thematic density toward a powerful closure. The final turn—from writing for others to writing for himself—constitutes a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, landing with a felt emotional cost on the page. The story's architecture is elegant and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot demonstrates a clean and effective Causal structure for its length. The prince's attempt leads directly to a temporary success, then a failure, which in turn causes a crucial change in his understanding and future plans. The ending achieves a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), with the cost of failure felt on the page, crystallizing a new, more difficult path forward.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building thematic density through recurring motifs rather than a strict causal chain. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maya successfully protects her grafts, affirming her path, with the cost legible in the surrounding destruction. The final image of the lagoon reflecting the sun provides a powerful, earned sense of renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: search, obstacle, revelation, resolution. The structure is sound and the orientation is immediate. However, the closure, while a Decisive Change, lacks a meaningful on-page cost. The "dangerous" memories are released with pure grace, which undermines the initial stakes and makes the resolution feel too tidy and unearned for a top-tier piece.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean two-shard structure under a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is handled well, and the plot proceeds logically from preparation to execution to return. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands effectively with a legible conceptual cost in the final lines ("eternal yet changing, complete yet yearning"), making the before/after state of the civilization and the sentimentalist's own experience clear.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds thematic and emotional density toward a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where the monument redefines grief as a shared, transformative experience, is earned and lands with conceptual cost (the depleted ribbon, the completion of a generational cycle). Orientation is immediate, and the causal logic, while poetic, remains coherent within its own rules.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story's causal structure is its greatest strength. The progression from the stopped pendulum to the communal repair is logical and well-paced. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration of Alaric's identity, lands cleanly on the page with a felt cost (his pride and isolation), fulfilling the requirements for a strong, publishable arc within this length.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds atmospheric pressure toward a clear point of closure—a Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist's understanding is fundamentally reweighted. The final realization ("sacrificial rather than romantic") lands with a palpable conceptual cost, fulfilling the requirements for a top-tier score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure toward a decisive final act. The closure is a perfect example of Charged Poise, where the act of beginning to write reconfigures all future options for the villagers. The cost—the burden of change and adaptation—is keenly felt, making the ending resonant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story establishes its premise and concludes with a resonant final image (a CR/Earned Stasis). However, the structure is critically flawed by placing a large block of world-building exposition after the central action of the broadcast has already concluded. This info-dump about the famine's history and the mechanics of dust-listening deflates the story's tension and momentum, feeling more like an appendix than integrated narrative causality. Reordering this information to surface earlier would significantly improve the plot's architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story effectively uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through imagery and reflection rather than causal events. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the rocking chair's halt triggers a re-evaluation of Elena's life's work, landing with a clear conceptual cost (abandoning the goal of safety-in-completion). The structure is deliberate and holds together well for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly. The structure is simple but potent, building from a discovery to a quiet, powerful resolution. The closure is an excellent example of Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Milo's choice to preserve the cog reaffirms his lonely path with a clear, felt cost of continued opposition and isolation. The final image provides a strong Conceptual Repricing of knowledge vs. progress, landing with significant weight.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a portrait over time rather than using a scene-based causal chain. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, with the passing of the rosette providing a concrete anchor for the story's thematic resolution. The primary weakness is that the progression is handled through summary ("Through months of practice"), which lessens the feeling of earnedness, though the structure itself is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story's structure is a model of economy for the accumulative/textural lens. It establishes its anchors cleanly and builds atmospheric pressure toward a single, decisive act. The closure, a form of Charged Poise, lands effectively, making the before/after state of the seed clear and resonant. The quiet, earned nature of the ending is a significant strength.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain driven by Elara’s condition, adhering to its single-scene structure effectively. The ascent of the tower provides a strong physical scaffolding for the plot's progression. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of Elara's affliction, lands on the page but feels abrupt, as the supervisor's capture and the beehive's repair are resolved with convenient speed, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through observation and ritual rather than causal turns. The structure is sound for its length, culminating in a clear Conceptual Repricing at the lighthouse keeper's cottage. The closure lands, and the subtle cost—the replacement of mystery with knowledge—is legible, making the before/after state clear.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building knowledge layer by layer. The structure is simple but effective for the length, moving from initial revelation to a climactic immersion. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the diver's worldview shifts from seeking answers to asking better questions, with the loss of certainty as the clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens: hesitation leads to confinement, methodical work leads to a solution, and the solution leads to rupture and a second chance. The closure is a decisive change with a clear cost—an eternity of labor—that is repriced as wisdom in the final moment. The structure is sound, and the final beat satisfyingly resolves the initial problem.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)

    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the town’s harmonic balance is restored, collapse averted, and Silas exits. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each footstep + fork strike layers resonance until the whole town answers in chord. Orientation is immediate; the single-scene arc holds. Cost is implied (his solitary departure) but not viscerally staged, keeping it just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sealed temple and captured starlight reweight Elena’s prior risk, making the cost (oxygen debt, permanent exile from the site) undeniable. Causal lens holds: each beat (gauge tick, vial warmth, door rumble) tightens options until the final ascent. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the lattice now bears his own story, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned repetitions tighten toward the final image—yet causality between beats is more associative than because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Drive lens: accumulative/textural; pattern—moonlit increment, bead pulse, seed release—tightens until the dying bead crystallizes a before/after. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: her dispersal into spiral bloom visibly bridges worlds, leaving greenhouse forever altered. Static reflection block at ~30% is anchored to present cues and alters her stance about timing the seeds, so BRR exception holds; pattern is taught early and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.0)
    Closure is a summary assertion rather than an on-page Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration; the “new precedents” are declared, not dramatized. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the final cadence shift is missing a felt cost. Orientation is clear, yet causality between plate, sleepwalking, and communal pilgrimage is elided.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise in the sundial’s first shadow and Kaelen’s felt unburdening. Causal chain holds: return → discovery → daily rebuilding → final piece → spiritual completion. One smooth transition from orchard entry to dig site; orientation anchored within 120 words. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causality holds: dawn light triggers reflection → chalk codes signal colleague → letter drop seals identity trade. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration, reweighting self-transformation against transparency under the Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    The causal chain (cosmic anomaly → embroidered sabotage → coup unravels) is tight; closure lands as Earned Stasis when she lets the conspirators dismiss her. The only hairline slip is the off-stage execution of the sabotage, slightly blurring the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal spine—“because she seeks the unwritten letter—therefore she braves the labyrinth—therefore the window scripts condensation”—lands cleanly; only the final forgiveness across time stretches plausibility beyond single-scene evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lens = Hybrid (textural accumulation & situational crystallization). Closure lands as a quiet reconfiguration: coral returned as promise kept across absence—felt cost clear. Timeline anchored early, minor echo of backstory not yet constrained by action.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each light-reveal beat deepens pattern and culminates in a Charged Poise (“hope had taken root”). Closure is on-page, yet the cost is communal rather than personal—Amelia’s own stake is never foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elena replaces the nickel, crystallizing her new stance (Charged Poise). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each awakening layers density until the final cadence shift. The causal chain is loose (nickel as coincidence), but the pattern is taught early and paid off. Cost is felt in her dissolved certainty, though the nickel’s prior placement strains plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Kaelen’s moment of pure thought reclaims humanity under the Thought Tax. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density of gardens, insects, and coded speech tightens to the final image—though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a lyric Charged Poise: poet’s death crystallizes centuries of lullabies into the shell’s living memory. Causality is accumulative/textural; pattern taught early but escalation is diffuse, lacking a decisive tightening beat. Orientation holds; shell, postcard, and blossoms remain coherent spatial anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored chime sings forgotten names, reweighting the library’s fading purpose. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each step (discovery, repair, rehanging) deepens the elegiac pattern. One transition (preservation room) is legible and brief. Orientation is clear by line 4; no penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Elena steps toward the chamber carrying translations whose weight is legible (“bridges waiting to be rebuilt”). Causality is causal-lens: each translated promise tightens the stakes because/therefore until the final image crystallizes the cost. Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the seasonal-lake plan crystallizes as a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights both preservation and progress. Causal chain holds—adhesive analysis → inscription → design—though the envelope’s prior agency is slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of paper-trail images thickens until the meteorite’s weight reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise as the bird lifts, foreclosing anonymity with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. Minor ellipsis in the winter-loss paragraph is justified by later payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of thresholds intensifies until the oak doorway crystallizes the stakes. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—“Home” reweights the logbook and the maze—though the father’s sudden arrival softens the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the burnt feather transforms into a map, crystallizing Maya’s new stance and foreclosing isolation. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each luminous pattern deepens density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. Cost is felt in her changed self, though external stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: “disappearance often means becoming something more beautiful.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of seeds, glass, and light deepens until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is felt in the shift from anxious conjecture to elegiac acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Leo stands silent between acts, the cost made legible—“inside, he congratulated himself… would now become hers”—the moment reconfigures the token’s value and Leo’s private ledger. The causal lens holds: each setup (eaves-dropping on earbuds, timing footsteps) causally enables the intervention. No orientation debt; anchors arrive within 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lira crystallizes into a living manuscript, the cost visible in her rooted stillness. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of gaps, moonstone, inscription. Transitions are smooth; no orientation debt. One minor causality slip: the moonstone’s dissolve feels slightly convenient rather than earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing — reframing of vocation — but the cost is abstract (“tranquility”) rather than concrete; lens is Accumulative/Textural and the pattern holds. Orientation is prompt and clear. No friction at closure, yet the causal beat between pond insight and workshop decision is elided.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene causal arc holds: inciting discovery of box → ridge reflection → re-weighting of box’s meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: “no longer an accusation, but a companion.” No orientation drift; moonlit ridge anchors early.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.1)
    A causal, mythic-science hybrid lens holds: every beat’s “because/therefore” links decorations → gauge → possibility-current. Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the compass re-weights the entire map of futures. Orientation debt is minimal; tide shift anchors time early.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each artifact layers meaning until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a quiet CR—walls’ dreams now include her voice—but the cost is only implied, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirrors’ revelations crystallize possibilities and then vanish, leaving the terrace’s borrowed heartbeat to slow with “familiar melancholy.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (rain, prism, bells) tightens the pattern until the final image reweights the premise with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elian leaves the ebony clipboard behind, reconfiguring their own future while acknowledging perpetual debt. Causality is accumulative/textural; the lens holds, though the final paragraph edges toward overt thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the egg’s release crystallizes Silas’s stance and reweights the drought’s meaning from triumph to elegy. Causal lens holds: the drought he caused forces the egg’s extinction, which in turn forces his private act. Cost is legible in the rain erasing his footprints—his public self dissolving. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s integration into the chorus of echoes—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The pattern of thread-untying is taught early and paid off, though the exact moment of cost is diffuse rather than pinpointed.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise—Elias smiles at “next project”—but the cost is only implied. Causal chain is loose: argument → puppet show → reflection, with no tightening beat. Orientation is clear; transitions are smooth. Lens reads Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the knotted signals glow under starlight, reconfiguring the meaning of memory and loss. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each knot adds density until the final image crystallizes cost. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. The only hairline slip is a slight drift in lens clarity at the midpoint, but the ending re-anchors it.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the rope’s illumination and crystallized names constitute a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (she stays, forever). Causal chain—card pattern → braid reconfiguration → auroral transcription—holds without gaps. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure delivers the promised Conceptual Repricing—“walkers also choose their paths”—with charged image of sunrise through vines; beats accumulate rather than rely on causal linkage, coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Anu’s palms glow with covenant marks, sealing a path with felt cost. Causal chain (tile → schematic → ritual → revelation) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the fused music boxes crystallize a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (resentment released). Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each pulse of the sanctuary intensifies pattern until the final image reweights meaning. Minor drift: the brother’s arrival lacks causal trigger on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sextant now points to possibility, not stars, and the orchard reconfigures from ruin to star-fruit. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of mirrored imagery and breath-cadence tighten until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is felt in the maker’s aged tremor and the irreversible shift in the sextant’s function. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each object added to the bridge thickens emotional density until the final image reweights the orchard as living archive. Closure lands in the apple-seed exchange—Conceptual Repricing that reframes “deciduous vows” as perennial roots. No causality breaks; spatial/temporal anchors are clear by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s comprehension reweights the premise with conceptual cost (“universe both laughed and wept”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned imagery and cadence shift charge the ending. Causality holds; however, the decisive moment is slightly abstract, softening the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: “gaps in understanding were…sacred and urgent” reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Causal chain is intact—diary → negotiation → extraction—but the pivotal renegotiation beat is summarized, softening the tightening. Orientation is clear early; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s acceptance of chronicler duty carries conceptual cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early, closure reweights premise, though emerald-card dissolve is slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure is a decisive change: the temporal merge succeeds and Croft appears, reconfiguring Eleanor’s reality. Causality holds under a causal lens: seal vibration → braid pattern → golden light → Croft. Cost is legible in the narrative weight given to “warnings of what happened when certain temporal doors were opened.” Minor deduction for a slight mid-scene exposition lull.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV, two discrete shards (disturbed caves → Ice Sanctum → re-center) with one legible transition. Closure is an Earned Stasis: the bloom of hush locks in the new harmonic frequency, the stone forever altered. Causality under Accumulative/Textural lens holds, but the orientation test finesse required by the Ice Sanctum is light-resolution, not decisive crux, so cost remains glance-level not bone-deep.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the beacon’s rekindling reframes collapse as transformation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of star charts, prism glow, pavilion hum layers to a cadence shift. Cost is legible in “fragile light…would not last forever,” foreclosing permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image reconfigures the stake from “preserve memory” to “sculpt identity,” with felt cost in the deepening hush; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds, though the causal linkage between shadow-length conjecture and this crystallized stance is lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the starless void → color-soaked courtyard reconfigures the emotional stakes with visible transformation. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each ignition beat layers density until the final image reweights hope itself. Minor causality wobble: the mosaic note arrives late as a deus-ex-machina code, but the payoff justifies the delay.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya’s reframing of “uncertainties as essential components” crystallizes under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The pause itself becomes the decisive beat; however, the causality between funding threat and conceptual breakthrough is more asserted than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the gilded hush is harvested and will re-weight her underground life, with the cost of leaving the doll behind felt in the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each silence sampled layers density until the final cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the last image of Elias “ready once again” crystallizes his endless stewardship and the quiet cost of perpetual service. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers sensory density until the final hush reweights the premise. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure holds—a resonant reconfiguration where Elara activates the throne and relinquishes personal power, foreclosing her own ascension. Causal chain from ruby’s resonance to mural map to elevator/awakening is intact. Cost: handing over the literal seat of sovereignty feels palpable, yet her emotional stake in the transfer is lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a decisive change: she leaves isolation to teach another to breathe, paying with the sanctuary she has just abandoned. Causal chain—ring warms → she knocks → door appears → she crosses—holds under the Causal lens. Cost is legible in the final image: dawn replaces starlight, solitude replaced by linkage. Orientation is immediate and spatially coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—pressure literally becomes diamonds—so the ending unit is valid. Causality, however, is external: glitchy texts feed every location and action; Maya merely follows. No meaningful tightening or reversal occurs between beats; escalation is additive description, not rising cost under a because/therefore chain.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    Motivations for the modified gramophone and the concealment of the forgery remain logically implied but not dramatized on page; the final closure beat (handing over the parchment) lands with a felt cost under an Accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.9)
    Selects Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density, dreamtime tempo, and final CR of re-seeing the world. Orientation anchors quickly; transition to “multiple realities overlapping” functions as closure. Feels a beat long—but the repricing of perception after “he would finally return” pays.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the button’s return reweights Eleanor’s solitude into shared witness. Dust-pattern forensics is taught early and paid off at the reunion. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; only minor ellipsis between file discovery and Benjamin’s arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lagoon’s golden surface becomes a charged poise where the archive’s survival is reweighted against capture risk. Causal chain holds—key insertion → protocol override → data exfiltration—each step narrowing options. Orientation is swift; stakes escalate because/therefore style. Cost is felt in the alarms and the forced flight into marshes.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing (CR) succeeds: the final sentence reweights “vested hush” from menace to earned quiet. However, the causal link from music to neutralized prophecy is asserted more than dramatized; lens stays Accumulative/Textural with a clear cadence shift, not a Causal chain. Slight over-summary in the victory beat prevents 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of seed-sorting → moonstone discovery → glowing monument → decoded warning. Closure is a Charged Poise: the moonstone monument glows, reconfiguring Elara’s attunement and the arbor’s future, with the cost of perpetual bodily change legible in “already feeling the first whispers of next year’s transformation.”

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of living clocks reweights the premise with undeniable cost—Elias’s lifelong goal is foreclosed. Causal lens holds: each beat (compass response, greenhouse descent, clock discovery) tightens options under “because/therefore” logic. No orientation debt; anchors clear by 120 words. One micro-turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    A tight causal arc (“failed search → luminous regret → kintsugi forging → rebalanced purpose”) drives stakes; closure lands as visible Conceptual Repricing—the flawed coin is accepted as golden seam—showing a newly oriented stance with felt cost under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: Thomas’s dissolution is a decisive change charged with earned joy, and the lingering warmth of the tooth reconfigures Elias’s next steps. Causal chain holds—distorted notes → tooth → bell → release—though the middle beats glide rather than tighten. No orientation debt; gorge and sunrise anchors arrive early.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the strap’s activation reframes survival as the first variable of mercy. Causal chain (strap → pattern → revelation) holds; cost is the unflinching witness he must keep paying. Orientation anchors by line 3; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of memory → market → painting reweights meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the fragment fully solidifies, but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Orientation is clear within 120 words. One transition (childhood to market) is handled cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: daily 4:17 silence → barrier thinning → barrel activation → ghost contact → acceptance. Closure lands as Charged Poise: the ticking after silence reconfigures his curse as conduit with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is clean by 120 words; no lens ambiguity at end.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library breathes, Eldon both preserves and destroys his life’s work, and the cost is legible in the cracking-reforming glass. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern intensification rather than causal chain—yet the rupture beat could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the manuscript’s circulation reweights the dispute into shared reimagining. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers symbolic density until the shard becomes a communal relic—though the causal bridge from “I will write” to “they read with astonishment” is elided.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the midnight chime triggers the decisive reconnection, and the city-wide restoration is felt as earned resonance. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each echo, glow, and chime layers density until the final cadence reweights the stakes. Cost is visible in the stone’s earlier wilting and Elias’s bodily warmth at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    The plot arc from auction-compass clue to subterranean revelation unfolds under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat layers sensory density and reconfigures meaning. Closure—the third hinged awakening dissolving self-boundary—is earned and priced by irrevocable immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the slide’s visions tighten the pattern until the sculpture crystallizes a Charged Poise. Orientation is swift, closure is legible, yet the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the moonlit glass reweights the stake with quiet conceptual cost. Causality is loose—travel and caretaker access are lightly sketched—but the final image reconfigures meaning without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lagoon accepts her message and rewrites the diary, reweighting her role from collector to maker. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the final image crystallizes—but the jump from “beach debris vanishes” to “grandfather’s final words appear” is a mild causal leap.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the amber bottle’s metaphor reweights the premise (“contained potential within everything”) and Elior chooses to activate latent community rather than seek an external fix. Causal chain is clear, but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (obsidian, orchard, wax, memory) tightens the stake until the final Charged Poise—“ready to begin his new work”—reweights Elias’s duty with irreversible cost. Anchors are clear by line 4; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the spiral of seeds plus cap opens the vortex and reconfigures Anya’s stance from observer to participant. Causality proceeds from entropy decrease → vortex → touch → becoming bridge; each step follows. Tight, no breaks; cost is the irreversible abandonment of her old saving ritual, palpable in her final reach.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the bell rings itself, reweighting the premise. Causal chain (rope repair → switch → bell’s autonomous note) holds; cost is conceptual—the sanctuary now speaks without him.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a pattern of quiet observation thickens until the final reconfiguration. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that reweights the premise, but the cost is only conceptually implied—“forever changed” lacks on-page embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Driven by an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure deepens through pattern accumulation: hives → spirits → box → silence covenant. The closure unit—release of the single bee beneath oldest hive—is Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost: the recluse’s lifelong silence. Orientation anchors cleanly by sun-cracked domes; no lens contradiction at end.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s new role weaving messages into mundane objects crystallizes her stance with felt cost—she accepts perpetual guardianship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each decoded garage-sale line thickens the tapestry until the final image reweights the premise. One minor causality slip: the “suddenly timeless” beat is asserted rather than earned by prior cues.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of release (kite snap → ink flow) tightens cadence toward closure. Closure is a Charged Poise—journal closed, feather bookmarked—cost is the surrender of the kite and the child’s cry absorbed into landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the orchard’s luminous transformation reconfigures meaning and stakes while Elias’s death supplies undeniable cost. Causal chain (diary → copper circuits → awakening) is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens; no orientation debt. One transition (cottage → orchard) is cleanly handled.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal linkage is largely clear, with each beat motivated by the need to follow footprints or converge. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing (recognition as chemistry of homecoming) but cost is under-projected; his “finally free from doubt” feels too easy after prior skepticism. Orientation holds; towers and sculptures remain legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: seed-by-seed scattering tightens pattern until dawn’s “promise in his wake” crystallizes Charged Poise. One transition (carriage→jetty→battlefield) is clean; closure cost is the emptied hands and lifelong solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear single-scene arc under an Accumulative/Textural lens; anniversary sketches repeat and deepen, yielding thematic closure—an Earned Stasis that reverberates with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain—sky wrong → climb → chess-sequence gates → sundial mends sky—holds cleanly under a Causal lens. Closure lands on the page: the golden light spreads, constellations correct, cost is the irreversible act of placing the lid. Orientation is anchored early; transitions between chambers are legible. Minor flaw: the master’s pre-arrival is a convenient beat rather than an earned twist.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the materialized pawn crystallizes the cost of her archival labor and reweights the gallery’s silence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each footfall adds density until the final luminous absence—though the causality of “unbinding” remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (CR): mountain dissolves into “doorway between all homes,” cost felt as prior alienation paid off. Causality is accumulative/textural—density increase via feather-guided texture—but late-third appearance of stone + feather reads more enchanted than causally seeded; small cohesion slip at final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the prince’s offered hand crystallizes the tutor’s earned humility and restarts time. Causal chain—tapestry → labyrinth → suspended prince—holds without gaps. The four-minute thunder lull is a persistent constraint that shapes tactics and is paid off when the bell rings.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dawn’s poetry session layers density until the canyon itself “breathes with alternatives.” Closure lands as Charged Poise—her whispered line refracted into “a chorus of infinite variation”—with conceptual cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shift from erasure to kintsugi acceptance reweights the premise with conceptual cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each scar traced layers density until the final image crystallizes. The only hairline slip is the slightly abstract phrasing of the final sentence, which blurs the exact moment of reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the discovery of the shell reconfigures Elias’s stance toward time and memory, fulfilling the promise with felt cost—his trembling fingers and tears mark the price. The causal lens holds; the wrong turn is motivated by creative drought, and the shell’s return tightens the thematic loop.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is tight: cork → whisper → sister’s felt response → Elias’s tearful confirmation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the vial’s warmth certifies the bridge across oceans. The orientation anchor (cobalt lighthouse at dawn) is immediate; no orientation debt. One transition (garden shard) is brief and legible under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is felt in the irreversible shift from private theory to public vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the navigator’s “Welcome home” crystallizes the reverse migration’s stakes while the censer foot’s heat marks the cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. One tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the second eye reframes the relic’s purpose from occlusion to intentional navigation. Causal chain holds—storm masking, textbook ritual, naming list—culminating in the discovery that reweights the premise. Cost is legible in her cracked voice and the rare smile that concedes vulnerability. Lens is Causal; every beat tightens options until the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single-scene structure holds; causal chain (stranger → Edelweiss → memories → understanding → release) lands a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost: Elias accepts lifelong isolation now reweighted as connection. Orientation anchored by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elias steps through a shimmering threshold and exits the woods with a reconfigured relationship to solitude. Causal chain holds from mentor→promise→matrix→ants→cavern→doorway; no teleports, no retroactive fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal dream-path → physical climb → cobalt vision → starlight revelation tightens options cleanly; closure lands with an earned Resonant Reconfiguration and visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of heat, light, and spiral imagery intensifies until the final image reframes the craft. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s new “palette of resolve” crystallizes with conceptual cost (she must abandon her prior art), but the secret’s vagueness slightly blurs the before/after legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias accepts his role and the scroll’s call, with the dawn image crystallizing a before/after. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of dream-records, scroll, aurora, dawn—but the Orientation Test is waived because disorientation is functional. One tightening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Situational lens: coherent pressure from Lena’s return tightens stakes, turning small objects into life vessels. Closure lands on the page when Elara returns the screw and redefines midwife/clock meanings. Causality holds—no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single continuous scene anchored by 40 words; causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Each rune stroke tightens density until the final image reweights the stakes: scars become cautionary stories, quill tip falls—visible cost. No teleporting props or causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the incomplete sheet of music left on the piano reweights the entire encounter, making the cost of unfinished reconciliation legible. Causal chain holds—perfume summons, current bridges, apology releases—without gaps. The orchard’s scheduled destruction supplies a ticking external constraint that sharpens the final image. One minor ellipsis (how the sheet arrives) is forgivable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dictionary’s blank page fills with “patterns representing all that had been lost,” and the witness, library, and dictionary unify into “one resounding hush.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence shift reweight the stake with undeniable conceptual cost. Orientation is taught early through the paradoxical “journeying inward while walking out,” so no penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: Arlo’s new understanding reweights all prior time-measurement under the lens of lived stillness. The reversal of flow is on-page, cost is the abandonment of conventional timekeeping, and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds across the re-configuration.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the laser becomes a key to communion, reweighting “intrusion” into “guardianship.” Causal linkage holds: each laser adjustment invites reciprocal gesture, tightening stakes until the dawn handshake across the barrier crystallizes the new relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative lens sustained: rain-cleansing, subway data, library quiet all thicken into a single pattern-break—Fibonacci sequence mirroring her own research—then reweight choice into a pilgrimage motif. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Renunciation via Earned Stasis) as Elena forgoes mastery in favor of acknowledging uncertainty, paid with her father’s legacy. Causal linkages accumulate rather than pivot; this choice lands with poetic inevitability without logical break.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image reframes the tunnel from prison to sanctuary, with the glass disc’s melody shifting from mourning to hope. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned wrong-number calls build density until the stance crystallizes. Cost is felt in Elias’s relinquishing of silence, though the causality of Meredith’s call remains lightly coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer and ritual beat tightens the stake of irreversible loss. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the sealed vial and turned back crystallize the cost without tidy resolution. No causality breaks; orientation is swift and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain (rumor → connection) is tight and legible; closure is a resonant reconfiguration where the cure becomes the sharing itself, with the ivy-cloaked station as charged poise. One minor ellipsis: we jump from rumor launch to media reports without on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.2)
    The causal chain relies on successive “then-elion” sequences propelled by an omniscient lyric voice; the pause of constellations is introduced late as a cosmic permission slip. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with emotional cost, but the motivation for successive discoveries (stillpoint, ring absorption, melody) remains underdramatized and lacunae-filled.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the universe’s course is gently realigned, and Elara accepts perpetual uncertainty as the price. Causal linkage is maintained via the pen’s contingent edit → Sarah’s revision → research corrected. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the harbor “sings” while Elias disappears, reweighting silence as communal music. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of mappings intensifies rather than causal chain. Cost is felt in Elias’s necessary erasure, though the beat is more elegy than decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the restored portrait reveals her own face, reweighting the premise. Causal chain holds—each artistic clue because/therefore leads to the next, culminating in the tapestry’s instruction. Cost is legible in the volcanic tenderness of that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden becomes the lagoon, Theo coalesces, and the cost is the certain knowledge that the moment will be torn away. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of drumming builds to pattern of light—without causal contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the whisper system outperforms Vance’s shouts, crystallizing Marlo’s quiet authority. Causal chain is tight—maps, coin, acoustics all feed the payoff—but the absence of a visible price keeps it just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final star pattern crystallizes the unspoken secret’s weight and reconfigures both characters’ options without words. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each shutter adjustment deepens pattern density until the last image reframes the night. Cost is felt in the visitor’s transformed silence, though the guardian’s personal price remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single POV, two-shard build (evening grotto → dawn unveiling); causal chain crystal → displays → morning epiphany holds closure. Persistent constraint: gift still demands silence; free-indirect loops around it. Clear who/where/ when by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    The drive lens is cumulative/textural: pressure layers of found object, re-reading, whale call, piece-by-piece detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the courtyard’s collective inhale crystallizes the bartered awakening, and the cost—Elara’s unnoticed color return—reweights the premise. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density (Fibonacci spiral, glass reflections) tightens until the final shimmer. One micro-turn suffices; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure is a soft Charged Poise: the lab becomes “a cathedral of resonance” and tomorrow will bring “new questions.” The lens hums, but the beat does not foreclose an option or extract a price. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the pattern of questioning assumptions is taught early and echoed, yet the final image lacks a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elena accepts perpetual guardianship with visible nightly labor as cost. Causality is thematic rather than beat-driven; the observatory appears as fated response to grief, not a choice that narrows options. Transitions are smooth, but the single reflective arc edges the BRR ceiling without fresh present-tense pressure after the midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a crystallizing alliance that reweights stakes; the cultural-pattern engine unfolds under the last measured beat, making the crypto-crash reversal feel inevitable without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara’s consciousness fuses with the past, foreclosing return. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of memory-images escalates until the final reconfiguration. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. Cost is legible in the last light vanishing and her irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the shadow’s dissolution into moonlight reweights Elara’s mission from cataloguing anomalies to witnessing love’s persistence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each nightly observation thickens pattern until the final image crystallizes cost. One minor drift: the “Great Division” backstory is introduced late without cue.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the mist, lantern light, and chameleon’s color shifts layer density until the dawn lift reweights trust from absolute to chosen. Closure is a quiet Charged Poise—“she had found a way forward”—with felt cost in her first real smile. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara steps into the tunnel and emerges changed, the hourglass now empty. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterns in coffee rings and plant voices accrue until they reweight the stake. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of her lifelong quest, though the beat is compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each paragraph thickens the emotional residue until the final image reweights the entire booth as cathedral. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elena’s stance shifts from passive reader to active releaser of stored love, cost legible in the tear and the hushed thunder. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. Minor ellipsis in how the letters actually fuse with celluloid is allowed under lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (aurora, stardust, whispers) thickens until the pattern breaks into usable rhythm; closure is a Charged Poise—Elara poised between cacophony and art—cost legible in ‘bittersweet knowledge of all the vision she had missed.’

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the chess clock ticks from 00:00 to 00:01, reweighting time itself and charging the final image. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each shard layers pattern until the cadence shift at the end. Orientation is taught by the second sentence; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Selects Accumulative/Textural as dominant lens. Closure lands cleanly: gear becomes crucible, integrates, re-weights reality—but the “wild frontier inside” is described more than dramatized, muting cost intensity. No significant artifact or continuity error.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the punch transforms from fare marker to courage stamp, a crystallized new purpose. The drive lens is clearly Accumulative; the final image reweights every ferrying act that follows. The before/after is legible and tied to perpetual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the first sung note reconfigures the fortress and the bellhop’s stance. Causal lens holds: bolt discovery → etchings → recognition → decision → song. Cost is visible in the trembling hand and the fortress’s ancient hum. Orientation is anchored by word 60.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the pretender is her own fear, time restarts, and the library’s collapse is the felt cost. Causal chain—ink → rune → revelation—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the torn atlas page reweights the premise—coastlines aren’t just lost, they’re being reclaimed by pre-industrial cycles. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each data comparison tightens the pattern. Cost is felt in Marina’s exhausted “drifting and moored” stance. Minor drift: the fossil-fuel ban is named but never threaded into the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern of ruin → stone circle → luminous transformation. Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cosmic cost. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. Minor drift: the stone circle’s sudden appearance bends causality without prior cue.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the embryo’s glow reweights tradition. Causal chain (kite → script → chamber) holds, though the kite’s sudden appearance edges coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each return to the photograph and the children’s request tightens the pattern until the final release reweights meaning. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost as the photo vanishes. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: Eleanor’s stance crystallizes in the final image, reconfiguring meaning with felt cost (“not flawless, but alive”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each thread sorted tightens the pattern until the portrait emerges. Minor drift: the tarot box’s causal role is under-taught, so the reprise feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal lens holds: eclipse end triggers ink experiment → temporal disappearance reframes knowledge. Closure in Charged Poise articulates cost (bound to time’s fabric). One meaningful tightening sorts escalation via ink pattern mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: power fluctuation → thaw → discovery → upload → consequence. Closure is a decisive change with felt cost (“she prepared to face the consequences”). Orientation anchored by line 3. One minor ellipsis: how dormant networks remain undetected is elided but not critical to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density of sensory and thematic pattern tightens toward closure. Orientation anchored by word 60; no debt. Closure unit: Earned Stasis crystallized in “she sheathed her pruning shears,” the cost felt in bodily fatigue and the endless garden. Causality intact: each beat of tending reiterates the same quiet resistance, pattern deepening rather than plot reversing.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the goddess-echo is caught, the garden settles, and the constellations’ paths are forever altered—cost is legible in the rail-spike’s hum and the fisher’s quiet rest. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern-break, density, and cadence shift reweight the stake without causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is tight: journalist’s call → retreat to observatory → proof-by-contradiction → dawn breakthrough. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Eleanor’s stance crystallizes with the rosewood pen as symbol of reclaimed legacy. Cost is implied in the sleepless night and the risk of confronting power, though not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens: firmware → amber → tether yields one decisive lullaby instead of phantom crying; cost is the irreversible knowledge that the song was never lived. Closure satisfies DC with felt price. A mild orientation waver on “where” in the laboratory until ~150 words, offset by sensory anchoring, nets −0.1. No causality breaks; time-fold serves the reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the mandala’s resonance converts zealot anger into wonder, a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible social cost. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each added grain tightens the grotto’s acoustic pattern. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the plaza is renamed and reclaimed, the survivors’ stance visibly shifts, and the cost is the irreversible past Elias must keep reliving. Causality is accumulative/textural: each tessera touch layers memory until the mosaic’s pattern reweights meaning. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity. One minor drift: “Samarkhand” appears only once, so the renaming punch could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the garden is restored and Silas dissolves, a resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. Causal chain holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each sung echo tightens the weave—though the midpoint could be sharper in showing the irreversible price.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya’s “protocol” crystallizes her stance and forecloses pure skepticism, with the geode against her heart as felt cost. Causal chain holds—static shock → geode activation → somatic mapping → protocol—though the brother’s rescue remains off-page. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: Maya exits with fossil and purpose, a Resonant Reconfiguration under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is soft—why the fossil waited for her is asserted, not demonstrated—but the final image reweights the premise with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the warehouse becomes a “center of communal wisdom,” a clear before/after. Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each catalogued button tightens the pattern until the prophecy reweights—but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    Scene anchors within first two sentences (who, where, when) and maintains causal linkage under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Micro-turns snowball: pillbox retrieval → coded lattice → photo trigger → resolve to walk downhill each escalating inner pressure toward Charged Poise that reconfigures future orientation. Closure is cleanly rendered in the final image: pillbox snapped shut as earned vow. Cost is visible—not the photo itself but the choice to carry a future rather than a past.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final knot secures the boundary “for another day,” reconfiguring the night’s vigil into earned stasis. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each droplet, stitch, and mist layer thickens until the last gutter tick stops. Orientation is swift; causality is lyric rather than linear, but the pattern is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the oasis’s timelines collapse into a single vibrant present, and Kael’s stance crystallizes—he will share the knowledge, foreclosing solitude. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of attention (potter’s circles, sun patterns, kindness) reweights the stake. Cost is legible in the final image—night vigil, hands still working. One micro-turn: smoke portals shift from passive vision to active invitation.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mara’s purpose crystallizes while refracted moonlight fills the alcove, the cost being the night-long labor and the inheritance of her grandmother’s vigil. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each reflection adds density until the scene glows. Orientation is clear by line 6. One minor slip: coincidence (Jim already there) complicates rather than resolves, so lens integrity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena’s acceptance of coexistence reweights her isolation into connection. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned imagery of tides, hum, and mirror accumulates until the final image crystallizes. One causality wobble: the stone circle’s hum is introduced late yet immediately solves her crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the rain-washed world and mirrored spirals build density until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—she chooses to keep the first secret for herself—yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral; the reader feels possibility, not forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: because she deciphers the pattern, therefore she recalibrates, therefore the signal stops. Closure lands with a visible shift—silence in the room and town—though the cosmic tricksters’ possible retaliation is more hinted than priced.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (entering nexus, activating compass, transfixion, portal) follows “because/therefore” logic. Closure is a decisive change—portal opens, she crosses—paid for by bodily transfixion and forfeiture of the compass. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening: the fallow period’s dormancy enables the breach.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal chain is clear—ribbon → mask → guest list → assistant—but the decisive change (confession) happens off-page, softening closure; orientation is sound, lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (decoding stanza → revealing hidden panel → initiating sequence) follows because/therefore logic. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost—the station awakening reconfigures both weather and ancestral exile. Orientation is clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: a pattern of intensifying image-pulses that reweights Elias’s world. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: “sculpt possibility from the ashes of never” crystallizes as he steps among fluttering wraps that form wings. Orientation is anchored early by scenic pullout + note. Cost is subtly felt in the forfeiture of empirical certainty. Yet ambiguity lurks—pixelated mechanics unexplained—so the CR edges down a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure is a Charged Poise reflection that reweights the starting premise, but it is articulated explicitly rather than dramatized on-page. Orientation is clear; time anchors land within 120 words. Causality across the startup arc is implied more than shown (summary of rise and fall) and pivots rely on retrospective narration rather than linked tension. Closure cost is felt intellectually but not viscerally enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: telegram triggers pattern recognition, telescope work yields glyphs, collaboration unlocks healing. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—shared labor reframes her solitary gift. Orientation is clear by line 3; no teleporting props. One micro-turn (stars → legible language) lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mentor’s true face revealed reweights the entire premise. Causal chain holds—seed feeds on blood, plant eats ice, glamour dissolves—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens = causal. A clear Decisive Change occurs on the page: entering the miniature maze re-forges the covenant and alters the visionary’s freedom. Spatial-temporal anchors are present and no causality lapses. However, the precise sentence where “cost” is visible is abstract—“burden … lift” rather than concrete forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the memory is re-contained, the card re-weighted, and the orchard exhales—an Earned Stasis with felt cost. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each beat layers density until the final cadence shift. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each analogy thickens the pattern until the seed’s vibration and the boarding beat crystallize the quest. Closure is a Charged Poise—options reconfigured, cost felt in the seed’s weight and the continuum she joins. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tide recedes to reveal a new composite self. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each moon-phase plate adds density—yet the causal linkage between smelting and identity shift is implied more than driven.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: pearl-stasis crystallizes new mission beyond bunkers, with invisible crown as legible cost. Causal ‘because/therefore’ chain—discovery→confession absorption→light spread—holds under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the accordion’s harmony with the hidden river reconfigures Elena’s entire map of guilt and love. Causality under the Accumulative/Textural lens is clean – graffiti clues + personal knowledge → discovery of river → decision to drown consciously. Cost is unmistakable: “her tears joined the river now, natural elements flowing where they belonged.” No causality slips; timeline and space remain legible throughout the single underground scene.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the watch ticks forward normally, the library fades, and the seeker leaves with “another unspoken truth.” Cost is felt—the mystery is spent—yet the causality between cipher fragments and final access remains lightly sketched. Orientation is clear; the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes: the violin’s internal shattering → tiny ice flower lodged in desert root. Sequence tracks causal beats under Accumulative/Textural lens: micro-perforations widen from resonance → propagation → empire left with husk. Cost is felt in “fragile, resonant echo blooming in the velvet dark.”

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the vial joins the shelf, reconfiguring Elara’s endless vigil without solving her grief. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each memory strand tightens the pattern until the final hush. The Orientation Test is met by line 3; no lens ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara becomes the source of contentment, reweighting the quest. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each climb and sensory layer thickens until the final image crystallizes. Causality is coherent, though the midpoint betrayal flashback is more texture than pivot. Orientation is clear by 80 words; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elian returns the shard, feels the weight of hired consciences, and readies the “sincerely insincere” smile—cost is felt, lens is Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: Maya’s vanishing reconfigures identity layers while Elien pays a visible decade. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each ripple image deepens pattern until the final starlit grotto reweights the rule-set. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. One meaningful cadence shift suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each echo, stone, and bird pattern layers density until the arrowhead’s pulse reconfigures the premise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Kael’s disappearance and the arrowhead’s new role—though the cost is more conceptual than viscerally on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the keystone’s luminance reweights the premise, making standardized magic feel hollow. Causal chain holds—archive mention → mist walk → unstrap → keystone bloom—each step narrowing options until the final charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-scene causality holds: key discovery → lighthouse portal → library revelation → luminous vow. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the multicolored flames reconfigure meaning and foreclose anonymity. The Orientation Test is met by 120 words; no teleporting props. One causal gap: why the key fits a door that “hadn’t been before” is asserted, not seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    Clear causal lens: contraction forces the choice → static bursts filtered → coins decide → input coordinates triggers rebirth. Closure (fold inward to begin again) lands with conceptual cost—humanity may not recognize itself after rebirth—and the obsidian/coin spiral reframes earlier shots.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the reaper’s stance shifts from collector to giver-of-names, crystallized through scattered light. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of naming tightens the emotional cadence. Cost is implied but not viscerally felt, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: the bell’s silent-then-audible toll reconfigures the world and the mage’s self-worth; the Accumulative/Textural lens (pattern of dripping → rebuilding) holds. Orientation is immediate; no causal leaps mar the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Thomas commits to public truth-telling, foreclosing his quiet complicity; the causal chain (label → photograph → phone calls) is tight and legible under a Causal lens. No orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the transformed crystal levitates, then settles, marking the before/after of her quest. Causal chain (dream → starlings → crystal → flame) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; only minor slack in the “as if summoned” coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the urgent transmission reconfigures the watcher’s stance and the community’s fate with undeniable pressure. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density of anomalies and memory tighten the cadence toward the final act. One minor orientation wobble: “the ancient canopy” arrives before we know we’re airborne, but the effect serves the lyric disorientation and is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Causal lens (vivify via opposites) holds from premise to the charged poise of the glowing brain; every beat advances because/therefore linkages narrowing options as history rewrites itself. Closure lands viscerally: the rewired consciousness pulses to life at the crest of the temporal wave, making before/after of Maya’s numbness legible. Orientation flags clear who/where by line 4, but a brief infodump on Great Unraveling risks –0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mosaic-accumulative lens holds: image patterns (seed, brook, storm silence) tighten until the final crystallization of the new room idea grants Charged Poise. Closure image—“potential … waiting to unfurl”—delivers conceptual cost rather than concrete forfeiture, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the impossible giggle reweights the silence, leaving absence as sanctuary. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each modulation thickens the sonic tapestry until the pattern breaks with the giggle. Orientation is swift; causality is internal and emotional rather than external-event driven. Cost is felt in the final stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of light-bending, mist oscillations, and interiorized memories tighten until the boundary dissolves. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—guardian becomes “belonging everywhere and nowhere” with visible cost (translucence, abandonment of the garden). Causality holds: centuries of practice in interiorizing exteriors directly enables the final porous state. One minor drift: the cultist backstory is summarized rather than dramatized, but it does not rupture the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration: the crozier’s metamorphosis crystallizes Elias’s break with destiny under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is swift—twilight, ember nexus, broken relic—taught by sensory cues. The final image (“torch and compass for the unwritten future”) reweights the premise with conceptual cost: centuries of tradition dissolved.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the towers re-awaken and Elara carries new knowledge, with a conceptual cost (the city will sleep again). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of silence → resonance → hush again. Causality holds; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the merged ferry and filled hourglass crystallize a new state with conceptual cost—Liam’s wholeness traded for eternal transience. Causal chain holds under a lyrical-accumulative lens; however, the physics of “interconnected patterns” is asserted more than dramatized, softening the final beat’s punch.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias grasps that connection must be woven, not found—yet the shift from gallery to dreamscape occurs via convenient absorption rather than a motivated beat, blurring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the confirmation of edge geometry reconfigures the city’s future with visible conceptual cost—“the benthic city’s navigation systems would never be the same.” Causal chain is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each session of refracted observation tightens the pattern until external validation crystallizes meaning. Minor ellipsis between discovery and confirmation keeps momentum but trims struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: each beat follows “because/therefore” from the urgent pulse to the garden, the recognition, the call to security. Closure lands on-page with the photograph re-framed and the hearing aid calmed—Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. One minor ellipsis (how Elena links photo to predator) is motivated by prior emotional residue and does not break linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elara accepts perpetual service, foreclosing a normal life. The causal chain (tide window → Codex activation → guiding shadows) is coherent under a Causal lens. Orientation is immediate; transitions are smooth. The only drag is a mid-story exposition dump on Dr. Thorne that stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—“failure is transformation”—but the cost is abstract; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds via ink-pattern density, yet the final beat merely re-states rather than re-weights the premise with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure unit: the diamond hums an entire sentence, turning decades of pattern-translation into audible texture. The causal lattice holds—each step (reading birds → hand gesture → diamond pulse → echo amplification) links because/therefore. Time-span compression from youth to old age is legible in the 800-word window and deepens the cost (aging body, last speaker gone). No causal breaks or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Aris’s stance crystallizes into witness rather than captor, cost felt in the forfeiture of prior ambition. Causal links are implied rather than explicit (arrowhead warmth → acceptance), but the accumulative pattern of sightings and celestial alignment tightens stakes. One transition (surface desk) is cleanly handled; orientation is never lost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative lens: beats layer resonance (shell–bridge–orchard–bridge) until the final image reconfigures meaning—“a world balanced between precision and wonder” lands as earned Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost of permanent exile from orchard solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the bottled storm transferred, the next reunion mapped, the arc reweighted from smuggling weather to smuggling people. Causal lens holds: because Elias mapped drone gaps, therefore the hand-off succeeds; because the storm is delivered, therefore hope is re-cast. Cost is legible in the “lightness” of the bag and the rain now falling outside. Orientation and drive remain coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of silence → fragment → oasis → song tightens stakes by density and cadence shift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—song reweights silence from absence to generative possibility, halo fragment dissolving into wind bell as felt cost. Spatial logic bends, but the pattern is taught early and paid off. One causal hiccup: door “never existed before” is asserted, not seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the scarf dissolves into light, transferring its memories to Margaret, reconfiguring the library’s “emotional resonance.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of image and cadence shift carry the cost. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s stance toward the “runaway dream” crystallizes with felt cost when she grasps her sister’s transformation. Causal chain is thin (book appears ex nihilo), but accumulative pattern of sunrise captures holds.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the ribbon alone in Silas’s hand crystallizes the cost of the freed idea. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each rotation thickens atmosphere until the final image reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the fairy ring’s dimming and constellations’ realignment crystallize a before/after with felt cost. Causal lens holds: each star-chart comparison tightens options until the seventh alignment triggers the shimmer. One transition (dawn break) is clean and contiguous. No orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the archivist’s exile is reweighted from curse to purpose when Prisha stands her ground. Causal chain—demonstration → Prisha’s absorption → her stance—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the archivist’s genuine smile and the phrase “even if the Historians never welcome him back.”

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of wonder builds until the seed’s rainbow reconfigures meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with visible cost—“to save something precious, one must sometimes give pieces of oneself.” Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causality unfolds like a braid: each unravelled knot raises stakes because it tightens silence & releases another wail, culminating in the earned stasis where the spirits are ‘grounded’ under starlight. One continuous scene, no causal breaks, and the closure unit lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara reweights the torn map from barrier to threshold, with felt conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds (footage analysis → pattern → celestial alignment → map repair). Orientation is swift; the drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, signaled early by layered footage and tightening pattern density.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the plane vanishes from the globe, reweighting the premise from historical puzzle to metaphysical transition. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—patterned observation of the globe accumulates until the image flips. One minor ellipsis: how the globe’s change occurs is elided, but the effect is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of graffiti-message exchanges that deepen resonance. Closure is a Charged Poise—the ongoing “silent song” reconfigures meaning—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.9)
    Linear elevator ascent provides clean (though cosmetic) causality; encrypted-diary motive is signalled early but the decryption decision never confronts escalating obstacles, so the lens reads more Accumulative than Causal.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Intimate single-scene architecture holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each cloud perception is a texture shift that tightens stakes until the cirrus ‘conversation’ forces the decisive change. Orientation is anchored at once; closure pays conceptual repricing with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the final etching of patterns redefines portraiture itself. The causal chain—coin indentations → algorithmic key → soul mapping—is tight across the tree’s last night. Each compression holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens, ending in charged poise as dawn breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: Eli’s deciphering reconfigures the sky’s map and his own future. The causal chain (hopscotch → cipher → light → discovery) holds, and the final image crystallizes new possibility with visible stakes. Minor slack: the “next great discovery” refrain edges toward thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure arrives clear and charged: the broken heart pulses, the library thaws, and Elias’s alignment with the ancestral rhythm feels inevitable yet weighty under the lunar eclipse’s surreal gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the community’s stance crystallizes around the watering bell, and the final spring-solstice message reweights the premise. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; however, the ghost’s chalked guidance is accepted too smoothly, muting felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    Chosen lens: Accumulative/Textural – nested lullaby-weaves intensify pattern until spindle’s low hum reweights entropy. Closure satisfies CR: the universe’s rule-set repriced by the lullaby’s sub-audible ripple, spindle accepted, cost paid in Elias’s drained stillness. Causality remains coherent under poetic ellipsis; each micro-repetition thickens rather than stalls. Slight Orientation waiver for late reveal of “threads of fractured starlight” but payoff absorbs earlier hush.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: mother’s promise → reluctant tending → discovery of nut/blueprint → assembly → rescue → dawn acceptance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias’s stance toward the orchard flips with felt cost (spent nut, spent night). One minor causality wobble: the blueprint’s origin is never grounded, but it doesn’t break the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the braided ravine image reconfigures meaning (CR) by equating molecular and relational bonds, and the cost—admitting neglect—is on-page. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; however, the single-scene default is met, transitions are smooth, and orientation is anchored early.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the door’s creation reweights the premise that stories start in absence, with parole’s nightly cost still looming. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of moonlight bottles and memory shards tightens toward the crystallized final image. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks. The persistent constraint (parole renewal) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael emerges lighter, the pavilion’s hum still echoing, so a before/after is legible. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—tidal-pool pattern → descent → refinement—but the cost is only implied (“hands trembling”), not felt in a single charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as a soft Charged Poise: the tower “beats with renewed purpose,” but the cost is only asserted, not dramatized. Causal chain is present—weight → talks → bridge project—but the pivotal beat (Elena’s decision to launch the talks) is summarized, not shown. Lens is Causal, yet the final tightening is more rhetorical than structural.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands hard: a broken shard reconfigures from limitation to lens, turning abandoned dreams into an archaeological map that reweights both identity and mission with visible conceptual cost while holding to an accumulative-textural drive throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: Elara re-enters the mundane world carrying renewed vigilance, the cost felt in the warm doodle and settling responsibility. Causal chain holds—gravity inversion triggers grotto access, threshold effects enable passage, final combination awakens seeds—though a few teleporting beats (“she stepped back through the threshold effects”) compress the exit.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of sensory cracks increases until the final moment reconfigures meaning. Closure arrives as a Charged Poise—the grove now “resonated with echoes of long-lost song.” Cost is felt on-page (“tears traced paths”) and the porcelain insulator’s earlier seed reappears, transmitting new purpose. No orientation debt; who/where/why anchors by the end of paragraph #3. A single, intensifying pulse satisfies the low-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the nexus reclaims Elias not as prisoner but student, cost visible in the swirl that claims him. Causal chain holds—covenant breach → exile → pattern translation → recognition—though the “partnership not penance” insight arrives in a single expository line rather than through a decisive on-page beat.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each added frequency layer thickens atmosphere until the clasp’s click becomes inevitable. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—diary’s contents reframe her life’s work—yet the felt cost is more conceptual than bodily. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the seed’s revelation reconfigures Elara’s purpose and the village’s future. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned scent-doodles accumulate until the final image reweights them. Cost is felt in the shift from private obsession to communal responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causality is sound: inversion clock → water-navigate → echo-vision → seed-fragment reveal. Closure is an earned Resonant Reconfiguration; Verdantis’s future is recalibrated through gained knowledge. Arrow tip as seed-motif is cleanly seeded and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.7)
    Closure is a restatement of intent (“Tomorrow would bring more measurements”) rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet the final cadence merely reiterates earlier stakes without reweighting them. No felt cost crystallizes; the story ends on open continuation, not earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.1)
    Causality holds under Accumulative lens: the aurora pattern steer/ bloom-into-white climax reweights meaning, the sculpted hush a Resonant Reconfiguration that forges “silence as presence.” Cost is palpable—held breath crystallizes before the final peal, homestead lost to wonder-as-essential. Timeline and POV remain rock-steady.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the flute feels “lighter, yet immeasurably more precious,” a Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each driftwood placement and note deepens pattern until the final silence. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance crystallizes—she will keep quantifying emotion—and Thomas’s flight confirms the cost to others. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of star-loss and data-gathering tightens into the final image of “one more star vanished,” reweighting the premise with conceptual cost. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the pendant’s hand-off to the elder crystallizes Ayla’s renunciation of courier identity under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The final image—“ground trembled…remembered”—reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Orientation is anchored early; transitions are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene structure holds; the causal chain (prism + frost → memory flood → reframed quest) is legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor’s “silence filled with possibility” crystallizes new stakes, though the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early via the vanishing sounds motif and held through the pattern of sacrifices. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the world’s sound returns with conceptual cost—the bead’s extinction and Elara’s irretrievable memories. The puzzle-path mechanics are legible, and the final image reweights the premise without exposition. Minor ellipsis in the “three days” transition is acceptable under the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of azure-lit arches reweights the premise—repair as defiance—while the cost (irrevocable trade of self) is legible in “echo of his determination.” Causal lens holds: each repair tightens the village’s dependence and his irrevocable stance. One transition (mine → village) is clean and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the map maker wakes with spent shard and renewed determination, reconfiguring options with felt cost. However, the lens wavers between Accumulative/Textural and Situational; the cyclical jumps lack a taught pattern, so the final beat reads more as pause than decisive change. Orientation is clear early, but causality between jumps is asserted rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s deliberate stone-stack and letter seal a new belonging. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each artifact (glass, letters, stones) layers meaning until the final image reweights his solitude. Cost is palpable in the vial of seawater he pockets.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance crystallizes—“Tonight we guide them home”—with the felt cost of perpetual vigilance. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: nightly ritual, manuscript echoes, and beam choreography layer until the final sweep reweights the stake. Orientation is swift; causality holds. Minor ellipsis (how comet prophecy alters tactics) keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of light-tracking and dye trials builds to a conceptual repricing—stories magnetize via iridescent perspective. Closure lands on-page with cost: Kaelen renounces broadcasting his discovery, instead modulating stories to each listener’s heartbeat. Orientation is swift; the floating rock tea house anchors by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    The closure (Samuel’s stance crystallizes into stewardship of quiet endurance) lands on the page with unambiguous Conceptual Repricing: what he thought was burden becomes testament. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each dream fragment and moon drop adds density until resonance reweights meaning. No causal gap mars the final image; cost is legible as he resigns the sextant from being mere tool to being witness-key.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the woven dawn spreads and the keeper rests, cost signaled by spent personal memories. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of light intensifies until it reweights the world—yet causality between song and realm-revival is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Eleanor’s refusal to attend crystallizes with the note-passing beat, cost legible in the society member’s “surprised” nod and her own solitude. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of nested paradoxes tightens to a single charged image. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. One minor ellipsis (how the member finds her) is tolerated.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of slow decay → guerrilla life → revelation → renunciation. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Eliza leaves the bread; the cost is the irreversibility of her own past silence. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s discovery that some vows can still be reinforced crystallizes his stance and reweights the premise. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of hope increases through pattern of fading/renewal—yet the felt cost is soft, more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single-scene causality holds: each rumor narrows Malachi’s options until the forged note triggers the decisive fracture. Closure lands on-page as Eliza captures the silence and exits before gunfire—earned stasis with cost. Orientation is anchored early; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    Drive lens is Situational under coherent natural/atmospheric pressure that crystallizes one decisive choice: the tactile convergence with the storm man under auroral vote. Closure in the dissolution ring image bears unmistakable cost—eternal symbiosis with no exit shown.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cave’s silence becomes the auroral sorrow of creation reclaimed, the portrait now “mirror and window.” Causal chain holds—key → cave → canvas → repaint—each step narrowing options until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the charcoal-darkened fingers and the irreversible shift from haunted to homecoming.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map + plate become a “key and lock” that reconfigure her path with the cost of abandoning tolerated falsehoods. Causal chain is intact—artifact discovery → map assembly → insight → decision—though the leap from insight to dawn departure is slightly telescoped.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spectrum pulse at her death crystallizes the community’s new language and immortalizes wonder. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each tuning session layers density until the final cadence shift. The Orientation Test is met early; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Holds situational lens: magnetic-shield pressure coheres around the dome collapse, then narrows to a single Renunciation (original body inert) that reweights options with clear cost—garden preserved, self splintered forever. The opening orientation (glass dome shimmer, twilight) is taught within first 10% so passes Orientation Test.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the locket and letters reconfigure communal memory. Causal chain holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens, though the mailbox reveal feels slightly convenient rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure lands cleanly: Elara’s dance sequence triggers the lab’s awakening, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the dice from fate to generator. Causal linkage is tight, yet the cost—her childhood dream language—feels asserted rather than earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: Elara re-buries the crystal and chooses to become “memory keeper,” a stance that reconfigures her future with visible cost (she cannot extract the memories, only visit). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each salt-crystal image, gravity pocket, and lantern light layers density until the final image crystallizes meaning. Orientation is clean by line 5; no causality breaks. The whale’s death is the inciting accumulation, not a causal turn, which fits the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the prophecy is absorbed and the crane released, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the world from threat to peace. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each beat thickens the hush until the final cadence shift. Orientation is swift; no temporal or spatial drift. The only gap is the missing on-page cost—no visible exhaustion or forfeiture after the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the seal’s transfer crystallizes Clara’s new fluency and shared lineage with visible cost (“carried not just an artifact, but the beginnings of fluency”). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of weekly teas and rooftop meteor shower deepens stakes until final reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each pulse of crystal light layers density until the dawn reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara illuminated with purpose—cost felt in the shell’s silence and her new burden. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    The closure—Elias writing a confession and the key dissolving into aurora—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (blood-sealed parchment). Causal linkage is clean: the key’s arrival triggers retrieval of the decree, which enables the redemptive act. One minor ellipsis: the key’s origin is unexplained, but it complicates rather than resolves, so lens integrity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of disclosure beats tighten toward the luminous release. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—balance restored via song—yet the cost (loss of the singer’s lifelong melancholy) is stated more than dramatized on the body.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the captain’s whispered thanks crystallizes the Resonant Reconfiguration, and the snow globe’s new glow marks the Decisive Change. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each shard of dream evidence tightens the pattern—though the mid-story jump from dive to shrine is only loosely bridged.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: nightly pilgrimage layers pattern upon pattern until the final tea-whisk foam reweights the premise. Closure is a Charged Poise—appreciation as stance crystallized—but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, capping the band just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Maya’s pivot from debunker to keeper crystallizes in the charged image of the pulsing diamond. Causal chain holds under a Causal lens, though the liquidation backstory is delivered in a single expository block rather than threaded through beats.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: storm patterns and radio fragments layer until the final image reweights meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elias’s recognition that the prophet below now carries the charge he once held alone. The cost is conceptual (obsolescence of his role) and felt on the page in the final “smile at the fragmented radio frequencies.”

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the poet’s retreat to the corner crystallizes his new stance—translator rather than vagrant—and the cost is the surrender of his private archive. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each sensory beat layers toward the communal chorus.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens is coherent: because the key stirs and intruders arrive, therefore Elias races, descends, performs ritual, earning a new silence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—he ascends “forever changed”—with visible consequence (stolen future autonomy). No orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.7)
    Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration—dawn confirms the mapper’s theory and signals the start of the revolution—but the cost is conceptual, not felt. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern holds, yet the tightening is gentle rather than decisive. Orientation is clear early.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single-scene causal arc: missing worker → lantern discovery → note revelation → decision to expose corruption. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost (“might jeopardize her career”). Orientation anchored by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the priest chooses not to repair the heart, foreclosing the path of personal absolution and accepting the cost of ongoing guilt. Causal chain (Grant’s gift → letter → house purchase → silence of heart) holds. One transition (street → shop) is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the unheard bell’s vibration reweights the glider’s entire quest. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each shard (arrow, kaleidoscope, bell) layers density until the final image crystallizes meaning. The acid sea’s pause supplies visible cost. Minor drift: the “evolution” summary could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands: Elara’s theft of the files reopens the case and forecloses her safety. Causal chain (numbers → breach → evidence) holds, but the 90-second countdown is resolved off-stage, softening the decisive change’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lens chosen: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean by word 30 (“gnarled apple trees…lighthouse orchard”); the weighted breath is named early and threads through to closure. Closure is Earned-Charged Stasis: she holds the reconstituted crystal between her fingers, the reconfiguration of “mapping empathy onto action” legible but the actual on-page price (political fallout, bodily aftermath) is inferred rather than dramatized, clipping the final cost proof. Minor teleport: we never see her physically leave the orchard for the vintage shop, only a collage of mirror memories introduced at 78%, late by the mid-point clarity rule.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the drift-ice, parasol, and wind accumulate meaning until the final image crystallizes a stance—Elena’s renunciation of suicide. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost: she forfeits the planned ending. Orientation is clear by line 4; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sentinel’s redefined purpose crystallizes under the harvest moon with felt loneliness as price. Causality is associative (Accumulative/Textural lens), patterning reflections on mismatches and vines; the lens holds, but the tightening beat is diffuse rather than sharply decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the consecrated clearing persists with felt cost (“continuity with the past meant isolation in the present”). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of whispers, sand, and parapet resonance tightens to final image—yet causality between prophet’s arrival and walker’s urgency is more asserted than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the circle forms, pain is transmuted into shared understanding. Causality is accumulative/textural—pattern builds until the final image reweights meaning. No orientation debt; time and place remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of pattern (“fractured sequences,” “testify”) tightens toward the resonant reconfiguration when the crystal’s tone reframes his mission. Closure lands with conceptual cost—he becomes the living dictionary—though the beat is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens sustained; each driftwood marker gathers and then releases a future-memory into fog, tightening stakes through density. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the hum is located but will be forgotten, achieving Earned Stasis with audible cost captured on the page (“soft, patient, and profound”).

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spinning hand slows into measured harmony, reweighting the premise from malfunction to attunement. The lens is Accumulative/Textural—patterned escalation of sensory detail and cadence shift. Causality holds: each adjustment to the filters is shown, and the cost (transcending human perception) is felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the final image of the son holding the shard while music continues reconfigures grief into continuity (Charged Poise). Causal chain is thin—music therapy doesn’t materially alter outcome—but the accumulative pattern of scent, sound, and shard holds. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the completed loop opens a dimensional bridge, reconfiguring Elara’s quest from “find shadows” to “follow them.” Causal chain holds—each rune connection tightens options—though the spoon-bending backstory is exposited rather than dramatized, softening the inciting rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden’s dissolution and Arthur’s “My bones need setting” crystallize a new, shared reality with felt cost—Eleanor’s worldview forever altered. Causal chain holds: tooth → circle → vibration → figure → mutual recognition. No teleporting props; every object’s state is tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Structure forms an accumulative/textural arc: nightly polishing intensifies pattern density until the final grotto display crystallizes meaning. Causality flows cleanly; memory resurfacing is cued by glass starlight and paid off in decisive communal sharing.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: spiral pattern, moss growth, and pendant return build density toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands with felt cost—the release of guilt onto the moss-covered keyboard—though causality between spiral and final act is more associative than driven.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a quiet Charged Poise: the seashell placed on the page crystallizes meaning. Yet the drive lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught late; pattern of mist/motif repetition is not anchored early enough to guide reader. Causality between reflection and final gesture remains implied rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the village’s collective memory is restored under the harvest moon, with the vine-powered device as the pivot. Causal chain is clear—vision → research → ritual—though the three-night ellipsis is compressed off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the golden glow reweights the orchard and the world’s stance toward darkness. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each heartbeat and pattern layer intensifies density until the final cadence shift. Cost is felt in the trembling reverence before ignition.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the timer’s awakening reweights the entire cavern into a living archive. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each reflection pattern tightens the density until the final thrumming beat crystallizes the cost of endless custodianship.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each burden calcifies in a rising cadence that reweights the weaver’s stance. Closure lands as Charged Poise—boundary-lessly trapped redefined as boundary-lessly connected—cost felt in the extinguished lamp and the unending return.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of rain, kettle whistle, and wood shavings accrues until the final image reweights absence as presence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise in the crystallized moment “while the kettle boiled, she had captured eternity.” Cost is legible in the half-finished carving and the empty whistle. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the carousel’s restart re-orders time and merges ghost with self under a Charged Poise of liquid peace. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—fragments accrete into a bridge, then into healing light—though the camera wheel’s sudden power is taught late, not early. Cost is palpable: the wheel, and thus the past, is gone.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal lens holds: because Maya stays behind, therefore she finds the sextant; because she reroutes power, therefore the terminal revives. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost—the resurrected lights are partial, fragile. Orientation is clear by ~100 words; no teleporting props. Minor ellipsis in technical steps is acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (mist, petrichor, crystal hum) thickens until the final sunrise reweights the premise. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elias’s lighter steps and turning gears—whose cost is the irreversible passage of time he now chooses to inhabit.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a quiet Conceptual Repricing: the sundial’s metaphorical reweighting reconfigures her mission. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of image and cadence shift carry the turn—but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the rope reconfigures the collector’s path with felt, if quiet, cost. Causal chain is intact—fulgurite triggers recognition, knots yield knowledge—but the lens tilts Accumulative/Textural rather than strictly Causal.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the traveler crystallizes a new stance—writing for the living who still have life—while the crimson thread reweights from anchor to compass. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each sensory saturation and memory shard tightens the emotional cadence toward the final shift. Cost is legible in the line "something beautiful and painful was beginning to heal."

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—beauty cannot be assembled—yet the lens tilts late from causal to accumulative; the palace’s reversion is legible but the cost is more conceptual than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is tight: volcanic sand coin → memory → garden graft → defensive fire-blanket → earned stance at lagoon. Closure (Charged Poise) reweights her legacy under Hybrid lens. No orientation lapses.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the box dissolves, fountains awaken, and Elara becomes Keeper—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; breadcrumbs → star-map → window → release tightens once with visible city-wide payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the civilization receives light without fire, reconfiguring the sentimentalist’s eternal pattern. Causality is accumulative/textural—each sonar ping and gear rotation layers density until the final illumination. Orientation is clear by line 3; the nebula garden and transit mechanics are legible. Cost is conceptual (another cycle of hope) rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the monument reframes grief from individual to collective, with the ribbon’s depletion as visible cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensification via butterflies, poems, ribbon knots—held cleanly to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene arc under causal lens: stalled pendulum → rake inscription → summons townsfolk → collective repair. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—shared stewardship crystallizes in the first bell. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. Cost is legible in Alaric’s cracked voice and relinquished sole authority.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sacrificial love reweights Elias’s understanding, and the velvet gloom becomes protective. Causal chain holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each decoded thread thickens the pattern until the final hum—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt in his immediate life.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the map is finished, stakes crystallize, and the lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of detail reweights the future. Orientation is clear by line 3; causality holds, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of dust “whispering” reconfigures meaning, but causality is loose—how dust retains and transmits is asserted, not shown. Orientation is clear by 120 words. One transition (apartment → alcove) handled cleanly. Persistent constraint (risk of capture) is named but not leveraged in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.1)
    The accumulative/textural lens holds: the cessation of the rocking chair triggers a charged poise that reconfigures meaning without needing a causal chain. The cost is visible—"no safety to be found in completion, only in the continuous process"—foreclosing the lifelong quest the gallery enabled. Orientation is clear within the first 100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the decision to preserve knowledge reweights the premise with felt cost. Causality is intact, though the lens (Accumulative/Textural) is taught late; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    Closure is a gentle Conceptual Repricing—passing the rosette as legacy—but the cost is abstract, not felt. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; seasonal montage replaces causal linkage. Orientation is clear, yet the story reads like an elegiac précis rather than a scene with tightening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the planted seed reconfigures Elias’s future options and the city’s unwitting fate. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory memory layer tightens the stake—though the celestial alignment functions more as atmospheric echo than causal trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain holds: blackout → honesty → keycard → confrontation → restoration. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the tower restarts, but Elara’s candor remains an irreversible price. One smooth transition up the staircase keeps scope tight.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each placed object layers density until the cottage tableau reweights the premise. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Aria’s stance crystallizes with conceptual cost (“path forward was clear”)—but the cost is felt more than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the diver’s stance crystallizes with visible cost—returning “not with answers, but with better questions.” Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each revelation layer deepens stakes until the final image reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a decisive rupture with visible cost: the staircase shatters and Elias re-enters the casino with “wisdom of eternity in his eyes.” Causal chain holds: perpetual-motion proofs → locate flaw → die as catalyst → rupture → second chance. One micro-turn (hesitation → action) is cleanly executed.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a lyrical Resonant Reconfiguration: the finished mural crystallizes her stance and reweights the premise with felt cost—the night of lost sleep and the wager that a stranger will someday answer. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stroke layers density until the dawn image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks. A hairline slip: the “tomorrow night” coda slightly dilutes the earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the emerald lens reweights the starter’s dormant life, the thaw audibly cracks, and Khira’s song crystallizes a new stance. Causal chain (lens → dough → warmth → thaw) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is the lingering dread that threads the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands cleanly: the yoyo clicks and reconfigures “the very fabric of possibility” under Causal lens—because Esme reverses spin, therefore the world rewires itself with an on-page cost felt in the tide “returning” as the new order dawns. All beats advance by “because” chains; no orientation drift or prop resets.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the photographically cursed image flips to radiance, reweighting death from loss to invitation. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each paradox read tightens the pattern until the funhouse dissolves. Cost is legible in the crumbling set and the dissolved clasp.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the storm’s diversion mirrors her musical map, reweighting the orchard’s safety. Causality is soft—music as weather-control remains metaphorical—so the decisive change feels conceptual rather than mechanical. Orientation is clear by 3rd sentence. One transition (dusk→dawn) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (tracing → whistle → crack → chamber → reversal) links by “therefore” logic. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael’s stance flips from escape to stewardship—charged by the whistle’s final note. The cost is implied rather than dramatized, keeping it just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (letter → station → ledger) tightens options under the “recapture truth” drive; closure lands with the tangible cost of exposing corporate guilt, satisfying the Decisive Change test.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-scene causal arc: discovery → retrieval → inscription → renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis (he recommits to the work), but the cost is more conceptual than visceral; transitions are legible, no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    The closure qualifies as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s decision to become “a bridge between past and present” crystallizes new identity options and carries unmistakable social-cost (ancestral lineage exposed, old methodology renounced). Causal linkage is clear—stamp → sigil match → hypothesis → map fragments → identity rewrite. No orientation debt; blackout duration and spatial anchors remain crisp. One residual looseness: the final beat of “everyone tracing their own honest origins” is gestural rather than dramatized, preventing a higher-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV scene with one transition (workshop→basilica) cleanly anchored. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: lantern ascends, part of self detaches—felt cost in tears and grounded presence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of polishing, folding, releasing intensifies to final cadence shift. One brief reflection block respects BRR and tilts present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant lens is causal; each leg of the descent follows “coordinates calculated” therefore “pod descends” therefore “crystal absorbs.” Closure is Charged Poise crystallizing future purpose—clear on page. The shift from survivor to “harvester” lands as reconfiguration with future cost hinted, satisfying the drive. One circuit-breaker constraint recurs without loophole.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: every beat is a because/therefore linkage leading to the pull climax where missing pieces literalise the frequency of belonging. Closure lands on-page with unmistakable reverberating cost as stasis crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: placing watch and carving together in the sand crystallizes the cost of decades of lies. Causal lens holds—each beat flows “because/therefore” from the discovery of the carving to the decision to close the business. No orientation drift; anchors are clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the apology/forgiveness exchange reweights the shared past and forecloses further vengeance. Causal linkage holds under a Situational lens—pressure crystallizes stance. Cost is legible in Rennett’s softened posture and Lyra’s relinquishing of the keepsake.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.7)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: regret-dense images build toward a crystallizing final scene where the compass turns from albatross to talisman; closure is Charged Poise with legible cost (abandoned stardom, acceptance of utility-pole navigation). One minor ellipsis: her father’s maxim enters retrospectively without earlier cue.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal loop lands cleanly—signing the ball completes the circuit and re-weights the premise—but the newspaper cluework is off-stage; the coordinates arrive pre-decoded, so the protagonist’s agency feels managed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Eliora’s stance crystallizes—“transformed yet fundamentally unchanged”—with the felt cost of accepting impermanence. Causal chain holds: fortune → spices → metamorphosis → bridge → fading connection. No orientation debt; moonlight and orchard anchor early. One transition (moonrise to dawn) is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the cracked saucer reframes time as presence, not recovery. Causal chain is thin—ritual mechanics are asserted more than dramatized—but the final image reweights the premise with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the final stitch opens the locked dimension with undeniable conceptual cost—the dissolution of the ship and Eli’s bodily departure. Causal chain holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each meditation session and tear-tracked photograph tightens the pattern until the cadence shift in the last paragraph reweights all prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: blackout → coded sundial completion → dawn rendezvous signaled, a Resonant Reconfiguration under Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality holds: blackout was anticipated, sundial message is the payoff. Cost is conceptual—risk of discovery—but felt only lightly; still, the lens is coherent and the ending reweights prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the star-dust sphere crystallizes a new stance (“its power now integrated with her consciousness”). Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and cadence shift reweight the stake. Orientation is immediate; no lens ambiguity. Cost is legible in the line “though she remained precognitively cursed, the visions no longer tormented her.”

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density and cadence shift reweight the stake. Closure arrives as Charged Poise: the poet stands above the clouds, verses in hand, the storm’s wonder reconfiguring the meaning of her silence. Orientation is immediate; causality is lyric rather than stepwise, fitting the lens. The cost is conceptual—she must return below—but the reader feels the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sundial’s coordinates crystallize a new destination, and the cost is the foreclosed certainty of the symposium’s safety. Causal chain holds—each rotation of the card tightens the pattern—though the lens tilts Accumulative/Textural rather than pure Causal.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the final image of the poet scattering seeds under starlight crystallizes the ongoing resistance with felt conceptual cost—beauty must be rebuilt nightly. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of rebuilding and molting tightens through density rather than causal turns. Orientation is established early; no teleporting props or timeline breaks. One minor drift: “luminous fracture” is repeated without reweighting until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the pianist vanishes into a liminal space with visible cost—he must leave the station and audience behind. Causal chain holds: broken clock ticks backward → research → modified projector → disappearance. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props. One transition (descent to archive) is clean and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    A single causal spine holds: dream interpretation → ridge descent → waterfall cave → stone circle → song → awakened memory; a visible cost appears in “luminous doubt” reconfiguring what Elara must now carry, satisfying closure under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the glowing needle reconfigures meaning and forecloses the old stasis. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; the lace pattern’s late reveal slightly strains causality but is paid off in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands via the butterfly emergence crystallizing Elena’s "true calling," but the cost of abandoning academia remains abstract—no concrete sacrifice is dramatized beyond vague mentions of "needless drama," weakening felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("rectified the world's loss of sound"), but no persistent constraint (e.g., tuning fork limitations) shapes tactics to meet 9+ gate; orientation perfect within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with "chased stillness" crystallizing his endurance, but the cryptic coordinates' origin breaks causality (convenient discovery without setup), slightly muddying escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change when Elias declares expanded food runs, with "they will need more support than we can provide alone" crystallizing the conceptual cost of collective risk. The Causal lens holds tightly, though the escalation’s pressure could be more viscerally embodied in the declaration beat.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the tear dissolving into her skin crystallizes the cost of releasing unused love. Orientation fails—no clear "when" established by 120 words—triggering -0.4; otherwise the Accumulative/Textural lens (density of breath/fog imagery) would have scored 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise (merging with garden) with conceptual cost, but the disintegration climax lacks escalation payoff—the pressure buildup doesn't fully earn the final sacrifice. Accumulative lens holds cleanly through temporal density.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost: vault destroyed but saved seeds enable renewal, crystallized in children’s laughter amid green shoots. Causal lens holds tightly—arrow guides decoding, which triggers crew arrival, forcing urgent escape. Orientation clear by 80 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with undeniable cost in the sound's transformation. Cancer reveal disrupts accumulative lens coherence mid-escalation; "recent reminder" lacks causal linkage to present choices despite strong final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "she realized her destiny wasn't to steal light but to preserve it" reweights her identity. Accumulative lens holds as pattern revelation (portraits + moonbeams) crystallizes meaning without causal mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise ("Thus, we thaw") crystallizes options with felt cost via melting ice and abandoned grief, but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural) isn't named until midpoint, blocking 8.8+ eligibility per high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with felt cost ("relinquish iron control"), but backstory reflection violates BRR limits with two blocks (mentor reveal + identity shift) exceeding 20% without altering present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with cost (her realization forecloses prevention path), but textural accumulation lacks causal escalation; one distinct issue (recurring darkness imagery without deepening pressure) triggers -0.8 cap. Anchors established by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable conceptual cost (surrendering logic for unity), and the Accumulative/Textural lens—density of sensory/temporal pressure—is held rigorously from midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis with conceptual cost (relinquishing power for trust), validated by peaceful murmurs at dawn. Weakness: hidden chamber discovery leans coincidental, slightly undermining agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative lens holds: scientists' visit deepens pressure without causal escalation, crystallizing Charged Poise closure where "strength waning" legibly charges the final image of marbles as silent witnesses.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with bird's gaze crystallizing stakes, but "subdued awakening of purpose" phrasing abstracts the cost; Accumulative lens holds consistently through temporal density buildup despite minor orientation debt in twilight mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (transformed hush with conceptual cost), fulfilling the accumulative/textural lens. Pressure builds through sensory density but lacks meaningful deepening—Elias's realization about the ghost's code doesn't alter tactics. Orientation is flawless, yet escalation feels passive rather than driven by agency.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: auroras amplify "sorrow he now carries as both burden and purpose." Accumulative lens holds perfectly—patterned margin work tightens options to one crystallized path with felt weight. No flaws touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Marcus's realization that truths "carry weight precisely because unspoken" reconfigures meaning with felt cost ("weight of his own swallowed truths acknowledged"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds throughout, though escalation lacks visceral tightening beyond sensory accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: the keeper's return to the river's change while bearing the silence's secret crystallizes the cost of witnessing (healed yet unchanged), but the "frayed edges" metaphor slightly obscures tangible cost at the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with visible cost ("fragile but real, like a newly opened flower"), yet eclipse resolution leans slightly on coincidence rather than Maya's causal agency narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure succeeds as Earned Stasis: historian's smile crystallizes acceptance of their role with conceptual cost (permanent dream-loss). But escalation lacks meaningful pressure—discoveries accumulate without narrowing options or raising stakes, violating Accumulative/Textural lens requirements for density increase.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: sunrise anticipation crystallizes pressure with conceptual cost (unseen impact on minds). Accumulative lens holds perfectly—density builds through layered revelations about microdots and prophecies without causal breaks. Orientation nailed by word 30.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Sarah's gasping recovery and fading symbols reconfigure the "unraveled stillness" with visible cost (priest's exhaustion), perfectly executing the Accumulative/Textural lens through sonic architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with strong Charged Poise closure ("time folded in on itself") and legible cost in collapse. Non-closure Accumulation Cap applied for one distinct issue: exhaustion motivation insufficiently earned through prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (accepting complexity), but the precise cost moment ("gripped the tablet") lacks visceral legibility under Causal lens. Lens holds consistently from eclipse setup.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stakes through the backward-spinning record’s "symphony of silence"; cost legible in "life without volume, but full of meaning" though drum maker’s conversion slightly softens tension.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds cleanly; pigeon discovery creates irreversible knowledge shift. Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost (pigeon’s return journey = hope/risk), though the courtyard’s transformation from refuge to launchpad slightly over-explains the stakes shift.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with undeniable cost ("irrevocably revealed") under Accumulative lens. Starlight intensifying as "universe leaned in" crystallizes pressure without causal breaks. Orientation anchored by 67 words.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "silence not absence" realization forecloses despair with visible cost (mother's tears, listing shipwrecks). Orientation solid by paragraph 1; Accumulative lens holds through density increase in final playing scene.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "knowledge that sometimes profound truths could be found in carefully crafted half truths" reconfigures the premise. Accumulative lens holds, but transformation mechanics slightly abstract; static electricity sensing provides tangible pressure for one tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly: envelope mistake initiates patterned recurrence culminating in Charged Poise closure. Cost is undeniable as Elias places the new locket—"To those who preserve what others forget"—charging the final starlit library image with conceptual weight. Orientation anchors by line 3 ("breeze-swept library," "symphony drifted away") with disorientation serving closure's cyclical theme.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands flawlessly: the sigil etching crystallizes options with conceptual cost ("luminescent ache" transforming to "radiant home"). Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout, with density increasing via sensory details until the final image reweights the crater's meaning under unbroken pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands with visible cost (collapsed illustrator, shortened future) under causal lens. Minor flaw: giant's awakening escalation feels slightly convenient rather than earned through protagonist's prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (hope's danger made visceral when mentor's vision appears), but cost proof lacks exact on-page sentence showing paid consequence beyond internal containment.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly under Accumulative lens—releasing control forecloses her old path with visible cost (destruction/growth)—but the "weeks passed" summary risks momentum loss despite anchoring in present via data collection.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise: Lena's insomnia fading as purpose clarifies ("hands steady as they mixed") reconfigures her stance with conceptual cost (relinquishing the brooch's "ghostly warmth"). However, the old woman's sudden appearance feels coincidental rather than earned by Lena's agency, weakening escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with conceptual cost ("gone from seer to participant") under Accumulative lens; pilgrim's convenient disappearance is the sole hairline slip in otherwise flawless pressure accumulation toward reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost in "home, at last, was not just a place," but minor causality gap: visions arrive "precisely when needed" without Elina's active pursuit narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("gently bring to light, one mapped path at a time"), but "hour that divides..." repetition creates scaffold loops that dull the final image's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure achieves valid Charged Poise ("Elara understood her role as both keeper and participant...") with conceptual cost in lifelong stewardship. Orientation anchors by word 5 ("Elara stood at the edge..."), and Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through tile transcriptions building to crystallized final image. Minor flaw: decision to invite others lacks on-page causality.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: "goodbye was merely a transition" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout—pressure builds via sensory density ("hushed thunder of the mutiny") rather than causal turns, fitting the scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "breach trust of employer" crystallizes stakes. Causal chain holds perfectly through guard observation to stamping, but cost remains slightly abstract versus visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: sealing the notepad with gold leaf crystallizes options (preservation vs oblivion) with undeniable cost in "a world that had forgotten how precious they were." Accumulative lens holds through refracted hum's spectrum reweighting temporal stakes.

    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully in "I press on through the labyrinth," crystallizing refusal with felt cost of perpetual limbo. Orientation anchors by line 3; Accumulative lens holds through tidal rhythm, though escalation lacks one decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: "uncertainty itself was the point" reweights the universal riddle with felt cost (transformed identity), held under Accumulative lens through sensory/musical density; storm-to-dawn cadence shift crystallizes stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: the returned foundation stone chip crystallizes Maya's renunciation of individual guidance for collective power. Causal lens holds cleanly through graffiti's encoded counterproposals, though corporate resolution leans slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: dissolving sand grain and vanished fireflies crystallize the cost of preservation. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dawning light's progression tightens pressure relentlessly toward the vanishing point with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (connection across distance) under Accumulative lens. Minor flaw: phone confirmation feels coincidental rather than earned pressure. Final image reconfigures "sighted perception" with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: condensation reforming with "definitive source" crystallizes science/myth convergence with felt cost of isolation ("few would believe him"). Falcon convenience slightly undermines causality but doesn't break accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: "shared balance returning" crystallizes the Accumulative lens with conceptual cost (banished collapse), though the threat's immediacy weakens the felt price; orientation anchors (archway/dusk) established within 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost ("burning lungs," "crushing finality") under Accumulative lens. Final image crystallizes transformed understanding of time with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure (finding voice to whisper truth) lands as Charged Poise under Accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual—no visible price paid for "threading the labyrinth" despite "bodies" urgency, failing cost proof test at ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: "bead began to crumble as she slowly dissipated" crystallizes debt repayment. Accumulative lens holds through density increase (resonant awakenings → seed release), taught by "pulsed with bioluminescent life" early. Orientation clear within 40 words; lens inferred by midpoint via "ephemeral cameo appearances" pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost (art transforming heritage), but lens ambiguity persists—Accumulative/Textural vs. Situational—undermining escalation. Cost proof fails: orchid growth lacks felt sacrifice, with villagers' discovery resolving tension too neatly.

    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully: "her purpose had found its way home" crystallizes her arc with visible cost (initial despair transformed into communal rebirth), under a coherent Causal lens where every action—from fragment discovery to exhibition—drives tangible change.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with "frozen music" realization, but cost of dissolved certainty remains abstract—no on-page struggle or tangible consequence makes the price legible despite thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("pure, untaxed thought" amid imminent raid), driven by Accumulative/Textural lens where horticultural patterns crystallize resistance; mycelial network vibration transmission deepens final image with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands via poet's death while lullabies persist, with conceptual cost in "final resting place". Orientation clear by line 3. Lens ambiguity: Accumulative/Textural pressure (blossom spread) lacks causal tightening; one deepening insufficient for 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable cost: restored names ("Xylos. Thalia. Maran.") momentarily defy oblivion while final lines cement "all things eventually drift into obscurity." Accumulative lens holds through sensory density escalation (crack discovery → light-beam focus).

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost of permanent division vs reconciliation, but cost legibility falters—final walk lacks visible consequence despite strong Accumulative lens cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with folded sketches embodying "encrypted compassion," but adhesive analysis resolving conflict via coincidence ("trace elements matching botanical preserve") violates Accumulative/Textural lens where pressure must deepen through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (pigeon release crystallizing balance) with conceptual cost (meteorite as cosmic counterweight), but Accumulative lens wobbles—dust-mote "heartbeat" mapping lacks causal setup, weakening escalation's pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation debt past 120 words (unclear where/when) triggers -0.4 penalty. Closure as Charged Poise ("sacred thresholds... return to love") lands with emotional cost, but lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural vs Hybrid) weakens escalation coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise (feather transformation, "eternal dance" realization) with conceptual cost. Weakness: feather's origin unexplained creates causality gap.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the woman's tears and cradled chess piece crystallize irreversible emotional cost (her vulnerability, Leo's hidden labor), with Causal lens holding through "because/therefore" linkages (e.g., earbud music observation → opera arrangement). Minor escalation dip when the quartet's appearance risks coincidence, but "subtly arranged" maintains causality.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: Lira’s transformation forecloses mobility with visible cost (rooted stillness), but the nostalgia ban’s pressure lacks concrete on-page escalation beyond atmospheric dread, weakening causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("subtle reordering of possibilities") when gauge points outward. Orientation perfect (grotto anchored by para 1), but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the gauge acts upon Elian rather than his choices driving change.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands cleanly with "weight of legacy's burden," but lens ambiguity at midpoint: Accumulative/Textural dominates but Situational elements muddy causality during film development.

    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost—the compass's dance reconfiguring life's flaw into feature. Hybrid lens (Accumulative pressure via emotional patterns) holds, but greenhouse transition lacks causal tightness; "drawn to" risks convenience despite thematic cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure achieves valid Charged Poise (new coin as "golden seam in broken heart"), but escalation lacks under Accumulative lens—shift from desolation to purpose feels unforced, with no meaningful pressure tightening beyond internal realization; cost legible but insufficiently earned.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (joy replacing ache), but crocodile tooth's proximity signal feels coincidental rather than causal escalation. Hidden sunrise timeframe weakens temporal pressure despite strong Earned Stasis reconfiguration.

Accumulative lens holds consistently as sensory density (scroll glowing, aurora) deepens stakes toward crystallized stance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise as Lena departs: the returned screw reconfigures both women's relationship to loss with palpable emotional cost (Elara's "warmth" contrasting past emptiness). Minor deduction as the cost—while felt—isn't visually anchored to a specific object or action in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands perfectly: quill-tip shedding signifies success with visible cost (exhausted tea ceremony space amid storm). Orientation crystal-clear by word 10. Platform tilt slightly coincidental but doesn't break Accumulative/Textural lens.

    Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing (covenant's true nature revealed) with causal escalation, but cost remains abstract ("burden lift" told not shown). Orientation anchors solid by para 1, yet missing on-page cost image weakens Q2's 8.8+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with visible cost ("her sacrifice" absorbing pain), but escalation under Accumulative lens lacks meaningful density increase—the memory confrontation resolves too neatly without deepening the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative/Textural lens: final image of sealing the scrap crystallizes options with undeniable conceptual cost ("something besides shame"); orientation anchors within 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with conceptual cost ("accumulated thoughts" in seed weight), but the transition from study to journey lacks causal tightening—packing occurs in one undramatized beat, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure is flawless Charged Poise: "who emerged... was neither archivist nor story-weaver" crystallizes identity migration with undeniable conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through tidal/moon imagery payoff. Cost proof: "identities migrating like tides" makes loss of fixed self legible in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully with social cost ("state of disconnection"), but early disorientation about inspector's role slightly weakens causal anchoring despite eventual clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: stepping into ordinary world with transformed understanding carries conceptual cost. However, the "second fateful letter" closure threat remains abstract, weakening the Accumulative lens's causal payoff despite strong pressure buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Empire gets hollow trophy while true essence blooms, with visible cost in the violin's "inert" state and "deep scars"; Accumulative lens holds as sensory density tightens toward the final image without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise ("pattern of the next journey began to reveal itself") lands with conceptual cost (perpetual burden of preservation) under Accumulative lens. Orientation clear by 50 words; density escalation in "strands of memory weaving" tightens stakes without causal breaks, though one decisive intensification barely avoids mid-band cap.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (sacrificing external search for contentment), but cost proof weakens at "become the source herself" where felt consequence remains abstract despite strong Accumulative lens coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure is a valid Charged Poise (mirror revealing "endless possibilities"), but the fisherman’s pivotal shift occurs in telling summary ("listened, his expression shifting..."), violating Accumulative/Textural lens requirements for pressure accumulation through dramatized beats.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise when Maya grasps the concept and "fades" while intensifying—Elien's aging reversal provides conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—disappearance reconfigures navigation with conceptual cost ("Kael was gone"). Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, though cost legibility slightly blurred by poetic abstraction in final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully—the keystone’s glow "across automated skies" crystallizes conceptual cost of rejecting standardization, with the Regulation Pack removal providing visceral, felt stakes; Accumulative lens holds impeccably through mist-walking’s "shed another preconception" rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the shimmering palm and multicolored flames crystallize irreversible transformation with visible cost. Orientation anchors pier/shift within 40 words; lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through symphony escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing works (spiral = rebirth), but Orientation Test fails: "ambered observatory deck" anchor delayed to para 3 (-0.3); cost ("contraction zenith") visible but not viscerally embodied in final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with felt cost ("cloak no longer heavy"), yet "echo of sacrifice" remains thematic ornament rather than causal pressure shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise flawless: "lukewarm" bell tone crystallizes cosmic realignment with visible cost in renewed "brittle devotion" of ship captains. Accumulative lens holds through dripping-rate density.

    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: "unwittingly upheld" realization crystallizes stakes. Orientation clear by paragraph 1; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through atmospheric pressure. Cost legible in final image’s "reclaimed truth" reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with crystal's transformation reconfiguring options, but cost remains conceptual (implied future stakes) without visceral on-page forfeiture; "final transformation" looms but lacks felt immediacy to satisfy Q2's cost-proof test for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise via transmission with conceptual cost ("clarity that belied complexity"), but lens ambiguity weakens escalation. The atmospheric anomaly escalation feels accumulative yet the emergency protocol’s origin remains causally opaque. Cost proof is legible in the final line’s tension between clarity and burden.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost (Maya embracing pain to vivify brain), but "complementary opposites" method isn't dramatized as active struggle—escalation lacks one beat where duality fails or strains tactics under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis works, but cost remains abstract ("deep commitment") with no visible price paid on the page. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet pressure never tightens options—seed merely confirms existing philosophy without forcing adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands decisively when the giggle shifts silence from "oppressive" to "echo released," with cost crystallized in "he'd merely remembered how it sounded"; Accumulative lens holds through sound-layering escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise ("stepped forward... path unclear") with felt cost (dissolved dimensional boundaries); Accumulative lens holds through light-boundary porosity. Orientation Test passed via "frozen garden shrouded in mist" anchor at 35 words.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully with the staff's heartbeat rhythm reconfiguring destiny, but the "penny dropped" idiom disrupts Accumulative/Textural lens coherence at the critical turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: towers humming with "renewed purpose" crystallizes cosmic rebirth with conceptual cost. But felt cost remains abstract—no visceral sacrifice (e.g., exhaustion, injury) beyond temporary silence, weakening the stakes at the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("complete yet ephemeral"), but childhood backstory summary dilutes causality; the accident explains motivation but isn't dramatized with micro-choices that alter tactics during the grotto sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost of redefining connection, but "jolt of recognition" feels unearned; lens (Hybrid) holds though causality wobbles during eruption sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "silent reverence... simultaneously humbled... energized" crystallizes the cost. Accumulative lens holds through refraction pattern accumulation, with alien charts confirmation providing decisive density shift. Orientation clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.3)
    Causal lens crystal-clear: photograph → pulse → garden → predator recognition. Closure lands as Earned Stasis ("pulses calm to steady rhythm") with undeniable cost (grandmother's decades-old warning resolved). Orientation flawless by word 30.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orientation fails at 120 words (no clear "who" until paragraph 2), triggering -0.4; closure as Earned Stasis works but cost proof weak—social isolation stated but not dramatized on-page during final image.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: snow stopping signals transformation cost, "failure isn't the end" crystallizes stance with felt consequence in stored ink patterns. Accumulative lens holds through ink density shifts reweighting system-failure stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise as the diamond hums "glyphs of texture made audible," crystallizing the Accumulative/Textural lens with undeniable cost: "tears streaming down his face" and "twilight of his years" make the decades-long sacrifice visceral. The birds' unprecedented pattern drives the escalation, but the diamond’s sudden glow risks coincidence complicating rather than deepening agency.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with "cultivate the frostbitten hope" foreclosing academic capture; cost is legible via the arrowhead's warmth against Aris's "professional bitterness," though the Accumulative lens tightens slightly late.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost (halo dissolution), though the "wrong turn" transition leans slightly on coincidence rather than earned accumulation under the dominant lens.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure lands as strong Charged Poise (scarf dissolving into light), but two distinct non-closure issues: hyperbolic geometry feels convenient without prior struggle, and scarf's transformation lacks setup. Orientation perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves valid Charged Poise (ribbon transformation + whisper), but accumulation lacks meaningful pressure escalation. Ritual proceeds flawlessly without narrowing options or raising cost—the compass spin is decorative, not consequential. Lens ambiguity cap applies as accumulation fails to deepen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost ("memories weren't stolen but borrowed"). Orientation perfect in first 50 words; Accumulative lens holds through constellation/mushroom pattern accumulation to final dimming.

    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: the archivist’s quiet smile at Prisha’s resilience acknowledges his exile’s purpose despite the Historians’ rejection. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly—shadow and tea leaf patterns accumulate pressure until the final swing metaphor crystallizes the cost of enduring separation.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds with Charged Poise closure (seed pulsing with wonder), but escalation lacks density increase—pressure remains static during weaving. Cost ("give pieces of oneself") is conceptual yet undramatized, weakening final image's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: the snow globe’s plane vanishing reconfigures death as "frequency shift," crystallizing stakes through Elara’s earned realization. Accumulative lens holds tightly, though the physics metaphor slightly abstracts the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.1)
    Hybrid lens (Accumulative/Situational) holds through closure. Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (mutual articulation), but felt stakes remain abstract. Critical flaw: no narrowing of options during the encoding process—ghost communication resolves too easily without tactical escalation under storm pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise as she preserves the diary, crystallizing the captain's dual existence with conceptual cost—but the weight of "silent promise" feels stated rather than viscerally shown in the final image, missing cost proof.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly under Accumulative lens: final image reweights "memorializing connection" with felt cost of professional isolation. Orientation solid by para 1, but escalation lacks meaningful deepening—cloud pattern shift doesn’t narrow options or heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost (shift from cartography to luminous pathways), but Accumulative lens ambiguity precludes higher; starlings' alignment lacks causal pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lens ambiguity (Causal vs. Accumulative) persists past midpoint; closure (Charged Poise solstice message) lacks legible cost—no sacrifice or irreversible change anchors the nebula's "brambled hope."

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens ambiguity early (Situational/Accumulative) resolved by midpoint; Earned Stasis closure valid with legible cost ("exhausted but resolute"), but lens inconsistency prevents 9.0+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with cost—spent nut, expended energy—but mechanical birds’ non-interference violates causality; coincidence resolves threat instead of pressure. Frost forming crystallizes stakes, yet bird passivity undermines escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: river channels reconfigure relationship stakes with felt cost ("grief had loosened its grip"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density, though transition from observation to call lacks micro-tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with legible cost ("hands trembling but heart lighter") under Accumulative lens. Tidal pool method's middle development feels underutilized for pressure escalation, slightly weakening causal density at the critical descent beat.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a valid Charged Poise RR: "time itself seemed to flow more smoothly" crystallizes reconfigured community rhythm with felt cost. But para 2's reflective backstory block (30% of story) violates BRR—it summarizes silo history without anchoring to a micro-choice that alters present tactics, dulling causality.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: mirror's fragmentation reweighted from damage to purpose with felt cost of permanent identity blurring ("quaking reverie now permanent"). Orientation anchors canyon/device by line 3, Accumulative lens (density/pattern shifts) holds from midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure (Earned Stasis) lands with conceptual cost (generational vigilance burden), but the final “weight of renewed responsibility” is abstract. Fails cost proof test—no exact on-page image/sentence making cost legible at closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: renewed purpose to "give rediscovered music new form" carries visible cost in tear-traced prisms; Accumulative lens holds through emotional layering without causal breaks.

Causal lens holds flawlessly: water navigation enables reaching echoes, which reconfigure resilience understanding. No causality breaks or orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    No closure unit: ends with procedural review lacking reconfiguration or cost. Orientation debt (who/where delayed past 120 words) triggers -0.3. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural intended but closure fails cost test).

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds: sculpted hush reconfigures wonder's necessity with conceptual cost ("not merely decorative but essential").

    Closure as Charged Poise lands with cost ("hollow space" vs new confidence) under Accumulative/Textural lens; orientation anchored by line 5 aurora/ridgeway.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: Elara stepping into dissolving mist with "a doorway to understanding" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost (her life's work was "too small"), but "truthful lies" phrasing in final paragraph triggers thematic echo penalty. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density buildup without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with conceptual cost (memories sacrificed), but puzzle mechanics feel coincidental rather than accumulated pressure. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds, yet cost proof falters—bead dimming signals loss but memory sacrifices lack on-page emotional consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost ("surge of azure energy... cold and burning") and reconfigured meaning. Causal lens holds firmly: silk discovery → trade → arch repair. Minor compression in "first days after" transition slightly dulls escalation momentum.

    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (truth hunted but not yet safe), but causality breaks: fabricated credentials lack setup, 90-second timer feels arbitrary. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural dominant but causal gaps) blocks 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (breath caught, elders' skepticism answered), but cost legibility falters slightly—the "weighted breath" motif isn't embodied viscerally enough in the final beat to fully satisfy the cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with undeniable cost: "tears freezing on her cheeks" and parasol's reweighted meaning crystallize transformation; Accumulative lens holds through ice/solace pattern intensification to Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds through reflective density; closure as Charged Poise lands with cost in "the burned love letter edge was not just a reminder of loss" reweighting the central symbol, though orientation debt slightly blurs the bus departure's causal role.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly under Accumulative lens with conceptual cost (map case "lighter in spirit"), but vine-climbing time lacks tangible pressure escalation. Missing one visible price altering tactics precludes 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise when the crystal's pure tone reconfigures the scholar's mission with visible cost (dust rising like spirits). Accumulative lens holds flawlessly: density builds through sensory accumulation, culminating in the resonant final image where dawn light transforms the crystal's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the sound fades as he opens his eyes to solitude, making the cost of ephemeral connection legible through the caretaker's absence and his quiet turn toward home under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost (transcended perception's limits), but the epiphany transition ("placed the clock outside") lacks causal texture under Accumulative lens, weakening escalation legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: son holding the fragment as "holy relic" crystallizes the unfixable loss while the final line reconfigures love as "space between notes"; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds ("shadows stretch away... bridge to another realm") with conceptual cost (reality's fragility), but the "budding scholar transformed" line tells rather than shows the earned shift, slightly dulling the final image's legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with dissolving maze walls and boundary softening, but conceptual cost ("renewal through mystery") remains abstract; no concrete image shows the price of lost certainty beyond thematic assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)

Accumulative lens holds perfectly as sea glass patterns progressively deepen meaning without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands powerfully: the moss-enveloped pendant reweights truth-telling's cost. Accumulative lens holds through pattern density (icicle spiral → grief stages), though the "months later" coda slightly dilutes immediacy of the on-page release.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.9)
    Orientation Test failure: no clear who/where/when by 120 words (e.g., "feral nexus" undefined), uncapped per waiver rules. Closure (Earned Stasis) lacks tangible cost—peace feels unearned as prior doubt dissolves without sacrifice. Lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs. Causal) persists past midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost in "they had not merely heard songs; they had remembered who they were"—reconfiguring community identity with conceptual cost of eroded heritage; causal lens holds through vine discovery to ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)

    Closure as Charged Poise lands with visceral cost in "love, like everything worth keeping, could be both here and gone simultaneously," crystallizing the Accumulative/Textural lens through rain-pattern lions; orientation anchors instantly via fractured light and kettle whistle, avoiding any causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise (carousel restarts, "liquid peace" replacing "fractured stillness") with conceptual cost—the camera wheel's dissolution—but escalation lacks active protagonist agency; the word-bridge forms magically without Cyrus altering tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost (reweighted meaning of navigation), but sextant's sudden equation revelation feels convenient. Causal chain holds though payoff slightly overreaches with "coordinates speaking directly to her project".

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as valid Charged Poise (renewed purpose with visible cost of soldered watch), but bear's appearance edges toward coincidence resolving conflict in Accumulative/Textural lens where pressure should stem solely from sensory accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("serene upheaval" reweights truth architecture), but lens ambiguity (Accumulative vs. Causal) weakens causality at climax. Orientation test passed early.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with rope gift reconfiguring options, but cost remains abstract ("infinitely grateful" lacks felt consequence). Accumulative/Textural lens holds through knot-decoding, though the fog's role in pressure escalation feels atmospheric rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: carpet thread transforms from "anchor and burden" to "compass pointing toward wholeness" with undeniable emotional cost ("his own explained absence becoming clearer"). Accumulative lens holds throughout with density increase in final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (beauty must grow organically), but "bitter taste of failure" labels emotion rather than embodying cost through action, slightly muddying the earned realization at the pivotal reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Valid Charged Poise closure as Maya witnesses intact grafts at dawn with surrounding destruction, charging cost through "black sand connecting past to present." However, cloud migration functions as convenient environmental coincidence rather than earned escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable cost: memories freed but Elara now bears Keeper burden, crystallized by geese resuming migration; sidereal patience reweights stakes via starlight breadcrumbs, though breadcrumb mechanics introduced late slightly weakens causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (eternal cycle of sharing light), but causal links dissolve into lyric repetition; "across the quiet sigh of falling petals" loop obscures pressure escalation toward the transit climax.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.7)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: final butterfly image reweights grief’s premise with undeniable cost (ribbon depletion, mentor’s exit). Accumulative lens holds—density of knots/butterflies tightens stakes without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise through the rocking chair's cessation crystallizing Elena's realization about safety in process over completion, with conceptual cost legible in "no safety to be found in completion"—Accumulative lens held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "true chronometer of human knowledge continued its silent turning" crystallizes stance with conceptual cost. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through sedimentary pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: rosette handover crystallizes cost ("vanishing arts need not disappear") under Accumulative lens. Early orientation (<50 words) and seamless escalation via sensory density avoid common pitfalls.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Elias stands knowing "something important had been accomplished" with conceptual cost ("roots would spread... in the minds").

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: repaired bees working as Elara realizes honesty bridges wonder/truth, with conceptual cost in supervisor’s ruined career; causal escalation holds tightly from tourist inquiry to sabotage reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise with conceptual cost ("echo of lives poured into walls"), but Accumulative lens falters as object glow feels coincidental rather than earned density escalation—pressure lacks tangible narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis succeeds with diver's nod signifying abandoned certainty, but cost remains implied rather than legible on-page. Orientation clear by para 1, yet pressure escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening—revelations cascade passively from statue.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change with undeniable cost: rupture forecloses purgatory path as "glimpses of the world flooded his senses." Causal lens holds perfectly—"because" of fracture point math, "therefore" staircase collapses with shattering-glass sound.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands: mural reweights premise with conceptual cost (fragility of connection in smog-choked anonymity). Dawn’s approach narrows options, but "tomorrow night" slightly softens the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands unmistakably: "dread still there... pierced by vivid green resilience" crystallizes cultural reawakening’s cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds through sensory density escalation ("slow roots finding light" → "distant cracking" → "impossible warmth"), narrowing options to the bread’s activation.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    Causal lens holds perfectly but cost proof test fails: "world would never run same direction" states change without dramatizing price. Closure image lacks legible consequence despite strong tide-pressure escalation ("narrow window of possibility").

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: "curse is your blessing" paradox reweights death with undeniable cost in the crumbling funhouse. Accumulative lens holds via luminance density, though advisor's origin edges toward mystical convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (orchard's silent journey embodying fragile harmony), but storm diversion lacks causal proof—feels coincidental, not earned by her actions. Orientation strong ("driftwood circle," "blue hour" anchored by 80 words), lens (Accumulative/Textural) consistent through density escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost ("dread transformed into purpose") under consistent Causal lens; orientation clear by line 3; one tightening (whistle crack) sufficient for length with unambiguous cost proof in final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds with clean orientation and ledger discovery as Decisive Change. Conceptual cost (truth's burden) is legible but insufficiently charged; "pit of lies" repetition in final paragraph weakens Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("weighted by responsibility") under Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening (recovery/addition of note) suffices for length, but escalation lacks pressure transformation beyond density increase.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: blackout ending crystallizes his bridge role with conceptual cost ("had to readjust his sense of self"), under Accumulative lens where evidence density reconfigures stakes; "hours passed" transition risks causality blur but saved by indexing training organically resolving the hypothesis.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: lantern's ascent crystallizes emotional reconfiguration with tears as visceral cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout—density increase in memory flooding during polishing tightens stakes without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    Causal lens holds perfectly: cooling circuit breakers create narrow window driving descent/harvest. Closure is decisive Charged Poise—Elias seeing "infinite possibility" with visible cost (rare smile feeling foreign), reconfiguring stakes through earned causality without retroactive fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure lands as Decisive Change with visceral cost ("racing heart," "reaching across light-years"), causal lens holds throughout via drone-path calculations narrowing options, but pilgrim’s off-page role creates minor causality drift—resolution hinges on Maya’s agency alone despite initial warning dependency.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable cost: paired objects in sand crystallize stance shift. Orientation anchors by line 3 ("cobalt terrace at dusk"). Hybrid lens (Accumulative dominant) holds through "sieved hush" density building to recognition beat.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly with moon phase/drawer pull pressure building to Charged Poise closure. Cost is undeniable in Rennett's relaxed shoulders after "I apologize," though moon synchronization mechanics could tighten causality earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lands with ship dissolution as cost, but escalation lacks felt pressure: no near-miss stitch consequence despite stated risk. Cost proof test fails—"weight of all human history" remains abstract, not dramatized during pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.3)
    Closure (Charged Poise) lacks legible cost—Ian's peaceful acceptance undercuts stakes. Coincidence resolves prophecy fulfillment, violating Situational lens rule that "coincidence may complicate but not resolve." Orientation clear, but cosmic alignment passively drives escalation without protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: completed sundial message crystallizes options with undeniable pressure as "embers began to glow," the warm quill holder making cost legible. Accumulative lens holds cohesively through blackout's density increase.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (time's relativity made visceral via glowing clock); Accumulative lens holds through density increase in final descent. Horizon's deepening violet perfectly reweights temporal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise (monsoon arrival + luminous doubt) but cost remains conceptual; Accumulative lens holds though causality frays during dream interpretation; orientation solid but lens ambiguity caps high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly with conceptual cost ("cerulean regret transformed into peace"); Accumulative lens holds through lace pattern shifts, though brief backstory risks orientation but is anchored by storm cue.
