You are a style and content analyst. Describe the stylistic fingerprint of one short story.
Judge both style and content axes. For content axes, ignore overlap caused solely by the required elements and rate the story’s additional choices.
Required elements are context only; do not reward or punish their presence.

STORY (cleaned of inline word counts):
<<<STORY>>>

REQUIRED ELEMENTS (context only):
<<<ELEMENTS>>>

Axes to assess (definitions and any allowed choices):
<<<AXIS_INSTRUCTIONS>>>

Output exactly these tags, one per line, in this order. For numeric axes, output a number in [0.0, 10.0] with one decimal. For enums, output exactly one allowed choice:
<<<OUTPUT_TAGS>>>
<flags>format_error=0</flags>
