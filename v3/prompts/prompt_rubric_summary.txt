Rubric summary (Q1–Q8 craft + 9A–9J element integration)

Global guardrails
- Drive lens (infer once and hold): Causal, Accumulative/Textural, Situational, or Hybrid (judge closure under the dominant lens at the end).
- Closure (required, on the page, with cost): Decisive Change (DC), Resonant Reconfiguration (RR — Charged Poise or Earned Stasis), or Conceptual Repricing (CR). A single meaningful tightening/shift is sufficient at short length.
- Escalation by lens:
  • Causal: because/therefore linkages narrow options or raise cost.
  • Accumulative/Textural: density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift reweights the dominant stake.
  • Situational: coherent pressure forces stance crystallization; coincidence may complicate but not resolve.
- Orientation test (single‑scene window): Anchor who/where/when by ~120 words unless deliberate disorientation is taught early and pays off at closure. If unclear past ~120 words and it does not serve closure, apply −0.3 to −0.5 once in Q2 and cap Q3 at 7.0.
- Lens clarity: if lens remains ambiguous past midpoint and is not taught by closure, −0.3 to −0.5 in Q2; if ambiguity persists at closure, apply listed caps.
- Backstory/Reflection (BRR): At 600–800 words, allow ≤20% single reflective block or two brief fragments that anchor in the present and tilt current stance; route penalties to Q7 (momentum drag) unless causality breaks (then Q2).
- Penalty routing: score each root flaw once where it harms most — Q2 for causality/motivation/orientation, Q4 for pressure/escalation/cost legibility with causality intact, Q7 for line‑level opacity/loops/drag. Avoid double‑penalizing.
- High‑band entry (tightened): Eligibility for 8.8+ generally requires Q2 ≥ 8.8, Q4 ≥ 8.2, Q7 ≥ 8.2, and a held drive lens; otherwise cap that category at 8.7.
- Global 9+ gate: No category ≥ 9.0 unless Q2 ≥ 9.0 and the category’s own 9+ quick test is satisfied; otherwise cap at 8.8. Apply the cost‑proof test at closure: if you cannot point to an exact sentence/image where cost is legible, deduct −0.4 to −0.8 in Q2.
- Dialogue policy: Optional; evaluate only when present for naturalism, subtext, goal pursuit, and advancement.

Q1 Character & Motivation
- Depth, specificity of goals/constraints; believable motives; active pursuit; decisive choice or renunciation that reads as earned by prior causality.
- Red flags: diagnostic label‑speak in peak beats (−0.4 to −0.6 unless dramatized immediately); unmotivated flips; asserted emotion without on‑page pressure.

Q2 Plot Structure & Coherence (closure lives here)
- Coherent beginning–middle–end or taught mosaic; causal/patterned logic holds; orientation anchors; closure lands with felt/conceptual cost under the chosen lens.
- Penalize: causality breaks, plot amnesia, soft resets that clear problems without cost, convenient coincidences that resolve stakes.

Q3 Setting, Atmosphere & Specificity
- Purposeful, selective detail that anchors who/where/when and constrains choice; allow micro‑setting (body/tool/object) when it constrains choice or charges the final image.
- 9+ gate: environment/body/tool/object must constrain a choice or charge the final image; else cap ≈8.8 even if vivid.

Q4 Story Impact & Pressure/Escalation
- Stakes/pressure tighten by lens; options narrow; one meaningful intensification suffices; closure unit pays a cost.

Q5 Authenticity & Originality
- Fresh perspective and imagery; avoids cliché and stock solutions; risk where justified by story logic; coherent novelty.

Q6 Thematic Cohesion & Tone
- Unified throughline; motifs and images reinforce core argument; tone stable or intentionally modulated in service of closure.

Q7 Voice & Point of View
- Consistent voice; clean focalization; no mid‑paragraph head‑hopping; legible sentence‑level flow; reflection does not flatten pressure.

Q8 Prose & Line‑Level Craft
- Diction, rhythm, syntax, and imagery serve the moment; avoids redundancy, over‑explanation, and ornament that obscures intent; technical accuracy.

9A–9J Element Integration (judge integration quality, not mentions)
- Each required element should shape choices, pressure, imagery, or the closure beat. “None” ⇒ N/A.
- 9A Character (specified person/role): On‑page presence changes options or colors closure.
- 9B Object: Recurs, constrains action, or charges final image; not a token prop.
- 9C Concept/Theme: Operates as pressure or lens, not a slogan.
- 9D Attribute/Trait: Evidenced in behavior/choices; not told once then dropped.
- 9E Action: Meaningfully executed on page; affects stakes or cadence.
- 9F Method/Technique: Shown in practice with consequence, not name‑dropped.
- 9G Setting/Location: Spatial choreography stays clear; setting constrains tactics.
- 9H Timeframe/Temporal: Temporal rules are legible and matter for outcomes.
- 9I Motivation/Drive: Concrete, threaded through choices; visible cost at or before closure.
- 9J Tone/Mood: Consistent with premise; charges images or closure cadence.
