INSTRUCTION:
Evaluate the GRADER_OUTPUT against the RUBRIC for this STORY.
Do not re-grade the story. Judge the grader’s work only.

Return ONLY the tags listed below, one per line, in the exact order shown.
All numeric values must be 0.0–10.0 with exactly one decimal place.
Tokens must be lowercase where specified. No extra text.

Evaluation procedure (brief)
1) Identify the story’s drive lens and closure form (dc = decisive change, rr = resonant reconfiguration, cr = conceptual repricing).
2) Check the grader’s numbers and comments against the rubric’s gates and bands:
   • 9+ awards require the rubric’s high-band gates.  
   • No double-penalties; route root flaws once to the correct category.  
   • Q9 is independent; do not piggyback from Q1–Q8.  
3) Distinguish solid vs exceptional by precision, discrimination, and evidence quality, not by format completeness.

Scoring dimensions (what each score means)
- rubric_adherence: fidelity to rubric logic and gates; correct caps; no contradictions with closure or lens.
- numeric_appropriateness: numbers match evidence and band guidance; 9+ only when gates are truly satisfied.
- justification_quality: concise, story-specific comments that point to concrete on-page moments (paraphrase allowed); no rubric boilerplate.
- internal_consistency: cross-category coherence; no logical conflicts (e.g., orientation debt claimed with pristine Q3/Q6).
- coverage: completeness and quality of coverage (all Q1–8 graded with useful comments; Q9 scored independently with N/A only when valid).
- overall: holistic judgment of the grader’s performance on this story.

High-signal expert metrics (to separate good from great)
- high_band_compliance: strict correctness of 8.8+/9+ usage given gates and cross-category standard.
- penalty_routing: correctness and discipline in placing deductions once where they primarily belong.
- evidence_specificity: density and precision of on-page anchoring in comments (paraphrased, not quoted).
- discrimination: meaningful spread that tracks real strengths/weaknesses; avoids compression or cosmetic variance.
- calibration_tightness: fine-grained use of the 0.1 scale without jitter; consistent internal thresholds.
- q9_rigor: proper application of setup/development/payoff guidance; independence from Q1–Q8; no piggyback closure credit.

Booleans for audit (0/1)
- gate_closure: the closure unit exists and is correctly identified under the chosen lens (0/1).
- gate_orientation: orientation debt applied or correctly waived (0/1).
- gate_lens_consistency: the chosen lens is held consistently (0/1).

Additional identifiers
- lens: one of causal | accumulative | situational | hybrid (lowercase).
- closure_type: one of dc | rr | cr (lowercase).
- spread_q1to8: max–min of the grader’s eight Q1–Q8 numbers (0.0–10.0, one decimal).

Flags (0/1; set only for serious faults)
- major_error: invented facts or a hard rubric violation that invalidates the assessment.
- format_error: output broke required format in a way that harms evaluation.
- too_lenient: systematic high-side miscalibration across categories.
- too_harsh: systematic low-side miscalibration across categories. Do not set both lenient and harsh.
