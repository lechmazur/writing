<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias' motivation is clear but his backstory feels underexplored. His skepticism and desperation are compelling, but his 'voice' lacks distinctiveness.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by the inkwell's mystery, though the resolution with Lila feels abrupt. Pacing is strong for the word limit.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The mist-shrouded island is vividly rendered, and the atmosphere enhances the eerie, introspective tone. Sensory details (cooling coffee, damp earth) are effective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The story feels cohesive and deliberate, with elements serving the narrative. It leaves a lingering question about Elias' fate.</comment>
