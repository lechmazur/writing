<question>1</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Gaius's motivation is clear and consistent, but his "outlaw" status feels underdeveloped. His pragmatic resolve and mockery of skepticism are strengths.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The plot is coherent and driven by his quest, but the tight word limit leaves some transitions abrupt. Pacing is well-managed.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>The Roman marketplace is vividly rendered with sensory details, enhancing the atmosphere and Gaius's actions. The setting and object (pouch) connect meaningfully.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Strong use of imagery and subtext, though the ending feels slightly rushed. The theme of decoding decay is memorable and thought-provoking.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Original in concept but leans slightly into flowery prose. Avoids clichés, but some metaphors feel overly precise rather than vivid.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Cohesive and creative, with elements serving the story well. The brevity feels deliberate, leaving a lingering sense of discovery.</comment>
