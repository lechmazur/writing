<question>1</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Elara's boredom and shapeshifting talent drive her actions clearly and consistently; her "intelligently foolish" trait adds depth to her reckless yet effective plan.</comment>  
<question>2</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The plot is tightly structured, with the shared taxi ride serving as a clever, high-stakes method for the overthrow. Pacing is brisk but coherent.</comment>  
<question>3</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are vividly rendered, with sensory details (sound, water) enhancing the atmosphere and amplifying the story's tension.</comment>  
<question>4</question><grade>9.8</grade><comment>The story excels in subtext (chaos vs. order), literary devices (glyphs as symbols), and a satisfying, purposeful ending. Dialogue is minimal but sharp.</comment>  
<question>5</question><grade>9.6</grade><comment>Original and fresh, avoiding clichés. The "intelligently foolish" twist on the shapeshifter trope and the figurine's glyphs stand out as inventive.</comment>  
<question>6</question><grade>9.4</grade><comment>All elements fuse seamlessly. The word limit feels intentional, leaving room for thematic resonance (chaos as liberation).</comment>
