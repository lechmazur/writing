<question>1</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Alistair is distinct and his motivations are clear, but his emotional arc feels slightly underdeveloped; more internal conflict or transformation would deepen his portrayal.</comment>
<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The story has a clear arc and resolution, but the transition from observation to action (nudging debris) feels abrupt and underexplained.</comment>
<question>3</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail and atmosphere; the juxtaposition of mundane (postcards, fridge) with cosmic scale is effective and immersive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Well-crafted and cohesive with a lingering thematic resonance, though a slightly more grounded emotional climax would elevate it further.</comment>
