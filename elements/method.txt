antinomy avoiding
leaving doors slightly ajar as invitations
wearing mismatched earrings to signal distress
tapping three times before entering any room
gifting strangers exactly what they need
arriving precisely seven minutes late always
replacing photos in frames while visiting
learning everyone's coffee order by heart
writing names on foggy windows
keeping one shoelace untied

buying two of everything and leaving one behind
reading only the last page of books first

mailing empty envelopes
receiving messages meant for others
opening others' fortunes
closing books mid-sentence
starting stories from the middle
ending conversations with beginnings
questioning answers instead of answering questions
forgetting important things on purpose
remembering what never happened
creating photo albums of strangers
keeping diaries for other people
writing shopping lists in poetry
singing lullabies to empty rooms
dancing with shadows at noon
swimming in imaginary pools
flying paper airplanes indoors
sailing boats in bathtubs
climbing stairs that go nowhere
running in place meaningfully
jumping to wrong conclusions beautifully
falling upward gracefully
standing still while moving
sitting in motion
lying down vertically
walking through walls mentally
passing through crowds untouched
disappearing in plain sight
appearing where unexpected
vanishing during conversations
materializing at important moments
existing in two places
being nowhere specific
occupying impossible spaces
filling empty rooms with presence
leaving impressions without touching
making shadows without light
creating echoes without sound
producing warmth without fire
generating light without source
causing ripples without dropping stones
making waves without water
stirring air without movement
breathing underwater metaphorically
drowning in shallow emotions
surfacing in deep thoughts
diving into solid ground
emerging from closed spaces
entering through exits
leaving through entrances
arriving before departing
staying while leaving
remaining by going away
returning without having left
traveling without moving
journeying inward while walking out
discovering familiar places anew
