Deputy Hayes, his face a granite mask, stretched his arms above his head, a personally impersonal gesture in the echoing cathedral. <words>16</words>
During oil changes, the only time he allowed himself this indulgence, he sought solace among the apple trees that inexplicably flourished in the rafters. <words>32</words>
Their branches, heavy with fruit, formed a lush orchard high above the crumbling pews. <words>41</words>
He breathed in the sweet, earthy scent, a stark contrast to the metallic tang of the garage below. <words>51</words>
He yearned, with a cautious bravery, to witness a moment of pure grace. <words>59</words>
The twisted twist tie in his pocket, a seemingly insignificant object, pulsed with a strange energy. <words>70</words>
It was a conduit, he believed, to the uncharted echoes that whispered through the cathedral. <words>80</words>
He closed his eyes, his impassive face betraying nothing of the turmoil within. <words>89</words>
He began to move his fingers, slowly at first, then with increasing speed, mimicking the intricate dance of bees. <words>102</words>
With the secret language of bees, he communicated with the echoes, stretching his awareness beyond the physical realm. <words>115</words>
The air around him vibrated, the uncharted echoes responding to his call. <words>123</words>
A single apple, ripe and red, detached itself from a branch and began to fall. <words>133</words>
Hayes watched, his gaze fixed on the descending fruit, his body still. <words>141</words>
Time seemed to slow as the apple plummeted towards the cracked stone floor. <words>150</words>
He held his breath, the twisted twist tie digging into his palm. <words>158</words>
Just before impact, a gust of wind, seemingly summoned from nowhere, caught the apple. <words>169</words>
It swirled upwards, a graceful pirouette in the air, before landing softly on a cushion of moss that had inexplicably sprung up on a crumbling pillar. <words>187</words>
Hayes exhaled, a barely perceptible movement of his chest. <words>193</words>
He had witnessed it, a moment of pure grace, orchestrated by the uncharted echoes and facilitated by his personally impersonal connection to them. <words>210</words>
He returned his hands to his sides, the twisted twist tie now cool to the touch. <words>220</words>
The echoes had receded, the cathedral returning to its usual stillness. <words>229</words>
He opened his eyes, his impassive face unchanged. <words>235</words>
The oil change was complete. <words>238</words>
He descended from the rafters, the scent of apples clinging to his clothes, a reminder of the secret world he inhabited during oil changes. <words>255</words>
Back in the garage, surrounded by the familiar smells of grease and gasoline, he resumed his duties, his impassive demeanor a shield against the mundane. <words>273</words>
No one would ever suspect the depths of his experience, the cautious bravery he displayed in the abandoned cathedral. <words>286</words>
The twisted twist tie, tucked back into his pocket, remained his silent confidant, a link to the uncharted echoes and the moments of pure grace he sought with the secret language of bees. <words>310</words>
He stretched his neck, a small, almost imperceptible movement, a personally impersonal acknowledgment of the connection he had forged with the unseen world. <words>328</words>
The world around him continued, oblivious to the subtle shifts in reality that occurred during oil changes in the presence of an impassive deputy. <words>346</words>
He continued his work, his mind already anticipating the next oil change, the next opportunity to stretch his awareness and witness the uncharted echoes dance within the lush orchard spanning the rafters of the abandoned cathedral. <words>376</words>
He knew, with a cautious bravery, that the moments of pure grace were waiting, hidden within the whispers of the bees and the secrets held within the twisted twist tie. <words>398</words>
He just had to be there to witness them. <words>403</words>
