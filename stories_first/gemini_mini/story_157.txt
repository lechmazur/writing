The elusive puppeteer, Bartholomew Buttonsby, adjusted his spectacles, a plain ring adorning his pinky finger. <words>12</words>
He believed that by tracking rain patterns throughout tailgating season, he could unveil the ancestors and water the seeds of curiosity in the minds of the living. <words>30</words>
The forgotten lighthouse library, with its shelves of mildew-stained encyclopedias and nautical charts, served as his absurdly solemn laboratory. <words>42</words>
Bartholomew was convinced that the ancestors, specifically universal in their influence, communicated through the subtle shifts in precipitation during pre-game festivities. <words>56</words>
He meticulously charted the trajectory of each raindrop, the angle of its descent, the diameter of the splash it made on the cracked pavement outside. <words>72</words>
He saw patterns where others saw chaos, connections where others saw coincidence. <words>79</words>
This week, the forecast predicted a drizzle, perfect for paddling through the metaphysical puddles of ancestral wisdom. <words>89</words>
Bartholomew grabbed his specially designed paddle, its handle carved with symbols he claimed were gleaned from ancient rain dances. <words>101</words>
He envisioned himself paddling through the air, navigating the currents of ancestral whispers carried on the wind. <words>111</words>
He believed that the specifically universal nature of the ancestors meant they were present in every drop, every gust, every burger flipped on a grill. <words>125</words>
The absurdity of his quest never struck him; he operated with the utmost solemnity, convinced of the profound importance of his work. <words>138</words>
He arrived at the stadium parking lot, a sea of pickup trucks and folding chairs, the air thick with the smell of charcoal and anticipation. <words>150</words>
Rain began to fall, a light, hesitant drizzle. <words>154</words>
Bartholomew, plain ring glinting in the dim light, began to paddle, his movements slow and deliberate, mimicking the strokes of a canoeist navigating a placid lake. <words>170</words>
He closed his eyes, focusing on the feel of the rain on his face, the sound of it pattering on the pavement, the subtle shifts in the wind. <words>183</words>
He imagined the ancestors, specifically universal in their presence, watching him, whispering secrets in the language of rain. <words>194</words>
A group of tailgaters, confused by the sight of a man paddling the air with a ceremonial paddle, stopped their cornhole game to stare. <words>208</words>
Bartholomew, oblivious to their bewildered gazes, continued his ritual, convinced he was on the verge of a breakthrough. <words>220</words>
He paddled through the thickening drizzle, the absurd solemnity of his actions amplified by the increasingly boisterous atmosphere of the tailgate party. <words>234</words>
He felt a connection, a sense of understanding, a feeling that he was finally tapping into the wisdom of the ancestors. <words>246</words>
He saw visions in the rain, faces swirling in the droplets, voices whispering in the wind. <words>255</words>
He paddled faster, more urgently, driven by the need to unveil the secrets hidden within the rain patterns. <words>266</words>
The tailgaters, now thoroughly entertained, began to cheer him on, their laughter echoing through the parking lot. <words>277</words>
Bartholomew, lost in his absurdly solemn quest, didn't notice. <words>283</words>
He paddled on, throughout the tailgating, a lone figure in a sea of revelry, driven by the specifically universal need to water the seeds of curiosity. <words>299</words>
He believed, with all his heart, that the ancestors were speaking to him, and he was determined to listen, even if it meant paddling through the rain in a forgotten lighthouse library parking lot. <words>320</words>
The plain ring on his finger, a symbol of his connection to the past, glinted in the fading light, a testament to his absurdly solemn dedication to unveiling the ancestors. <words>337</words>
And as the last drops of rain fell, and the tailgaters dispersed, Bartholomew Buttonsby, the elusive puppeteer, stood alone, his paddle dripping, a faint smile playing on his lips. <words>356</words>
He had heard them. <words>358</words>
The ancestors. <words>360</words>
Specifically universal. <words>362</words>
Speaking through the rain. <words>364</words>
And he, Bartholomew Buttonsby, had watered the seeds of curiosity. <words>370</words>
At least, that's what he believed. <words>374</words>
And in the absurd solemnity of the forgotten lighthouse library parking lot, that was all that mattered. <words>385</words>
