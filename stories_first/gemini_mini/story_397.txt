Bartholomew, the bartender, a man whose soul had marinated in enough spilled whiskey to pickle a small town, stared at the bloodstained medical scalpel. <words>19</words>
He found it nestled amongst the crystal shards in the growing lab, a genuinely strange intrusion in a place dedicated to the slow, deliberate dance of molecules. <words>38</words>
The lab, usually humming with the low thrum of machinery, was eerily silent, the final stillness before fireworks ignite, a pregnant pause before the explosion of color and sound. <words>59</words>
He felt a pull, an optimistic desperation, a conviction that this scalpel held a key to understanding his past, a past shrouded in a fog he couldn't quite penetrate. <words>80</words>
He started collecting the discarded receipts from the lab's small office, each covered in his predecessor's idle doodles. <words>92</words>
Bartholomew's predecessor, a brilliant but eccentric crystallographer, had vanished without a trace six months ago. <words>104</words>
He spread the receipts across the lab's pristine workbench, a chaotic tapestry of overlapping circles, triangles, and what looked suspiciously like anatomical sketches. <words>120</words>
He felt a strange kinship with this ghost, a shared fascination with the hidden patterns of the universe. <words>130</words>
He began comparing the doodles, meticulously searching for overlaps, for recurring motifs, for any hint of a message. <words>141</words>
The scalpel lay heavy in his hand, a cold reminder of the unknown fate he was trying to unravel. <words>152</words>
He noticed a pattern, a series of overlapping circles that appeared on multiple receipts, each slightly different, as if charting a progression. <words>166</words>
He traced the circles with his finger, a growing excitement bubbling in his chest. <words>174</words>
He realized the circles weren't just circles; they were cross-sections of crystals, each representing a different stage of growth. <words>187</words>
And within those circles, hidden within the seemingly random scribbles, were tiny, almost imperceptible numbers. <words>198</words>
He transcribed the numbers onto a fresh sheet of paper, his hand trembling with anticipation. <words>207</words>
They formed a sequence, a code. <words>210</words>
He recognized it instantly: geographical coordinates. <words>214</words>
Scattered across the globe. <words>216</words>
He felt a jolt, a sudden understanding of the crystallographer's grand, genuinely strange ambition: to globalize the growth of a specific type of crystal, a crystal with unique properties, by planting seeds in strategic locations around the world. <words>246</words>
But why? <words>247</words>
He looked at the scalpel again, the dried blood a stark contrast to the pristine white of the lab. <words>258</words>
He felt a chill run down his spine. <words>262</words>
Had the crystallographer's ambition become an obsession? <words>267</words>
Had he pushed the boundaries of science too far? <words>272</words>
He knew he had to find out. <words>276</words>
He had to follow the coordinates, to see what the crystallographer had created, to understand the past and, perhaps, to challenge the fate that awaited him. <words>295</words>
The fireworks began to explode outside, painting the night sky in vibrant hues. <words>303</words>
The silence was broken, replaced by the joyous cacophony of celebration. <words>310</words>
But inside the lab, Bartholomew felt a different kind of explosion, an explosion of understanding, of purpose, of optimistic desperation. <words>324</words>
He clutched the scalpel tighter, a strange artifact in a strange quest, a symbol of his determination to uncover the truth, no matter how bizarre or dangerous it might be. <words>344</words>
He was no longer just a jaded bartender. <words>349</words>
He was an investigator, an adventurer, a challenger of fate. <words>355</words>
He was ready to globalize his search, one crystal, one coordinate, one doodle at a time. <words>366</words>
He picked up his bag, the scalpel nestled safely inside, and stepped out into the vibrant, firework-lit night, ready to face whatever the future held. <words>385</words>
The past was a puzzle, and he, Bartholomew, the unlikely detective of a crystal growing laboratory, was determined to solve it. <words>399</words>
He had a feeling it would be a genuinely strange journey. <words>405</words>
