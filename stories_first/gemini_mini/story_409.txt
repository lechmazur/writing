The bruised fighter, ribs aching, knuckles raw, stumbled through the dusty attic. <words>10</words>
Clockwork monkeys chattered silently from atop precarious stacks of books, their gears frozen mid-motion. <words>20</words>
A giraffe with mismatched legs craned its neck towards a cobwebbed skylight, forever reaching for a sun it could never touch. <words>32</words>
He was skillfully incompetent at hiding his pain, each wince a betrayal of his carefully constructed facade of toughness. <words>44</words>
At the moment a sculptor’s chisel first struck marble, a tremor ran through the attic, shaking dust motes into swirling constellations. <words>57</words>
He knew, with a certainty that chilled him more than any punch, that this was his moment. <words>66</words>
He had to extinguish the last vestige of self-deception, the lie that he was fighting for anything other than his own bruised ego. <words>80</words>
He was here to abduct a piece of himself, a forgotten dream. <words>87</words>
He sifted through a trunk filled with moth-eaten velvet cloaks and tarnished silver lockets, each item a whisper of a life he’d almost lived. <words>102</words>
His fingers closed around something sharp, a clay pot shard. <words>108</words>
An inscription, barely legible beneath layers of grime, read: "Stand for something, even if it’s yourself." <words>118</words>
The words resonated with a painful truth he’d been trying to ignore. <words>125</words>
He’d been so busy fighting, so focused on proving his strength, that he’d forgotten what he was fighting for. <words>138</words>
The attic shimmered, the clockwork animals blurring at the edges. <words>144</words>
He was slipping, falling through the cracks of time, pulled by the forgotten dream. <words>153</words>
He saw himself, younger, eyes bright with idealism, standing before a cheering crowd. <words>161</words>
He was fighting for justice, for equality, for a world where the weak weren't preyed upon. <words>171</words>
That boy, that dream, was the piece of himself he needed to abduct, to bring back from the dusty graveyard of forgotten aspirations. <words>186</words>
He clutched the shard, the inscription burning into his palm. <words>192</words>
The attic dissolved, replaced by a swirling vortex of colors and sensations. <words>200</words>
He was falling through the forgotten dreams, reaching for the boy he used to be. <words>209</words>
He would reclaim that lost part of himself, the part that stood for something more than just winning the next fight. <words>222</words>
The memory of the sculptor’s chisel striking marble echoed in his mind, a reminder of the moment he chose to change. <words>234</words>
He would rebuild himself, shard by shard, dream by dream, until he could once again stand for something true. <words>247</words>
The swirling colors coalesced into a single point of light, a beacon in the darkness of his self-deception. <words>259</words>
He reached out, his bruised hand trembling, and grasped the light. <words>266</words>
He felt a surge of hope, a flicker of the fire that had once burned so brightly within him. <words>278</words>
He was no longer just a bruised fighter. <words>283</words>
He was a man on a mission, a man with a purpose. <words>290</words>
He was a man standing for something. <words>295</words>
The forgotten dream, no longer forgotten, pulsed with renewed life within him. <words>304</words>
He carried it back with him, a precious cargo salvaged from the wreckage of his past. <words>315</words>
He emerged from the attic, blinking in the harsh light of the present, the clay shard clutched tight in his hand. <words>328</words>
The inscription, now clean and clear, seemed to glow with an inner light. <words>336</words>
He looked at his bruised knuckles, no longer symbols of pointless aggression, but badges of honor earned in the fight for something real. <words>351</words>
He was still skillfully incompetent, still prone to stumbling and falling, but now he knew where he was going, and why. <words>365</words>
He was standing for something, and that made all the difference. <words>371</words>
The clockwork animals in the attic, still frozen in their silent dance, seemed to watch him with newfound respect. <words>384</words>
He had faced his own weakness, his own self-deception, and emerged stronger, more whole. <words>395</words>
He had abducted his forgotten dream, and in doing so, he had saved himself. <words>404</words>
