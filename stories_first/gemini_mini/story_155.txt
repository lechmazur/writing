The flickering neon sign of "The Celestial Dive" cast an eerie glow on the rain-slicked streets. <words>14</words>
Inside, the broken planetarium, now a pulsating nightclub, throbbed with a bass that vibrated through the very foundations of the building. <words>29</words>
Jax, an underwater welder by trade, but a seeker of improbable power by obsession, felt a familiar thrum of anticipation. <words>42</words>
He was patiently impatient, a man perpetually on the edge of a breakthrough he couldn't quite grasp. <words>52</words>
Tonight, at the crossing where two timelines should never meet, he believed he'd find it. <words>61</words>

The air crackled with an energy that wasn't entirely from the faulty wiring of the repurposed planetarium. <words>74</words>
Jax moved through the crowd, his gaze drawn to the fragmented reflections in the vintage store mirrors lining the walls, remnants of a forgotten era. <words>91</words>
In each glimpse, he saw fractured versions of himself, each existing in a slightly different reality. <words>102</words>
He was pampering his obsession, feeding it with these fragmented reflections, searching for the one that held the key. <words>115</words>

He stopped before a stall piled high with forgotten trinkets, a graveyard of memories from a timeline that shouldn't exist. <words>129</words>
His eyes locked onto a vintage button box, its tarnished brass gleaming faintly in the strobe lights. <words>140</words>
It called to him, a siren song in the cacophony of the club. <words>148</words>
He picked it up, the cool metal a stark contrast to the feverish heat of his anticipation. <words>158</words>

The button box felt strangely familiar, as if he'd held it in another life, in another time. <words>168</words>
He opened it, revealing a chaotic jumble of buttons, each a different size, shape, and color. <words>178</words>
As he ran his fingers over them, the fragmented reflections in the mirrors began to swirl, the timelines blurring. <words>191</words>
The music warped, the lights pulsed erratically, and the air grew thick with the scent of ozone. <words>201</words>
The moments of unraveling had begun. <words>206</words>

Jax felt a surge of power, raw and untamed, coursing through his veins. <words>215</words>
He pressed a small, mother-of-pearl button, and the world around him shifted. <words>224</words>
The nightclub dissolved into a swirling vortex of colors and sounds, the boundaries of reality bending and breaking. <words>238</words>
He was falling, tumbling through the fractured timelines, the vintage button box clutched tightly in his hand. <words>250</words>

He saw glimpses of other worlds, other possibilities, each a tantalizing taste of the power he craved. <words>261</words>
He saw himself as a king, a god, a destroyer, each reflection a potential future, a potential him. <words>273</words>
The inherited mystery of his quest, passed down through generations of seekers, was finally within his grasp. <words>286</words>
He was on the precipice of wielding a power beyond comprehension, a power that could reshape reality itself. <words>299</words>

But as he reached for it, the button box slipped from his grasp, tumbling into the chaotic void. <words>310</words>
The timelines snapped back into place, the nightclub solidified around him, the music returned to its steady rhythm. <words>323</words>
He was back in The Celestial Dive, the vintage store mirrors reflecting only his own bewildered face. <words>335</words>
The moment of unraveling had passed, leaving him with nothing but the lingering scent of ozone and the echo of improbable power. <words>350</words>

He looked around, the nightclub suddenly mundane, the music grating on his ears. <words>359</words>
The inherited mystery remained, a tantalizing whisper in the back of his mind. <words>368</words>
He knew he would continue his search, patiently impatient, driven by the glimpse of what could be. <words>380</words>
He would pamper his obsession, scouring the forgotten corners of reality, until he found the crossing again, until he held the power in his hands once more. <words>399</words>
The vintage button box, lost in the fractured timelines, became a symbol of his unfulfilled potential, a constant reminder of the power that almost was. <words>419</words>
