A contrite swordsman, known as Hiro, drifted on a plush, algae-woven raft in the Floating Island Spa, the air thick with the scent of lavender and impending doom. <words>20</words>
<words>20</words>
The hush where hope takes root had settled, a time when the sun dipped below the cloud sea, painting the sky in hues of bruised plum and hesitant apricot. <words>36</words>
<words>36</words>
Hiro, hypnotically rigid with anxiety, clutched a cracked monocle, a relic from his disgraced father. <words>45</words>
<words>45</words>
He was here to unmask a pretender to the throne, a charlatan who’d wormed his way into power with honeyed words and forged lineage. <words>59</words>
<words>59</words>
The pretender, a portly man named Bartholomew, was currently enjoying a seaweed wrap in the spa’s “Rejuvenation Chamber.” <words>70</words>
<words>70</words>
Hiro’s method was… unconventional. <words>72</words>
<words>72</words>
Bartholomew, it turned out, had a penchant for cryptic tattoos, each supposedly a symbol of his royal heritage. <words>83</words>
<words>83</words>
Hiro, however, suspected they were elaborate lies, inked by a con artist in a back alley tavern. <words>93</words>
<words>93</words>
His plan involved yarn. <words>95</words>
<words>95</words>
Specifically, by unraveling the tattoos. <words>98</words>
<words>98</words>
He’d discovered, through painstaking research (and a rather embarrassing incident involving a sheep and a particularly strong gust of wind), that the tattoos were not inked, but meticulously embroidered onto Bartholomew’s skin with enchanted yarn. <words>130</words>
<words>130</words>
Hiro had procured a special solvent disguised as massage oil, and a tiny, exquisitely crafted pair of silver scissors. <words>142</words>
<words>142</words>
He planned to infiltrate the Rejuvenation Chamber, apply the solvent, and delicately snip a loose end of Bartholomew’s most prominent tattoo – a snarling griffin supposedly representing the royal crest. <words>164</words>
<words>164</words>
The humorous unease churning in Hiro’s stomach intensified as a spa attendant, radiating serene menace, offered him a cucumber-infused water. <words>178</words>
<words>178</words>
“Relax, honored guest,” she whispered, her smile unwavering. <words>183</words>
<words>183</words>
“Tension is the enemy of rejuvenation.” <words>186</words>
<words>186</words>
Hiro accepted the water, his hand trembling slightly. <words>190</words>
<words>190</words>
He adjusted the cracked monocle, a wave of guilt washing over him. <words>197</words>
<words>197</words>
His father, stripped of his honor and title, had always believed in Bartholomew’s legitimacy. <words>207</words>
<words>207</words>
What if he was wrong? <words>209</words>
<words>209</words>
What if he was perpetuating his father’s disgrace? <words>214</words>
<words>214</words>
But then, he saw Bartholomew emerge from the Rejuvenation Chamber, his skin glistening with oils, the griffin tattoo proudly displayed on his ample bicep. <words>230</words>
<words>230</words>
The sheer audacity of the man, the casual flaunting of his fabricated heritage, solidified Hiro’s resolve. <words>241</words>
<words>241</words>
He took a deep breath, the lavender scent suddenly less calming, more like a battle cry. <words>250</words>
<words>250</words>
He was freed by the kindness his father had shown him, even in disgrace, the kindness that fueled his desire for justice. <words>264</words>
<words>264</words>
He would unravel this charade, one thread at a time. <words>270</words>
<words>270</words>
He slipped past the attendant, the silver scissors glinting in his palm. <words>277</words>
<words>277</words>
The hush where hope takes root was about to be broken. <words>284</words>
