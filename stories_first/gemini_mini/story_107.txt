Bartholomew Buttons, former host of "Wheel of Misfortune," strangely always found himself sweating, even in the shade of the giant palm leaves. <words>17</words>
The insect symphony hall, usually abuzz with a frenetic rhythm, was strangely quiet this evening. <words>28</words>
When the old typewriter’s keys finally go silent, Bartholomew knew his time was up. <words>37</words>
He had to act. <words>39</words>
He had to rescue the sacred knowledge. <words>43</words>
The knowledge hidden within the fortune-teller’s crystal ball he’d salvaged from the wreckage. <words>53</words>

Bartholomew’s motivation, a bitter honey mixture of desperation and duty, gnawed at him. <words>62</words>
He’d been stranded on this island for months, ever since his game show was sabotaged by a rival host. <words>74</words>
A sudden illness, conveniently timed just before his flight, had led him to meet a helpful stranger in the airport lounge. <words>88</words>
The stranger, overly solicitous, had offered him a “vitamin-infused” beverage. <words>96</words>
Bartholomew, ever the trusting soul, had accepted. <words>101</words>
The next thing he knew, he was waking up on this godforsaken beach. <words>110</words>

The crystal ball, strangely always cool to the touch, pulsed with a faint inner light. <words>119</words>
It contained the prophecies of Madame Evangeline, his great-aunt, a woman whose wisdom had been ridiculed by the world. <words>132</words>
Now, her words were Bartholomew’s only hope. <words>137</words>
He believed the prophecies held the key to a gentle overturn, a subtle shift in the world’s power dynamics that would expose the corruption he’d witnessed in the entertainment industry. <words>158</words>
He’d been using the old typewriter, salvaged from the same wreckage as the crystal ball, to transcribe them. <words>170</words>

But the typewriter ribbon was gone. <words>174</words>
And the insect symphony hall’s silence was a bad omen. <words>181</words>
He felt a prickling fear. <words>185</words>
He picked up the crystal ball, its weight strangely always comforting. <words>193</words>
He looked into its depths, the swirling mists revealing nothing. <words>200</words>
Then, a flicker. <words>202</words>
A face. <words>204</words>
The helpful stranger. <words>207</words>

The stranger smiled, a bitter honey smile that sent a chill down Bartholomew’s spine. <words>217</words>
He knew then. <words>219</words>
The sabotage hadn’t been about the game show. <words>225</words>
It had been about this. <words>228</words>
About silencing Madame Evangeline’s prophecies. <words>233</words>
About preventing the gentle overturn. <words>237</words>

Bartholomew, strangely always optimistic, felt a surge of defiance. <words>245</words>
He wouldn’t let them win. <words>248</words>
He would find another way. <words>252</words>
He would protect the sacred knowledge, even if it was the last thing he did. <words>262</words>
The insect symphony hall remained silent, a stark contrast to the storm brewing within him. <words>273</words>
When the old typewriter’s keys finally go silent, a new chapter begins. <words>281</words>
He clutched the crystal ball, a bitter honey resolve hardening his gaze. <words>290</words>
The game, he realized, was far from over. <words>297</words>
He would find a way to make his voice heard, even from this deserted island. <words>308</words>
He would ensure the gentle overturn, no matter the cost. <words>316</words>
The silence of the insect symphony hall was broken by a single, defiant cricket chirp. <words>328</words>
Bartholomew smiled. <words>330</words>
He wasn't alone. <words>333</words>
The game was on. <words>336</words>
