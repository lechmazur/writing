Father Michael, a rattled exorcist more accustomed to screaming demons than hushed whispers, clutched a vintage postcard depicting a sun-drenched Italian piazza. <words>20</words>
He felt a tremor in his hand, a phantom echo of the violent expulsions he’d recently performed. <words>30</words>
Amid the rhythmic thump of salsa music emanating from the adjacent dance studio, he found himself in the sterile, dimly lit library of the psychic research facility, a place he’d hoped would offer solace, not another enigma. <words>54</words>
His motivation, to entwine science with wonder, seemed increasingly naive within these austere walls. <words>64</words>
The postcard, a seemingly innocuous souvenir, was the first piece of a series of puzzles that unlocked a hidden room, a room rumored to hold answers to questions he hadn't even dared to articulate. <words>88</words>
Inwardly social, Father Michael craved connection, a shared understanding of the strange phenomena he witnessed, but years of guarded disclosures had built walls around him thicker than any possessed entity could conjure. <words>114</words>
He traced the faded ink of the postcard, a coy aggression simmering beneath his forced calm. <words>123</words>
The postcard’s message, a jumble of seemingly random letters and numbers, hinted at a deeper meaning. <words>133</words>
He needed to synthesize the information, to decipher the code. <words>139</words>
The dance lessons next door, a vibrant pulse of life against the sterile backdrop of the facility, served as a strange counterpoint to his intellectual struggle. <words>154</words>
He glanced at the clock, the rhythmic tick a metronome against the salsa beat. <words>161</words>
Time was running out. <words>164</words>
He recognized the number sequence on the postcard as coordinates, but coordinates for what? <words>173</words>
He pulled out a map of the facility, his fingers tracing the lines of the floorplan. <words>181</words>
The coordinates pointed to a blank wall in the library, a wall he’d dismissed as unremarkable. <words>190</words>
He pressed his ear against the cool plaster, listening for any hollow resonance. <words>198</words>
Nothing. <words>199</words>
He returned to the postcard, turning it over and over in his hands. <words>206</words>
The Italian piazza, bathed in sunlight, mocked his sterile surroundings. <words>213</words>
He noticed a faint inscription on the back, almost invisible to the naked eye. <words>221</words>
“Dance with the shadows,” it read. <words>225</words>
The salsa music swelled, a crescendo of trumpets and drums. <words>231</words>
He looked at the wall again, the shadows cast by the flickering fluorescent lights dancing across its surface. <words>241</words>
He realized the shadows themselves were the key. <words>246</words>
The inscription wasn't a metaphor, it was an instruction. <words>252</words>
He needed to synthesize the shadows with the coordinates. <words>258</words>
He held the postcard up to the wall, aligning the piazza's central fountain with the coordinates. <words>267</words>
The shadows cast by the postcard, mimicking the shapes of the buildings in the piazza, fell upon the wall, revealing a hidden pattern. <words>280</words>
A series of symbols emerged from the interplay of light and shadow. <words>287</words>
He traced the symbols with his finger, feeling a click as a hidden mechanism disengaged. <words>296</words>
A section of the wall slid open, revealing the hidden room. <words>302</words>
He stepped inside, the salsa music fading behind him as the door clicked shut. <words>310</words>
He was alone, surrounded by the hushed whispers of secrets waiting to be unveiled. <words>318</words>
The coy aggression he’d carried with him transformed into a quiet awe. <words>326</words>
He was finally ready to face the wonder, to bridge the gap between science and the supernatural. <words>336</words>
The guarded disclosures of the past were behind him. <words>342</words>
He was ready to synthesize the truth. <words>346</words>
The hidden room, bathed in an ethereal glow, promised answers, but also, perhaps, even more profound mysteries. <words>358</words>
He took a deep breath, the scent of old parchment and dust filling his lungs. <words>366</words>
The dance lessons continued next door, oblivious to the revelations unfolding within the hidden room. <words>376</words>
Father Michael, the rattled exorcist, was no longer rattled. <words>382</words>
He was a seeker, an explorer, ready to embrace the unknown. <words>389</words>
He was finally home. <words>392</words>
