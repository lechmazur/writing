The apathetic summoner, enthusiastically lazy, stretched out on the worn leather couch of the shared dream recording studio. <words>14</words>
The air hummed with the residual energy of creation, a faint echo after the last breath of a dying god. <words>26</words>
His motivation, a surprisingly sharp point in his otherwise blunted existence, was to rebuild the coral reefs, bleached white and brittle in the waking world. <words>45</words>
He knew, with a certainty that flowed like the river wisdom he sought, that the answer lay somewhere within this dream-space. <words>59</words>
He rose, with the deliberate slowness of someone conserving energy for a truly monumental task, and approached a row of empty frames hanging in a deserted hall. <words>77</words>
These frames, he sensed, were the key. <words>81</words>
He unfolded a dusty, rustic coffee grinder, its wooden handle smooth with age. <words>89</words>
It wasn't for grinding beans, not here. <words>93</words>
This was a tool for grinding reality, for sifting through the remnants of the god's dream and finding the seeds of creation. <words>109</words>
He placed the grinder beneath the first frame, its emptiness a stark canvas against the swirling dream residue. <words>120</words>
He cranked the handle, the gears groaning in protest, and the frame began to fill with an image: a single polyp, vibrant and alive. <words>132</words>
He moved to the next frame, repeating the process. <words>137</words>
Another turn of the handle, another image unfolded: a school of fish darting through a vibrant reef. <words>147</words>
Frame by frame, he ground through the dream, matching the empty frames with images of thriving coral, of teeming life. <words>159</words>
The gentle sharpness of his focus, a surprising counterpoint to his usual apathy, propelled him forward. <words>170</words>
He wasn't simply observing these images; he was weaving them, connecting them, building a new reality within the dream. <words>183</words>
The river wisdom flowed through him, guiding his hand, whispering the secrets of creation. <words>192</words>
He understood now. <words>194</words>
The dying god's dream was a source, a wellspring of potential. <words>201</words>
By matching the empty frames, he wasn't just creating images; he was channeling the god's residual energy, focusing it, shaping it. <words>217</words>
He was, in his own enthusiastically lazy way, rebuilding the reefs, not in the physical world, but in the foundational layer of reality, the dream from which all things sprung. <words>238</words>
As he filled the last frame, a sense of completion washed over him. <words>246</words>
The deserted hall was now a vibrant gallery, a testament to his unlikely act of creation. <words>256</words>
He knew, with the quiet certainty of the river wisdom, that this new reality would bleed into the waking world, slowly but surely. <words>270</words>
The bleached coral would regain its color, the silent reefs would teem with life once more. <words>280</words>
He stretched, a slow, satisfied unfolding of limbs, and returned to the worn leather couch. <words>289</words>
His work was done, for now. <words>292</words>
The reefs were rebuilding, and he, the apathetic summoner, could rest, content in his enthusiastic laziness, knowing he had played his part in the grand, unfolding tapestry of existence. <words>317</words>
The rustic coffee grinder sat on the floor, a humble tool that had ground not beans, but reality itself. <words>329</words>
The shared dream recording studio, once a repository of fading echoes, now pulsed with the vibrant energy of new life. <words>342</words>
And somewhere, in the waking world, a single polyp, vibrant and alive, unfurled its tiny tentacles, a harbinger of the reef's return. <words>357</words>
The river wisdom flowed on, carrying the echoes of the dying god's dream, and the gentle sharpness of the summoner's unlikely act of creation, into the vast, unfolding ocean of existence. <words>381</words>
The summoner closed his eyes, a small smile playing on his lips. <words>388</words>
He was tired, but in a good way. <words>392</words>
The kind of tired that comes from enthusiastically lazy world-saving. <words>399</words>
