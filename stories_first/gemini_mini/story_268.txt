The abandoned waiting area was a mausoleum of faded upholstery and flickering fluorescent lights, a screaming silence punctuated only by the hum of Elias’s laptop. <words>20</words>
<words>20</words>
He was a subdued vigilante, his battles fought not in alleyways but during virtual calls, his weapon not a fist but a plain wooden bead he rolled between his fingers. <words>40</words>
<words>40</words>
The price of war, he knew, wasn’t always measured in blood and bodies, but in the subtle distortions of the human spirit, the cracks in the facade of normalcy. <words>59</words>
<words>59</words>
Tonight, his target was a politician known for his silver tongue and carefully crafted public image. <words>70</words>
<words>70</words>
Elias’s method was unorthodox: he tracked distortions in an antique funhouse mirror, a relic he’d found in the waiting area’s forgotten baggage claim. <words>88</words>
<words>88</words>
The mirror, somehow, reflected not just physical form but the inner landscape, the hidden anxieties and carefully suppressed truths. <words>103</words>
<words>103</words>
As the politician spoke on screen, extolling his virtues and lamenting the plight of the common man, Elias watched his reflection in the funhouse mirror. <words>122</words>
<words>122</words>
The image warped and twisted, the politician’s smile becoming a grotesque leer, his eyes widening into pools of avarice. <words>136</words>
<words>136</words>
Elias’s motivation was to master an ancient art, a form of psychological combat passed down through generations of his family. <words>150</words>
<words>150</words>
It was a delicate dance of subtle manipulation, a way to expose the lies hidden beneath layers of carefully constructed narratives. <words>166</words>
<words>166</words>
He began to flatter the politician, his voice a low, soothing murmur, artfully clumsy in its effusiveness. <words>179</words>
<words>179</words>
“Your dedication to public service is truly inspiring, sir,” he said, rolling the wooden bead between his thumb and forefinger. <words>192</words>
<words>192</words>
“A true beacon of hope in these troubled times.” <words>197</words>
<words>197</words>
In the mirror, the politician’s reflection preened, the distorted features softening slightly, the avarice replaced by a smug self-satisfaction. <words>214</words>
<words>214</words>
Elias continued, his words dripping with false sincerity, each compliment a carefully placed jab, designed to inflate the politician’s ego and expose his vulnerabilities. <words>234</words>
<words>234</words>
The screaming silence of the waiting area amplified the subtle shifts in the politician’s tone, the slight hesitations in his speech, the micro-expressions that flickered across his face. <words>256</words>
<words>256</words>
With each carefully crafted phrase, Elias peeled back another layer of the carefully constructed facade, revealing the raw, unvarnished truth beneath. <words>274</words>
<words>274</words>
The politician, blinded by his own vanity, became increasingly verbose, his pronouncements growing more grandiose, his lies more transparent. <words>290</words>
<words>290</words>
Elias watched, the wooden bead a steady rhythm against his skin, as the man’s carefully crafted image crumbled, revealing the hollow shell beneath. <words>308</words>
<words>308</words>
The funhouse mirror reflected the transformation, the grotesque caricature dissolving into a pathetic, almost pitiable figure. <words>323</words>
<words>323</words>
The price of war, Elias thought, wasn’t always paid in blood, but sometimes in the agonizing exposure of one’s own self-deception. <words>340</words>
<words>340</words>
He ended the call, the screaming silence of the abandoned waiting area pressing in on him, a constant reminder of the battles fought in the shadows, the quiet victories and the unseen scars. <words>364</words>
<words>364</words>
The plain wooden bead, warmed by his touch, felt heavy in his hand, a tangible symbol of the weight he carried, the burden of his artfully clumsy vigilantism. <words>385</words>
<words>385</words>
He closed his laptop, the screen reflecting the flickering fluorescent lights, a ghostly reminder of the distorted reflections he sought, the hidden truths he unearthed in the screaming silence of his virtual battlefield. <words>412</words>
