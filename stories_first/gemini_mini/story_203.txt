The exorcist, plagued by a stage fright so profound it bordered on paralysis, stared at the inheritance papers. <words>16</words>
Amid the scattered plastic limbs and torsos of half-assembled action figures, the legalese swam before his eyes. <words>29</words>
A legacy of lies, passed down through generations like a cursed heirloom, now rested in his trembling hands. <words>40</words>
He had to sculpt possibility from the ashes of “never,” but the weight of expectation threatened to submerge him. <words>52</words>
The orbital debris field, a graveyard of broken satellites and spent rocket stages, stretched out beyond the grimy workshop window, a stark reminder of humanity's failed aspirations. <words>72</words>
It was never usual to conduct an exorcism in a toy workshop, let alone one orbiting a dying star. <words>83</words>
But then again, nothing about his life, or this inheritance, had ever been usual. <words>91</words>
He picked up a pressed wildflower, a splash of vibrant purple against the grey of the legal document. <words>102</words>
His grandmother, the previous inheritor of the lies, had given it to him. <words>110</words>
"Find the truth in the silence," she had whispered, her voice a defiant hush against the cacophony of their lives. <words>122</words>
He closed his eyes, the scent of the dried petals filling his nostrils, a fragile memory in the sterile air of the workshop. <words>135</words>
The sound of a key turning in a lock echoed through the small space. <words>143</words>
By the sound of that key, he knew it was time. <words>150</words>
Time to confront the lies, to submerge himself in the murky depths of his family's history. <words>160</words>
He tucked the pressed wildflower into his pocket, a small beacon of hope against the encroaching darkness. <words>170</words>
The door hissed open, revealing a figure shrouded in shadows. <words>177</words>
The air crackled with an unseen energy, a defiant hush settling over the room. <words>185</words>
The figure stepped forward, its features slowly resolving into a familiar face, twisted by an ancient malice. <words>196</words>
It was the embodiment of the inherited lies, a parasitic entity that had fed on his family for generations. <words>208</words>
Fear, cold and sharp, threatened to paralyze him, to submerge him in the suffocating grip of stage fright. <words>220</words>
But the memory of his grandmother's words, the feel of the pressed wildflower against his chest, ignited a spark of defiance. <words>233</words>
He took a deep breath, the stale air of the workshop filling his lungs. <words>241</words>
Amid the scattered toy parts, in the shadow of orbital debris, he prepared to face the inherited lies. <words>252</words>
He would sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never," even if it meant confronting his deepest fears. <words>263</words>
The defiant hush deepened, the air thick with anticipation. <words>269</words>
He knew this exorcism, conducted amid toy assembly in the desolate expanse of orbital debris, would be anything but usual. <words>282</words>
He met the entity's gaze, his own eyes burning with a newfound resolve. <words>290</words>
He would not be submerged by fear. <words>294</words>
He would not let the lies win. <words>298</words>
He would break the cycle. <words>301</words>
By the sound of his own heart beating, a steady rhythm against the silence of space, he began the ritual. <words>315</words>
The words, ancient and powerful, flowed from his lips, a defiant hush against the encroaching darkness. <words>326</words>
He spoke of truth and resilience, of hope blooming in the most desolate of places. <words>336</words>
He spoke of the pressed wildflower, a symbol of enduring beauty amid the ruins. <words>345</words>
He spoke of sculpting possibility from the ashes of "never," a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit. <words>358</words>
And as he spoke, the entity began to tremble, its form flickering and distorting. <words>368</words>
The lies, confronted by truth, began to unravel. <words>373</words>
The exorcism, never usual, continued amid the scattered toys, under the watchful gaze of the orbital debris. <words>385</words>
The defiant hush held its breath, waiting for the dawn. <words>391</words>
