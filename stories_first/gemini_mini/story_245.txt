The irate smuggler, Jax, pounded the abandoned spaceport’s flight deck, each footfall echoing like a dying star. <words>14</words>
His breath, ragged and hot, fogged the cracked viewport, momentarily obscuring the rust-colored dunes stretching beyond. <words>26</words>
He wasn’t supposed to be jogging; smugglers didn't jog. <words>32</words>
They schemed, they calculated, they certainly didn't engage in such abstractly physical pursuits. <words>42</words>
But his heart, that traitorous organ, was in revolt. <words>48</words>
It demanded more than stolen cargo and close calls with patrol ships. <words>56</words>
It craved the rumored hidden waterfalls, whispered about in hushed tones in grimy cantinas. <words>67</words>
Jax cursed, the biting sincerity of his frustration echoing in the cavernous flight deck. <words>77</words>
He stopped, leaning heavily against a console riddled with bullet holes, a testament to the spaceport’s violent past. <words>90</words>
He pulled a single chopstick from his pocket, a memento from his last successful haul – a shipment of fine Corellian dining sets. <words>105</words>
He’d kept it, not for its practicality, but for its strange, almost ceremonial feel. <words>115</words>
Now, he used it to stir the lukewarm tea he carried in a dented thermos. <words>124</words>
He stared into the swirling leaves, searching for patterns, for some sign, some abstractly physical manifestation of the waterfalls’ location. <words>140</words>
He was memorializing his desire, etching it into the tea leaves, hoping the universe, in its infinite indifference, might take notice. <words>154</words>
“Stupid,” he muttered, the word hanging in the air like a lost transmission. <words>161</words>
He knew it was foolish, this ritual, this desperate attempt to find solace in the random dance of tea leaves. <words>175</words>
But the heart, once in revolt, rarely listened to reason. <words>182</words>
He saw a swirl, a sudden confluence of leaves that resembled a cascading stream. <words>191</words>
Hope, sharp and unexpected, pierced through his cynicism. <words>197</words>
He traced the pattern with the chopstick, memorizing its every curve and eddy. <words>206</words>
This was his map, his abstractly physical guide to the hidden waterfalls. <words>215</words>
He took another swig of tea, the bitter taste a stark contrast to the sweetness of his burgeoning hope. <words>228</words>
He resumed his jog, his pace quicker now, energized by the possibility, however slim, of finding the waterfalls. <words>241</words>
The flight deck stretched before him, a concrete expanse under a sky the color of bruised plums. <words>251</words>
He ran, not just to find the waterfalls, but to outrun the biting sincerity of his own despair. <words>263</words>
He ran to prove to his rebellious heart that even a smuggler, hardened by a life of cynicism and close calls, could still chase a dream, however abstractly physical it might be. <words>288</words>
He ran to memorialize, through the patterns in his tea leaves and the rhythm of his feet, the heart's enduring capacity for revolt. <words>304</words>
The single chopstick, tucked safely back in his pocket, felt like a talisman, a reminder of the hidden waterfalls and the hope they represented. <words>321</words>
He ran, the abandoned spaceport flight deck echoing with the sound of his footfalls, a testament to the heart's enduring, abstractly physical revolt. <words>338</words>
The rust-colored dunes shimmered in the distance, a promise of the unknown, a canvas upon which he would paint his own escape. <words>354</words>
He ran, driven by the biting sincerity of a heart that refused to be silenced, a heart that demanded more than the cold, hard reality of a smuggler's life. <words>377</words>
He ran, and in his run, he memorialized the revolt, the hope, the abstractly physical yearning for something more. <words>392</words>
He ran, and the universe, in its infinite indifference, seemed to finally take notice. <words>402</words>
