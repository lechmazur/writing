The stoic wanderer, mesmerizingly bland in his dust-coated cloak, arrived at the witch's familiar training ground just as the chalk dust of the final formula swirled into nothingness under the teacher's swift hand. <words>22</words>
He had followed a trail of nightmares, visions of twisted rituals and half-formed familiars, each one a breadcrumb leading him to this precise moment. <words>37</words>
The air crackled with residual magic, a brash tenderness clinging to the stones where moments before, monstrous forms had cavorted. <words>49</words>
He needed to archive these practices, to preserve the knowledge before it vanished completely, even if it meant imposing his will upon the secrecy of the witches. <words>63</words>
He knew the necessary lie he had to tell. <words>68</words>

He approached the teacher, his face an unreadable mask. <words>73</words>
"I seek apprenticeship," he said, his voice as flat and weathered as the abandoned cabin from which he'd salvaged the floorboard tucked beneath his arm. <words>88</words>
The teacher, a woman with eyes like chips of obsidian, raised a skeptical eyebrow. <words>96</words>
"The training is complete. <words>98</words>
There are no more apprentices to be taken." <words>102</words>

He held out the floorboard, its surface etched with symbols that mirrored, faintly, the erased formula. <words>112</words>
"This," he said, his voice gaining a sliver of something akin to passion, "is a fragment of a lost ritual. <words>122</words>
I believe your teachings can unlock its secrets." <words>126</words>
It was a lie, of course. <words>129</words>
The floorboard held no power, only the scent of decay and forgotten dreams. <words>137</words>
But it was a necessary lie, a key to infiltrate their ranks and record their vanishing art. <words>147</words>

The teacher's obsidian eyes narrowed, scrutinizing the board, then him. <words>154</words>
The brash tenderness in the air seemed to thrum, a silent interrogation. <words>161</words>
He met her gaze, his mesmerizing blandness a shield against her probing magic. <words>169</words>
Finally, a slow smile spread across her lips. <words>174</words>
"Perhaps," she said, her voice a low purr, "there is room for one more." <words>182</words>

He allowed himself the smallest of nods, a crack in his stoic facade. <words>189</words>
He had imposed himself upon their world, a silent observer disguised as a seeker. <words>198</words>
He would learn their secrets, archive their rituals, preserve the knowledge even as he knew, with a brash tenderness of his own, that he was betraying their trust. <words>218</words>
The necessary lies were a burden, but a necessary one. <words>224</words>
He would carry them, along with the floorboard, as he walked deeper into the heart of the witch's familiar training ground. <words>238</words>

The nightmares that had led him here were now his allies, whispers in the darkness guiding him through the labyrinth of arcane knowledge. <words>251</words>
He would become a shadow in their midst, a mesmerizingly bland chronicler of their brash, tender magic. <words>261</words>
He would preserve it all, even if it meant becoming a lie himself. <words>268</words>
The floorboard, a symbol of his deception, pressed against his side, a constant reminder of the necessary lies that paved his path. <words>282</words>
He was a stoic wanderer, an archivist of the forbidden, and he was finally where he needed to be. <words>293</words>
At the heart of the witch's familiar training ground, at the moment of erasure, he had found his purpose. <words>305</words>
And he would fulfill it, one meticulously documented lie at a time. <words>312</words>
The brash tenderness of the fading magic seemed to embrace him, a silent welcome to a world of secrets. <words>324</words>
He was home. <words>326</words>
