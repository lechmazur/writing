The wry caretaker, warmly aloof, sat among crates of plundered nebula silk and fossilized star-jelly in the space pirate ship’s cargo hold. <words>18</words>
The air, thick with the scent of cosmic dust and regret, vibrated with the insistent whine of an outdated phone’s dial tone. <words>31</words>
It was a sound that clawed at the edges of sanity, a constant reminder of conversations never had, paths not taken. <words>45</words>
He needed it to stop, to hush the endless “what if” siren song that echoed in the vast emptiness of space and his own soul. <words>59</words>
His motivation was simple: silence. <words>62</words>

He picked up a piece of chalk, its surface rough against his calloused fingertips. <words>70</words>
On the metallic wall of the cargo hold, he began to chart the paths of the clouds visible through a grimy porthole. <words>82</words>
Not the swirling nebulae outside, but the phantom clouds of memory, each one a potential past, a “what if” given form. <words>95</words>
He meticulously tracked their ephemeral journeys, the chalk leaving a faint white trail against the dull grey. <words>105</words>
This was his method, a strange ritual born of long solitude and the gnawing nature of time. <words>115</words>

As the dial tone sputtered and finally cut out, marking the timeframe of his endeavor, a strange stillness settled over the cargo hold. <words>129</words>
The silence, however, wasn’t peaceful. <words>132</words>
It was heavy, pregnant with the weight of unchosen possibilities. <words>138</words>
He stared at the chalk map, a tangled web of lines representing the infinite branches of time. <words>147</words>
A gentle harshness settled in his eyes, a reflection of the universe’s indifference to his meticulous record-keeping. <words>158</words>

He knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that these phantom clouds were just that – phantoms. <words>169</words>
The past was immutable, the future uncertain. <words>173</words>
Only the present, fleeting and fragile, held any real weight. <words>179</words>
And yet, he couldn’t resist the urge to map the unmappable, to chase the ghosts of what might have been. <words>190</words>

He touched a finger to one of the chalk lines, a path that represented a life where he hadn’t become a caretaker on a space pirate ship. <words>204</words>
A life where… what? <words>207</words>
The question hung in the air, unanswered. <words>211</words>
He closed his eyes, the image of that other life, tantalizingly close yet forever out of reach, flickering behind his eyelids. <words>224</words>

When he opened them again, the chalk dust was settling on the floor. <words>230</words>
The lines on the wall were gone. <words>234</words>
He, too, was gone. <words>237</words>
He had vanished, leaving behind only the faint scent of chalk and the lingering silence of a dead dial tone. <words>249</words>
He had followed one of the cloud paths, not into a different past, but into a different kind of nothing. <words>260</words>
A nothing where the siren song of “what if” was finally hushed, replaced by the vast, indifferent hum of the cosmos. <words>273</words>
The nature of time, he realized as he dissolved into the fabric of the universe, was not to be charted, but to be accepted. <words>286</words>
Or escaped. <words>288</words>
