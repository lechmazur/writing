Bartholomew, a small-time con artist unusually normal in appearance, sat on an overturned milk crate in the dilapidated barn, the dystopian farm’s designated story time area. <words>20</words>
The air hung thick with the smell of stale feed and despair. <words>26</words>
He clutched an empty tape dispenser, its hollowness a stark metaphor for the gnawing emptiness within him. <words>36</words>
Story time on the farm wasn't about fairy tales; it was about confessions, forced pronouncements of guilt and regret. <words>48</words>
But Bartholomew, driven by a mild fervor to taunt the jaws of defeat and grin, had a different plan. <words>58</words>

He cleared his throat, the sound echoing unnaturally in the cavernous space. <words>65</words>
“Tonight,” he announced, his voice steady despite the tremor in his hands, “I’ll be interrogating the ghosts of our past mistakes.” <words>77</words>
He held up the empty tape dispenser. <words>80</words>
“This,” he declared, “is our spectral communicator.” <words>84</words>
The other farmhands, weathered and worn, shifted uneasily. <words>89</words>

Bartholomew closed his eyes, feigning a deep trance. <words>94</words>
“Spirit of the Broken Plow,” he intoned, “why did you betray Farmer Giles’ trust?” <words>102</words>
He pressed the empty tape dispenser to his ear, listening intently. <words>108</words>
“It whispers,” he announced, his eyes still closed, “of a deep-seated desire for…comfort.” <words>116</words>
He paused, letting the word hang in the air. <words>120</words>
“The plow yearned for the soft embrace of the earth, not the harsh demands of labor.” <words>129</words>

He moved on, conjuring the ghosts of spoiled milk, withered crops, and even a runaway chicken, each interrogation revealing a yearning for comfort in some form. <words>146</words>
The lull of remorse, usually a heavy blanket during story time, began to lift. <words>154</words>
A strange sense of peace settled over the barn. <words>159</words>
Bartholomew, through his charade, had inadvertently offered solace. <words>164</words>
He wasn’t absolving their failures, but he was reframing them, offering a different perspective. <words>173</words>

He continued, his performance becoming less about taunting defeat and more about providing a strange, twisted form of comfort. <words>185</words>
He saw a flicker of something akin to a smile on the face of Old Man Hemlock, a man who hadn't smiled in years. <words>196</words>
Bartholomew felt a pang of something unfamiliar. <words>201</words>
Could it be… remorse? <words>204</words>
His own con, his own attempt to mock the system, had backfired, leaving him with a strange sense of responsibility. <words>216</words>

He finished his performance, placing the empty tape dispenser back on the crate. <words>223</words>
The silence that followed wasn't the usual oppressive silence of guilt, but a contemplative quiet. <words>232</words>
Bartholomew sat there, the lull of remorse washing over him, not as a taunt, but as a gentle wave. <words>242</words>
He had come to comfort himself by mocking others, but he ended up comforting them instead. <words>251</words>
The dystopian farm, for a brief moment, felt a little less dystopian. <words>258</words>
And Bartholomew, the unusually normal con artist, felt a little less empty. <words>265</words>
