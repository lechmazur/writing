The astute hermit, Bartholomew, sniffed the air, a strangely effective method he'd developed over the years to amplify his awareness of the cavern cathedral's rhythms. <words>18</words>
<words>18</words>
The phosphorescent flora pulsed with a sickly green light, mirroring the despair in his heart. <words>27</words>
<words>27</words>
At the moment an elevator arrived to an empty floor, a dull *ding* echoing through the vast space, Bartholomew knew it was time. <words>41</words>
<words>41</words>
Time to face the rusted machinery, the broken pipes, the monumental task of restoring the water systems. <words>52</words>
<words>52</words>
"Right on schedule," he muttered, his voice raspy from disuse, the humor despairing. <words>60</words>
<words>60</words>
He clutched the blunt scissor, his only tool, a pathetic symbol of his isolation. <words>69</words>
<words>69</words>
The scissor wouldn't cut metal, of course, but it served as a strangely effective talisman, a reminder of the world above, a world he'd abandoned long ago. <words>88</words>
<words>88</words>
Bartholomew had retreated to the cavern cathedral after the Great Drying, when the surface world became uninhabitable. <words>99</words>
<words>99</words>
The impact of isolation had warped him, twisted his priorities, made him believe that restoring water to a deserted cathedral was a meaningful endeavor. <words>116</words>
<words>116</words>
He'd convinced himself that if he could just get the fountains flowing again, the cavern would bloom anew, and perhaps, just perhaps, he wouldn't feel so utterly alone. <words>136</words>
<words>136</words>
The scent of a fresh loaf of bread, phantom, imagined, wafted through the air, a cruel trick of his deteriorating mind. <words>149</words>
<words>149</words>
He used this imagined scent, via its evocative power, to amplify his resolve, a desperate attempt to conjure motivation from the ether. <words>163</words>
<words>163</words>
The bread, a symbol of community, of shared meals, of a life he no longer had, mocked him with its absence. <words>176</words>
<words>176</words>
He stepped into the elevator, the blunt scissor clutched tight in his hand. <words>184</words>
<words>184</words>
The doors slid closed, plunging him into darkness. <words>189</words>
<words>189</words>
He imagined the scent of bread intensifying, filling the small metal box, a bittersweet symphony of hope and despair. <words>202</words>
<words>202</words>
He knew, deep down, that the water systems were beyond repair, that his efforts were futile. <words>212</words>
<words>212</words>
But the impact of isolation had eroded his sense of reality, leaving him clinging to the smallest sliver of purpose. <words>226</words>
<words>226</words>
The elevator lurched downwards, carrying him deeper into the cavern, deeper into his self-imposed exile. <words>237</words>
<words>237</words>
He closed his eyes, inhaled deeply, and focused on the phantom scent of bread, letting it amplify his delusion, his strangely effective coping mechanism in this desolate, phosphorescent world. <words>260</words>
<words>260</words>
He chuckled, a dry, rasping sound that echoed in the confined space. <words>268</words>
<words>268</words>
"Fresh bread," he whispered, the despairing humor clinging to his words like the scent itself. <words>278</words>
<words>278</words>
"Just like Mom used to make." <words>281</words>
<words>281</words>
The elevator shuddered to a halt. <words>285</words>
<words>285</words>
The doors slid open, revealing the flooded engine room, the source of his Sisyphean task. <words>294</words>
<words>294</words>
Bartholomew stepped out, blunt scissor held aloft like a holy relic, ready to face the impossible, fueled by the ghost of a loaf and the crushing weight of his solitude. <words>316</words>
<words>316</words>
The phosphorescent flora cast long, eerie shadows, dancing on the waterlogged floor, a silent audience to his lonely struggle. <words>330</words>
<words>330</words>
He knew, with a chilling certainty, that even if he somehow managed to restore the water, it wouldn't change a thing. <words>344</words>
<words>344</words>
The emptiness within him, the gaping void carved by isolation, would remain. <words>352</words>
<words>352</words>
But in this cavern cathedral, at the bottom of this empty elevator shaft, with only a blunt scissor and the phantom scent of bread for company, he had found a strange, sad, and strangely effective way to survive. <words>380</words>
<words>380</words>
He had found a way to amplify the faintest flicker of hope in the face of utter despair. <words>391</words>
<words>391</words>
And for Bartholomew, the astute hermit, that was enough.
