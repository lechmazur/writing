<story>In the abandoned space freighter docking bay, an unsteady sentinel stood guard, his eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of movement. <words>20</words> The air was thick with the cheerless ecstasy of impending doom, a sensation that clung to the walls like a forgotten memory. <words>37</words> Between worlds colliding, time seemed to stretch and contract, leaving the sentinel in a perpetual state of unease. <words>52</words> His mission was clear: to clear the fog of a misguided prophecy that had led him to this desolate place. <words>68</words> 

In his hands, he held a strange automaton bird, its metal feathers glinting under the dim lights. <words>82</words> The bird was his only companion, a mechanical marvel that had been left behind by the ship's previous occupants. <words>98</words> It was coyly furious, its gears whirring with a life of their own, as if aware of the fate that awaited them both. <words>117</words>
