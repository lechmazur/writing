<story>In the floating rock monastery, where silence was a sacred hymn, a tired swordsman sat alone in the quiet breakroom, contemplating the resignation of a fellow monk. <words>23</words> His eyes, shadowed by years of battles and burdens, drifted to a plain cloth bag resting beside him. <words>38</words> It was unremarkable, yet it held the weight of a promise he had made to himself long ago. <words>54</words> The swordsman, fiercely apathetic to the world’s chaos, found solace in the simplicity of his vow. <words>68</words> He had promised to overcome his weariness, not through grand gestures, but by following the meteor showers that graced the night sky. <words>88</words>

As he sat in the breakroom, the resignation of his colleague echoed in his mind, a testament to the monastery’s quiet demands. <words>151</words> Yet, he understood that the monk’s departure was not a failure, but a personal triumph, a decision to seek a different path. <words>168</words> This realization fueled his own resolve to keep his hidden promise, to find strength in the simple act of watching the stars fall. <words>186</words>
