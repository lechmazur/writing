In a world where everything was archived on social networks, Elara's craft seemed anachronistic, yet it was this very anachronism that gave her purpose. <words>148</words> The social network archive was a digital tapestry of lives lived, yet it lacked the depth and vibrancy that Elara's paints could capture. <words>172</words> Her motivation was clear: to preserve these ancient practices, to ensure that the stories of the past were not lost in the digital ether. <words>199</words>
