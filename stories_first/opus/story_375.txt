<story>
Lena was a smiling saboteur, her anger masked beneath a veneer of tranquility as she made her way through the abandoned radio tower city suspended precariously over the yawning chasm of Blackrock Gorge. <words>32</words> Her scuffed flashlight illuminated the corroded metal walkways and dilapidated towers with an eerie glow, casting long shadows that seemed to reach out like grasping claws. <words>57</words> Lena was on a mission to channel the wrath of Antares, the red supergiant star whose rage burned cold and implacable in the night sky above. <words>82</words>

Throughout her years of studying the arcane arts, Lena had learned the secret to harnessing the power of the stars themselves. <words>103</words> An ancient tome, long sought and dearly bought, had revealed to her a ritual that could unleash the stellar fury to raze the corrupt city and its wicked denizens. <words>131</words> The key to the ritual, it was whispered, lay in a set of antique store mannequins rumored to speak in the dead of night, their wooden lips exhaling secrets and incantations. <words>161</words>

Lena made her way to the central spire where the mannequins stood in a circle, their blank faces seeming to stare through her. <words>185</words> As the starlight fell upon them at the stroke of midnight, the mannequins began to chant in eerie unison, their voices dry and hollow. <words>211</words> Lena listened intently, transcribing the incantation and committing it to memory as the ritual required. <words>228</words>

With the words of power obtained, Lena set about her work, painting eldritch sigils on the mannequins and tower walls with a mix of ash and blood. <words>254</words> As she progressed through the ritual, the air grew heavy and the wind began to howl through the gorge. <words>275</words> Antares pulsed a deep crimson, its wrath seeping into the world below. <words>288</words>

When the final word was spoken, the stellar power surged through Lena into the mannequins, ancient wood bursting into searing flame. <words>309</words> Cleansing fire spread from the central spire, leaping between towers and walkways, an inferno of purification. <words>326</words> The city, with all its corruption and cruelty, its grime and its gilt, burned away until only ashes remained. <words>347</words>

And amidst the embers and the dust, Lena found a strange peace in the beauty of the devastation, the wiping clean of the slate, the chance for something new to arise from the ruin. <words>384</words> Her anger was sated and her smile was genuine as she looked to the star-speckled sky, the imperfections of the world burned away for a time. <words>414</words>
