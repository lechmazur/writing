Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
Agent Woolworth sheepishly crept through the darkened halls of the pattern recognition center, his stained glass lamp casting a kaleidoscope of colors on the walls. <words>25</words> He was an analytically creative spy, always finding novel ways to complete his missions, but this one would require him to unite his team through forgotten promises made long ago. <words>54</words> It was naptime at the facility, which provided just the opportunity he needed to charm a monster from the depths and foil the villains' nefarious plot. <words>79</words>

As he made his way to the central control room, Woolworth reflected on how his hopes had evolved over his years of service, from naively patriotic to jaded and cynical, and now to a place of earnest mockery - he still believed in the cause, but recognized the absurdity of it all. <words>119</words> Approaching the massive sealed door, he input the secret access codes obtained by his clever hacking, and the portal swung open with a hydraulic hiss. <words>144</words>

Inside, a pulsing tangle of tubes and wires converged on a central tank of bubbling green fluid, within which floated the dark silhouette of a mysterious creature. <words>171</words> Woolworth knew this abomination, code-named "Tessera", had been engineered by enemy agents to sow chaos through subconscious pattern manipulation, and it was his team's sworn duty to stop it. <words>202</words>

"Rise and shine, beastie," Woolworth declared with a smirk as he affixed C4 charges to the tank. "Your pattern of destruction ends today." <words>225</words>

Just then, alarm klaxons began blaring as the facility's security systems detected the intrusion. <words>238</words> Woolworth spun around to see his fellow agents burst into the room, ready for action. <words>252</words>  

"Took you lot long enough!" Woolworth called out. "Let's blow this abomination back to the depths and be home in time for tea and medals, what do you say?" <words>282</words>

The other spies shared a determined nod, remembering the promises that had brought them together as a team, united in purpose. <words>300</words> Quickly planting the remaining explosives and synchronizing their detonators, they dashed out of the control room just as security robots were closing in. <words>322</words>

With a resounding boom and a shockwave that knocked them off their feet, the charges exploded, vaporizing Tessera and its tank in a conflagration of glass, metal, and neon ichor. <words>351</words> Alarms wailed and sprinklers doused the flames as the agents picked themselves up, dusting off their singed suits. <words>368</words>

"Smashing work, team!" Woolworth declared, flashing a roguish grin. "Let's scarper before the mop-up crews arrive and steal our thunder. Drinks are on me!" <words>393</words>

And with that, the spies made their daring escape, another crisis averted, hopes restored, and promises kept. <words>409</words>
