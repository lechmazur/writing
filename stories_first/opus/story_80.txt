Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
Zara was a daring pathfinder, ingeniously clueless about the true nature of her quest. <words>14</words> She had been tasked with finding the last fragment, a mythical artifact said to answer a riddle older than time itself. <words>35</words> Her search led her to investigate bizarre housekeeping logs in haunted inns across the land, each visit eroding her grip on reality bit by bit. <words>60</words>

Amid page turns of a moldering guestbook in a particularly dilapidated inn, a strange pattern began to emerge, tugging at her mind with quiet mania. <words>84</words> Scrawled in the margins were cryptic references to an "abandoned roller coaster track" and something hidden there. <words>101</words> Could this be the key to locating the elusive last fragment? <words>113</words>

Zara set out at once, driven by obsessive purpose. <words>123</words> The derelict amusement park soon loomed before her, a decaying monument to forgotten thrills. <words>138</words> She clambered up the rickety wooden supports of the roller coaster, rotted planks creaking precariously underfoot. <words>155</words>  At the summit, she spied an antique doorknob perched incongruously atop a coaster car, glinting in the fading light. <words>175</words>

Hands trembling, she grasped the knob and turned. <words>183</words> There was a click, and a hidden compartment sprung open in the car's dashboard. <words>197</words> Inside rested an ornate metal puzzle box, inscribed with runes that made her eyes ache. <words>212</words> This was it - the last fragment, the answer to the riddle that had consumed her.

As she worked feverishly to solve the puzzle, the pieces began to move of their own accord, sliding and shifting until the box cracked open with a sigh. <words>246</words> Ethereal light spilled forth, and suddenly, shockingly, Zara understood. <words>256</words>

The "last fragment" was no mere physical object. <words>264</words> It was the final piece of a spell woven long ago, an incantation to rend the veil between worlds. <words>283</words> By assembling it, she had unwittingly begun the ritual. <words>292</words> As the light engulfed her and the amusement park dissolved into an alien realm beyond comprehension, Zara realized with dawning horror that the riddle's answer was a cosmic joke with a terrible punchline. <words>326</words>

In her ingeniously clueless quest to find meaning, she had eroded the very boundaries that kept our reality intact. <words>345</words> The ritual was complete, the veil sundered, and Zara now stood as an eternal gatekeeper between realms, forever bound to the consequences of her curiosity. <words>373</words> Amid the page turns of history, her story would be forgotten, lost in the haunted annals she once so eagerly investigated. <words>400</words>
