<story>
Groggy brewer Elias stumbled through the haunted mansion graveyard, a piece of a broken mirror clutched in his hand. <words>20</words> The encroaching darkness pressed in from all sides, an inky void threatening to swallow him whole. <words>33</words> Elias was uniquely generic, just an average man, but in this moment he felt singled out by fate. <words>48</words>  

He had to initiate the ritual, and fast, before the darkness consumed everything. <words>60</words> The method was clear - he had to reach the room at the top of the mansion's tower, indicated by the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase. <words>82</words> Elias entered the decrepit manse, the sounds of the distant protest a mere whisper now, voices gathering again during a lull to shout their demands into a world that wouldn't listen. <words>110</words>

But Elias no longer cared about their trivial concerns. <words>118</words> He had a higher calling now, a need to transcend the mundane and become a living embodiment of his values. <words>135</words> With flippant solemnity, he ascended the spiral staircase, each creaking step a mocking reminder of his groggy, hung-over state. <words>153</words>  

At the top, he found the ritual chamber, a round room lined with guttering black candles and arcane symbols etched in chalk. <words>175</words> Elias approached the altar in the center and carefully positioned the broken mirror shard on it, his distorted reflection looking back at him. <words>196</words>

As he began chanting the eldritch words, the darkness outside seemed to take notice, swirling faster, closing in. <words>214</words> Elias felt it constricting him, crushing him, until he was on the verge of passing out. <words>229</words> But he pushed on, yelling the final words into the void. <words>240</words>

Suddenly, the pressure ceased. <words>244</words> The darkness coalesced into a single point, then shot forward, slamming into the mirror shard. <words>258</words> It shattered into countless pieces, each one absorbing a part of the darkness until it was all gone, sealed away. <words>278</words>

Elias breathed heavily, stunned but victorious. <words>284</words> He had done it - he had faced his inner demons, his flaws and vices, and bound them. <words>301</words> He was no longer just a groggy brewer - he was a living embodiment of determination, of the will to better himself and shape his own fate. <words>326</words>

With a final glance at the shattered mirror, now faintly glowing with captured shadows, Elias turned and descended the stairs, ready to return to the world and live up to his full potential at last, no matter how uniquely generic he appeared on the outside. <words>400</words>
