Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
The stoic wanderer arrived at the witch's familiar training ground, a floorboard from an abandoned cabin tucked under his arm. <words>20</words> He had followed a trail of nightmares to this place, at the precise moment a teacher wiped the final ritual formula away. <words>40</words> The wanderer's purpose was to archive these arcane practices before they were lost forever, even if it required telling necessary lies. <words>59</words>

He approached the teacher with a mesmerizingly bland expression, his weathered face betraying no emotion or intent. <words>74</words> "I've come to enroll in your next class," the wanderer stated, his rough voice tinged with a brash tenderness that felt out of place. <words>95</words> "I have much to learn about the familiar's path."

The teacher eyed him skeptically. <words>105</words> "The training is arduous and not for the faint of heart. What makes you think you're worthy?" <words>122</words>

The wanderer hefted the cabin floorboard. <words>128</words> "This talisman imbues me with the focus and fortitude required. It has served many masters on this journey." <words>146</words>

It was a necessary lie. <words>150</words> The floorboard held no power; he had pried it from the abandoned cabin three nights ago to serve as an improvised walking stick in the steep mountain passes. <words>176</words> But the wanderer knew he must use every advantage to impose his will here. <words>189</words>

The teacher shrugged. <words>191</words> "Very well. But you'll find no shortcuts or favoritism in my class. You'll earn your place like everyone else, splinter or no." <words>213</words>

Over the next moon, the wanderer applied himself to the familiar's craft, mastering rituals of bonding, scrying, and spell channeling. <words>230</words> While the other students slept, he furtively copied the ritual formulas into a small, coded notebook, preserving the knowledge for posterity. <words>249</words>

On the night before graduation, the wanderer dreamed of the abandoned cabin and a floorboard stained with blood. <words>265</words> He awoke knowing his mission was not yet complete. <words>274</words>

At the graduation ceremony, as the teacher presented the wanderer with his familiar's amulet, he knew what he must do. <words>292</words> "I'm sorry, but I cannot accept this," the wanderer said solemnly, his voice thick with brash tenderness. <words>309</words> "My path leads me elsewhere."

Ignoring the shocked murmurs, the wanderer turned and walked away from the training ground. <words>324</words> The amulet would have bound him to this place, but the cabin floorboard had shown him a different way. <words>342</words> The rituals had to be shared beyond these cloistered walls if the craft was to endure. <words>358</words>

The wanderer clutched his notebook of rituals and set off for the next abandoned cabin on his endless journey. <words>378</words> The necessary lies were a small price to pay for the vital knowledge he now carried. <words>394</words> With a final glance back, the stoic wanderer disappeared into the misty forest. <words>406</words>
