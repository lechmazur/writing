<story>
In the time after the last human dream was dreamt, an overzealous park ranger patrolled an urban orchard on a repurposed highway overpass, seeking to catch the echo of a goddess. <words>32</words> The orchard was a chaotic organization of trees and vines, with fluctuating harvests of familiarly unknown fruits. <words>50</words> Through chance encounters, the ranger discovered a plain notebook hidden among the foliage, filled with cryptic writings and sketches. <words>69</words>

As the ranger pored over the notebook's contents night after night, a story began to take shape - the story of the ranger's own grandmother and the secrets she had kept hidden away. <words>100</words> The grandmother, it seemed, had been the keeper of this orchard long ago, tending to the strange crops and communing with forgotten gods. <words>124</words> In her final days, wracked by visions, she had tried to pass on her knowledge, but her whispered words had been dismissed as delirium. <words>149</words>

Now, piece by piece, the ranger began to uncover the truth behind the grandmother's ramblings. <words>166</words> The orchard was a nexus, a thin place where the boundary between worlds wore thin, and the notebook was the key to unlocking its mysteries. <words>191</words> Night after night, guided by the notebook's cryptic clues, the ranger performed rituals among the trees, calling out to the lost goddess in words half-remembered from childhood. <words>220</words>

Slowly, the orchard began to change. <words>226</words> The fruits ripened into unrecognizable shapes and colors, pulsing with an inner light. <words>240</words> Strange constellations wheeled overhead, and the distant sounds of an otherworldly city echoed from the shadows between the trees. <words>261</words> The ranger's obsession grew, until the line between waking and dreaming blurred into insignificance. <words>277</words>

At last, on a night when the orchard's leaves shimmered like the scales of a vast serpent, the goddess answered the ranger's call. <words>301</words> She took many forms - a woman, a tree, a creature of fractured light - and though her words were alien, the ranger understood. <words>327</words> This was the secret the grandmother had tried to pass on, the burden and the blessing of communion with the divine. <words>350</words>

From that night forward, the ranger and the goddess walked the orchard together, two beings in one form, the notebook their guide and their gospel. <words>377</words> And though the world beyond the overpass had long since crumbled to dust, the orchard remained, a chaotic organization of unearthly delights, riotous and eternal. <words>405</words>
