<story>
Amid the dusty starlight filtering through the skylights of the found object museum, Eliza carefully prepared the poison, her innocently guilty conscience weighing on her like the cracked hilt of the elegant rapier displayed in the case beside her. <words>37</words> She had to authenticate her skills, to test the edges of gravity and her own moral code of instinct by leaving a trail of cryptic clues hidden in a scavenger hunt through the museum's eclectic exhibits. <words>74</words>

As she worked, the distant clatter of skateboards echoed from the street outside, a carefree counterpoint to her dark purpose. <words>91</words> The poison had to be strong enough to accomplish her task, but subtle enough to be overlooked by investigators. <words>109</words> Just like the objects filling the museum, it would be hidden in plain sight. <words>123</words>

Eliza reflected on what drove her to this point as she filled a delicate glass vial with the deadly tincture. <words>142</words> Betrayal, jealousy, a love turned bitter and rancid - these emotions propelled her now as much as the desire to prove her own cunning and skill. <words>167</words> The clues she would leave for her victim were her real masterpiece, an elegant web ensnaring them as inescapably as her poison. <words>191</words>

With a final glance at the rapier, its once gleaming blade now cracked and dull like her own tarnished spirit, Eliza slipped the vial into her pocket and exited the museum. <words>222</words> In the alley behind the building, skateboarders still wheeled and spun, blissfully unaware of the deadly game about to unfold. <words>241</words>

The first clue would be waiting in her victim's mailbox by morning, the initial thread that would lead them into her labyrinth. <words>262</words> Each step would bring them closer to their fate even as it revealed the depth of her own meticulous planning. <words>282</words>

Eliza melted into the city's shadows, a ghost amidst the neon and noise. <words>296</words> Her code of instinct had guided her true so far, but this final test would determine if she truly had the ruthlessness to join the ranks of history's great poisoners. <words>327</words>

The museum's collection would soon have a new exhibit, she mused, and her victim would take their place among the other lost and discarded objects, an anonymous memorial to her great work. <words>357</words> As the starlight mingled with the city's glow, Eliza disappeared into the night, the cracked rapier a reflection of her own fractured morality. <words>383</words>

Innocence and guilt blurred into one as she embarked on her grand hunt, the final authentication of her deadly art. <words>400</words>
