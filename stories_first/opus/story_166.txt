One particularly cold evening, the ghostly caretaker sat beneath a gnarled apple tree, carefully perusing the expedition logs by the light of a hovering lantern. <words>97</words> As he turned the brittle pages, a sudden gust of wind carried a plastic straw into the orchard, perforating the delicate balance of the sacred space. <words>124</words> The straw landed at the base of the apple tree, glowing with an eerie, unnatural light. <words>140</words>
