<story>
Amid drum circles in the forgotten city hall, the measured diplomat Zara clutched the fox tail tassel taken from a slain bandit, its organically synthetic fibers tickling her palm as she pondered the price of revenge. <words>35</words> Through the faint scent of must in the shuttered children's theater, she recalled how the brigand had murdered her family when she was but a child, an abrasive calm settling over her as she vowed to decode the genetic patterns that would lead her to the rest of his bloodthirsty clan. <words>91</words>

"A jest, milady?" inquired her aide Finn, eyeing the tassel. <words>100</words> "No," Zara replied coolly, "A reminder of debts unpaid and justice unserved." <words>112</words> She tucked the totem into her jacket and strode to the stage. <words>124</words> Addressing the restless crowd, Zara began, "Friends, I know well the bitter sting of loss, the unquenchable thirst for vengeance." <words>143</words> "But we cannot let our pain poison our purpose!" <words>153</words>

Murmurs rippled through the audience. <words>158</words> "The bandits grow bold, preying on our caravans, kidnapping our children." <words>169</words> "We must act!" someone cried. <words>174</words> "Yes," Zara agreed, "But not with the same savage cruelty they employ." <words>186</words> "We are better than that, bound by honor even if they have none." <words>199</words>

She produced the fox tail tassel, holding it aloft. <words>208</words> "This belonged to the bandit Kredd. I slew him, but others remain to threaten us." <words>223</words> The crowd gasped. <words>226</words> "Through ancient arts, I can use this to track his foul brethren to their lair." <words>241</words> "But I will offer them a choice - surrender to face justice, or meet their fate on the battlefield." <words>260</words>

Zara's gaze hardened. <words>263</words> "We will respond to their aggression, but need not lose our souls in the process." <words>278</words> "A measured response is still a firm one." <words>286</words> The people nodded slowly, seeing the wisdom in her words. <words>296</words>

"Now," Zara smiled slightly, "Let us plan our next move, balancing justice and mercy as best we can." <words>314</words> As the council convened, she fingered the tassel, knowing it would lead her to the rest of her family's killers. <words>333</words> She would decode its secrets and see this through. <words>342</words> But Zara vowed to cling to her humanity, even as she hunted those who had discarded their own. <words>360</words> For that was the true price of revenge - not coin or blood, but the cost to one's spirit. <words>379</words> And that was a toll the diplomat hoped never to pay. <words>390</words>
