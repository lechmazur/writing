<story>
In the moment when a puzzle piece finally fits, Elias the uptight scribe found himself standing in a witch's greenhouse clinging to a hill of gravestones, cradling a prototype light bulb from Tesla's workshop. <words>32</words> The quiet transformation that brought him to this strange place began when he discovered a mysterious envelope sealed with an unusual adhesive. <words>56</words> By analyzing the leftover adhesive from the once-sealed envelope using techniques of chromatography and spectroscopy, Elias traced it back to the witch's abode. <words>81</words>

With equal parts trepidation and curiosity, the certainly uncertain scribe approached the greenhouse door and turned the knob, which let out a bellow like a dying cow. <words>107</words> Inside, the air hung heavy with humidity and the cloying scent of exotic plants. <words>122</words> Elias nearly stumbled over the gnarled roots that twisted across the earthen floor. <words>136</words>

"Why have you come?" croaked a voice from the shadows, brittle as dried leaves. <words>151</words>
 
Elias stammered, "I...I found your envelope. <words>158</words> The adhesive - I've never seen its like before. <words>167</words> I had to know its origin and what secrets it held." <words>179</words>

The witch emerged into a shaft of sickly light, her long fingers wrapped around Tesla's prototype bulb. <words>196</words> "You're a clever one," she rasped, "but mere knowledge alone holds no power here. <words>212</words> Only those who cradle empathy in arms of steel may grasp what I protect." <words>228</words>

Elias's eyes widened as understanding dawned. <words>234</words> The witch was the keeper of lost and impossible things, driven to preserve the world's buried optimism from those who would exploit it. <words>257</words> In that moment, the scribe's uptight demeanor fell away, replaced by a sense of kinship with the witch's noble purpose. <words>278</words>

"Please," Elias whispered, "let me help you. <words>285</words> I too believe in safeguarding dreams and visions others would callously destroy or corrupt." <words>301</words>

A glimmer of surprise and appraisal flashed across the witch's weathered face. <words>314</words> Slowly, almost reluctantly, she held out the precious light bulb. <words>324</words> "Carry this flame of inspiration then, and nurture it. <words>333</words> But mark me - the burden is heavy and the way fraught with sorrow." <words>348</words>

Elias accepted it reverently, feeling the weight of the witch's trust and the fragile filament of hope he now guarded. <words>368</words> As he stepped back out into the eerie twilight of the graveyard, the scribe knew his life - and perhaps the world - would never be the same. <words>400</words>
