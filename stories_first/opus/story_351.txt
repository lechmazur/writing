Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
The dreamy poet stood in the disused railway station, overgrown with ivy, a brass sundial glinting in the fading light. <words>20</words> He held an unopened letter, studying the cryptic shapes embedded in the red wax seal, shapes that seemed to shift and dance before his eyes. <words>41</words> The shapes compelled him, tugging at his mind with a quietly intense insistence, as if the very paper was imbued with a strange and irresistible power. <words>64</words>

For months, the poet had been following a trail of riddles and clues, a formally rebellious quest that led him to forgotten places and enigmatic strangers, each encounter unraveling another layer in a delicate undoing of all he thought he knew. <words>97</words> Now, after the last riddle was solved, he found himself here, in this liminal space between past and present, between the rational world and something altogether more mysterious. <words>124</words>

With trembling fingers, he broke the seal and unfolded the letter. <words>135</words> The words within seemed to shimmer and transform, revealing not a message but a map, a guide to a hidden place where the unremembered lingered, waiting to have their stories told. <words>163</words> In that moment, the poet understood his true purpose - to stand as witness and chronicler for those who had been forgotten, to give voice to the voiceless and shape to the shapeless. <words>194</words>

As night fell, he followed the map deeper into the labyrinthine ruins of the old station, guided by the sundial's ancient face and the spectral glow of the rising moon. <words>223</words> With each step, the world seemed to fall away, replaced by a realm of shadows and whispers, where time itself bent to the will of lost and unfinished tales. <words>251</words>

In a chamber lit by the flicker of a thousand candles, the poet found them - the unremembered, the forgotten ones, their faces etched with sorrow and longing. <words>277</words> He sat among them, listening to their stories, weaving their words into verses that shimmered with the patina of ages. <words>297</words> As dawn approached, he sealed each poem with a fragment of wax from the original letter, a talisman to carry their tales out into the world. <words>323</words>

Emerging from the ruins, the poet blinked in the sunlight, the brass sundial now cool and silent in his hand. <words>343</words> The quest was complete, yet he knew it was only the beginning. <words>356</words> For the dreamy poet was now the keeper of stories, the guardian of the unremembered, his life and work forever entwined with the delicate undoing of silence and the rebellious act of remembrance. <words>400</words>
