Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
Lena was a quiet deserter, having fled the army after one too many senseless battles. <words>16</words> She found herself in a peculiar place, a plant communication study lab hidden deep in the forest. <words>34</words> The lab was filled with shattered porcelain masks, each one depicting a different emotion or persona. <words>50</words> Lena's task, assigned by the eccentric scientist who ran the lab, was to reconstruct stories and identities from the broken shards, piecing them together like jigsaw puzzles. <words>72</words>

As she worked, Lena gazed into a cracked mirror, seeing her fragmented reflection staring back - a metaphor for her own fractured sense of self and belonging. <words>95</words> She had always felt dizzyingly grounded, torn between the weight of reality and yearning to break free from the cycles that ensnared her. <words>116</words> With each mask she rebuilt, Lena felt the stories of these forgotten souls flow through her, tales of love and loss, triumph and tragedy. <words>139</words> In a strange way, through this act of reconstruction and storytelling, she began to reconstruct her own identity.

The days blurred together as Lena lost herself in the work, fingers nimbly fitting shards together, mind consumed by the narratives she wove. <words>168</words> She barely noticed as her own memories and emotions began to carbonize, gradually replaced by the hopes and dreams of the masks' original owners. <words>191</words> Lena came to realize that she had been desperately searching for a place to truly belong. <words>207</words> A place where she was not judged for her past, nor shackled by others' expectations. <words>222</words> A place where she could simply be herself - even if that self was an amalgamation of a hundred different stories. <words>243</words>

In a moment of noble foolishness, Lena decided she would find that place, even if it meant leaving everything behind once again. <words>264</words> This time, she would not be a deserter, but an explorer - setting out to craft an existence uniquely her own. <words>285</words> With a silent nod to the cracked mirror, Lena carefully wrapped the rebuilt masks in cloth and placed them in her satchel. <words>306</words> They would be her companions on this journey, reminders of all the lives she had touched and been touched by in turn. <words>329</words>

As dawn broke over the treetops, Lena stepped out of the lab and into the waiting forest, finally breaking the cycle that had held her captive for so long. <words>356</words> With each step, she left the quiet deserter behind, transforming herself into the author of her own story. <words>376</words> And though she knew not where her path might lead, Lena embraced the unknown, knowing that somewhere out there was a place where she truly belonged - even if it was nowhere at all. <words>409</words>
