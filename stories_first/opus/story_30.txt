Days turned into weeks as the ship navigated the treacherous, uncharted regions of space, guided only by the cryptic markings on the tapestry fragment. <words>235</words> Zephyr's crew, a motley assortment of space pirates and horticultural enthusiasts, worked tirelessly to maintain the vessel, their faith in their leader's vision unwavering. <words>258</words> Finally, as the ship emerged from a particularly perilous asteroid field, Arboreal appeared before them, a verdant jewel amid the inky blackness. <words>278</words>
