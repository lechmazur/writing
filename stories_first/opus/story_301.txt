Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
The philosopher sat in his study, a jazz age time capsule filled with antique books and curios, pondering the cosmic wonder of existence with a numb fascination. <words>27</words> He absentmindedly fiddled with a pair of worn gardening gloves, an incongruous sight against his tweed jacket and bow tie, as he contemplated how to impart his latest ethically questionable epiphany to an unsuspecting world. <words>61</words>

Through the window, he could see his neighbor Mrs. Ellington knitting on her porch, as she did every afternoon like clockwork. <words>81</words> The steady click-clack of her needles suddenly gave him a devious idea for how to disseminate his dangerous new philosophy in a way that would impair the masses' ability to resist its subversive message. <words>113</words>

He would encode his treatise in a series of cryptic symbols to be etched upon an oversized pewter mug - the perfect Trojan horse to infiltrate the morning tea routines of the bourgeoisie and slowly erode their staid conformist worldviews sip by sip. <words>155</words> The gloves protected his hands as he worked late into the night, carefully engraving his mug with an intricate pattern of swirls, dots and dashes that would appear as mere decoration to the untrained eye. <words>191</words>

As dawn broke, the philosopher ventured out, mug in hand, to Mrs. Ellington's porch. <words>206</words> "I thought you might enjoy this lovely vintage mug as a token of neighborly appreciation for your daily knitting vigils," he said with a disarming smile as he handed it to her. <words>236</words>

Little did she know, as she poured her morning Earl Grey, that she would be the first domino to fall to the philosopher's scheme. <words>260</words> Each day, as the warm brew steeped, the coded etchings activated, seeping revolutionary notions into her subconscious. <words>280</words> Gradually, almost imperceptibly at first, her knitting began to change - tight purl stitches gave way to loose, unraveling strands; staid doilies morphed into avant-garde abstractions. <words>311</words>

Soon, other ladies of the neighborhood took note of Mrs. Ellington's sudden shift and sought to emulate her daring new aesthetic by acquiring their own cryptic mugs from the peculiar philosopher next door. <words>347</words> Like a slow-spreading virus, his radical ideas infected household after household, as the cosmic wonder of a new paradigm took hold. <words>371</words>

The old expectations of the jazz age were unraveling one stitch at a time, as a mind-expanding revolution brewed in the most unassuming of vessels, aided by the most ordinary of accomplices. <words>400</words>
