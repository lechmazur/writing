Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
The baffled pickpocket crept into the haunted lighthouse's engine room, seeking respite between appointments. <words>14</words> In the dim light, an eerie ventriloquist dummy sat propped against the rusting machinery, its glassy eyes seeming to follow the thief's every move with a confusingly lucid gaze. <words>40</words> The pickpocket froze, unnerved by the uncanny figure. <words>47</words>

Suddenly, the dummy spoke, its wooden jaw clacking. <words>55</words> "Welcome, my light-fingered friend. I've been expecting you." <words>64</words>

The thief stammered. "H-how? What do you want with me?" <words>74</words>

"To teach you the art of transformation, of course. True change comes from within, not the trinkets you pilfer. Shall we begin?" <words>96</words>

Perplexed but intrigued, the pickpocket nodded. <words>102</words> The dummy's painted lips curled into a knowing smile. <words>111</words>

"Splendid. We'll start with poetry, the language of the soul. Speak your truth and let the metamorphosis unfold." <words>129</words>

With scorching poise, the dummy began to recite verses, its voice echoing through the engine room. <words>145</words> The pickpocket, caught in the spell, found himself responding in kind, the words flowing from some hidden wellspring within. <words>164</words>

Back and forth they traded stanzas, the thief's initial hesitation giving way to a strange exhilaration. <words>180</words> The poetry session stretched on, minutes blurring into hours, the outside world fading away. <words>194</words>

In that haunted space, something shifted inside the pickpocket. <words>203</words> His past misdeeds, once a source of pride, now felt hollow and meaningless. <words>216</words> The dummy's words had awakened a hunger for something more, a yearning to challenge the status quo of his own existence. <words>237</words>

As the final verse hung in the air, the pickpocket felt a profound sense of clarity, as if a veil had been lifted from his eyes. <words>261</words> He knew then that he could no longer sustain his life of petty crime. <words>275</words>

The dummy regarded him with approval. "You've taken the first step on a new path. Embrace the change, and let your words be your guide." <words>300</words>

With a nod of gratitude, the pickpocket turned to leave, his heart lighter than it had been in years. <words>319</words> As he stepped out into the world, he knew that he would never be the same. <words>336</words>

The art of transformation had claimed another willing student, and the haunted lighthouse stood sentinel, ready to welcome the next lost soul in need of its eerie wisdom. <words>362</words>

In the engine room, the ventriloquist dummy settled back into its resting place, a faint smile playing across its painted features, content in the knowledge that its work was far from finished. <words>400</words>
