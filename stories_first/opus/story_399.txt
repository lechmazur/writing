<story>
Grunthark the crypt caretaker scowled as he entered the witch's crystal scrying room, an unmarked cardboard tube clutched in his gnarled hand. <words>22</words> The importance of trauma weighed heavily on his mind as he approached the intricate sand mandala in the center of the chamber. <words>41</words> Its multiply singular pattern seemed to shift and dance in the flickering candlelight, as if alive with hidden meaning. <words>57</words>

Throughout stargazing the previous night, Grunthark had divined an impending uprising within the crypt, led by the restless spirits he was sworn to contain. <words>79</words> With a heavy sigh, he knelt before the mandala and began to jiggle the cardboard tube, grandiose subtlety in his movements. <words>98</words> A fine mist of enchanted powder sprinkled onto the delicate sand pattern, causing it to shimmer and glow with an otherworldly aura. <words>119</words>

As Grunthark peered deeper into the morphing sand designs, visions of the looming spectral rebellion played out before his eyes. <words>137</words> The spirits, enraged by centuries of confinement and longing for the world of the living, had grown strong enough to challenge his guardianship. <words>159</words> Their ghostly forms swirled and raged within the scrying mandala, a maelstrom of ectoplasmic fury threatening to burst free from the crypt's ancient walls. <words>182</words>

Grunthark knew he had to act fast to quell the uprising within, lest the spirits escape and wreak havoc upon the unsuspecting mortal realm. <words>205</words> With a heavy heart, he reached into the cardboard tube and withdrew a pinch of sacred ash, a powerful relic imbued with the essence of long-forgotten gods. <words>231</words> Whispering an arcane incantation, he sprinkled the ash over the agitated sand mandala, watching as it absorbed into the intricate patterns like ink into parchment. <words>255</words>

The scrying room fell silent as the mandala's glow intensified, pulsing with an ancient rhythm that resonated deep within Grunthark's weary soul. <words>276</words> Slowly, the visions of ghostly rebellion faded, replaced by scenes of spectral figures returning to their eternal rest, their rage and resentment dissipating like mist in the morning sun. <words>304</words>

With a grunt of satisfaction, Grunthark rose to his feet, the empty cardboard tube dangling from his fingers. <words>322</words> He had succeeded in his duty, the importance of trauma once again laid to rest within the crypt's hallowed walls. <words>343</words> As he turned to leave the scrying room, Grunthark couldn't help but feel a twinge of sympathy for the spirits he guarded, forever trapped by the weight of their own unresolved pain. <words>375</words> But such was the burden of a crypt caretaker, forever tasked with maintaining the delicate balance between the living and the dead. <words>400</words>
