Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
Zane, a shaky mercenary with a carefully reckless demeanor, stepped into the collapsed cathedral turned street artist's haven, his boots crunching on scattered debris. <words>24</words> He was searching for something unknown, following a trail of improbable rumor chains that led him to this decrepit sanctuary during the slow fade of an echoing hour before twilight. <words>50</words> Zane needed to make peace with his past, and the whispers spoke of an artist here who could help him do just that - though the specifics were hazy, as rumors often are. <words>80</words>

Spray-painted murals and half-finished charcoal sketches littered the crumbling stone walls, but the space seemed abandoned, the artists nowhere in sight. <words>100</words> Zane wandered through archways and side chambers, his old instincts on alert, until a glint of something caught his eye - an chunk of amber resting on a painted wooden box, a spider delicately suspended inside the golden resin. <words>132</words>

He reached for it when a voice echoed through the cathedral. <words>144</words> "You've come for answers that can't be given, only found." <words>154</words> A figure stepped from the shadows, an old woman with piercing eyes and a knowing smile. <words>169</words>  

Zane eyed her warily. <words>173</words> "I was told you could help me... make sense of things. <words>184</words> Find some kind of meaning behind everything that's happened." <words>192</words>

The woman picked up the amber, turning it in her weathered hands. <words>203</words> "This spider is trapped in time, a single moment suspended for eternity. <words>214</words> But you, you are trapped by your past, by moments you can't release. <words>226</words> What you seek is inside yourself, if you have the courage to look." <words>238</words>

She pressed the amber into his palm and closed his fingers around it. <words>250</words> Zane felt its warmth, studied the delicate spider inside, and suddenly understood. <words>261</words> He had to confront his memories, his mistakes, his regrets. <words>270</words> Only by facing them could he finally let them go and step forward unburdened. <words>283</words>  

With a nod to the woman, Zane pocketed the amber and strode from the cathedral, stepping into the fading light of dusk. <words>303</words> The improbable longing that had driven him for so long crystalized into resolve. <words>315</words> No more running, no more hiding from his ghosts. <words>324</words> It was time to finalize this chapter of his story and begin anew. <words>336</words>

As the last echoes of the hour faded away, Zane walked on, the amber spider resting close to his heart - a talisman of the past, and a promise for the future. <words>364</words> He didn't know exactly where this path would lead him, but for the first time in years, he was unafraid to find out. <words>390</words> With carefully reckless determination, the shaky mercenary embarked on a new journey into the unknown. <words>403</words>
