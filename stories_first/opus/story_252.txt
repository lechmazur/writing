<story>
In the icy warmth of the fruit preservation vault, the penitent memory thief sat alone, turning a simple wooden toy block over in his hands. <words>25</words> The block was the key to unlocking the crack in reality he had discovered, a fissure that would allow him to recalibrate the universe and restore the ancient methods lost to time. <words>54</words> He had tracked the flower petals strewn through his mind to this moment, at the hush as an empty swing set slows to a stop, the perfect still point to enact his plan. <words>87</words>

The memory thief's eyes gleamed with lovingly hateful determination as he focused intently on the toy block, reaching out with his power to siphon the essence it contained. <words>114</words> Stolen memories of childhood innocence and wonder flowed into him, filling the void left by the sins of his past. <words>134</words> Each memory was a petal, plucked from a delicate bloom and preserved here in this vault, sustaining him for centuries. <words>155</words>

As the energy from the block filled him, the memory thief felt the boundaries of the vault begin to splinter and crack, giving way to the larger schism beyond. <words>182</words> Rising to his feet, he channeled the power into the rupture, willing it to open. <words>196</words> With a blinding flash, the vault fell away and he stepped through the gap into the space between worlds. <words>217</words>

Gliding on currents of thought, the memory thief moved through the flickering shadows of forgotten moments, seeking the origin point. <words>235</words> At last, he found it - the shattered fragments of the first memory, the template for all that followed. <words>254</words> Kneeling down, he began to piece the shards together, rebuilding the original thought that had birthed existence. <words>271</words>

As the final piece slid into place, a wave of pure white energy pulsed out from the restored memory, washing over everything. <words>292</words> The memory thief felt his own history being unwritten and rewritten, ancient methods and knowledge pouring back into the collective consciousness. <words>313</words> His mission complete, he drifted in the void, a formless thought among an infinity of remembered dreams. <words>330</words>

Then he was back in his body, standing in the fruit preservation vault once more. <words>345</words> But everything had changed. <words>350</words> The simple wooden block in his hand now thrummed with primordial power, the record of a world restored to its original state. <words>371</words> The memory thief smiled, his eyes still gleaming with icy warmth, and lovingly hateful satisfaction. <words>386</words> He placed the block back on the shelf and walked out, his debt paid, his penance complete. <words>404</words>
