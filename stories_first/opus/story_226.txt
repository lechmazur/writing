<story>
In a resonance testing facility on the edge of a sun-bleached desert, a gloomy orchardist named Arlo worked late into the night. <words>22</words> His calloused hands moved with a craftsman's pride as he tuned the massive steel chambers, preparing them for the next round of experiments. <words>44</words> Arlo took haggard awe in his work, though the ethics of it sometimes haunted him during the hush where past met prophecy in his troubled mind. <words>70</words>

The facility was engaged in genuinely artificial and dubious research, attempting to collect and contain lost lullabies via black-market transactions with shady collectors around the world. <words>95</words> Arlo didn't fully understand the science, but he knew his role was crucialâ€”without proper resonance, the lullabies would be lost forever, scattered to the desert winds. <words>122</words>

As he worked, his eyes kept returning to the sun-bleached skull that sat on his workbench, a morbid paperweight holding down a stack of schematics. <words>145</words> He'd found it half-buried in the sand on one of his rare trips outside the facility. <words>161</words> Something about its hollow eyes seemed to follow him, whispering wordless warnings. <words>174</words>

Arlo's mind drifted to the past, to the orchard he'd left behind when the facility's director had offered him triple the salary to maintain their equipment. <words>199</words> At first, the money had been enough to quiet his conscience. <words>210</words> But as the experiments grew stranger and the lullabies more haunting, he'd begun to question the cost of his work. <words>229</words>

The skull watched him as he tightened the final bolts, its grin mocking his unease. <words>243</words> Arlo knew he was just a cog in a machine he couldn't hope to understand, but his pride in his craft kept him going. <words>266</words> He told himself that the lullabies needed to be preserved, that some knowledge was worth the cost. <words>283</words>

As he stepped back to admire his handiwork, a soft melody began to emanate from the chamber, an eerie, half-remembered tune that made his heart ache. <words>306</words> The skull's empty sockets seemed to deepen, pulling him in like twin black holes. <words>320</words>

In that moment, Arlo realized that he was just as trapped as the lullabies he helped to contain, a prisoner of his own pride and the facility's dark ambitions. <words>346</words> He stared at the skull, wondering if it was a warning or a promise, a glimpse of his own future. <words>365</words>

With a heavy sigh, he turned back to his work, the haggard awe of a craftsman who knew his craft too well. <words>389</words> In the hush of the desert night, the lost lullabies sang on, and Arlo listened, a gloomy orchardist in a world of steel and shadow. <words>418</words>
