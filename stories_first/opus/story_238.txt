Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
The gloomy barkeep wiped down the counter, his worn wallet tucked in his back pocket a reminder of transient realities. <words>20</words> He was abrasively charming, quick with a joke or scowl, depending on the patron and his mood. <words>35</words> The bar was his stage, where he would drone on with half-listened tales, the abandoned carnival ticket booth outside a fitting backdrop. <words>54</words>

It was at the hush when a truce forms without words, that liminal space between night and day, when the barkeep heard the confessions. <words>75</words> They came from the broken payphone booth out back, disembodied voices spilling secrets and sorrows to uncaring receivers. <words>92</words> He couldn't make out the words, but the tones painted vivid pictures in his mind - desperation, heartache, hope, and fear. <words>112</words>

One voice in particular drew him in with its enigmatic familiarity. <words>123</words> It was a woman, her words a riddle wrapped in a mystery. <words>135</words> Night after night she would call, always at the witching hour, always with a story that danced around the edges of a larger truth. <words>158</words>

The barkeep found himself drawn to her tales, trying to piece together her identity from overheard fragments. <words>175</words> He imagined her as a femme fatale, a damsel in distress, a mastermind criminal - the possibilities shifted like smoke. <words>194</words> He knew he should ignore the calls, focus on his own problems, but he couldn't resist the siren song of her voice. <words>217</words>

One night, emboldened by whiskey and loneliness, the barkeep picked up the phone. <words>229</words> "I know you," he rasped, his voice rough from cigarettes and disuse. <words>241</words> 
There was a pause, then a soft laugh. <words>250</words> "Do you now?" the woman replied, her tone amused and enigmatic. <words>261</words>
"I've heard your stories," the barkeep said. <words>269</words> "Night after night. <words>273</words> I feel like I know you better than I know myself." <words>285</words>

Another pause, longer this time. <words>290</words> Then, "Perhaps you do," she said softly. <words>298</words> "Perhaps we are all just stories in the end, our lives the tales we tell ourselves and others." <words>318</words>

The barkeep's hand tightened on the phone, her words echoing his own dark musings. <words>332</words> "Who are you?" he asked, his voice barely a whisper. <words>342</words>
"A thief," she replied simply. <words>347</words> "I steal the light from midnight, the hope from the hopeless. <words>359</words> And now I've stolen a piece of you as well." <words>370</words>

The line went dead and the barkeep slowly hung up the phone, her final words ringing in his ears. <words>390</words> He looked out at the abandoned carnival, the rising sun painting it in shades of possibility and regret, and felt the weight of his own untold story pressing down on him. <words>418</words>
