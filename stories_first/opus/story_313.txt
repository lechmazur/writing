<story>
Zeke was a small-time con artist, always looking for the next mark to fleece with his unusually normal demeanor and mild fervor. <words>22</words> He found himself in a dystopian farm, a wretched place where hope came to die, seeking shelter for the night during story time. <words>44</words> As he lay on a moldy cot in the ramshackle barn, the lull of remorse began to seep into his restless thoughts. <words>67</words>

In a moment of despair, Zeke longed to taunt the jaws of defeat and grin, to laugh in the face of his own reckoning. <words>164</words> But the weight of his choices pressed down on him like a ton of bricks, suffocating his usual bravado. <words>184</words> He realized that he needed to change, to find a way to make amends and chart a new course. <words>205</words>
