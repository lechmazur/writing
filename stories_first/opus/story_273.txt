Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
Before the universe began, in a swamp fortress reachable only by gondola, there lived an incognito aristocrat named Lyra who was known for her strangely honest ways. <words>27</words> She spent her days spinning tales on a rustic yarn swift, chronicling the stories of the village folk in humble defiance of the ruling authorities who sought to subjugate and silence them. <words>54</words>

Lyra knew that challenging authority directly would only lead to her imprisonment or worse. <words>66</words> So she devised a clever plan to spread the truth through messages concealed in vintage wine bottles that she launched from the parapets of her fortress into the surrounding swamp. <words>91</words> The bottles would drift along the dark currents until they were discovered by the gondoliers who ferried supplies and contraband to her remote outpost. <words>111</words>

The gondoliers, sworn to secrecy, would deliver Lyra's bottled stories to the village elders who would share them in clandestine gatherings held deep in the bayou on moonless nights. <words>135</words> There, huddled around flickering bonfires, the villagers would uncork the bottles and unroll the parchment scrolls contained within, eagerly devouring Lyra's tales of their lives, loves, struggles and triumphs. <words>161</words>

As the stories spread, the villagers began to see themselves and each other in a new light. <words>177</words> No longer were they merely downtrodden subjects of a tyrannical regime, but the heroes of an epic saga still unfolding. <words>196</words> Slowly at first, and then more boldly, they began to resist their oppressors in subtle ways, guided by the wisdom and courage they gleaned from Lyra's stories. <words>221</words>

When the authorities learned of Lyra's subversive activities, they launched a campaign to hunt her down and destroy her yarn swift and story bottles. <words>241</words> But the villagers banded together to protect her, forming a secret network to ferry her to safety in a remote corner of the swamp. <words>263</words>  

There, Lyra continued her work, spinning stories into the night as the universe winked into existence overhead, born from the hopes and dreams she had kindled. <words>287</words> And though the authorities redoubled their efforts to subjugate the villagers, they could never extinguish the flames of resistance that Lyra's stories had sparked in their hearts. <words>312</words>

For Lyra understood a fundamental truth - that stories have the power to change the world, one heart and mind at a time. <words>332</words> And as she recorded the tales of her people on her rustic yarn swift in that swamp fortress reachable only by gondola, she knew that no force in the universe could ever subjugate the human spirit as long as there were stories to be told and shared. <words>380</words> Lyra's strange yet honest chronicles, passed from hand to hand in humble defiance, would echo through the ages as a testament to the unbreakable power of story. <words>405</words>
