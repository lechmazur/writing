Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
Javier, the jaded locksmith, donned his embroidered gloves as he ascended the winding stairs to the labyrinth orchard on the rooftops of the colonial town. <words>24</words> The unclaimed throne of the city's underworld beckoned, a prize he had long schemed to seize through delightfully menacing cunning. <words>42</words> Permeating the evening air was the aroma of ripening fruit from the twisting groves above, mingling with the acrid scent of the forges and hearths rising from the streets below. <words>67</words>

Javier's path to power was an unlikely one - not through force of arms or political machinations, but an encounter at a pottery class of all things. <words>94</words> It was there, amidst the shaping of clay, that he met Lucia, the unassuming daughter of the city's most notorious crime lord. <words>115</words> Javier played the long game, his demure audacity allowing him to charm Lucia and infiltrate her father's inner circle as an unnoticed peripheral figure, biding his time. <words>139</words>

Now, under the cover of dusk in the secluded rooftop orchard, Javier prepared to strike. <words>153</words> Lucia stood before an easel, engrossed in painting the silhouettes of the colonial buildings against the dimming sky, unaware of Javier's presence or his intentions. <words>175</words> Javier crept closer, his footfalls muffled by the well-worn leather of his boots, his gloved hand gripping the hilt of a blade. <words>195</words> 

But as he drew near, Lucia spoke without turning: "I know why you're here, Javier. You want to claim my father's throne." <words>216</words>

Javier froze, his plan unraveling. "How long have you known?" he asked.  <words>227</words>

"Long enough," Lucia replied calmly, still focused on her painting. "I've been watching you, studying your methods. You're not the only one with ambitions." <words>248</words>

Javier's mind raced, recalculating his approach. He could end it here, but something in Lucia's voice gave him pause. <words>265</words> "What do you propose?" he ventured.  <words>271</words>

Lucia set down her brush and finally faced him, a sly smile on her lips. "A partnership. I have the connections, you have the skills. Together, we could rule this city's underworld." <words>298</words>

Javier considered her offer, weighing the risks and potential rewards. An alliance with Lucia could accelerate his ascent, but it also meant sharing power. <words>318</words> Yet the alternative was uncertainty, and Javier's patience had worn thin. <words>329</words>

"I accept," he said at last, sheathing his blade. "But know this - I will not be content as a mere consort. The throne will be mine in the end." <words>356</words>

Lucia laughed lightly. "I would expect nothing less from you, locksmith. But first, we have work to do. My father's empire is ours for the taking." <words>381</words>

And with that, a new era dawned in the city's underworld, one that would be shaped by the combined cunning and ruthless ambition of the jaded locksmith and the crime lord's unassuming daughter. <words>412</words>
