<story>
Lena stared out the obsidian skyscraper window, her mind adrift in lucid confusion as she pondered the ancient symbols she had been tasked with decoding. <words>25</words> The scattered seeds of an idea began to take root, but remained frustratingly out of reach, like the receding footprints of a nighttime beach wanderer. <words>50</words>

During the quiet shift before sunrise in the hospital ward below, Lena noticed the pleasant meddler Nurse Olivia making her rounds, her openly manipulative cheer doing little to lift the patients' spirits. <words>81</words> Olivia's tactics seemed to weaken their resolve, Lena mused, as she absently fingered the rusted ice skates on her desk, a relic from a distant past. <words>107</words>

The ice skates were the key, Lena suddenly realized - their intricate designs mirrored the symbols she had been struggling to decipher. <words>128</words> Memories flooded back of her grandmother teaching her to skate on the frozen pond behind their house, tracing looping figure eights and whispering stories of the ancient ones in her ear. <words>158</words>

As dawn broke over the skyscraper, Lena worked feverishly, cross-referencing the ice skate etchings with the symbol lexicons. <words>176</words> The seeds of understanding finally sprouted as the pieces fell into place - the symbols told of an ancient civilization that thrived in the cold and dark, building great onyx cities that reached to the heavens. <words>210</words>

Excited by her breakthrough, Lena rushed to share her findings with the professor leading the research team. <words>227</words> But in the elevator, she encountered Nurse Olivia, who fixed Lena with a knowing smile. <words>243</words>  

"I've been watching you, dear," Olivia said sweetly. <words>252</words> "Struggling with those dusty old symbols day after day. <words>261</words> You know, I could help you with those... for a price." <words>273</words>

Lena recoiled at the nurse's openly manipulative offer. <words>281</words> She clutched her notes protectively to her chest. <words>289</words> "No thanks," Lena said firmly, though her voice shook slightly. <words>299</words> "I've already figured it out on my own." <words>308</words>

Olivia's smile didn't waver, but her eyes flashed with irritation. <words>318</words> "Suit yourself," she shrugged as the elevator dinged and the doors slid open. <words>331</words> "But you'll be back. They always come back, in the end." <words>343</words>

Lena hurried out of the elevator, Olivia's unsettling words echoing in her mind, mixing with the elation of her discovery. <words>364</words> As she stepped out into the bright morning sunlight, Lena couldn't shake the feeling that, in decoding the ancient symbols, she had unleashed something that would return to haunt her - like the ghost of a forgotten civilization, whispering its secrets from the shadows of an obsidian skyscraper. <words>400</words>
