Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
The bruised fighter climbed the creaky stairs to the dusty attic filled with clockwork animals, each tick and whir an accusation. <words>21</words> He clutched the clay pot shard with an inscription, its jagged edges cutting into his palm, the pain a reminder of his purpose. <words>41</words> At the moment a sculptor's chisel first strikes marble, a new creation begins to take shape, and so too did the fighter's resolve solidify. <words>64</words>

Through forgotten dreams, visions that once fueled his self-deception, he had skillfully maintained his incompetence for years, avoiding the truth. <words>83</words> But no longer. <words>86</words> He would stand for something real now, even if it destroyed him. <words>97</words> The clockwork animals judged him with unblinking glass eyes - a menagerie of his manifested doubts. <words>111</words>

With a deep breath, the fighter approached the largest of the machines, a monstrous amalgamation of tarnished brass and iron. <words>128</words> Its form shifted as he neared, taking on a familiar shape - his own reflection. <words>142</words> He pressed the clay shard against his doppelganger's chest, the inscription burning red like a brand. <words>156</words>

The automaton shuddered and came alive with a screech of grinding gears. <words>167</words> It lunged at the fighter, who deftly dodged and countered with a swift kick, sending his mechanical twin crashing into a pile of discarded parts. <words>190</words> They traded blows in a whirlwind of sparks and shattering wood until the attic was thick with swirling dust and debris. <words>210</words>

Panting, the fighter stood over the remains of his clockwork counterpart. <words>221</words> He reached down and pried open its metal skull, revealing a pulsing knot of wires and light - the core of his self-deception. <words>241</words> With shaking hands, he raised the clay shard and plunged it deep into the tangled mass. <words>256</words> The automaton convulsed and went still, the light fading from its eyes. <words>267</words>

The fighter slumped against a beam, his bruises aching, but a newfound clarity in his mind. <words>282</words> He had confronted his own weakness and triumphed, though the cost had been high. <words>295</words> The inscription on the shard seemed to mock him now: "Truth is the sculptor's chisel." <words>310</words>

He laughed bitterly, realizing that his entire life had been shaped by lies and illusions, a masterpiece of self-deception. <words>327</words> But like a sculptor's creation emerging from raw stone, he too had been transformed. <words>340</words> The fighter rose unsteadily to his feet and made his way back down the attic stairs, leaving the shattered remnants of his past behind. <words>363</words>

He stepped out into the blinding sunlight, the clay shard still clutched in his hand. <words>378</words> The first step on a new path, guided by truth and purpose. <words>390</words> The bruised fighter smiled grimly, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. <words>401</words>
