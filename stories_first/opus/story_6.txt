<story>
The skeptical minstrel crept through the abandoned disappearing ink factory, dragon-scale armor scrap in hand, moving with irreverent awe at the hush of the empty mailbox at midday. <words>28</words> His reckless generosity had gotten him into this mess - he never should have agreed to help the immortal trickster, even if the reward seemed impossibly plausible at the time. <words>57</words> Now he had to out-scheme the devious mastermind at his own game, using only his wits and the meager tools at his disposal in this derelict place. <words>87</words>

A sudden hiss from an ancient steam vent made the minstrel jump, almost dropping the precious armor shard. <words>105</words> He couldn't afford to lose it - the scale was the key to the whole plan. <words>122</words> Steadying his nerves, he crept onward through the dusty factory, past vats of evaporated ink and stained glass windows portraying fading images. <words>146</words> At the center of the building stood his target - the enchanted mailbox that held the trickster's power. <words>165</words>

The minstrel knew he had only one chance. <words>174</words> With a deep breath, he loaded the dragon scale into his slingshot and took aim, letting the projectile fly with a twang that echoed through the cavernous space. <words>203</words> It struck the mailbox with a resounding clang, denting the metal and unleashing a swirl of sparkling mist. <words>223</words> The box shuddered and morphed, transforming into the scowling visage of the immortal trickster himself, enraged at being outsmarted. <words>244</words>

"You! How dare you meddle in my schemes," the trickster bellowed, his voice shaking dust from the rafters. <words>264</words>

The minstrel stood his ground, a smirk playing at his lips. <words>275</words> "Someone had to put an end to your games. I couldn't let you keep deceiving people with your impossible promises." <words>299</words>

"Impossible? All my offers are completely plausible... for a price," the trickster hissed. <words>315</words>

"A price no one should have to pay. Your generosity is reckless and cruel," the minstrel retorted. <words>334</words>

The trickster laughed, a sound like shattering glass. <words>342</words> "And you think you've beaten me with a little dragon scale and a slingshot? I am immortal, you naive fool!" <words>365</words>

"Perhaps, but now you're trapped in the form of a mailbox, at the mercy of the postal service," the minstrel said with a wink. <words>393</words> Touching the brim of his cap in a jaunty salute, he strode out of the factory, leaving the trickster to his fate. <words>420</words>
