<story>
In an ancient Persian palace reimagined, a weary undertaker named Cyrus tended to the dead with placid ferocity, his motions automatic yet filled with purpose. <words>24</words> The palace walls were adorned with intricate astronomical clocks, each a masterpiece of gears and dials tracking the celestial dance above, a testament to the tribal knowledge passed down through generations of palace engineers and craftsmen. <words>59</words>

Cyrus's methods were meticulous but rarely practical, honed by years of ritual and tradition rather than efficiency. <words>77</words> As he prepared the bodies for their final rest, he would carefully align them along precise sun paths mapped on the palace floors, a sacred geometry to guide their souls to the afterlife. <words>108</words>

In the silence of the preparation chamber, Cyrus found a strange peace, insulated from the outside world. <words>125</words> But on this day, the hush was shattered by the sound of a car backfiring in the street beyond the palace walls, an incongruous intrusion of modernity upon the ancient rites. <words>156</words>

Shaken from his reverie, Cyrus felt a renewed surge of purpose. <words>167</words> In these dark times of war and unrest, his role as undertaker had never felt more vital. <words>185</words> Each body that came under his care was a vessel for the grief and hopes of the living. <words>204</words> By tending to the dead with reverence and precision, he helped those left behind hold onto hope in the absolute dark of their loss. <words>230</words>

Cyrus knew that death could imprison the spirit, trapping it in regret and despair. <words>244</words> But through the ancient rites and sacred alignments, he sought to set those spirits free, to chart them a course to the celestial realms beyond. <words>270</words> The astronomical clocks ticked on, marking the passage of time in the world above, while Cyrus labored in the timeless world below, a bridge between life and death, light and dark, hope and sorrow. <words>306</words>

As he worked, Cyrus's mind drifted to the tribal knowledge imparted to him by his father and grandfather, palace undertakers stretching back generations. <words>327</words> In their whispered wisdom, he found the strength to continue his lonely vigil, to bear witness to the great passage and guide the dead to their final rest. <words>356</words>

With each body aligned and prepared according to the ancient ways, Cyrus felt a small flicker of light in the darkness, a glimmer of hope that even in death, there could be peace and purpose. <words>394</words> In the face of war and chaos, he would hold fast to his sacred duty, a placid ferocity burning within him, an undertaker at the crossroads of worlds. <words>430</words>
