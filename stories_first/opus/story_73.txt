<story>
Xiuhtonal dug graves with a steady hand, as he had for decades among the crumbling ruins of Tenochtitlan's reimagined ancient temples. <words>22</words> Through the hush of wind passing a broken fence line, he heard a raucous silence, the kind that follows a sudden confession. <words>41</words> Xiuhtonal paused his digging, peering through a vintage magnifying glass at some pottery shards newly unearthed in the grave. <words>57</words> The clay fragments bore symbols of worlds overlapping - the realm of the living and the realm of the dead. <words>75</words>

Xiuhtonal contemplated the shards with a diligently whimsical air, as one who found joy and purpose in the solemn work of burying the deceased. <words>97</words> For Xiuhtonal was no ordinary gravedigger; he was a keeper of the old Aztec rituals, despite the Spaniards' attempts to quash them. <words>117</words> He kindrelized the dead, treating the lifeless bodies with familial care, honoring them with copal incense and burial goods for the afterlife. <words>137</words>

Amid the temple ruins, Xiuhtonal heard a voice, at first a whisper, then rising to a plaintive cry. <words>155</words> He turned and saw the specter of an Aztec woman in traditional garments, her burial shroud trailing behind her like mist. <words>175</words> She spoke to him across the divide between living and dead, confessing her sorrow at the loss of the old ways. <words>196</words>

"Our world is fading," she lamented, her voice echoing in the raucous silence. <words>208</words> "The rituals are being forgotten, the gods abandoned." <words>216</words>

Xiuhtonal met her ghostly eyes with a steady gaze. <words>224</words> "I remember," he said simply. <words>229</words> "I preserve the practices, even as the temples crumble to dust around us." <words>241</words>

The specter smiled at this, a melancholy upturning of translucent lips. <words>251</words> "Then there is still hope that our worlds may overlap a while longer." <words>264</words>

She faded then, dissipating in the breeze that whispered through the broken fence, and Xiuhtonal was alone again among the graves and ruins. <words>285</words> He returned to his digging, sifting through the earth with a sense of renewed purpose. <words>299</words>

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Xiuhtonal placed the pottery shards in the grave alongside the body, murmuring prayers to Mictlantecuhtli, lord of the underworld. <words>321</words> The dead would pass into the afterlife with honor, guided by one who remembered the old ways. <words>336</words>

In the hush that followed the prayer, Xiuhtonal covered the grave with soil, each shovelful a promise, each burial an act of remembrance. <words>357</words> The worlds of the living and the dead would continue to overlap, even if only in the actions of one diligently whimsical gravedigger. <words>379</words> Xiuhtonal straightened up, his work complete, and gazed at the stars emerging in the twilight sky, finding solace in their ancient, steady light. <words>400</words>
