In the giant's cavernous dining room, the lingering minstrel sat alone, his lute resting silently beside him. <words>18</words> The room was openly private, a place where the minstrel could escape the mundane existence of the outside world, if only for a little while. <words>37</words> He ran his fingers over the strings, but no sound emerged, his gentle turmoil affirmed by the silence. <words>52</words>

As the realm beyond the dining room buzzed with the frenzy of rush hour, the minstrel reached into his satchel and retrieved a gnarled wooden ladle, a relic from a witch he once knew. <words>77</words> The ladle's surface was rough like the texture of a meteorite, pocked and pitted from its otherworldly journeys. <words>93</words> Holding it now, the minstrel felt a strange energy coursing through the ancient wood, as if it yearned to rejuvenate his weary soul. <words>113</words>
