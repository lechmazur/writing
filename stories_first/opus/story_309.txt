Detective Jenna Reeves rummaged through the debris at the Vanishing Point Gallery, her molten sarcasm barely concealing the weariness in her bones. <words>22</words> The overworked detective had been called to the scene during the hush that followed the final siren, the one signaling the all-clear after the bomb threat was called in. <words>45</words> But the damage was already done - shattered glass, splintered frames, priceless art reduced to confetti. <words>58</words>
