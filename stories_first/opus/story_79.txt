Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
Sheriff Jed Hawkins sat in the scientific poetry library, the midday lull suspending time as dust motes floated in the sunbeams. <words>22</words> He turned the tarnished silver chain over in his hands, feeling its ethereally physical weight. <words>35</words> The chain was the only clue to the mystery that had haunted this small town for decades. <words>50</words>

Jed's father, the sheriff before him, always spoke of the "echo of quiet" - the uneasy stillness that fell over the town when another girl went missing. <words>74</words> Jeb rebelled against that helpless silence, vowing to trace the path of falling stars to find the truth, no matter how long it took. <words>95</words>

He pored over the dusty astronomy tomes and obscure poetry volumes, searching for any hint or pattern to the abductions. <words>113</words> The latest girl, Lila, disappeared during the Perseids meteor shower, like the others before her. <words>126</words> Jed noticed the showers all peaked in years ending in prime numbers - 1987, 1993, 2003, 2011. <words>141</words> The next would be 2027. <words>145</words>

As he fingered the delicate chain, Jed felt a ghostly resolve settle over him. <words>158</words> He would let this single clue defeat the dirge of despair that paralyzed the town for too long. <words>175</words> Jed knew in his bones that the key to the mystery lay in the fallen stars themselves. <words>192</words>

He began to chart the precise trajectories of past and future showers, overlaying them on maps of the abduction sites. <words>211</words> A pattern emerged - an eerily perfect spiral, with its center in the heart of the woods. <words>228</words> Jed rallied the townspeople, and they ventured into the forest, to the spot where the falling stars converged. <words>245</words>

There, in a hidden grove, they found them - dozens of girls, trapped in an ethereal stasis, as if they were made of stardust themselves. <words>267</words> And in the center, an ancient altar inscribed with celestial poetry, a summoning circle for a ravenous god. <words>284</words>

Jed knew what he had to do. <words>291</words> He placed the silver chain on the altar and began to chant the words, inverting the ritual. <words>309</words> As the sky darkened and the ground shook, the girls started to awaken, the starlight fading from their eyes. <words>327</words>

One by one, they stumbled into the arms of their families, dazed but unharmed. <words>341</words> Lila was the last to emerge, and as Jed caught her, she pressed something into his hand - a small, shimmering star. <words>363</words> "It's over," she whispered. <words>366</words> "The stars are free now, and so are we." <words>375</words>

Jed looked up at the clear sky, feeling the echo of quiet settle over the town once more. <words>394</words> But this time, it was the hush of peace, not fear. <words>405</words>
