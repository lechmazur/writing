<story>
In the hush of a streetlamp flickering out, a hopeful knight ventured into the mystic orchard garden concealed within a hedge maze. <words>22</words> He sought to sabotage the machine that cycles regrets, a cleverly naive quest to reclaim what was lost. <words>37</words> With agonizing bliss, he pressed onward, a stray jigsaw edge his only clue to solving the cryptic puzzle. <words>52</words>

The knight moved nimbly through the maze, the scent of ripe fruit and blossoms thick in the air. <words>69</words> Tiny pinpricks of starlight filtered through dense boughs overhead, barely illuminating the twisting path. <words>82</words> A melodic humming emanated from the center of the labyrinth, pulsing in sync with a frequency only the knight could perceive. <words>100</words>

He knew the sound held the key to neutralizing the infernal contraption that had stolen so much from so many. <words>118</words> With each step, the knight felt a surge of hopeful energy, even as dread knotted his stomach. <words>134</words> The orchard seemed to sway and shimmer around him, as if trying to lead him astray. <words>149</words> But he maintained his focus on the signal, allowing it to guide him true.

At last, the knight reached the heart of the maze. <words>165</words> There stood a towering machine of obsidian gears, ebony pistons, and midnight grates, all churning in a haunting rhythm. <words>182</words> Suspended above it hung an enormous hourglass, crimson sand trickling down into the device like blood. <words>196</words> Each grain seemed to carry with it a whispered sigh of sorrow and regret.

The knight approached, clutching the jigsaw piece tight. <words>209</words> He could feel it humming in sync with the machine's frequency. <words>220</words> With a determined breath, he reached out and touched the edge to the central gear. <words>234</words>

Instantly, an unearthly wail pierced the garden as the mechanism shuddered and screeched. <words>246</words> Hairline fractures raced across its surface, glowing with searing light. <words>256</words> The knight stood firm, pouring all his hope and will into the jigsaw piece. <words>269</words> With a deafening crack, the device exploded into a cascade of luminous shards.

As the fragments evaporated like mist, the hourglass burst, releasing a swirl of glittering ruby sand. <words>288</words> It surrounded the knight, filling him with a profound sense of peace and absolution. <words>301</words> Throughout the land, all those burdened by the weight of regrets felt the lift of a terrible yoke from their hearts. <words>321</words>

The knight closed his eyes, basking in the warmth of reclaimed hope and possibility. <words>334</words> He understood then the true wisdom behind his seemingly naive quest. <words>345</words> Only by embracing the agonizing bliss of facing one's deepest sorrows could one ever dream of triumphing over them. <words>362</words>

With a soft sigh, the knight released the jigsaw piece, letting it dissolve into the breeze. <words>377</words> He turned and strode out of the maze, the mystic orchard garden already fading behind him like a half-remembered dream. <words>397</words>
