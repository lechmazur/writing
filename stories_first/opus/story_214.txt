<story>
Jed Hawkins was a lone trapper, living a solitary life on the floating observatory between shifts monitoring the stars. <words>20</words> His only companion was a piece of sea glass he kept in his pocket, a memento from his past life on Earth. <words>40</words> Jed had lost much over the years - his family, his home, his sense of purpose. <words>54</words> But in the vast silence of space, he was starting to appreciate the upside of loss. <words>69</words> It had brought him clarity and a chance to recommence his life on new terms. <words>83</words>

One night, unable to sleep, Jed began sifting through the observatory's shady archives, driven by a strange compulsion. <words>100</words> Buried in the files, he discovered a reel of microfilm that seemed to silently call out to him, audible only in his mind. <words>122</words> With gritty determination, Jed set to work decoding the encrypted data, desperate to siphon some radiance of meaning from the black hole of doubt that consumed him. <words>147</words>

As the symbols resolved into words on his screen, Jed couldn't believe what he was reading. <words>163</words> The microfilm contained classified information about a covert mission - one that involved his long-lost daughter Mira. <words>179</words> She was alive and secretly working to infiltrate a hostile alien species on the fringes of known space. <words>196</words> 

Jed's heart raced as memories came flooding back - teaching young Mira to read the stars, her delicate fingers collecting sea glass on the shore, the wrenching pain when she disappeared years ago. <words>226</words> He finally understood her cryptic last message: "The upside of loss is rebirth. I commence anew so others may shine." <words>246</words>

With trembling hands, Jed pocketed the sea glass and prepared a pod for interstellar travel. <words>260</words> He would find Mira and bring her home, no matter the cost. <words>272</words> As he blasted away from the observatory into the glittering expanse, Jed felt a flicker of something he hadn't experienced in years: hope. <words>294</words>  

Maybe loss wasn't an end but a beginning. A chance to recommence and chase the radiance that beckoned from beyond. <words>314</words> With gritty resolve, Jed piloted through the void, the stars blurring into whimsical streaks of light. <words>329</words> He would decode the coordinates in the microfilm and follow them to Mira. <words>341</words> The sea glass in his pocket was a reminder of what he once had, and what he could have again. <words>361</words> In the silently audible pulse of space, Jed Hawkins commenced the most important mission of his life. <words>378</words> He would siphon radiance from the black holes of the universe if that's what it took to bring his daughter home. <words>400</words>
