Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
In the depths of a subterranean cavern, a roaring waterfall echoed off the stone walls, misting the air with a cold spray. <words>24</words> Torches flickered, casting dancing shadows on the hooded figures gathered around an intricate ice sculpture depicting swirling energy flows through the human body. <words>47</words> Alia, the poison taster, stood apart from the others, her eyes transfixed by the sculpture's strangely compelling beauty as she absently fingered the simple cloth bookmark in her pocket, her totem of a former life. <words>79</words>

The sculpture began to crack and drip in the warm torchlight - in mere seconds, it would collapse into a puddle, its flows forever disrupted. <words>105</words> Alia felt a pang of sorrow, wishing she could preserve it, wishing she had more time. <words>121</words> Time was a luxury she could ill afford these days. <words>131</words>

"The flows are shifting," intoned the leader, his voice deep and commanding. <words>144</words> "We must rebalance the energies before it is too late. <words>155</words> The surface world depends on it, though they remain ignorant to our work." <words>168</words>

Alia knew the price of failure, the havoc that would be unleashed if the ancient energy flows were to unravel. <words>188</words> It was why she had pledged herself to this strange, secret society, why she had trained as a poison taster, sampling all manner of concoctions and elixirs to build up resistances. <words>219</words> She was already living on borrowed time - what was a little more risk if it helped maintain the balance? <words>239</words>

The leader turned to her now, proffering an ornate vial. <words>249</words> "You know what must be done," he said simply. <words>258</words>

Alia nodded, unstoppering the vial. <words>263</words> The opalescent liquid shimmered in the torchlight. <words>270</words> She took a deep breath, said a silent prayer, and downed the contents in one gulp. <words>286</words> Fire raced through her veins and she collapsed to her knees, gasping, as the ice sculpture shattered with a resounding crack. <words>308</words>

Dimly, she could hear the frantic calls of disciples to the talk-radio psychics who served as the society's oracles and guides, interpreting their cryptic messages. <words>332</words> "The sacrifice is accepted," proclaimed the leader. <words>339</words> "The flows are bound in their course once more." <words>349</words>

As darkness clouded her vision, Alia felt a profound sense of peace and purpose. <words>363</words> She had found belonging here, had helped safeguard the world, fleeting though her time had been. <words>379</words> As the last of her life force drained away, she clutched the bookmark and smiled, embracing the serene upheaval of death, her final duty fulfilled. <words>404</words>
