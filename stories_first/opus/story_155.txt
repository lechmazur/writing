<story>
Zara was an underwater welder by day, but her true passion lay in the broken planetarium reimagined as a night club where she DJed on weekends. <words>27</words> The vintage button box she had inherited from her grandmother held an improbable power, allowing her to glimpse moments from alternate timelines in the antique store mirrors she collected. <words>61</words>

Patiently impatient, Zara spent years unraveling the mystery, seeking the crossing where two timelines should never meet. <words>81</words> In stolen moments between welding jobs, she would pamper herself by getting lost among the button box's glimmering secrets, each one a window into what could have been. <words>110</words>

One fateful night at the club, as Zara spun records and danced between the defunct telescopes, the button box began to rattle with untapped energy. <words>137</words> She rushed to open it and a kaleidoscope of colors burst forth, transporting her consciousness to the other side of the mirror. <words>162</words>

In this alternate timeline, Zara's grandmother was still alive, still the keeper of the button box's power. <words>182</words> "You must wield it wisely," her grandmother warned. <words>191</words> "Every choice unravels a thread in time's tapestry." <words>200</words>

Zara reached out to touch her grandmother's hand, but her fingers passed right through, a ghostly chill. <words>218</words> She was a trespasser in this timeline, an improbable visitor. <words>228</words>

When Zara opened her eyes, she was back in the nightclub planetarium, but everything had changed. <words>246</words> The button box lay silent, its power spent. <words>254</words> On the dance floor, clubgoers had vanished, replaced by shadowy figures from every timeline Zara had glimpsed—the lives she could have lived, now converged. <words>281</words>

In the center of the room stood Zara's grandmother, youthful and radiant, no longer just a reflection. <words>299</words> "You have unraveled the threads of time," she said, her voice echoing with inherited mystery. <words>316</words> "Now you must weave them back together." <words>324</words>

Zara understood then the button box's true power—not to grant wishes or undo regrets, but to reveal the delicate interconnectedness of all lives, all choices. <words>352</words> She would spend the rest of her days welding the timelines back together, guided by patience and purpose. <words>373</words>

In the broken planetarium reimagined as a night club, at the crossing where two timelines should never meet, Zara finally embraced her own unraveling, her own improbable power. <words>400</words>
