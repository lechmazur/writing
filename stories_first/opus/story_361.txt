Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
Zeke was a mild-mannered trapper, known in these parts for his keen intuition with all things mechanical. <words>18</words> He frequented the Stardust Diner, a retro-futuristic outpost on the edge of town that stood at the brink of change, with plans to raze it for a new hyperloop station. <words>50</words> Zeke nursed a coffee at the chrome counter and fidgeted with a single dice, the last memento of his Apache grandfather. <words>75</words>

As a child, the old man had taught Zeke about the sanctity of the hearth - how the fireplace was the heart of the home, a spiritual gateway that must be guarded and kept pure. <words>114</words> Now Zeke lived alone in his cabin in the woods, trapping small game and tinkering with gadgets, but he still lit a fire each night in memory of his ancestor's lessons. <words>152</words>

One evening, a strange woman entered the diner - raven-haired, with obsidian eyes that seemed to pierce into Zeke's very essence. <words>177</words> She slid into the booth across from him and in a husky voice said: "I know who you are, Zeke Redfeather. <words>200</words> You're the guardian we need."

She explained that a cache of indigenous knowledge was hidden in a boarded-up schoolhouse deep in the forest, encoded in scattered chalk equations covering the walls and floor. <words>239</words> Only someone with Zeke's unique aptitude for mechanics and connection to the native spirits could decipher it. <words>258</words> But agents of a shadowy corporation were also searching for the site, seeking to steal and monetize the ancient wisdom. <words>282</words>

Zeke's thumb rubbed the dice's worn edge as he contemplated the woman's plea. <words>297</words> Preserving his heritage was his sworn duty, but did he have the skill to unlock the cryptic mathematical language? <words>319</words> Emulating his grandfather's courage, he tossed the dice on the table - a perfect six. <words>335</words> "I'll do it," he declared, rising to his feet amidst the diner's organized disorder of overturned stools and half-finished meals abandoned in the dinner rush. <words>368</words>

With a final swig of coffee, Zeke strode out the door, pocketing the dice and his destiny. <words>387</words> It was time to rescue the lost knowledge of his people, guarding the hearth of their collective memory. <words>406</words>
