<story>
Jeb, a sullen farmer, trudged through the forgotten underwater city power station, his boots echoing on the rusted metal grating. <words>20</words> The objectively biased city council had forced him to investigate the mysterious power outages, despite his protests that he was just a simple farmer, not an electrician. <words>41</words> As he walked, Jeb fingered the collection of used postage stamps in his pocket, a comforting reminder of his beloved grandfather who had passed down the family farm to him, along with Grandma's treasured quilt, sewn with mismatched patches representing their life together. <words>74</words>

Jeb's thoughts drifted to the farm, which had become a dead end, the soil depleted and barren. <words>87</words> He yearned to walk away from it all and start fresh somewhere new, to erase the boundaries of his narrow, unfulfilling life. <words>105</words> Lost in thought, Jeb almost missed the faint glow emanating from the control room ahead. <words>117</words> He approached cautiously and peered through the grimy window to see banks of monitors flickering with strange symbols and diagrams. <words>134</words>

In a moment of pure inspiration, Jeb realized this was his chance to change everything. <words>147</words> With newfound zest, he barged into the control room and began frantically pushing buttons and flipping switches, channeling the borrowed valor of action movie heroes. <words>167</words> Warning klaxons blared and lights flashed as the ancient machinery groaned to life. <words>178</words> Jeb's heart raced - he had no idea what he was doing, but for once he felt truly alive, unbound. <words>195</words>

Suddenly, a blinding blue portal swirled open before him, crackling with energy. <words>205</words> On the other side, Jeb glimpsed a vibrant alien landscape of towering purple spires under a green sky. <words>220</words> With nothing left for him in this world, Jeb clutched his grandfather's stamps and leaped through the gateway to a new life. <words>238</words>

As the portal snapped shut behind him, the city's power stabilized and the lights stopped flickering in the undersea metropolis above. <words>256</words> Oblivious citizens went about their days, never knowing a sullen farmer's moment of madness had saved them through a rift to another dimension. <words>277</words>

Light years away, Jeb stood blinking under the emerald stars of an unknown world, Grandma's quilt still slung over his shoulder. <words>295</words> With a deep breath of sweet alien air, he set off toward the distant mountains, ready to plant new seeds and watch them flourish, finally free. <words>318</words>

And in his pocket, his grandfather's faded postage stamps from a world away would always remind Jeb of the day he embraced chaos, leapt into the unknown, and found himself. <words>342</words>
