<story>
In the bacteria-powered city of Microbiopolis, a nervous minstrel named Lyric clutched a crumpled photograph, rarely sincere in his interactions with others. <words>22</words> He yearned to escape the ordinary, to find purpose in a world of uncertainty, but he didn't know how. <words>37</words> 

Lyric studied the photograph, an image of celestial star patterns that he believed held the key to his destiny. <words>54</words> As a lonely candle flame guttered on his rickety table, he knew his time was running out. <words>70</words> If he was going to make a change, it had to be tonight.

Gathering his meager possessions, Lyric crept out into the bioluminescent streets, lit by the glow of trillions of engineered microbes. <words>93</words> The city hummed with life, yet Lyric had never felt more alone. <words>104</words> He didn't belong here among the towering spires and gleaming edifices. <words>115</words> His path lay elsewhere, out there in the wider world.

Unfolding the photograph, Lyric oriented himself by the stars, plotting a course out of the city and into the wild unknown. <words>136</words> With a deep breath, he began to walk, each step taking him further from the only home he'd ever known. <words>155</words>

As he walked, Lyric softly strummed his lute, a melancholy tune to match his cautious revelry. <words>171</words> He was really doing this - leaving everything behind on a mad quest to find himself. <words>187</words> Part of him wanted to turn back to the safety of the familiar, but a greater part urged him onward into the night. <words>209</words>

Mile by mile, Lyric followed the star patterns in the photograph, wondering what he might find at his journey's end. <words>228</words> Would it be a place to belong? <words>235</words> A higher purpose? <words>238</words> Or merely more of the same emptiness he felt inside? <words>249</words>  

He supposed he would find out, one way or another. <words>260</words> All he could do was place one foot in front of the other and keep going, a minstrel deploying himself into the great unknown. <words>284</words>

Lyric walked for hours, until the first light of dawn began to paint the sky in hues of radiant gold and pink. <words>307</words> In that moment, as he crested a hill and beheld a glorious sunrise, Lyric felt a profound shift inside himself. <words>328</words> 

He didn't know what the future held, but for the first time in his life, he felt truly alive and present. <words>349</words> With music in his heart and purpose in his step, Lyric continued on, ready to embrace whatever lay ahead. <words>369</words> The crumpled photograph had led him to exactly where he needed to be. <words>382</words>
