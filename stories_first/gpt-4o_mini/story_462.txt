<story>In the hush before someone finally says, “I love you,” a town-weary traveler found himself standing before the abandoned carnival house of mirrors. <words>22</words> The air was thick with the scent of salt and rust, a reminder of the coastal winds that had once animated the laughter of children. <words>45</words> He stepped inside, the creaking door echoing like a distant memory, and was greeted by the fractured reflections of his own weary face. <words>70</words> 

The walls were adorned with remnants of vibrant colors, but the stained glass panel at the far end caught his eye, its beauty dulled by years of neglect. <words>98</words> It was a kaleidoscope of hues, each piece a fragment of a forgotten dream, and he felt an inexplicable pull toward it. <words>118</words> As he approached, the metal sign outside began to swing in the coastal wind, tapping against the wooden frame of the house, creating a rhythm that resonated deep within him. <words>144</words>
