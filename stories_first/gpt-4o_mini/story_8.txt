<story>In the heart of the city, where the sun barely kissed the horizon, a dazed noble named Alaric wandered through the composer’s sound garden. <words>22</words> The garden was a sanctuary of wild melodies, where nature and music intertwined, creating a symphony that echoed through the air. <words>45</words> Alaric, with his tousled hair and rumpled attire, felt the weight of his lineage pressing down on him, a legacy of expectations that he found increasingly suffocating. <words>73</words>
