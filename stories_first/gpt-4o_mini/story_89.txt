Kael clutched a rusted nail in his hand, a relic from a forgotten era, its surface pitted and worn. <words>92</words> This nail was not just a piece of metal; it was a key to the whispered legends that spoke of a silent revolution, one that could disintegrate the chains of oppression binding his people. <words>116</words> He had heard tales of time capsules buried deep within the earth, each containing fragments of wisdom and power, waiting for someone brave enough to retrieve them. <words>144</words>
