<story>In the fading light of dusk, the coral restoration station stood like a forgotten relic, its walls adorned with vibrant marine life, a testament to nature's resilience. <words>24</words> Elara, a free-spirited herbalist, wandered through the remnants of the station, her fingers brushing against the rough stone, feeling the pulse of the ocean beneath. <words>49</words> She had come here not just to restore coral but to mend the frayed edges of her own heart, a heart burdened by the hollow echoes of shame. <words>75</words>
