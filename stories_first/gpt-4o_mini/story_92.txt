Clara was a dog walker for the elite, a role that required her to navigate the delicate balance of their extravagant lives. <words>92</words> She had learned to be carefully careless, a skill that allowed her to slip through the cracks of their worlds without drawing attention. <words>115</words> Yet, tonight, she felt the weight of her silent agreements with her clients pressing down on her, urging her to justify her presence in this eerie space. <words>141</words>
