As the band stopped playing at the corner bar, the distant sound of laughter and clinking glasses faded into the background, leaving only the gentle buzz of bees. <words>98</words> Finn had always been a man of few words, his life spent navigating the airwaves with an ironically earnest passion for music and stories. <words>123</words> Yet, that day, something stirred within him, a desire to explore uncharted emotional depths he had long kept at bay. <words>150</words>
