<story>In the dusty attic filled with clockwork animals, Eldon, a bruised fighter, sat slumped against a wall.<words>24</words> His body ached from his latest bout, but it was his spirit that took the harder beating.<words>43</words> Above him, a skylight framed the crisp moon, its light striking an old clay pot.<words>64</words> At that moment, a distant chisel struck marble for the first time, its echo resonating through the quiet night, and the pot fell, shattering.<words>92</words>

Eldon picked up a shard, running his fingers over an inscription: "Stand for something, or fall for anything."<words>116</words> The words struck a chord, resonating like the sculptor’s chisel, awakening something within him.<words>139</words> He was known in the fighting pits as skillfully incompetent, always coming close but never winning, a trait that once served his survival but now gnawed at him.<words>174</words>
