<story>In the heart of the underground city of the goblins, where the air was thick with humidity and the walls glistened with phosphorescent fungi, there lived a meek necromancer named Eli.<words>36</words> His life was far from ordinary, yet he was known among the goblins for his peculiarly sincere nature, a trait that made him both beloved and somewhat of an enigma.<words>67</words> Eli's days were filled with the cacophony of playground sounds, as the goblin children played amidst the twisted stalagmites and bioluminescent flora.<words>98</words>

Eli possessed an unusual object: a fountain pen with a broken nib, its ink long since dried up.<words>121</words> This pen was not merely a writing instrument; it was a relic, a key to decoding a universal riddle that had plagued Eli's thoughts for years.<words>157</words> The riddle was said to be woven into the very fabric of existence, a tangled tapestry that held the secrets of life, death, and everything in between.<words>193</words>

One day, as Eli watched the goblin children play, he noticed something extraordinary.<words>213</words> A single dewdrop, hanging from the tip of a stalactite, caught the light from a nearby fungal growth, creating a mesmerizing display of refracted colors.<words>247</words> In that moment, Eli saw not just a play of light, but a patternâ€”a clue to the riddle he sought to decode.<words>275</words>
