In the faded glow of an abandoned spaceport flight deck, Kellan jogged, each step echoing through the cavernous chamber like a metronome counting out his irritation. <words>33</words> An irate smuggler, Kellan was a man of abstractly physical contradictions, his emotions etched into every sinew of his body, yet as intangible as the dust motes dancing in the stale air. <words>67</words> His heart pounded in his chest, a rebellion against the sterile, lifeless environment that surrounded him. <words>87</words> The heart's revolt, he thought, was a relentless drumbeat driving him forward, driving him to find something, anything, that was real and alive. <words>121</words>

Kellan sought waterfalls, hidden ones that whispered secrets into the wind. <words>137</words> He yearned for the raw, untamed power of nature, a stark contrast to the cold, dead technology that entombed him. <words>166</words> His jogging was not merely exercise, but a memorial, a ritual to honor the life he once knew, the life that was stolen from him when he was exiled to this forsaken place. <words>206</words>

Pausing at a makeshift table, Kellan poured himself a cup of tea from an old, dented pot. <words>227</words> He held the cup aloft, swirling the liquid gently before taking a sip. <words>242</words> He reached into his pocket, retrieving a single chopstick, its surface worn smooth by years of use. <words>263</words> With a practiced hand, he stirred the tea, creating patterns in the leaves that settled at the bottom. <words>281</words>

The patterns were his map, his guide to the waterfalls he so desperately sought. <words>298</words> Through the abstract, twisting shapes in the tea leaves, he divined the path that would lead him to his heart's desire. <words>324</words> It was a biting sincerity that drove him, a sincere belief in the power of the patterns, and a biting resentment towards the circumstances that had brought him here. <words>356</words>

One day, Kellan believed, the patterns would lead him to a waterfall, and there he would wash away the bitterness, the resentment, the anger. <words>385</words> There, he would find his redemption, his peace. <words>393</words> Until then, he would jog, he would read the patterns, and he would memorialize the life he once knew, one cup of tea at a time. <words>424</words>

But for now, the flight deck was silent save for the echo of his footsteps, the whisper of his breath, and the distant, haunting promise of falling water. <words>456</words>
