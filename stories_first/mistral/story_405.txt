One day, Elroy noticed something peculiar on the subway seatsâ€”cryptic scrawls etched into the grimy surfaces.<words>139</words> They were unlike any graffiti he had seen before, seeming to bear a hidden message.<words>159</words> Driven by a desperate hope that these marks might guide lost travelers to safety, he became obsessed with interpreting them.<words>189</words> His sister had often spoken of the language of plants, of how they communicated through subtle signs and symbols.<words>217</words> Elroy began to see a pattern in the scrawls, a collection of dried petals she had left behind becoming his key to deciphering them.<words>247</words>
