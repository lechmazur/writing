<story>In the quietude of an exo-atmospheric garden, amidst the hushed whispers of plants that had never known the touch of earthly winds, there lived a solitary painter named Eli.<words>41</words> His days were measured not by the ticking of clocks, but by the spaces between borrowed books, each one a temporary companion in his isolated world.<words>74</words> Eli was known for his fiercely gentle demeanor, a man who could capture the fragility of a moment in every stroke of his brush.<words>107</words>
