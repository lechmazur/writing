In the quiet mania of a world after the last human was born, there existed a forgotten library inside a treehouse. <words>26</words> This was where Eamon, a convicted dream thief, found solace in his eternal sentence. <words>42</words> Eamon was mathematically challenged, unable to grasp the cold logic of numbers, but he possessed an uncanny ability to navigate the fragmented self, the dreamscape where human remnants still lingered. <words>76</words>

His days were filled with a desperate longing to coax thunder from empty skies, to bring back the vibrancy of life that once was. <words>99</words> He believed that if he could plunge into the depths of forgotten dreams and reunite the fragmented selves, he could resurrect the echoes of humanity. <words>134</words>

One day, tucked away in the dusty corners of the library, he found a flimsy photo album. <words>153</words> Its pages were filled with images of people playing a sport he recognized—soccer, a shared love that transcended time and space. <words>180</words> The album became his key to unlocking the dreams he sought. <words>193</words>

One final dream remained—a young girl with a brilliant smile, her love for soccer shining brightly. <words>345</words> Eamon plunged into her dream, finding her on a vast, empty field, waiting for a game that would never start. <words>369</words> He reached out, offering her the album. <words>377</words> As she took it, thunder rumbled in the distant sky, and the field began to fill with the echoes of players and spectators. <words>402</words>

In that forgotten library inside a treehouse, Eamon had finally coaxed thunder from empty skies. <words>418</words> The fragmented selves were no longer lost, their dreams intertwined, creating a new reality. <words>437</words> Eamon, the mathematically challenged dream thief, had found his redemption in the quiet mania of a world reborn. <words>459</words>
