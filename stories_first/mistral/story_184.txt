<story>In the most peculiar of settings, a vacuum chamber garden, there existed a scrappy tavern-hand named Eli.<words>24</words> This was no ordinary garden, nor was Eli an ordinary tavern-hand.<words>41</words> The garden was encased in a glass dome, devoid of air, where plants thrived under the careful control of various pressures and temperatures, a predictably unpredictable environment.<words>79</words> Eli, a rugged individual with a heart full of dreams, worked at the nearby space tavern, a pit stop for intergalactic travelers.<words>117</words>
