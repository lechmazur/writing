<story>In the hush after a cashier closes out the register, a subtle illusionist named Eli made his way up the invisible steps to the temple in the clouds.<words>33</words> This was no ordinary temple; it was where the understory of the world grew, where the secrets of the heart were whispered in the rustling of leaves.<words>57</words> Eli was casually intense, his eyes holding a depth of purpose that belied his relaxed demeanor.<words>77</words> He had come to rekindle a lost art, to learn the language of the heart, something he believed was hidden within the temple's walls.<words>107</words>

The temple was a labyrinth of clouds and stone, its corridors echoing with a doleful cheer, a sense of melancholy hope that resonated with Eli's own feelings.<words>146</words> He carried with him an unmarked binder clip, a seemingly innocuous object that was, in fact, a key—a gift from his grandmother, who had been an illusionist before him.<words>183</words>
