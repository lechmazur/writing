<story>In the quietude of a leaf classification office, Edgar, a solitary birdwatcher, found solace in his anxiously relaxed routine.<words>25</words> His life was as ordered as the leaf specimens he cataloged, a stark contrast to the chaotic flight patterns of the birds he admired.<words>47</words> During a cosmic blink, a moment as fleeting as a hummingbird's wingbeat, his orderly world tilted off kilter.<words>71</words>

A mask made from shattered porcelain shards appeared on his desk, its jagged edges glinting like a constellation against the dullness of his workspace.<words>98</words> The mask seemed to embody cosmic chaos, a force Edgar had long dismissed as destructive.<words>117</words> Yet, he was inexplicably drawn to it, seeing in its brokenness a ghostlike reflection on the polished marble floor of his own fragmented spirit.<words>149</words>
