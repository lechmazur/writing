<story>In the husk of an abandoned customs office, Prince Edmund, an exiled royal, sought refuge from the abrupt snowstorm that swallowed his lonely path.<words>30</words> The building, a relic of a time when this isolated valley was a bustling trade route, creaked with the echoes of its forgotten past.<words>52</words> Edmund had been wandering for years, unintentionally becoming an icon of rebellion to those who whispered of his unjust banishment.<words>79</words> Yet, he felt anything but iconic, his days bleak with an insurmountable loneliness.<words>97</words>

Driven by an insatiable desire to find a cure for his solitude, Edmund carried with him an antique mortar and pestle, a family heirloom and the only tangible connection to his past.<words>134</words> He believed that if he could grind down the bitter seeds of his exile, he might concoct a salve to ease his aching heart.<words>159</words> But the seeds were metaphorical, and the cure remained elusive.<words>174</words>
