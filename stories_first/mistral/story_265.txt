<story>In the heart of an abandoned cathedral, a lush orchard thrived, its roots stretching across the stone floor, branches reaching like supplicants towards the stained-glass windows.<words>37</words> Deputy Thomas, an impassive man, was known for his personally impersonal demeanor, never letting emotions cloud his judgment.<words>57</words> During his lunch breaks, coinciding with the garage's oil changes, he would venture into the orchard, drawn by rumors of something extraordinary.<words>87</words>

He first noticed it while investigating a trivial matter—a twisted twist tie, discarded among the roots.<words>112</words> It was not the trash but the faint humming that caught his attention, an echo uncharted on any map or guide.<words>139</words> The sound was cautious, much like his own bravery, a quiet strength that didn't call attention to itself.<words>165</words>
