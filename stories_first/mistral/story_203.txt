<story>In the hushed silence of the orbital debris field, amid the ever-present hum of distant toy assembly machines, Sister Elara floated.<words>30</words> Her heart pounded like a locked door rattling against its hinges, as it always did before an exorcism.<words>53</words> She was an unusual exorcist, never the usual clerical garb nor the standard holy books, but instead, armed with pressed wildflowers and an iron will.<words>84</words>

Elara inherited her vocation from her grandmother, along with a secretâ€”a lie untold.<words>107</words> She was to sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never," to confront the anomalies that lurked in the void among the discarded remnants of humanity's technological prowess.<words>152</words> Today, she faced a spirit never usual, a malevolence that fed on the silence and the forsaken atmosphere of the debris field.<words>184</words>

Her stage fright was a familiar companion, a chilling whisper that she would fail, submerge into the darkness herself.<words>212</words> But Elara had a method, a ritual that began with the sound of a key turning in a lock.<words>235</words> She'd turn an imaginary key, unlock her fears, and let them drift away like the orbital junk outside her capsule.<words>262</words>

The wildflowers, earthly remnants pressed between sheets of clear resin, were her weapons.<words>283</words> Each one a symbol of life, of growth, of possibility.<words>298</words> She held them close, their silent strength a defiant hush against the void's eternal night.<words>322</words>

As she began the rite, her voice steady despite her fears, the capsule's lights flickered.<words>346</words> The spirit resisted, the air thick with its lies, its whispers of "never" and "impossible."<words>367</words> But Elara pressed on, her voice rising like a tide, determined to submerge the darkness.<words>390</words> She would not let the inheritance of lies claim another victim.<words>409</words> With a final cry, she cast the wildflowers into the air, their truth scattering like stardust, shattering the spirit's deceit.<words>441</words>

In the aftermath, amid the toy parts drifting like confetti, Elara found her calm.<words>461</words> She had faced the never usual and triumphed, her stage fright a distant echo.<words>480</words> For in the void, amid the orbital debris, she had sculpted a new possibility.<words>499</words></story>
