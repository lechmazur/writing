<story>In the quiet hum of the orbital debris tracking station, Alistair, an uneasy emissary from the Foreign Stars Council, found solace in the rhythmic dance of junk above and the rustle of postcards pinned to his fridge door.<words>41</words> Each postcard, sent from various diplomats and friends scattered across the galaxy, was a pixel in the image of his life, consistently surprising him with echoes of past picnics and half-forgotten laughter.<words>76</words> His current post, high above the Earth, was a penance, a chance to learn universal patterns and redeem the sins of his pastâ€”a past filled with rushed judgments and botched negotiations.<words>127</words>

One day, as Alistair tracked the fragments of an old satellite, he noticed something peculiar lurch across his screen.<words>154</words> A thin, metallic object, tumbling in an erratic orbit. Intrigued, he hailed the object, only to receive a static-laced SOS: 'Help. Grav-drive malfunction. Coathanger-class vessel. Life support dwindling.'<words>204</words> A coathanger-class vessel?
