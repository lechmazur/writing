In the grimy, clockwork-littered backroom of the water clock repair shop, Edmond quietly flamboyantly plied his true trade between chapters of his mundane life. <words>31</words> His hands, stained with oil and time, were not merely those of a repairman; they belonged to a hidden assassin, a man who adored the bleak poetry of his victims' final moments. <words>60</words> Edmond believed that to transmute pain into a masterpiece was the only way to grant meaning to the lives he took. <words>82</words> His targets, chosen through bleak eulogies that mention hidden truths, were not random; they were individuals whose domestic mysteries begged for closure. <words>117</words>

A moss-covered lantern, hanging in the corner, cast eerie shadows on the worn gears and rusted springs scattered about. <words>142</words> It was under this faded light that Edmond crafted his tools of trade, not just the gadgets of a clockmaker, but the silent weapons of a killer. <words>170</words> Each cog, each spring, each carefully crafted piece served a dual purpose, much like Edmond himself. <words>191</words>

His latest target was a man named Frederic, a seemingly ordinary fellow with a penchant for collecting antique timepieces. <words>216</words> Frederic's domestic mystery was a dark oneâ€”a wife who vanished without a trace, a past shrouded in whispers and lies. <words>242</words> Edmond had received the eulogy through his usual means, a cryptic note slipped under his door, a plea for resolution hidden within mournful prose. <words>269</words>

As he worked on repairing Frederic's water clock, Edmond's mind was a whirl of despairing humor. <words>288</words> The irony of using his day job to get close to his mark was not lost on him. <words>306</words> He chuckled softly, a sound as dry as the dust on the old clocks. <words>321</words> The clock's face stared back at him, its hands frozen in time, much like Frederic's life since his wife's disappearance. <words>347</words>

Edmond's plan was meticulous, a quietly flamboyant dance of death. <words>361</words> He would deliver the clock personally, ensuring it was the last thing Frederic would ever receive. <words>378</words> The clock's chimes, modified with Edmond's lethal touch, would be the final notes of Frederic's bleak eulogy. <words>402</words>

Yet, as Edmond worked, he couldn't shake the feeling that this job was different. <words>418</words> Perhaps it was the lantern's gloomy light, or perhaps it was the desperate words of the eulogy echoing in his mind. <words>442</words> Whatever it was, Edmond knew one thing for certain: this masterpiece would be his darkest yet. <words>460</words>
