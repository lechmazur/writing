<story>In the heart of a radio wave garden, where antennas bloomed like artfully messy sunflowers, a seasoned woodsman named Eli trudged through the undergrowth.<words>31</words> His cabin was nestled in the shadows of the abandoned water tower, a relic of simpler times.<words>53</words> Eli's life was as tangled as the weeds he walked through, his past as echoing as the emptiness within the tower.<words>81</words>

His wife, Clara, had been his compass, her laughter his favorite echo.<words>98</words> But Clara was gone now, her absence a hollow ache, like the final beep of a hospital monitor still ringing in his ears.<words>130</words> Her last words, a whispered secret, had freed him by honesty, but also left him shackled to a promise.<words>157</words> To map abandoned railways, she'd said, to find where their youthful adventures would have taken them.<words>184</words>

Eli's grip tightened on the antique hairbrush he'd carried since her funeral.<words>205</words> Its silver bristles held strands of Clara's hair, a reminder of her, and a tool for his peculiar cartography.<words>232</words> He climbed the water tower, his boots echoing against the rusted rungs.<words>248</words> At the top, he pulled out a small device, a echo-meter of his own invention.<words>267</words> By measuring the echo in the abandoned water tower, he could triangulate the old railways, mapping them with sound and memory.<words>298</words>

The radio waves hummed around him, a despairing cheer of forgotten frequencies.<words>319</words> He held up the hairbrush, Clara's hair catching the breeze like a macabre pennant.<words>339</words> He activated the echo-meter, sending a pulse into the tower.<words>353</words> The returning echo was strong, short-circuiting his device, a sudden silence falling like a shroud.<words>378</words>

But in that silence, he heard it - a distant rumble, a ghostly train on ghostly tracks.<words>399</words> Eli smiled, his first genuine smile in months.<words>411</words> He was one step closer to fulfilling Clara's wish, one step closer to freedom.<words>431</words> The radio waves sang around him, a chorus of despairing cheer, as Eli descended, ready to follow the echo to the next forgotten line.<words>461</words></story>
