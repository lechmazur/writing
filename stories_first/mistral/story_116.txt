In the heart of a black velvet sky-lounge floating above an endless city, a dismayed minstrel named Lyra found solace amid garden secrets. <words>30</words> She had been trying to draw a map of an endless night, a task both subjectively rational and deeply personal. <words>53</words> The sky-lounge, with its dim lights and hushed whispers, was the perfect sanctuary for her quest. <words>77</words> Lyra's motivation was not mere curiosity, but a desperate need to understand the boundaries that separated her world from the endless night beyond. <words>109</words>

One evening, as she studied old polaroid photographs scattered across her table, she noticed something peculiar. <words>136</words> A broken watch band lay tucked beneath a photograph of a forgotten cityscape. <words>159</words> The watch band, though broken, held a strange allure, its worn leather and tarnished buckle hinting at a story untold. <words>187</words> Lyra decided to excavate its secrets, believing it might hold the key to her endless night. <words>211</words>
