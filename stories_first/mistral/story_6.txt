<story>At the hush of an empty mailbox at midday, the disappearing ink factory lay silent, save for the hiss of an ancient steam vent. <words>26</words> The factory, long abandoned, was rumored to be the haunt of an immortal trickster, known for his reckless generosity and impossibly plausible schemes. <words>46</words> Into this eerie tableau stepped a skeptical minstrel, his lute slung over his back and a slingshot tucked into his belt. <words>71</words> He was not here for the faded grandeur or the ghostly whispers of machinery past; he was here to out-scheme the trickster. <words>97</words>

The minstrel had heard tales of the trickster's latest bargain: a scrap of dragon-scale armor, said to bring invincibility to its bearer, offered to anyone who could best him in a game of wits. <words>143</words> The minstrel, with his quick tongue and sharper wit, saw an opportunity. <words>159</words> He scoffed at the idea of invincibility, but the thought of owning a piece of dragon-scale armor, even just a scrap, filled him with irreverent awe. <words>191</words>

He moved cautiously through the factory, his footsteps echoing against the grimy floors. <words>209</words> The steam vent hissed, its ancient pipes clanking and groaning like the snores of a sleeping beast. <words>233</words> The minstrel loaded his slingshot, not with a stone, but with a small, smooth pebble of compressed ink, scavenged from the factory's dusty corners. <words>266</words> He had heard that the trickster's games often involved tests of skill and cunning, and he was ready. <words>287</words>

Deeper into the factory, he encountered the trickster, his eyes gleaming with mischief. <words>309</words> "You seek the dragon-scale armor, minstrel?" the trickster asked, his voice a low, mocking purr. <words>332</words> The minstrel nodded, his fingers tightening around his slingshot. <words>346</words> "Very well," the trickster grinned. <words>352</words> "Hit me with your best shot. <words>358</words> If you can strike me, the armor is yours." <words>368</words>

The minstrel raised his slingshot, the ink pebble glistening in its pouch. <words>382</words> He pulled back the band, his eyes narrowing as he took aim. <words>394</words> The trickster stood still, his grin never wavering. <words>404</words> With a flick of his wrist, the minstrel released the band, sending the ink pebble flying. <words>421</words> It struck the trickster square in the forehead, leaving a smudge of deep blue against his pale skin. <words>439</words>

The trickster's laughter echoed through the factory, a sound of genuine delight. <words>454</words> "Well played, minstrel," he said, holding out a shimmering scrap of dragon-scale armor. <words>469</words> "You've earned this." <words>473</words> The minstrel took the armor, his fingers tracing the iridescent scales. <words>485</words> He had done itâ€”out-schemed the immortal trickster in his own game. <words>498</words> As he left the factory, the steam vent hissed one last time, as if bidding him farewell. <words>515</words></story>
