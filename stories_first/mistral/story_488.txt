In the hush just before a condemned building is demolished, a solitary summoner named Eli prowled the deserted halls.<words>26</words> His family, known for their oddly authentic traditions, had a unique way to celebrate the annual Day of the Double: each member would attempt to outshine their own reflection in as literal a sense as possible.<words>53</words> Eli, however, had never managed to do so, his reflections often outsmarting him, mocking his failures.<words>77</words>

This year, Eli had discovered an ancient, peculiar map drawn on a leaf, tucked away in the attic.<words>98</words> The map pointed to a quantum beach, a place rumored to exist outside the normal constraints of time and space.<words>121</words> Legend spoke of its sands shifting like liquid metal, reflecting the sun in a corroded rapture of color and light.<words>148</words> It was said that at this beach, one could find the spark of invention, a tangible thing that could bring life to any idea conceived in its presence.<words>177</words>

Eli hoped that with this spark, he could create something so extraordinary, it would finally eclipse his reflection's smug superiority.<words>203</words> With the building's demolition imminent, Eli used the map, his heart pounding with anticipation and desperation.<words>225</words> The walls crumbled around him as he chanted, the leaf glowing, and suddenly, he was standing on a beach that defied reality.<words>250</words>

The sand, like shimmering mercury, reflected a sun that seemed to flicker through different phases of its life cycle.<words>272</words> Eli could feel it—the spark—like electricity in the air, raising the hairs on his arms.<words>288</words> He reached out, and it was as if he could grasp the very essence of creation.<words>306</words>

With the spark in hand, Eli thought of his reflection, of the years of failure, of the incessant mockery.<words>328</words> An idea began to form, a device that could trap a reflection, forcing it to mimic its owner's actions exactly, without deviation or mockery.<words>355</words> He worked feverishly, the spark guiding his hands, the corroded rapture of the beach fueling his obsession.<words>377</words>

As the device took shape, Eli felt a sense of triumph.<words>389</words> He had done it; he had outshone his reflection.<words>399</words> But as he looked at his creation, he realized the spark had shown him more than just invention—it had shown him the truth of his obsession.<words>427</words> His reflection was not his enemy; it was a part of him, a part he needed to accept, not defeat.<words>449</words>

With a heavy heart, Eli let the device fall to the quantum sand, where it was swallowed whole.<words>467</words> As the beach began to fade, Eli knew he would return to the condemned building mere seconds before its destruction, changed, accepting.<words>491</words> The spark of invention had given him more than he bargained for, but it had given him what he needed.<words>500</words>
