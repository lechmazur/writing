The misdelivered package sat incongruously on the console—a weathered cardboard box with her grandmother's cryptic return address barely visible beneath layers of cosmic postal stamps. <words>101</words> Inside, nestled among crumpled star charts, was a porcelain doll head with unnervingly lifelike blinking eyes that seemed to track her every movement. <words>138</words>
