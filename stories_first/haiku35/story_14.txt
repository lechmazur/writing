Marcus Reilly always believed luck was a lady who whispered secrets, especially during midnight shifts at the remote tidal power monitoring station along the windswept coast. <words>42</words>

His naive gambling instincts had somehow landed him this peculiar job, watching oscillating wave meters and listening to the rhythmic crash of water against concrete pylons. <words>84</words>

Every evening, Dr. Heinrich—a brilliantly unhinged professor who occasionally visited to deliver rebellious midnight lectures about renewable energy—would sit with Marcus, illuminating their workspace with an ancient rustic candle mold he'd inherited from some forgotten maritime ancestor. <words>146</words>

"Probability is never predictable," Heinrich would laugh, tears glinting in his eyes, "but energy—energy is always a negotiation." <words>180</words>

Marcus understood these unspoken bargains intimately: between human ambition and natural forces, between calculated risk and wild chance. <words>216</words>

Tonight, as they docked additional monitoring equipment and calibrated sensitive instruments, Marcus felt something extraordinary brewing—a sense that he was capturing one last extraordinary spark before some undefined oblivion. <words>270</words>

The candle flickered, casting strange shadows across electronic panels, its wavering light seeming to communicate something just beyond comprehension—a message about transitions, about thresholds between known and unknown. <words>333</words>

Heinrich suddenly gripped Marcus's shoulder. "Watch," he whispered, "sometimes the universe negotiates in moments no instrument can measure." <words>375</words>

At precisely midnight, a massive wave surge triggered unexpected readings, transforming their quiet monitoring into a symphony of potential and surprise—proving once again that true understanding emerges from embracing uncertainty. <words>438</words>

Marcus laughed, then wept, recognizing he was witnessing something miraculous: science, chance, and human curiosity dancing together in perfect, unpredictable harmony. <words>485</words>
