Clara Reese kneaded bread dough with hands that knew more secrets than her small bakery's weathered walls. <words>25</words>

Her pressed flower collection—delicate specimens preserved between glass—whispered ancient warnings about impending transformation. <words>50</words>

In this emergency time machine garage, where shadows were learning to speak and reality bent like warm taffy, Clara understood something fundamental was changing. <words>85</words>

She was tracking moon patterns with cynically gentle precision, watching for the precise moment when the seeds of contagion would germinate across human consciousness. <words>120</words>

Her motivation was singular: to dethrone the tyrant whose genetic manipulation had begun subtly generations ago, promising progress but delivering slow, systemic destruction. <words>160</words>

The lunar charts suggested tonight—when moonlight would slice through dimensional barriers like a scalpel—she could exceed expected human limitations and trigger a cellular revolution. <words>200</words>

Her pressed violets and dried chrysanthemums seemed to pulse with anticipation, botanical witnesses to an imminent metamorphosis that would rewrite humanity's genetic narrative. <words>235</words>

Clara's fingers, dusted with flour and encoded with revolutionary potential, traced intricate patterns across her makeshift laboratory—part bakery, part resistance headquarters. <words>270</words>

The time machine hummed softly, a mechanical heartbeat synchronizing with her own rhythmic breathing and the silent communication of her preserved botanical archives. <words>310</words>

When the moon reached its precise apex, Clara would release a contagion designed not to destroy, but to liberate—a genetic key that would dismantle the tyrant's carefully constructed biological hierarchy. <words>360</words>

Her bread would rise. Humanity would transform. And the shadows would finally speak their long-suppressed truth. <words>385</words>
