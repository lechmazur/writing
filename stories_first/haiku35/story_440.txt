The last stroke of a street artist's mural had just dried, its vibrant colors marking a moment of transition that resonated with Kai's own liminal existence as a Secret Weaver—an ancient order dedicated to preserving forgotten narratives. <words>110</words>

A fragment of sea pottery caught his eye, its blue-green curves tumbling among discarded canvas scraps. He recognized it immediately: a piece from the maritime archives he'd been tracking, containing cryptic fragments of a promise made generations ago. <words>177</words>
