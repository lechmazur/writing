Dr. Elena Reyes stood at the edge of the bioluminescent bay, her analytical gaze scanning the phosphorescent waters that glimmered like scattered starlight. <words>32</words> Her fingers traced the outline of a tiny porcelain doll tucked carefully into her lab coat pocket—a memento from her grandmother and the only connection to the lost civilizations she'd dedicated her life to understanding. <words>87</words>
