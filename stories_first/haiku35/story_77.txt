Elena clutched the dried starfish, its brittle limbs crumbling between her fingers as she navigated the dimly lit corridors of the asteroid hideout. <words>37</words>

Her empathic senses tingled with the residual emotions of countless space pirates who had passed through these tunnels, their desperate hopes and broken dreams etched into the metal walls like invisible scars. <words>86</words>

She was here to marshal a resistance—not with weapons, but with understanding—for the outcasts who existed beyond the rational world's comprehension. <words>126</words>

The starfish, a relic from her mountain mentor's teachings, represented the fragmented wisdom she now sought to reconstruct: just as she could reassemble the shattered pieces of a forgotten marionette, she could rebuild the narratives of those society had discarded. <words>201</words>
