Viktor Volkov stood motionless in the greenhouse's humid corridor, his massive frame incongruously delicate against the writhing carnivorous vines. <words>30</words>

The conductor's baton hung from a silver chain around his neck—a relic rumored to resurrect the dead, acquired during his years as a docile bruiser in Eastern European underground circuits. <words>71</words>

Drum solos from a distant performance echoed through the labyrinthine glass structure, punctuating the silence with staccato rhythms that seemed to make the man-eating plants pulse with anticipation. <words>120</words>

He was disturbingly calm as he began twisting together fragments of a shredded treasure map discovered beneath rotting floorboards, his massive hands moving with surprising precision. <words>164</words>

Viktor didn't speak Russian. The map's original owner didn't speak English. Yet here he was, attempting to mold a myth from the mud of reality, bridging language barriers through pure determination. <words>222</words>

Each plant around him seemed to watch, their Venus flytrap mouths glistening with digestive enzymes, as he reconstructed the cryptic document with a brash tenderness that belied his intimidating physique. <words>281</words>

The map suggested something extraordinary lay hidden within this very greenhouse—a secret that transcended linguistic limitations and physical boundaries. <words>321</words>

When the final piece clicked into place, the baton around his neck began to vibrate, humming with an energy that suggested resurrection was more than just a rumor. <words>375</words>

Viktor smiled—a gentle expression that seemed wildly out of place on a man who had spent years breaking bones for money—and prepared to uncover whatever ancient mystery awaited him among the carnivorous greenery. <words>442</words>
