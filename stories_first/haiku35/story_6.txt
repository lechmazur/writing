Elias the minstrel strummed his lute with a sardonic smile, watching the abandoned disappearing ink factory shimmer like a mirage in the midday stillness. <words>32</words>

The dragon-scale armor scrap hanging from his belt clinked softly, a memento from his last impossible encounter with the immortal trickster who had haunted his wanderings for decades. <words>82</words>

The dragon-scale scrap trembled, a silent witness to the confrontation about to unfold between a mortal's determination and an immortal's cunning. <words>442</words>
