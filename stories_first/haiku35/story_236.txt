His reputation as a meek blacksmith who crafted delicate underwater infrastructure components belied the storm of unresolved emotions churning within him. <words>77</words>

The dictionary—a relic from the surface world—contained half-erased annotations about an unfinished bargain that haunted him across decades of luminous regret. <words>122</words>

Elias had learned to harness heartbreak as fuel, transforming personal anguish into meticulously engineered architectural blueprints that would reshape the city's underwater landscape. <words>175</words>
