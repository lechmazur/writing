Marcus gripped the welding torch, its blue flame dancing beneath the murky waters where he worked, repairing offshore oil rig infrastructure with methodical precision. <words>37</words>

His grandmother's vintage button box—the last remnant of her mysterious past—sat sealed in his locker, its brass clasp holding secrets he'd never fully understood. <words>82</words>

Tonight, after his shift, something would unravel—he could feel it in the trembling anticipation that made him both patient and restless, a contradiction he'd inherited along with the box. <words>132</words>

The broken planetarium-turned-nightclub waited in the city, a liminal space where timelines threatened to intersect, where glimpses in vintage mirrors promised revelations. <words>177</words>

Marcus knew he was about to wield an improbable power, something passed down through generations of his family—a capability that existed between moments, in the spaces where reality bent. <words>233</words>

When he entered the club, the mirrors caught fractured reflections: himself at different ages, different possibilities, all converging in this single moment of potential transformation. <words>285</words>

He opened the button box carefully, each vintage button a potential key to understanding the inherited mystery that had haunted his bloodline. <words>333</words>
