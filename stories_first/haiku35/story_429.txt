The delicate brass instrument had been passed down through his family, a silent witness to their quiet rebellion against generations of agricultural servitude. <words>86</words>

Tonight, during the mysterious temporal phenomenon known as "folding" - when reality seemed to shimmer and bend - Elias was preparing to break the invisible chains that had bound his family to the land for centuries. <words>146</words>
