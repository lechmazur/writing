In the hush as the last parade float disappeared down the street, Thomas began to coax memories from the silent bell, hoping to chronicle the industrial shifts that had consumed his entire working life. <words>202</words>

Ghostly recollections of underground tunnels and mechanical revolutions flickered through his mind, each memory a delicate thread connecting past to present. <words>255</words>
