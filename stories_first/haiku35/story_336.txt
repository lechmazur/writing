In the hushed aftermath of a distant car's metallic stutter, Karim the undertaker stood motionless within the alabaster chambers of an ancient Persian palace, his weathered hands tracing the intricate mechanisms of a massive astronomical clock. <words>62</words>

The timepiece—a relic of forgotten tribal knowledge—mapped celestial movements with a precision that felt almost sentient, its brass gears whispering secrets of navigation and cosmic order. <words>116</words>

Karim's weary eyes reflected a placid ferocity, a quiet determination born from generations of understanding that survival often depended on rarely practical methods of tracking time and direction. <words>181</words>
