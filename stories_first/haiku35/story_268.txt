Marcus sat motionless in the abandoned train station's waiting area, his fingers rolling a plain wooden bead between calloused fingers. <words>30</words>

The virtual conference call droned in his earpiece, bureaucrats discussing conflict zones with clinical detachment while he tracked subtle distortions in an antique funhouse mirror mounted crookedly on the wall. <words>76</words>

His vigilante work demanded precision, yet he moved with an artfully clumsy grace that disguised his true intentions. <words>106</words>

Each reflection revealed fragments of troop movements, supply lines, hidden insurgent networks—intelligence gathered through an ancient tracking technique passed down through generations of warrior-scholars. <words>151</words>

"Impressive deployment," he would occasionally flatter a military contact, his soft-spoken words masking the screaming silence of his internal rage against war's senseless brutality. <words>198</words>

Marcus was mastering an art older than modern conflict: understanding violence by observing its peripheral echoes, its subtle distortions. <words>236</words>

The wooden bead—a talisman from his mentor—clicked rhythmically between his fingers, a metronome measuring the human cost of each strategic maneuver discussed in the sterile digital meeting. <words>287</words>

He knew intimately the price of war: not just lives lost, but souls fractured, communities destroyed, humanity's potential crushed beneath geopolitical machinery. <words>331</words>

As another strategic recommendation was made, Marcus saw in the mirror's warped reflection not troop positions, but the ghostly outlines of children, families, entire cultures being systematically erased. <words>388</words>

His mission was not destruction, but understanding—tracking the invisible lines of conflict to ultimately prevent their most devastating manifestations. <words>430</words>

The wooden bead stopped spinning. <words>438</words>

The mirror revealed everything. <words>445</words>
