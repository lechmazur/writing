Her silently expressive eyes scanned the secret society library hidden behind a mundane neighborhood bookstore, a space that seemed ordinary during block parties but harbored extraordinary secrets. <words>106</words>

"I remember fragments," Aria whispered, her digital form flickering with a drowsy enthusiasm that suggested deeper memories struggling to integrate themselves. <words>141</words>
