Her outfit was fashionably unfashionable - a patchwork of salvaged tech and threadbare silk that spoke of survival more than style. <words>87</words>

After the storm used up its last rumble, she crouched beneath a market stall, methodically charting the swirl of antique marbles scattered under an abandoned bed, searching for something beyond mere survival. <words>151</words>
