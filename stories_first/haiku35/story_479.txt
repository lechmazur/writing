Evelyn Blackwood adjusted her silk scarf, its emerald sheen contrasting sharply with her midnight-black funeral attire, and carefully unrolled her brass measuring tape across the embalming table. <words>45</words>

Her family's undertaking tradition stretched back seven generations, each descendant meticulously preserving the precise ritual of preparing bodies for their final journey—a practice her great-great-grandmother had brought from the misty highlands of Scotland. <words>107</words>

Today's subject was different: a social media influencer whose digital archive would outlive her physical form, a paradoxical testament to modern mortality that made Evelyn smile with a peculiar mixture of jubilant remorse. <words>171</words>
