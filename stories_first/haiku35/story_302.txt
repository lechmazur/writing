The tuneless bard Ezra Windwhisper slouched against the brass-riveted wall of the airship's dining room, his stained manuscript clutched like a talisman. <words>37</words>

Amid the poetry readings that evening, passengers in elaborate goggles and leather corsets listened with half-attention, their mechanical limbs glinting under gaslight. <words>132</words>
