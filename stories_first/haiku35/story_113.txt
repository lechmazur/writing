The bard's fingers trembled as he clutched the worn-out dinosaur plush, its fabric threadbare and memories seeping through worn seams. <words>37</words>

In the xenon-lit tunnel where time seemed to fold and unfold like fragile origami, he stood at the crossing of a year everyone would rather forget—a moment suspended between remembrance and erasure. <words>107</words>

His shyly loud voice wavered, simultaneously timid and desperate, as he approached the dream-hopping machine that promised to unravel the tapestry woven from collective sorrow. <words>170</words>

The machine hummed with an ironic awe, its circuits understanding more about human pain than humans themselves ever could. <words>221</words>
