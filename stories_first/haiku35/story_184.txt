Mara wiped down the tavern's grimy counter, her calloused hands moving with the predictably unpredictable rhythm of someone who'd seen more life than most. <words>32</words>

Her collection of broken seashells—fragments gathered from forgotten shores—clinked softly in her apron pocket, a constant reminder of the life she'd never quite escaped. <words>82</words>

In the vacuum chamber garden behind the tavern, where time itself seemed to flow backward and reality bent like heated glass, Mara understood her inescapable calling wasn't serving drinks, but something far more mysterious. <words>146</words>
