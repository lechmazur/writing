The air in the shared dream recording studio hung thick with the last breath of a dying god. Dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through the grimy windows, illuminating rows of empty frames hanging on the peeling walls.  <words>59</words>
Elias, the summoner, slumped in a worn armchair, his gaze fixed on a chipped coffee grinder resting on the table before him. He was, by nature, enthusiastically lazy, a trait that had served him well in his previous life as a court jester. <words>106</words>
Summoning gods was hard work, and Elias preferred to conserve his energy for naps and witty retorts. But the dying god's plea had stirred something in him, a flicker of something akin to purpose. <words>144</words>
The god had spoken of coral reefs, vibrant underwater cities choked by the rising tides. He had begged Elias to rebuild them, to restore the balance of the ocean. <words>181</words>
Elias sighed. Summoning a god was one thing, rebuilding an entire ecosystem was another. He idly picked up the coffee grinder, its rough wooden handle worn smooth by countless hands. <words>215</words>
He had a vague idea, a whisper of river wisdom gleaned from a forgotten dream. The god had spoken of matching empty frames, of unfolding a tapestry of life. <words>251</words>
Elias stood, his joints protesting with a series of pops and clicks. He walked to the wall, his eyes scanning the rows of empty frames. Each one was a portal, a window into a different dream. <words>286</words>
He closed his eyes, focusing on the river wisdom, on the dying god's plea. He pictured the coral reefs, their vibrant colors, the teeming life they once held. <words>321</words>
Slowly, he began to match the frames, guided by an instinct he couldn't explain. He saw flashes of coral, of fish darting through swaying kelp forests. <words>353</words>
With each match, the air in the studio grew warmer, the dust motes swirling faster. The coffee grinder hummed in his hand, its gears grinding a rhythm that echoed the pulse of the ocean. <words>388</words>
As the last frame clicked into place, a wave of energy surged through the room. The empty frames filled with swirling colors, a kaleidoscope of underwater life. <words>422</words>
Elias watched, a rare smile touching his lips. The river wisdom had guided him, the enthusiastic laziness forgotten. He had unfolded a tapestry of life, a tribute to the dying god and a promise for the future. <words>460</words>
The coffee grinder fell silent, its task complete. Elias leaned against the wall, exhaustion washing over him. He had done what he had to do. Now, he thought, it was time for a nap. <words>495</words>
