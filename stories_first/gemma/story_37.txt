The crumpled sheet music felt rough against Finn's calloused fingers. <words>15</words>
He smoothed it out, the faded ink blurring further under his touch. <words>30</words>
It was a yodel, a jaunty, almost defiant melody that seemed out of place in the uncertain silence of the doctor's waiting room. <words>54</words>
Finn, a reformed con artist, wasn't sure why he'd kept it all these years. <words>74</words>
Maybe it was the memory of the woman who'd given it to him, her eyes sparkling with a mischievous glint that mirrored his own. <words>97</words>
Or maybe it was the song itself, a reminder of a time when life had been simpler, less burdened by the weight of his past. <words>121</words>
He'd come to this rainforest canopy village seeking a fresh start, a chance to become the guardian of tomorrow's flame, as the village elder had called it. <words>150</words>
But the doctor's diagnosis had thrown a wrench into his plans. <words>167</words>
His heart, weakened by years of hustling and hiding, was failing. <words>184</words>
He needed a miracle. <words>195</words>

Finn glanced at the door, willing it to open. <words>206</words>
He'd been waiting for hours, the silence punctuated only by the chirping of unseen insects and the rustle of leaves outside. <words>230</words>
He thought about taking a detour, avoiding the construction zone that had blocked the main path to the village. <words>255</words>
Maybe he could find a shortcut through the dense foliage, a hidden trail known only to the locals. <words>280</words>
He'd always been good at finding his way, at navigating the tangled paths of life, even when they led him astray. <words>307</words>
But this time, he needed to be found. <words>319</words>

He closed his eyes, the melody of the yodel echoing in his mind. <words>333</words>
He remembered the woman's words, "Sing it loud, Finn. <words>348</words>
Let your voice carry on the wind. <words>361</words>
It will find its way." <words>372</words>
He took a deep breath and began to yodel, his voice cracking at first, then gaining strength. <words>391</words>
It was a strange sound, a blend of yearning and defiance, echoing through the waiting room, a plea for a second chance. <words>420</words>
He yodelled for the woman, for the village, for himself. <words>436</words>
He yodelled for the future, for the flame that flickered within him, refusing to be extinguished. <words>460</words>
And as the last note faded, he felt a flicker of hope, a tiny spark igniting in the darkness. <words>486</words>
