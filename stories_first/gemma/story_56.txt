The whirring of the computer fan was the only sound in the cavernous space, a lonely hum echoing through the reclaimed orchard farmland that had sprouted within the toppled skyscraper.  <words>29</words>
Felix, a man who moved with the energetically lethargic grace of a sloth on espresso, watched the screen flicker back to life. <words>56</words>
It was a moment he'd been anticipating for weeks, ever since he'd found the blank price tag tucked into a dusty corner of the building. <words>83</words>
He'd known, somehow, that it was a key, a conduit to something bigger, something hidden. <words>110</words>
The computer, salvaged from the wreckage, finally displayed a single line of text: "They are watching." <words>137</words>
Felix's heart hammered against his ribs. <words>151</words>
He wasn't sure who "they" were, but he knew they were the reason the world had fallen apart, the reason the skyscrapers had crumbled, the reason the earth had begun to reclaim its concrete jungle. <words>190</words>
He glanced at the blank price tag, its emptiness suddenly charged with meaning. <words>215</words>
It was a symbol, a beacon, a way to call for help. <words>233</words>
But help from whom? <words>246</words>
Felix had always been a bluffing swindler, a master of illusion and deception. <words>270</words>
He'd used his skills to survive in a world gone mad, but now, he needed something more. <words>295</words>
He needed allies, invisible allies, the kind who existed only in whispers and shadows. <words>321</words>
Just then, a book tumbled from a shelf, landing at his feet with a soft thud. <words>346</words>
He picked it up, its pages filled with faded botanical illustrations. <words>368</words>
As he brushed the dust off the cover, a woman emerged from the orchard, her eyes wide with curiosity. <words>393</words>
"Did you drop this?" she asked, her voice soft but firm. <words>414</words>
Felix looked at her, his mind racing. <words>429</words>
Could she be one of them? <words>442</words>
He took a deep breath, summoning his most charming smile. <words>460</words>
"Actually," he said, holding up the blank price tag, "I think it dropped me." <words>483</words>
He magnetized her gaze with his eyes, a gentle harshness in their depths. <words>506</words>
"And I think," he continued, "it's time we talked." <words>525</words>
