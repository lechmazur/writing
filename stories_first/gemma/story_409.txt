<story>
The air in the attic was thick with dust motes dancing in the single shaft of sunlight piercing through a grimy window.  <words>26</words>
Each particle illuminated for a fleeting moment, then vanished into the gloom, much like the memories that haunted Finn. <words>54</words>
He ran a calloused hand over the chipped paint of a clockwork sparrow, its gears long rusted silent. <words>78</words>
His knuckles, perpetually bruised from a life spent fighting battles he couldn't win, ached in sympathy with the broken bird. <words>105</words>
Finn was a fighter, yes, but a skillfully incompetent one. <words>125</words>
He'd always been more adept at taking a beating than delivering one. <words>146</words>
But today, something felt different. <words>161</words>
Today, the air crackled with a strange energy, a hum that vibrated deep in his bones. <words>185</words>
It started with a dream, a forgotten dream of a sculptor's chisel striking marble, the sound echoing through his sleep. <words>210</words>
The dream was vivid, visceral, and it left him with a shard of clay, cool and smooth against his palm. <words>235</words>
Etched on its surface was a single word: "Believe." <words>253</words>
Believe. <words>258</words>
The word resonated within him, a challenge, a dare. <words>275</words>
He had spent his life believing in nothing, trusting no one, fighting for nothing but survival. <words>299</words>
But this shard, this whisper from a forgotten dream, demanded more. <words>322</words>
It demanded he stand for something, even if it meant facing his own demons. <words>346</words>
He clutched the shard tighter, the inscription digging into his skin. <words>368</words>
He had to extinguish the last vestige of self-deception, the lie that he was content with his bruised, meaningless existence. <words>395</words>
He had to abduct the truth, wrest it from the shadows of his past. <words>417</words>
And he knew just where to find it. <words>432</words>
In the heart of the dusty attic, amongst the silent clockwork animals, lay the key to his redemption. <words>458</words>
He would face his past, his failures, his fears. <words>476</words>
He would believe. <words>487</words>
