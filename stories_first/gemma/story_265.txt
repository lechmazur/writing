Deputy Silas stretched, his face betraying nothing of the effort. <words>14</words>
He was, after all, an impassive man, personally impersonal, a shield against the chaos of the world. <words>39</words>
Today's chaos was an abandoned cathedral, its rafters now groaning under the weight of a lush orchard, fruit heavy and ripe. <words>65</words>
Silas was here during the oil changes, a time when the orchard slept, its whispers hushed, its secrets held close. <words>91</words>
He wasn't here for the fruit, though its sweetness hung heavy in the air, a siren song to the senses. <words>118</words>
No, Silas was here for something else, something uncharted, something that echoed in the silence between the rustling leaves. <words>146</words>
He held a twisted twist tie in his hand, a relic from a world long gone, a world of plastic and convenience. <words>173</words>
He stretched it, feeling the tension build, the metal protesting against its contortion. <words>198</words>
This was his method, the secret language of bees, a way to tap into the uncharted echoes that hummed beneath the surface of reality. <words>231</words>
He held the twist tie aloft, its twisted form a question mark against the stained glass windows, now obscured by vines and blossoms. <words>261</words>
He closed his eyes, focusing on the vibrations, the subtle shifts in the air, the whispers of the orchard. <words>288</words>
And then, he saw it. <words>299</words>
A moment of pure grace, a hummingbird hovering before a blossom, its wings a blur of iridescent green and gold. <words>328</words>
It was a fleeting glimpse, a whisper of beauty in the vastness of the cathedral, but it was enough. <words>356</words>
Silas lowered the twist tie, a small smile playing on his lips, a crack in his impassive facade. <words>384</words>
He had witnessed a moment of pure grace, and for a brief, precious moment, the world felt whole. <words>412</words>
He tucked the twist tie away, a talisman against the encroaching darkness, a reminder that even in the most unexpected places, beauty could be found. <words>449</words>
He left the cathedral, the scent of ripe fruit clinging to his clothes, the echo of the hummingbird's wings still ringing in his ears. <words>483</words>
He was an impassive deputy, yes, but even he could not deny the power of a moment of pure grace. <words>516</words>
