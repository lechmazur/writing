Kaelen, the blacksmith, leaned against a rusted pinball machine, his gaze fixed on the swirling dust. <words>76</words>
He wasn't here for the games, the cacophony of electronic blips and beeps, or the throngs of neon-clad teenagers. <words>109</words>
He was here for the light, for the way it painted the dust into ephemeral constellations, a fleeting glimpse of the wild within the concrete jungle. <words>152</words>

He would kindle a spark, a whisper of green amidst the grey. <words>408</words>
The arcade, with its flashing lights and synthetic sounds, would become his canvas. <words>435</words>
He would map the swirl of dust motes, the dance of light and shadow, and with his forge and his flame, he would bring forth a new kind of beauty, a beauty born of the wild, reclaimed from the ashes of the city. <words>480</words>
