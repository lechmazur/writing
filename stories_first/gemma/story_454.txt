The rusted gate groaned like a dying beast, its paint peeling like scabs.  <words>25</words>
Jax, a grin plastered on his face despite the tremor in his hands, pushed it open. <words>49</words>
The air inside the funhouse entrance was thick with the scent of mildew and forgotten laughter. <words>76</words>
He clutched the pressed four-leaf clover in its glass casing, a talisman against the creeping dread that threatened to consume him. <words>109</words>
This was it. <words>116</words>
The spot on the map where the lines blurred, where the familiar faded into the unknown. <words>143</words>
The place where the Crows, the notorious smuggling ring, were rumored to hold their initiation. <words>173</words>

Jax, a reckless smuggler with a heart full of yearning, had been chasing their acceptance for months. <words>204</words>
He craved the camaraderie, the sense of belonging that had always eluded him. <words>232</words>
He'd heard whispers of their synchronized watch alarms, a ritualistic countdown to a shared destiny. <words>263</words>
He'd even managed to snag a battered timepiece, its hands frozen at the precise moment the Crows would begin their ceremony. <words>296</words>

He took a deep breath, the air catching in his throat. <words>314</words>
His heart pounded against his ribs, a frantic drumbeat against the silence. <words>341</words>

He knew the risks, the potential for danger, but the allure of acceptance outweighed the fear. <words>399</words>

He set his watch alarm for midnight, the same time the Crows would begin their ritual. <words>428</words>
He held the clover tight, its fragile beauty a reminder of the hope that flickered within him. <words>457</words>
As the first chime echoed through the decaying funhouse, a wave of jubilant despair washed over him. <words>486</words>
He was alone, yet somehow, he felt connected. <words>505</words>
He was on the precipice of something unknown, something that could change his life forever. <words>535</words>
He closed his eyes, the sound of his watch a steady beat against the silence, and waited. <words>562</words>
