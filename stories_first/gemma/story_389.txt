The thin-lipped warlock, Elias, ran a fingertip along the chipped edge of the viking ship figurehead fragment. <words>22</words> It was cold, smooth, and strangely compelling. <words>36</words> He'd found it nestled amongst crumbling tomes in the forgotten library, deep within the abandoned mine. <words>61</words> The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and decay, a fitting aroma for a place where knowledge went to die. <words>85</words>

Elias, however, thrived on the scent of forgotten lore. <words>106</words> He was a collector of lost artifacts, a scavenger of discarded wisdom. <words>130</words> Tonight, as the final calendar page of the year was flipped, he felt a peculiar urgency. <words>154</words> The fragment pulsed with a faint energy, whispering promises of power. <words>177</words>

He knew the risks. <words>188</words> The library was rumored to be cursed, its shelves laden with discredited textbooks containing dangerous, even heretical, knowledge. <words>216</words> But Elias, with his formally casual demeanor and unsettling certainty, scoffed at such warnings. <words>243</words> He believed knowledge was a feast, and he intended to gorge himself. <words>266</words>

He consulted a tattered volume, its pages brittle and yellowed. <words>286</words> The text spoke of optimizing one's magical abilities through the use of ancient artifacts, specifically mentioning a viking ship figurehead as a conduit for channeling raw power. <words>325</words> The method was unorthodox, bordering on madness, but Elias was undeterred. <words>351</words>

He placed the fragment on a dusty pedestal, its carved visage seeming to leer at him. <words>378</words> Closing his eyes, he began to chant, his voice echoing through the cavernous library. <words>403</words> The air crackled with energy, the fragment thrumming in response. <words>426</words> A sense of exhilaration, tinged with a primal fear, coursed through him. <words>449</words>

He was on the precipice of something profound, something dangerous. <words>472</words> As the final syllable left his lips, a blinding light erupted from the fragment, engulfing him in its incandescent glow. <words>500</words>
