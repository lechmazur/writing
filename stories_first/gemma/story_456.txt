The last flicker of the lantern cast long, dancing shadows across the worn tatami mats of the floating rock dojo.  <words>27</words>
Anya, the morbid florist, knelt before the ancient trunk, its brass lock glinting faintly in the dying light. <words>54</words>
She ran a calloused thumb over the cool metal, her heart a drum against her ribs. <words>76</words>
Inside, nestled amongst the yellowed scrolls and brittle parchment, lay a backlog of typed pages, the life's work of a long-dead writer. <words>103</words>
Anya had come to this remote dojo, perched precariously on a craggy outcropping high above the swirling mists, seeking answers. <words>131</words>
Answers about the cosmic cycles, about the ebb and flow of life and death, about the delicate balance that held the universe together. <words>162</words>
She was a florist, yes, but not in the conventional sense. <words>178</words>
Her blooms were not of the earthly variety, but of the ethereal, the spectral, the kind that bloomed only in the twilight between worlds. <words>206</words>
And she, Anya, was the only one who could coax them into existence. <words>228</words>
But her gift, her curse, came with a heavy price: a morbid fascination with the cycle of decay, a yearning to understand the inevitable end. <words>260</words>
The writer, a recluse who had spent his life contemplating the cosmos, was said to have unlocked some of the universe's secrets. <words>290</words>
Anya hoped his words, preserved in these fragile pages, would offer her the solace she craved. <words>319</words>
She lifted the lid of the trunk, the scent of aged paper and dust rising to greet her. <words>346</words>
A plain white candle, its wick already blackened, sat atop the pile of manuscripts. <words>373</words>
Anya lit it, the flame sputtering to life, casting a fragile halo of light on the pages. <words>399</words>
With a deep breath, she began to read, her neutrally passionate heart both terrified and exhilarated by the secrets she was about to uncover. <words>431</words>
She would oblige the writer's legacy, delve into his words, and through them, perhaps, find a way to temper her own beliefs about the inevitable end. <words>465</words>
