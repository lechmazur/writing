Kaelen, the pilot, perched precariously on the crumbling stone ledge of the abandoned observatory, the wind whipping at his tattered cloak. <words>52</words>

He had to act quickly, before the last vestiges of hope withered and died. <words>392</words>
He adjusted the herb bundle, a talisman against despair, and descended into the gathering dusk, his heart a fragile ember flickering in the charred serenity of his soul. <words>430</words>
