The rain hammered against the translucent dome, a ceaseless drumming that echoed through the humid air of the greenhouse city.  <words>28</words>
Brother Silas, his pale face slick with perspiration, clutched the ceramic owl figurine, its glassy eyes reflecting the sickly green glow of the artificial sunlamps. <words>61</words>
He was a man perpetually on the verge of weeping, his thin frame trembling with a nervous energy that never quite manifested into action. <words>91</words>
He was the leader of the Bloomers, a cult dedicated to deciphering the language of flowers, a language they believed held the key to escaping this toxic world. <words>128</words>
But Silas was a spineless leader, his influence stemming not from charisma or conviction, but from a peculiar ability: he could see the faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs, tears imbued with the emotions of the past. <words>180</words>

He held the owl aloft, its glazed surface catching the light. <words>195</words>
It was a relic from the Before Times, a time when the sky was blue and the air was clean. <words>218</words>
Silas closed his eyes, focusing on the faint shimmer on the owl's beak, a tear shed by a child who had loved the creature dearly. <words>245</words>
He saw a vision, a fleeting glimpse of a sun-drenched garden, the air alive with the scent of roses and honeysuckle. <words>272</words>
He saw the child, laughing, her face alight with joy. <words>287</words>
And then, the vision faded, leaving Silas with a hollow ache in his chest. <words>312</words>

He longed to understand the language of flowers, to unlock the secrets they held. <words>336</words>
He believed that if he could decipher their whispers, he could find a way to cleanse the toxic sky, to bring back the blue. <words>363</words>
But the language remained elusive, a statically dynamic code that shifted and changed with every passing breeze. <words>391</words>
He felt a surge of despair, a familiar weight that threatened to crush him. <words>416</words>

He looked around the greenhouse city, at the rows of wilting plants, their leaves drooping under the artificial sunlamps. <words>443</words>
He saw the faces of his followers, their eyes filled with a doleful cheer, a desperate hope that clung to him like a lifeline. <words>475</words>
He knew he had to keep searching, to keep trying. <words>490</words>
For them, for himself, for the memory of a world bathed in sunlight. <words>513</words>
