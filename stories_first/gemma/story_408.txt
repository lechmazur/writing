The orchard, a tangle of gnarled branches and bruised fruit, clung precariously to the ravine's edge.  <words>26</words>
Storms had ravaged it for generations, leaving behind a tapestry of broken limbs and wind-whipped leaves. <words>54</words>
Elias, a conscientious objector with a valiantly bored expression, surveyed the scene from his perch on a rickety ladder. <words>81</words>
He wasn't supposed to be here. <words>94</words>
This was supposed to be his day off, a rare respite from the endless cycle of craft fairs and neighborhood watch patrols. <words>126</words>
But duty, like a rusty nail, had a way of finding him. <words>145</words>

His family had a tradition, passed down through generations, of mapping the migration routes of birds during the autumn equinox. <words>176</words>
It was a peculiar tradition, born from a time when their ancestors believed the birds carried messages from the gods. <words>208</words>
Elias, a pragmatist at heart, saw it as a way to keep busy, a way to feel useful in a world that seemed determined to leave him behind. <words>249</words>

He adjusted his binoculars, the lenses clouded with the dampness of the ravine. <words>271</words>
Below him, the orchard pulsed with a strange energy. <words>286</words>
The wind rustled through the leaves, whispering secrets in a language he couldn't understand. <words>314</words>
He scanned the branches, searching for the telltale flicker of wings. <words>336</words>

A flash of crimson caught his eye. <words>349</words>
A cardinal, perched on a branch laden with bruised apples, cocked its head and regarded him with a beady eye. <words>381</words>
Elias smiled, a coy malevolence creeping into his expression. <words>403</words>
He knew the cardinal wasn't just any bird. <words>419</words>
It was a scout, a harbinger of something bigger, something darker. <words>441</words>

He reached into his pocket and retrieved a small, leather-bound notebook. <words>463</words>
Inside, meticulously drawn maps charted the movements of birds, each line a thread in a vast, intricate web. <words>493</words>
Tonight, he would add a new line, a line that led to the heart of the ravine, a line that whispered of secrets best left undisturbed. <words>526</words>
He would be xenial, welcoming the darkness, for he knew it held the answers he sought. <words>555</words>
