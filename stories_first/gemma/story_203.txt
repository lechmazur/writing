The silence of orbital debris was never usual. <words>14</words>
It wasn't the vacuum, the lack of air, that made it so. <words>28</words>
It was the weight of forgotten dreams, the ghosts of discarded ambitions, swirling around like cosmic dust. <words>54</words>
Father Elias, an exorcist with stage fright, clutched the pressed wildflowers in his gloved hand, their brittle petals a stark contrast to the cold steel of his suit. <words>88</words>
He was here to cleanse this graveyard of broken hopes, to sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never." <words>124</words>
His inheritance, a legacy of lies whispered by a dying father, had led him to this desolate place. <words>155</words>
The lies had promised power, the ability to bend reality to his will, but all they had delivered was this: a heart heavy with doubt and a mission that felt more like a penance than a calling. <words>203</words>
He knelt amidst the tangled wreckage of a shattered satellite, its metallic bones jutting out like the ribs of some celestial beast. <words>240</words>
Around him, the remnants of countless toys, once destined for children's laughter, now floated in silent testament to dreams deferred. <words>275</words>
He closed his eyes, the wildflowers crumbling against his palm, their scent a faint echo of a life lived on a planet he could barely remember. <words>312</words>
He began to chant, his voice a hesitant whisper against the backdrop of the void. <words>339</words>
The words were ancient, passed down through generations of exorcists, each syllable a key unlocking a hidden door. <words>371</words>
He felt a tremor, a subtle shift in the fabric of reality, as if the debris itself was holding its breath. <words>404</words>
Then, by the sound of a key turning in a lock, a portal shimmered open, a tear in the fabric of space-time. <words>438</words>
Elias hesitated, fear warring with a defiant hush that had settled over him. <words>465</words>
He submerged himself in the swirling vortex, the wildflowers scattering like fallen stars, leaving behind only the echo of a promise, a whisper of hope in the deafening silence. <words>502</words>
