The blinking doll head sat on the control panel, its painted eyes flickering with an unnervingly lifelike rhythm.  <words>25</words>
It was exceptionally unusual, even for the abandoned space station control room, a place where misdelivered packages often ended up, forgotten relics of a forgotten future. <words>59</words>
I, Kaelen, the underachieving mage, had been sent here by my mentor to retrieve it. <words>84</words>
He claimed it was a key to reclaiming my heritage, a lineage of powerful sorcerers I'd always felt disconnected from. <words>116</words>
But honestly, I was more excited by the prospect of finally having something, anything, to break the monotony of my life. <words>149</words>
The farmland surrounding the station was about to be sold, swallowed by the ever-expanding city. <words>178</words>
Soon, this place, this dusty relic of a forgotten dream, would be gone, just like my chances of ever becoming the mage I was supposed to be. <words>211</words>
I picked up the doll head, its porcelain skin cold against my fingertips. <words>233</words>
Its eyes blinked again, faster this time, as if urging me to do something. <words>258</words>
I closed my eyes, focusing on the energy within me, the dormant power that had always felt just out of reach. <words>285</words>
I pictured the doll head, its blinking eyes, and willed it to unveil its secrets. <words>312</words>
A tingling sensation spread through my body, a surge of energy I hadn't felt before. <words>338</words>
The doll head glowed, its eyes blazing with an ethereal light. <words>361</words>
And then, the control panel hummed to life, screens flickering with forgotten data, long-dormant systems whirring back to life. <words>390</words>
I had sprung the trap, not on my limitations, but on the very fabric of this abandoned place. <words>418</words>
The doll head, a conduit, a key, had unlocked something within me, something powerful and ancient. <words>446</words>
Maybe, just maybe, this was the beginning of my reclaiming, not just my heritage, but myself. <words>474</words>
