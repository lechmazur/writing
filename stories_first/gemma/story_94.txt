The amber earrings, warm against her skin, felt like tiny suns, radiating a heat that mirrored the turmoil in her chest.  <words>28</words>
She traced the intricate carvings, each swirl and curve a reminder of the man who had gifted them, the man who had promised her forever, only to vanish into the swirling mists of time. <words>71</words>
He'd been a time traveler, a rogue, a whisper of a man who'd stolen her heart and then, with a flick of his wrist and a flash of chronometric light, disappeared. <words>109</words>
Now, she was a femme fatale heartbreak counselor, dispensing advice on mending shattered hearts, all the while nursing her own. <words>142</words>
But tonight, something was different. <words>154</words>
A restless curiosity, a yearning for something more than the hollow comfort of her profession, pulsed through her veins. <words>187</words>
She stood by the sky reflection pool, its surface a mirror to the star-dusted expanse above. <words>215</words>
The air hummed with the faint thrum of temporal energy, a constant reminder of the man who had shattered her world. <words>246</words>
She zipped open her satchel, pulling out a worn leather-bound journal. <words>271</words>

He'd been careless, arrogant, leaving behind these breadcrumbs for her to follow. <words>332</words>
Tonight, she would use them. <words>344</words>
Tonight, she would track him. <words>356</words>
Tonight, she would proclaim herself free in this cage of illusions he'd built around her. <words>389</words>
She closed her eyes, focusing on the amber earrings, their warmth a beacon in the darkness. <words>419</words>
Then, with a deep breath, she stepped into the pool, the water rippling around her like liquid starlight. <words>449</words>
The world dissolved, and she was gone, swallowed by the shimmering reflection of the sky, her heart a compass, her desire a guide. <words>481</words>
