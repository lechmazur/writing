Sir Gideon, a paladin whose armor gleamed with a dull, almost mournful sheen, sat slumped against a console in the lavishly austere control room of the solar flare observatory. <words: 29> He idly picked at a loose thread on his cloak with a needle so dull it could barely pierce cloth. <words: 52> The last star had been named centuries ago, rendering his order obsolete. <words: 75> Now, they were little more than glorified caretakers of a silent, dusty monument to a bygone era. <words: 108>

A city-wide blackout plunged the observatory into near darkness, the only light emanating from the emergency lamps casting long, eerie shadows. <words: 141> Gideon sighed, his boredom momentarily forgotten. <words: 156> He rose, his joints protesting with a series of pops and clicks, and wandered towards the observation deck. <words: 180>

The blackout had been sudden, unexpected. <words: 193> It was as if the city itself had held its breath, waiting. <words: 208> Gideon peered through the massive telescope, its lens reflecting a distorted image of the starless sky. <words: 231>

Then he saw it. <words: 238>

A faint, pulsing light, barely perceptible against the inky blackness. <words: 260> It wasn't a star, not in the traditional sense. <words: 273> It was something else, something...ancient. <words: 286>

A thrill, a spark of the excitement he thought long extinguished, ignited within him. <words: 309> This was it. <words: 315> This was the chance encounter he'd been waiting for. <words: 331>

He rushed back to the control room, his heart pounding. <words: 346> The dull needle, forgotten in his hand, suddenly felt sharp, purposeful. <words: 363> He had to restore the ancient systems, bring them back online. <words: 380> This light, this anomaly, it was a sign. <words: 393>

He had to confine it, study it, understand it. <words: 408>

This was more than just a chance encounter. <words: 421> This was a chance to rewrite his own story, to find meaning in a world that had seemingly forgotten him. <words: 446>

And as he began to work, the faint light in the sky pulsed brighter, as if responding to his newfound purpose. <words: 471>
