The car backfired, a sharp crack in the otherwise silent street.  <words>15</words>
Darius, the weary undertaker, barely flinched. <words>28</words>
He was used to the jarring intrusions of the modern world into the hushed stillness of his ancient Persian palace, reimagined as a funeral home. <words>61</words>
His work demanded a certain placid ferocity, a calm acceptance of the cycle of life and death, even as the world around him roared with its own chaotic rhythm. <words>99</words>
Tonight, however, the silence that followed the backfire felt different, heavier. <words>126</words>
It pressed down on him, a tangible weight that threatened to suffocate the flickering ember of hope he clung to. <words>158</words>
Hope, a rarely practical emotion for an undertaker, but one he desperately needed. <words>189</words>
He turned his gaze to the astronomical clock, its intricate gears and celestial charts gleaming in the dim light. <words>218</words>
This clock, a marvel of ancient Persian engineering, held more than just the time; it held the secrets of the heavens, the whispers of tribal knowledge passed down through generations. <words>269</words>
It was said that by following the sun paths etched into its face, one could imprison the darkness, hold it at bay, even in the deepest night. <words>319</words>
Darius had always dismissed this as superstition, a comforting myth for a people who feared the unknown. <words>355</words>
But tonight, with the silence pressing in and the darkness threatening to consume him, he found himself drawn to the clock's promise. <words>391</words>
He traced the sun paths with his calloused fingers, feeling the cool metal beneath his touch. <words>422</words>
He closed his eyes, picturing the sun's journey across the sky, its golden light banishing the shadows. <words>456</words>
And as he did, a flicker of warmth spread through him, a tiny spark of hope rekindled in the face of the absolute dark. <words>490</words>
