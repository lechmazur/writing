The sandstone walls hummed with the soft glow of floating lanterns, casting intricate shadows that danced and shifted with the breeze.  <words>29</words>
King Oberon, his once regal robes now tattered and faded, sat cross-legged in the heart of the labyrinth, his weather-beaten kaleidoscope clutched in his calloused hands. <words>65</words>
He was a philosopher-king, dethroned not by force, but by a betrayal so profound it had shattered his world. <words>91</words>
Now, he sought solace and perhaps, a glimmer of understanding, in the labyrinth's winding paths. <words>122</words>
He believed the labyrinth held the key to piecing together the fragments of his shattered reality, a reality twisted by the very person he had trusted most. <words>160</words>

Oberon's method was as unorthodox as his current circumstances. <words>181</words>
He would extend his hand, not in supplication, but in earnest frivolity, offering confetti-coded proposals at random weddings that took place within the labyrinth's sandstone embrace. <words>221</words>
Each proposal, a vibrant burst of color, held a question, a riddle, a piece of the puzzle he desperately sought to solve. <words>256</words>
The confetti, meticulously arranged in patterns only he understood, represented the tangled threads of his past, the betrayals, the loves, the losses. <words>291</words>

During the readings, when the air crackled with anticipation and the weight of vows hung heavy, Oberon would rise, his kaleidoscope catching the lantern light, and present his proposal. <words>331</words>
The bewildered couples, caught in the whirlwind of their own commitment, would often dismiss him as a harmless eccentric. <words>364</words>
But Oberon saw something more in their reactions, a flicker of recognition, a spark of understanding that fueled his hope. <words>397</words>
He believed that somewhere within the labyrinth's intricate pathways, amidst the swirling confetti and whispered vows, lay the answer to his torment. <words>435</words>

He would continue his quest, his earnest frivolity a shield against the pain, his kaleidoscope a beacon in the labyrinth's heart, until he found the truth, until he could finally piece together the shattered fragments of his soul. <words>481</words>
