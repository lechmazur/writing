The rusted chain-link fence, once meant to keep people out, now served as a trellis for gnarled apple trees. Their branches, heavy with fruit, stretched across the repurposed highway overpass, a testament to the city's strange, post-dream resilience. Ranger Silas, his khaki uniform stiff with sweat, patrolled the urban orchard, his eyes darting between the rustling leaves and the worn path below. <words: 69>

He clutched a plain notebook, its pages filled with his grandmother's spidery handwriting. It was a jumble of botanical sketches, cryptic notes on lunar cycles, and fragmented stories of a forgotten goddess who whispered through the wind. Silas had inherited the notebook after her passing, its contents as familiarly unknown as a half-remembered dream. <words: 139>

He believed his grandmother had been chasing an echo, a faint whisper of the goddess in the rustling leaves, the chirping birds, the very air itself. Silas, ever the overzealous ranger, was determined to catch it too. <words: 180>

His methods were unorthodox, fluctuating between meticulous observation and wild leaps of faith. He'd spend hours charting the orchard's microclimate, meticulously recording the number of bees visiting each blossom, the precise angle of the sun at noon. Then, he'd abandon his notebook, climb a tree, and howl at the moon, hoping to draw the goddess's attention. <words: 248>

Today, Silas was focused on chance encounters. He'd positioned himself near a particularly gnarled apple tree, its branches laden with fruit. He believed this tree, with its twisted limbs and ancient roots, held a special connection to the goddess. He waited, his heart pounding, for a sign, a whisper, anything. <words: 309>

A young girl, no older than ten, skipped into the orchard, her laughter echoing through the trees. She stopped beneath the gnarled apple tree, her eyes wide with wonder. She reached out, plucking a ripe apple from a branch. <words: 355>

Silas watched, his breath catching in his throat. The girl's laughter, the way she held the apple, the sunlight filtering through the leaves – it all felt… significant. Could this be it? Was this the echo he'd been searching for? <words: 403>

He approached the girl cautiously, his notebook clutched tightly in his hand. "Excuse me," he said, his voice trembling slightly. "Do you ever hear anything… unusual in this orchard?" <words: 445>

The girl looked at him, her eyes wide and innocent. "Sometimes," she whispered, "I hear the trees singing." <words: 471>

Silas's heart skipped a beat. Singing trees. Could it be? He glanced at his notebook, at his grandmother's faded ink, and a strange sense of peace washed over him. Perhaps the echo wasn't a voice, but a feeling, a connection to something ancient and beautiful. Perhaps, he thought, the goddess wasn't lost, but simply waiting to be heard. <words: 530>
