The last strains of the brass band faded, swallowed by the twilight as the final parade float disappeared around the corner.  <words>26</words>
Bartholomew, his face etched with the grime of a lifetime spent coaxing coal from the earth, sat alone in the hushed meeting hall. <words>54</words>
He clutched a tiny, silent bell in his calloused hand, its surface smooth from years of absent-minded polishing. <words>81</words>
It was a relic from a time before the Great Shift, a time when the world hummed with the clatter of machinery and the clang of metal on metal. <words>115</words>
Now, the world was silent, powered by the hum of unseen forces, a symphony only Bartholomew could hear in the after-images of his nightmares. <words>152</words>

Bartholomew was a member of the Chronographers, a secret society dedicated to chronicling the technological shifts that had reshaped their world. <words>185</words>
He was, by nature, passionately indifferent to the changes, a trait that made him an ideal observer. <words>214</words>
He saw the world with a detached clarity, his grief for the lost world a dull ache that never quite subsided. <words>245</words>
Tonight, however, the ache was sharper, the silence heavier. <words>268</words>
He closed his eyes, the tiny bell a cool weight in his palm. <words>290</words>
He focused on the after-images, the ghostly echoes of the machines that haunted his dreams. <words>318</words>
He saw the gears grinding, the pistons pumping, the steam hissing. <words>342</words>
He saw the faces of the men he had worked with, their laughter echoing in the cavernous mines. <words>370</words>

He coaxed the images, shaping them with the meticulous care of a sculptor molding clay. <words>396</words>
He saw the world before the Shift, a world of noise and chaos, a world he both loved and hated. <words>424</words>
He saw the world after the Shift, a world of silence and stillness, a world that both fascinated and frightened him. <words>454</words>
And in the space between, he saw the tiny bell, its silence a testament to the relentless march of time. <words>485</words>
He opened his eyes, the bell still clutched in his hand. <words>507</words>
The silence of the meeting hall seemed less oppressive now, less like an absence and more like a canvas waiting to be filled. <words>539</words>
He would chronicle the silence, just as he had chronicled the noise. <words>562</words>
He would remember. <words>573</words>
