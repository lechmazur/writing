The last keystroke echoed in the stillness, a final punctuation mark on a life's work.  <words>22</words>
The worn typewriter sat silent, its keys cold beneath the single bare bulb that illuminated the dusty room. <words>46</words>
Ferdinand, a philodendron of considerable girth and even greater apathy, shifted his leaves, a rustle like dry paper against the silence. <words>75</words>
He'd witnessed the typing, the endless tapping, the furrowed brow, the occasional triumphant sigh. <words>101</words>
He'd seen the man age, the lines deepen around his eyes, the stoop in his shoulders grow more pronounced. <words>131</words>
But Ferdinand felt nothing. <words>143</words>
He was, after all, a houseplant. <words>156</words>
Or so he thought. <words>168</words>
The man, now gone, had left behind a single object on the desk: an embroidered bookmark, a vibrant splash of color against the faded wood. <words>196</words>
It depicted a winding path leading to a towering tree, its branches laden with books. <words>224</words>
Something stirred within Ferdinand, a prickle of curiosity, a yearning for something he couldn't name. <words>254</words>
He stretched a tendril towards the bookmark, its silken threads brushing against his leaf. <words>282</words>
A sudden, overwhelming urge to outrun the confines of his pot, to explore the world beyond the dusty window, seized him. <words>316</words>
He had to find that tree, that hidden knowledge. <words>335</words>
With a surprising burst of energy, Ferdinand unfurled his roots, tearing through the cracked terracotta. <words>363</words>
He slithered across the floor, a green wave of leaves and vines, propelled by a newfound purpose. <words>392</words>
He found himself outside, the night air cool against his leaves. <words>414</words>
The abandoned drive-in loomed before him, a skeletal silhouette against the moonlit sky. <words>441</words>
He sensed something there, a whisper of forgotten stories, a repository of untold tales. <words>470</words>
He would find the tree, even if it meant traversing the desolate landscape of the drive-in, even if it meant confronting the ghosts of memories past. <words>500</words>
