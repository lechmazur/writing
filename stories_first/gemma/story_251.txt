The prophet, Elara, ran a calloused thumb over the chipped surface of a milky-white marble. <words>22</words>
It was one of hundreds, each a fragment of a shattered whole, each whispering of a prophecy she couldn't quite grasp. <words>49</words>
She was a prophet, yes, but one burdened with a heart full of happily sad contradictions. <words>76</words>
Her visions were clear, yet muddled by a cosmic static, a jumble of possibilities that refused to coalesce. <words>108</words>
She knew the final oath was coming, a cosmic reset button that would scramble the scoreboard of fate, but the how, the when, the why â€“ those remained elusive. <words>151</words>

Elara lived in a lunar mining colony, a harsh, metallic landscape bathed in the cold, grey light of Earth. <words>180</words>
Between heartbeats, she sought answers in the most unlikely of places: a rummage sale box filled with discarded trinkets. <words>211</words>
There, nestled amongst broken toys and faded photographs, she found a jigsaw puzzle, its edges strangely familiar. <words>241</words>
Each piece, like her marbles, was a shard of a larger picture, a fragmented vision of the final oath. <words>272</words>

With bashful arrogance, Elara believed she could defragment the prophecy, piece together the cosmic puzzle. <words>306</words>
She spent her days meticulously sorting the puzzle edges, her fingers tracing the worn cardboard, her mind searching for connections. <words>340</words>
Each click of a piece into place sent a jolt of anticipation through her, a surge of hope that she was finally getting closer to the truth. <words>375</words>

As the puzzle slowly took shape, so too did Elara's understanding of the final oath. <words>399</words>
It wasn't about destruction, as she had initially feared, but about transformation. <words>424</words>
The cosmic scoreboard wasn't being erased, but rewritten, offering a chance for a new beginning, a fresh start for all. <words>456</words>
And Elara, the ambivalent prophet, the keeper of cracked marbles and fragmented visions, would be the one to guide the way. <words>489</words>
