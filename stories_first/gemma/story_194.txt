The scent of rosemary and thyme clung to Finnigan's flannel shirt as he pedaled through the twilight, the ancient ossuary looming ahead like a skeletal giant. <words>39</words>
He'd been drawn to the place since childhood, its gothic arches and weathered stone whispering tales of forgotten lives. <words>66</words>
Now, it housed "The Bone Appetit," a gourmet restaurant where the dead seemed to dine alongside the living. <words>94</words>
Finnigan, a lumberjack with hands as rough as bark and a heart as tender as new growth, felt strangely at home there. <words>126</words>
He was there to meet Elara, a woman whose eyes held the wisdom of centuries and whose touch could soothe even the most troubled soul. <words>158</words>
She was the only one who understood his nightmares, the ones that had plagued him since he found the coded letter tucked away in a hollowed-out log. <words>190</words>
The letter, a chilling message from a future war, had awakened a dormant fear within him, a fear he couldn't shake. <words>221</words>
Elara believed the nightmares held the key to healing, to understanding the ancient healing traditions his ancestors had practiced. <words>253</words>
She had promised to help him decipher the letter, to unlock the secrets it held. <words>281</words>
Tonight, she had a new method: through reawakened nightmares. <words>306</words>
Finnigan, despite his spirited nature, was gracefully awkward when it came to matters of the soul. <words>335</words>
He fidgeted with his worn leather gloves as Elara led him to a secluded alcove, the air thick with the scent of incense and old bones. <words>367</words>
She placed a hand on his forehead, her touch sending a shiver down his spine. <words>393</words>
"Let the nightmares come," she whispered, her voice a soothing balm. <words>418</words>
"Let them guide you." <words>431</words>
As Finnigan closed his eyes, the ossuary seemed to shift around him, the clatter of cutlery and hushed conversations fading into a distant hum. <words>462</words>
He was back in the forest, the air thick with smoke and the stench of burning wood. <words>488</words>
The coded letter burned in his hand, its message a searing brand on his mind. <words>515</words>
He knew then, with a clarity that startled him, that the letter wasn't just a warning, it was a call to action. <words>544</words>
He had to learn the healing traditions, not just for himself, but for the future. <words>571</words>
He had to be ready. <words>584</words>
