The journal lay open on the rough-hewn table, its pages brittle with age.  <words>18</words>
The last entry, scrawled in a hand that trembled with both age and excitement, spoke of a hidden wisdom, a truth buried deep within the heart of the asteroid. <words>51</words>
Kira, her fingers tracing the faded ink, felt a familiar thrum of empathy, a whisper of emotions long gone. <words>76</words>
She was an empath, a rare breed even among the space pirates who called this asteroid home. <words>101</words>
Her gift, or curse, allowed her to feel the echoes of others, their joys and sorrows, their hopes and fears. <words>130</words>
But here, in this forgotten journal, she sensed something different, something ancient and powerful. <words>158</words>
It spoke of a mountain, not of rock and stone, but of knowledge, a repository of forgotten truths. <words>187</words>
And at its peak, a dried starfish, a symbol of the wisdom it held. <words>209</words>

Kira closed her eyes, letting the emotions of the journal wash over her. <words>231</words>
She saw a vision, fragmented and hazy, of a shattered marionette, its limbs scattered across the asteroid. <words>259</words>
Each piece, she realized, held a piece of the mountain's wisdom. <words>281</words>
The journal's author, a long-dead pirate captain, had been trying to reassemble the marionette, to unlock the secrets it held. <words>310</words>
But he had failed, his efforts thwarted by the chaos and violence that plagued their world. <words>338</words>

Kira knew what she had to do. <words>351</words>
She would become the captain's successor, the marshal of forgotten wisdom. <words>374</words>
She would gather the fragments, piece by piece, and reassemble the marionette. <words>397</words>
It wouldn't be easy. <words>408</words>
The asteroid was a dangerous place, filled with outcasts and renegades, each with their own agendas. <words>435</words>
But Kira was driven by a drowsy enthusiasm, a quiet fire that burned within her. <words>460</words>
She would champion the outcasts of reason, those who sought knowledge and understanding in a world consumed by greed and violence. <words>491</words>
She would find the dried starfish, and with it, the wisdom of the mountain. <words>515</words>
