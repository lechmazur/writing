The elevator doors wheezed open, revealing an empty floor bathed in the eerie green glow of phosphorescent fungi clinging to the cavern walls.  <words>28</words>
A sigh, dry as dust, escaped the hermit's lips. Another day, another empty floor. <words>54</words>
He was the last one left, the sole inhabitant of this once-bustling subterranean city, a relic of a forgotten age. <words>81</words>
His only companions were the whispering echoes and the phosphorescent flora that pulsed with an unsettling life of its own. <words>115</words>
He clutched the blunt scissor in his hand, its dull edge a testament to his dwindling hope. <words>143</words>
It was strangely effective, though, at cutting through the thick vines that choked the water pipes, the only thing standing between him and a semblance of normalcy. <words>181</words>
He'd been trying to restore the water systems for months, a Sisyphean task in this silent, decaying world. <words>211</words>
The silence was the worst. <words>224</words>
It pressed down on him, a suffocating blanket of loneliness. <words>247</words>
He missed the hum of machinery, the chatter of voices, the smell of fresh bread wafting from the communal kitchens. <words>276</words>
He missed the world. <words>286</words>
He closed his eyes, trying to conjure the scent of that bread, the yeasty warmth that used to fill the air. <words>315</words>
It was a futile exercise, a cruel reminder of what he'd lost. <words>338</words>
But then, a faint, almost imperceptible scent tickled his nostrils. <words>361</words>
Bread. <words>366</words>
Fresh bread. <words>375</words>
His eyes snapped open. <words>384</words>
He sniffed the air again, his heart pounding. <words>396</words>
It was faint, but it was there. <words>407</words>
He wasn't alone. <words>416</words>
Someone else was here. <words>425</words>
And they were baking bread. <words>434</words>
A surge of hope, the first he'd felt in what seemed like an eternity, coursed through him. <words>462</words>
He grabbed the blunt scissor, its dull edge suddenly gleaming with possibility. <words>489</words>
He had work to do. <words>500</words>
