The worn leather of the plain cloth bag dug into Kaelen's shoulder, a familiar weight that mirrored the weariness in his bones. <words>25</words> He slumped against the cool stone wall of the breakroom, the silence after Brother Eldrin's resignation echoing in the cavernous space. <words>52</words> Kaelen, the monastery's most seasoned swordsman, felt a flicker of something akin to sympathy for the departing monk, but it was quickly extinguished by his own fierce apathy. <words>85</words>

He wasn't here for spiritual enlightenment or brotherly camaraderie. <words>108</words> He was here because of a promise, a whispered vow made to a younger, more idealistic version of himself. <words>132</words> A promise to keep searching, to keep hoping, even when the world seemed determined to snuff out the spark of defiance within him. <words>165</words>

Kaelen untied the bag, revealing a collection of worn maps and star charts, their edges frayed from years of use. <words>190</words> He traced the constellations etched onto the parchment, his calloused fingers lingering on the familiar patterns. <words>215</words> Tonight, the meteor shower would peak, a celestial spectacle that had guided him for years. <words>239</words>

The monastery, perched precariously on a floating rock, offered a breathtaking view of the night sky, unobstructed by earthly obstructions. <words>264</words> Kaelen climbed the winding stone stairs to the rooftop, the cool night air a welcome respite from the stifling atmosphere of the breakroom. <words>291</words>

As the first meteor streaked across the inky canvas, Kaelen felt a familiar tug, a pull towards the unknown. <words>317</words> It wasn't a conscious decision, more like an instinctual response to the celestial dance above. <words>342</words> He knew, with a certainty that defied logic, that the meteor shower held the key to fulfilling his promise. <words>368</words>

He had followed these celestial breadcrumbs for years, traversing treacherous landscapes and facing countless dangers. <words>394</words> Each meteor shower brought him closer, inch by agonizing inch, to the truth he sought. <words>421</words>

Tonight, he would overcome. <words>434</words> Tonight, he would finally understand the meaning of the spark that refused to be extinguished. <words>460</words>
