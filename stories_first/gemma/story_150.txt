The worn runic bone dice felt cool against Jericho's calloused fingers. <words>15</words> He rolled them between his palms, the symbols blurring in the dim light filtering through the observatory dome's stained glass. <words>38</words> The air hummed with the whirring of gears and the hiss of steam, a constant reminder of the city's relentless, clockwork pulse. <words>65</words> Jericho, a virtually peculiar outlaw cowboy poet, wasn't supposed to be here. <words>85</words> He was supposed to be out on the dusty plains, chasing sunsets and composing ballads about lost loves and forgotten dreams. <words>114</words> But something had drawn him to this steampunk observatory, to the rehearsals of the Celestial Chorus, a group of singers who claimed to harmonize with the stars. <words>147</words>

He'd heard whispers of their performances, of voices that could bend the very fabric of reality. <words>176</words> And Jericho, ever the seeker of the strange and the unknown, couldn't resist the pull. <words>203</words>

The rehearsals were held in the observatory's vast dome, a cathedral of brass and glass that seemed to pierce the very heavens. <words>232</words> The singers, clad in shimmering robes, stood in a circle, their voices rising and falling in a hypnotic melody. <words>261</words> Jericho, perched on a rickety scaffolding overlooking the scene, felt a strange tingling sensation, as if the music was weaving itself into his very being. <words>294</words>

But it was the walls of the observatory that truly captivated him. <words>316</words> They weren't static, but alive, covered in swirling patterns of text that shifted and changed with each note sung. <words>347</words> Words, phrases, entire poems materialized and vanished, a kaleidoscope of language that seemed to whisper secrets only Jericho could hear. <words>380</words>

He began to read, his fingers tracing the ephemeral script. <words>396</words> The words spoke of intertwined destinies, of choices made and paths not taken. <words>419</words> They spoke of a power hidden within the runic dice, a power that could misalign the very fabric of fate. <words>446</words>

Jericho's curiosity, already a raging fire, ignited into an unstoppable inferno. <words>472</words> He had to know more. <words>482</words> He had to understand the connection between the dice, the singers, and the ever-changing walls. <words>508</words>

He knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that his life was about to change forever. <words>538</words>
