The dim lights of the steampunk lounge cast long, flickering shadows across the worn velvet booths.  <words>26</words>
Cogsworth, the street performer, sat hunched over a chipped table, the rusted knight’s gauntlet clutched in his hand. <words>54</words>
He traced the intricate engravings, the metal cold and rough against his fingertips. <words>77</words>
It was a relic from a past life, a life he’d left behind, a life he desperately wanted to forget. <words>104</words>
But the gauntlet, a constant reminder of his oath, wouldn't let him. <words>127</words>
He was creatively blocked, his usual repertoire of juggling and acrobatics feeling hollow and meaningless. <words>155</words>
His mind was a tangled mess of guilt and regret, unable to conjure the joy he once found in entertaining. <words>184</words>
He remembered the day he’d sworn the oath, the weight of responsibility pressing down on him like a physical burden. <words>211</words>
He’d promised to protect the city, to uphold justice, to be a beacon of hope. <words>236</words>
But he’d failed. <words>245</words>
He’d let his fear consume him, his doubt cripple him. <words>266</words>
And now, the city was in danger, and he was powerless to stop it. <words>290</words>
He closed his eyes, trying to remember the feeling of the coral reef he’d explored as a child. <words>316</words>
The smooth, cool texture, the vibrant colors, the sense of peace and tranquility. <words>342</words>
He needed to find that peace again, that sense of purpose. <words>364</words>
He needed to remember why he’d taken the oath in the first place. <words>386</words>
He needed to offer peace to his sworn adversary, the one who held the city hostage. <words>411</words>
He needed to trust again. <words>424</words>
He opened his eyes, the rusted gauntlet gleaming in the dim light. <words>446</words>
It wasn't just a symbol of his past, it was a reminder of his potential. <words>472</words>
He could still be the hero the city needed. <words>490</words>
He could still make things right. <words>505</words>
