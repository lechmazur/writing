The static electricity garden hummed with a low, constant thrum.  <words>20</words>
Tiny sparks danced between the metal sculptures, illuminating the gathering dusk. <words>44</words>
Marco stood amongst the sculptures, his hands shoved deep in his pockets, a plain wooden crate slat clutched tightly in one fist. <words>71</words>
He was waiting. <words>80</words>
Not for a person, not exactly. <words>96</words>
He was waiting for the moment, the second, when a new silhouette would appear on the horizon, a silhouette he knew intimately, a silhouette that haunted his dreams. <words>139</words>
It had been five years since he'd last seen her, five years since he'd made the choice that had shattered their lives. <words>171</words>
Five years of trying to outrun the guilt, the shame, the memory of her tear-streaked face. <words>204</words>
He'd tried everything to escape the past, to outrun the ghost of who he used to be. <words>236</words>
He'd moved cities, changed his name, even tried to change his face. <words>262</words>
But the past, like a stubborn stain, refused to be erased. <words>285</words>
He'd come to this garden, this place of charged energy and fleeting connections, hoping to find a way to break free. <words>320</words>
He'd heard whispers of a woman who frequented the garden, a woman who seemed to understand the language of static, who could manipulate the very air around her. <words>365</words>
He'd started staging accidental meetings, leaving the crate slat, a symbol of their shared past, in places he knew she'd find it. <words>408</words>
He wasn't sure why he did it. <words>421</words>
Maybe it was a twisted form of apology, a way to say he was sorry without actually saying the words. <words>454</words>
Maybe it was a desperate attempt to connect, to find some semblance of redemption. <words>487</words>
Or maybe, just maybe, it was a way to learn the true meaning of resilience, to see if he could outlast the ghosts of his past. <words>529</words>
In the distance, a figure emerged from the gathering shadows. <words>552</words>
Marco's breath caught in his throat. <words>565</words>
It was her. <words>572</words>
She was holding the crate slat. <words>585</words>
