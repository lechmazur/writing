The flickering neon sign outside the "Cosmic Cocktail Lounge" cast a sickly green glow on Kai's face, highlighting the fatigue etched around his eyes. He adjusted the strap of his tool belt, the weight of his welding gear a familiar comfort.  <words>55</words>
He wasn't supposed to be here. An underwater welder in a repurposed planetarium turned nightclub? It was absurd. <words>81</words>
But the pull of the place, the whispers of a past life echoing through the cracked dome, had been too strong to resist. <words>115</words>
Kai was a man of two timelines, existing in the liminal space between the world he knew and the one he felt in his bones. <words>149</words>
He pushed through the heavy velvet curtains, the bass thumping like a heartbeat against his chest. <words>176</words>
The air was thick with the scent of cheap perfume and spilled liquor, a stark contrast to the sterile tang of chlorine he was used to. <words>208</words>
He scanned the room, his gaze drawn to a dusty display case filled with vintage trinkets. <words>235</words>
There, nestled amongst tarnished brooches and chipped porcelain dolls, was a small, wooden box overflowing with buttons. <words>263</words>
Each button was unique, a tiny portal to a forgotten era. <words>285</words>
He felt a tug, a yearning to touch them, to unlock the secrets they held. <words>311</words>
Kai was patiently impatient, a contradiction he'd learned to live with. <words>335</words>
He knew he shouldn't linger, but the box called to him, promising glimpses into a past he couldn't quite grasp. <words>364</words>
He approached the case, his reflection wavering in the dusty glass. <words>387</words>
The man staring back at him was a stranger, his eyes haunted by a longing he couldn't name. <words>414</words>
He reached out, his fingers brushing against the cool glass. <words>435</words>
In that instant, the world around him dissolved, replaced by a kaleidoscope of images: a bustling marketplace, a woman with eyes like the sea, a whispered promise. <words>466</words>
He saw himself, younger, stronger, wielding a power he couldn't comprehend. <words>491</words>
The vision faded, leaving him breathless, his heart pounding against his ribs. <words>518</words>
He knew then what he had to do. <words>531</words>
He had to unlock the secrets of the button box, to unravel the threads of his past and claim the power that was rightfully his. <words>562</words>
He had to pamper himself with these glimpses, these fragments of a life he'd forgotten, until the puzzle pieces clicked into place. <words>594</words>
He had to bridge the gap between timelines, to become whole. <words>616</words>
