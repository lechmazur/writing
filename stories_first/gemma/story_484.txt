The groggy brewer, Bartholomew, squinted at the piece of broken mirror clutched in his hand. It was uniquely generic, a shard of silvered glass reflecting nothing but the dusty spiral staircase leading up to the haunted mansion. <words>38</words>
He'd found it nestled amongst the overgrown weeds of the graveyard, a glint of something unnatural in the lull between the chants of the protestors. <words>71</words>
Their voices, a cacophony of righteous anger, had faded to a low murmur, gathering again like a storm on the horizon. <words>96</words>
Bartholomew, however, was more interested in the encroaching darkness that seemed to emanate from the mansion itself. <words>121</words>
It wasn't the darkness of night, but something older, deeper, a tangible presence that pressed against his skin like a cold hand. <words>148</words>
He'd come here seeking a way to become more than just a brewer, to become a living embodiment of his values, a beacon against the encroaching shadows. <words>181</words>
The shard of mirror, with its subtle discoloration, seemed to whisper promises of power, of a transformation that would allow him to stand against the tide of darkness. <words>212</words>
He took a deep breath, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, and began to climb the stairs. <words>236</words>
Each step creaked ominously, the sound echoing through the stillness of the graveyard. <words>259</words>
The protestors' voices rose again, a wave of sound that crashed against the mansion walls. <words>282</words>
Bartholomew ignored them, his focus solely on the shard in his hand and the darkness that beckoned him upwards. <words>308</words>
He reached the top of the stairs, the door to the mansion looming before him like a gaping maw. <words>332</words>
He hesitated for a moment, a flicker of doubt crossing his face. <words>353</words>
But then he remembered the encroaching darkness, the protestors' fading hope, and the shard of mirror, cold and heavy in his palm. <words>380</words>
With a flippant solemnity, he pushed open the door and stepped inside. <words>404</words>
The darkness welcomed him. <words>417</words>
