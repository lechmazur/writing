The minstrel, his lute silent against his knee, stared at the broken watch band, its leather strap frayed and useless. <words>22</words>
Heâ€™d been so careful, so meticulous in his preparations, yet here he was, stranded in the velvet expanse of the sky-lounge, time slipping through his fingers like grains of sand. <words>59</words>
He was a man of subjectively rational thought, a weaver of melodies and maps, but even his logic couldn't mend the broken thread of time. <words>91</words>
His gaze drifted to the stack of old Polaroid photographs scattered across the plush, midnight-blue carpet. <words>119</words>
Each one a fragment of a memory, a glimpse into the endless city below, a city that pulsed with secrets hidden in the shadows. <words>148</words>
He had come to this floating sanctuary, this haven above the urban sprawl, to excavate those secrets, to draw a map of the endless night. <words>185</words>
He believed that within the city's labyrinthine streets, within the whispers of its inhabitants, lay the key to understanding the boundaries of time itself. <words>221</words>
But now, with his watch broken, his sense of time fractured, he felt a wave of dismay wash over him. <words>249</words>
He picked up a photograph, its edges softened with age. <words>264</words>
It depicted a bustling marketplace, the air thick with the scent of spices and the murmur of a thousand voices. <words>290</words>
He could almost hear the laughter, the haggling, the clinking of coins. <words>312</words>
He closed his eyes, letting the image wash over him, searching for a clue, a thread to pull, a boundary to cross. <words>340</words>
He knew that the answers lay hidden within the city's fabric, woven into its very essence. <words>366</words>
He would find them. <words>376</words>
He had to. <words>383</words>
His laconic exuberance, his unwavering belief in the power of music and memory, would guide him. <words>411</words>
He would map the endless night, one photograph, one memory, one secret at a time. <words>440</words>
And when he did, he would mend the broken thread of time, not with a watch band, but with the music of the city itself. <words>474</words>
