<story>
The town-weary traveler, Elias, stumbled into the abandoned carnival, the rusted gates groaning like a tired beast. <words>25</words>
He’d been wandering for months, his mind a tangled mess of half-remembered dreams and anxieties. <words>51</words>
The carnival, with its peeling paint and cracked mirrors, promised a kind of oblivion, a place to lose himself. <words>78</words>
He found it, the house of mirrors, its warped reflections a mockery of reality. <words>103</words>
Inside, dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight that pierced the gloom. <words>127</words>
And there, in the center, a single stained glass panel, depicting a cradle of sparks, glowed with an ethereal light. <words>154</words>
It was beautiful, a beacon in the decaying grandeur. <words>171</words>
Elias reached out, his fingers tracing the intricate lines of the design. <words>191</words>
He felt a strange pull, a yearning to be closer to the light. <words>211</words>
Outside, the wind whipped through the skeletal remains of the Ferris wheel, its rusted chains clanging like a mournful song. <words>236</words>
A metal sign, advertising a long-gone sideshow, swung precariously, its edges catching the wind. <words>261</words>
Intentionally accidental, Elias thought, as he nudged the sign with his foot. <words>283</words>
It struck the stained glass panel with a sharp clang, a shower of sparks erupting from the impact. <words>308</words>
The sparks, like tiny fireflies, danced in the air, then settled on the dusty floor, each one a miniature sun. <words>333</words>
Elias watched, mesmerized, as the sparks seemed to pulse with a life of their own. <words>358</words>
He felt a shift within him, a loosening of the tight knot in his chest. <words>380</words>
The sparks, he realized, were fertilizing the barren landscape of his mind. <words>403</words>
They were a reminder that even in the darkest corners, beauty and hope could still exist. <words>429</words>
And in that moment, as the wind whispered through the broken windows and the sparks flickered around him, Elias felt a sense of peace he hadn't known in years. <words>460</words>
He closed his eyes, the image of the cradle of sparks imprinted on his mind. <words>483</words>
He was ready to face the world again, to love and be loved, to finally say those three words that had been trapped in his throat for so long. <words>511</words>
In the hush before someone finally says, “I love you,” Elias found his own spark. <words>536</words>
