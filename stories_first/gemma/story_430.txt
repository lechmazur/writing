The reaver, all sharp angles and chipped bone, sat on a bench in Kaleidoscope Park, the rusted metal groaning under his weight. <words>26</words>
He was a creature of shadows and scavenged scraps, his face a mask of perpetual disdain, his touch leaving a trail of frostbite on anything it grazed. <words>61</words>
But today, something was different. <words>73</words>
A crumpled piece of paper, adorned with crayon scribbles, lay nestled in his calloused hand. <words>95</words>
It was a child's drawing, a riot of color depicting a sun with a toothy grin and stick-figure people dancing around it. <words>125</words>
He traced the lines with a gnarled finger, a flicker of something akin to tenderness softening his usually harsh features. <words>155</words>
This was the first time he'd seen anything so...charmingly grotesque. <words>178</words>
The drawing was a stark contrast to the bleak landscape of his own existence, a world where beauty was a forgotten relic. <words>205</words>
He unfolded the paper carefully, smoothing out the creases. <words>223</words>
On the back, scrawled in childish handwriting, were a series of poems, each one a plea, a nag, a desperate attempt to understand the reaver's silence. <words>258</words>
"Why don't you talk?" one read. <words>269</words>
"Do you have a name?" another asked. <words>281</words>
The reaver's lips curled into a sardonic smile. <words>294</words>
He had a name, of course. <words>306</words>
But it was a name lost to time, buried under layers of pain and regret. <words>329</words>
He had chosen silence, a shield against the world's cruelty. <words>349</words>
But these poems, these childish pleas, were chipping away at his defenses. <words>373</words>
They reminded him of a time before the shadows, before the frostbite, before the need to hide. <words>401</words>
They reminded him of a time when he, too, had believed in the impossible, in the taste of stars in a single kiss. <words>430</words>
He looked up at the kaleidoscope sky, a swirling mass of color that mirrored the child's drawing. <words>455</words>
Maybe, just maybe, it wasn't too late to taste those stars again. <words>478</words>
Maybe, just maybe, he could break the generational pattern of silence and pain. <words>504</words>
