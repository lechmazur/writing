Bartholomew adjusted his spectacles, the lenses catching the faint, ethereal glow emanating from the salt crystal growing chamber. <words: 25>
He smoothed down his waistcoat, a nervous habit he couldn't seem to shake, even amidst the whirring and clicking of the automated laundry cycles that punctuated the otherwise silent chamber. <words: 61>
He was, after all, merely the understudy sorcerer, tasked with the mundane while the Master delved into the truly arcane. <words: 91>
But Bartholomew had a secret passion: tracking the evolution of culture through the whispers of the ancient oak grove that bordered the chamber. <words: 130>

He believed the grove held the key to understanding the unheard voices of the past, the forgotten murmurs of civilizations long gone. <words: 168>
Today, however, his pursuit was hindered by a most peculiar obstacle: a small cardboard box. <words: 196>
It sat innocuously on a nearby workbench, its plain brown exterior offering no hint of its contents. <words: 225>
Yet, Bartholomew couldn't shake the feeling that it held some significance, some whispered secret that threatened to disrupt his delicate eavesdropping. <words: 263>

He approached the box with the obnoxiously polite demeanor he'd cultivated over years of being overlooked. <words: 291>
"Good morning, esteemed box," he chirped, his voice echoing slightly in the cavernous chamber. <words: 320>
"Might I inquire as to the nature of your presence here?" <words: 345>
Of course, the box remained silent, its cardboard surface unyielding. <words: 369>
Undeterred, Bartholomew pressed on, his curiosity piqued. <words: 391>

He circled the box, his mind racing with possibilities. <words: 414>
Could it contain a relic from the grove? A forgotten spellbook? A message from the past? <words: 441>
His playful dread intensified. <words: 455>
He knew he shouldn't interfere, but the whispers of the grove seemed to urge him forward. <words: 483>
With a deep breath, Bartholomew lifted the lid of the box. <words: 506>

Inside, nestled amongst crumpled tissue paper, lay a single, perfectly formed salt crystal. <words: 534>
Bartholomew blinked, his obnoxiously polite facade crumbling. <words: 557>
The crystal pulsed with a faint, ethereal light, mirroring the glow of the chamber. <words: 584>
It was a simple object, yet it held a profound truth: the whispers of the past were not confined to the grove, but echoed in the very fabric of the present. <words: 619>
Bartholomew smiled, a genuine smile this time, as he realized his eavesdropping had led him to a far greater understanding. <words: 652>
The unheard voices were everywhere, waiting to be discovered. <words: 674>
