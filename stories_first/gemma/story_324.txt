The fluorescent lights hummed, a discordant symphony in the sterile white corridors of the headquarters.  <words>26</words>
Agent Silas, his face etched with a lifetime of suppressed anxieties, clutched the jar containing the brain. <words>53</words>
It was labeled "Duplicate," a chillingly clinical term for a consciousness trapped in a glass prison. <words>81</words>
Silas wasn't sure what to make of it, but the rumor had snagged him, a whisper in the hush of this simmering future. <words>115</words>
A dreamer's calling, they said. <words>128</words>
A way to access the echoes of the past, to glean knowledge from the forgotten. <words>155</words>
He wasn't sure he believed it, but the desperation gnawed at him, a constant, throbbing ache. <words>183</words>
He was an advisor, relegated to the shadows, his insights dismissed, his warnings ignored. <words>211</words>
This, this brain, this "duplicate," was his chance to prove them wrong, to finally be heard. <words>241</words>
He clutched the jar tighter, the cool glass a stark contrast to the clammy sweat on his palms. <words>271</words>
The abandoned wing of the headquarters was eerily silent, the air thick with the dust of forgotten missions. <words>299</words>
Each echoing footstep sent shivers down his spine, a reminder of the secrets these walls held. <words>327</words>
He reached a door marked "Restricted," the paint peeling, the metal rusted. <words>354</words>
He hesitated, his hand hovering over the handle. <words>370</words>
What if this was a mistake? <words>383</words>
What if the rumors were just that, rumors? <words>404</words>
But the dreamer's calling, the promise of knowledge, the chance to finally be seen, spurred him on. <words>434</words>
He pushed the door open, the hinges groaning in protest. <words>456</words>
Inside, a single spotlight illuminated a circular platform. <words>478</words>
In the center, a device hummed, its purpose unclear. <words>500</words>
Silas approached cautiously, the brain jar trembling in his hand. <words>523</words>
He placed it on the platform, his heart pounding in his chest. <words>546</words>
He jabbed the activation button, a surge of electricity coursing through the room. <words>573</words>
The brain pulsed, a faint light flickering within the jar. <words>594</words>
And then, a voice, raspy and distant, echoed through the chamber. <words>616</words>
"Who... who dares disturb my slumber?" <words>636</words>
Silas stared, his breath catching in his throat. <words>655</words>
The dreamer had awakened. <words>667</words>
