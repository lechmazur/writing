The rusted metal groaned beneath his boots, each step a jarring reminder of the spaceport's abandonment.  <words>26</words>
Jax, his face a mask of perpetual irritation, jogged along the cracked flight deck, the single chopstick clutched in his hand a stark contrast to the decaying grandeur around him. <words>61</words>
He wasn't sure why he kept coming back to this desolate place, this graveyard of forgotten dreams. <words>85</words>
Maybe it was the silence, a welcome respite from the cacophony of the black market he navigated. <words>113</words>
Or maybe it was the ghosts, the echoes of a time when starships soared and hope filled the air. <words>141</words>
Today, though, Jax was driven by something else, something abstractly physical, a gnawing in his gut that wouldn't be silenced. <words>175</words>
He needed to find the hidden waterfalls. <words>191</words>

He'd heard whispers, rumors of cascading water hidden deep within the abandoned spaceport, a secret oasis untouched by time. <words>221</words>
They said the water held answers, that its patterns held the key to unlocking the heart's revolt. <words>251</words>
Jax scoffed at the idea, but the desperation in his own heart was a siren song he couldn't ignore. <words>281</words>
He stopped jogging, his gaze sweeping across the desolate landscape. <words>305</words>
His eyes landed on a forgotten tea stall, its metal teapot still perched precariously on a rusted burner. <words>335</words>
An idea sparked, a desperate hope flickering in his chest. <words>357</words>

He knelt, carefully placing the chopstick into the teapot. <words>379</words>
He poured the last of his canteen water into the pot, the liquid swirling around the chopstick like a miniature whirlpool. <words>410</words>
Closing his eyes, he focused on the water, willing it to reveal its secrets. <words>433</words>
He saw patterns emerge, swirling eddies and fleeting shapes, a language whispered by the heart itself. <words>461</words>
The patterns spoke of hidden passages, of forgotten tunnels leading to the heart of the spaceport. <words>491</words>
And there, at the end of the labyrinth, lay the waterfalls, a testament to the enduring power of hope. <words>521</words>

Jax rose, a newfound determination hardening his features. <words>543</words>
He would find the waterfalls. <words>557</words>
He would memorialize them, not with stone or metal, but with the knowledge that even in the most desolate of places, the heart's revolt could still find its way to the light. <words>596</words>
