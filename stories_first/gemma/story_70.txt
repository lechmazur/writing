Bartholomew clutched the glass bulb, its filament a delicate, unlit promise. <words>15</words>
He ran a fingertip along its smooth surface, the cool glass a stark contrast to the humid air of the greenhouse. <words>35</words>
He was an uptight scribe, more comfortable with the precise order of ledgers than the chaotic beauty of this place. <words>57</words>
Yet, here he was, in a witch's greenhouse clinging precariously to a hill of gravestones, holding a prototype light bulb from Tesla's workshop. <words>89</words>
It was certainly uncertain how he'd gotten here, how this artifact had fallen into his possession. <words>115</words>
But the moment he'd seen it, nestled amongst the witch's peculiar collection of oddities, he knew he had to have it. <words>141</words>
He'd bartered a month's worth of meticulously copied manuscripts for it, a decision that had left his usually meticulous ledger in disarray. <words>173</words>
But something about the bulb, its potential to illuminate the darkness, resonated with a buried optimism within him. <words>203</words>
He'd spent weeks studying it, analyzing the leftover adhesive from a once-sealed envelope that had contained it. <words>231</words>
The witch, a woman with eyes as green as the moss creeping up the gravestones, had warned him against tampering with it. <words>261</words>
"It holds more than just light, scribe," she'd rasped, her voice like rustling leaves. <words>286</words>
"It holds a spark of something...else." <words>304</words>
But Bartholomew, driven by a need to understand, to bring order to the chaos, had pressed on. <words>333</words>
And now, in this moment, as he finally deciphered the last cryptic symbol etched onto the bulb's base, a puzzle piece clicked into place. <words>365</words>
He understood. <words>372</words>
The bulb wasn't just a source of light; it was a conduit, a bridge between worlds. <words>398</words>
And he, the uptight scribe, the man who craved order, was about to become its keeper. <words>426</words>
He took a deep breath, the air thick with the scent of herbs and damp earth. <words>452</words>
He would cradle empathy in the arms of steel, he decided, and use this light to illuminate the darkness within himself and the world. <words>488</words>
He would bellow its truth to the world, a beacon of hope in a world shrouded in shadows. <words>518</words>
