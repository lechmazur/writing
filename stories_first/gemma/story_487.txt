The greenhouse throbbed with the relentless pulse of drums.  <words>16</words>
Each beat vibrated through the humid air, shaking the leaves of carnivorous plants that swayed like hungry dancers. <words>39</words>
Boris, a mountain of a man with a disturbingly calm demeanor, barely flinched. <words>61</words>
He was used to the cacophony, the constant thrumming that echoed through the labyrinthine paths of the greenhouse. <words>86</words>
He was, after all, the gardener, the caretaker of this botanical nightmare. <words>111</words>
But tonight, the drums held a different rhythm, a frantic urgency that mirrored the turmoil in Boris's own heart. <words>138</words>
He clutched a tattered piece of parchment in his massive hand, the remnants of a map he'd painstakingly pieced together from fragments found beneath the floorboards. <words>171</words>
It spoke of a conductor's baton, rumored to possess the power to raise the dead, hidden somewhere within this verdant prison. <words>201</words>
Boris, a docile bruiser with a heart full of unspoken grief, yearned to believe. <words>228</words>
He wanted to mold a myth from the mud of reality, to bring back the one thing that mattered most. <words>259</words>
The map led him deeper into the greenhouse, past Venus flytraps with gaping maws and pitcher plants filled with glistening nectar. <words>290</words>
The air grew thick with the scent of decay and the promise of death. <words>314</words>
He navigated the twisting paths with an almost preternatural grace, his massive frame moving with surprising agility. <words>345</words>
The language of the map was a puzzle, a jumble of symbols and cryptic verses that defied translation. <words>376</words>
But Boris understood. <words>387</words>
He felt it in the rhythm of the drums, in the rustling of leaves, in the very air he breathed. <words>416</words>
He understood the language of grief, the language of loss, the language of desperate hope. <words>446</words>
Finally, he reached a clearing, a small, secluded space bathed in an ethereal glow. <words>475</words>
In the center, resting on a pedestal of twisted roots, lay the conductor's baton. <words>503</words>
It was simple, unassuming, yet it pulsed with an energy that sent shivers down Boris's spine. <words>534</words>
He reached for it, his hand trembling slightly. <words>551</words>
But before he could grasp it, a voice boomed through the greenhouse, a voice that seemed to rise from the very earth itself. <words>582</words>
"The price of resurrection is steep," it intoned, the words echoing through the labyrinth. <words>611</words>
Boris hesitated, his hand hovering inches from the baton. <words>633</words>
He knew the risks, the potential consequences. <words>654</words>
But the drums pounded in his ears, urging him forward, whispering promises of reunion. <words>683</words>
With a deep breath, Boris closed his eyes and grasped the baton. <words>706</words>
The world around him dissolved into a blinding white light. <words>726</words>
Then, silence. <words>735</words>
