The rusted hinges screamed as Elias heaved open the attic door, dust motes dancing in the sliver of sunlight that pierced the gloom. <words>26</words>
He coughed, the acrid scent of decay stinging his nostrils. <words>41</words>
This was the third abandoned building he'd scoured this week, each one a tomb of memories, each one a dead end. <words>67</words>
Elias, a man who'd always been more comfortable with numbers than people, had become a reluctant hero, thrust into this role by a loss so profound it had cracked the very foundations of his world. <words>105</words>
He'd lost his wife, Anya, to the Cataclysm, a cosmic event that had reshaped the planet, leaving behind a patchwork of ravaged landscapes and scattered survivors. <words>141</words>
He'd vowed to understand, to dissect the architecture of cosmic balance, to find some semblance of meaning in the chaos. <words>175</words>
That's why he was here, scouring dusty attics, his softly militant gaze fixed on the remnants of a life lived before the fall. <words>204</words>
He was looking for something, anything, that could shed light on the Cataclysm, a clue, a whisper from the past. <words>233</words>
His fingers brushed against something cold and metallic, half-hidden beneath a pile of moth-eaten blankets. <words>260</words>
He pulled it out, his heart quickening. <words>272</words>
A mariner's spyglass, its brass tarnished, its lens cloudy with age. <words>294</words>
He held it to his eye, peering through the grime. <words>311</words>
The world swam into focus, the rooftop farm where he grew his meager crops, the skeletal remains of skyscrapers piercing the hazy sky. <words>340</words>
And then, something else. <words>351</words>
A faint shimmer in the distance, a ripple in the fabric of reality. <words>372</words>
Elias lowered the spyglass, his breath catching in his throat. <words>391</words>
He didn't know what he was seeing, but he knew it was important. <words>412</words>
He had to get closer. <words>423</words>
He had to understand. <words>434</words>
He had to coerce the universe into revealing its secrets, even if it meant tearing apart the very space between the first tear and the final sigh. <words>470</words>
