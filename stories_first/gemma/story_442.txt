The flickering candlelight danced across the rough-hewn walls of the giant mushroom house, casting long, distorted shadows that writhed like living things.  <words>39</words>
Grog, the edgy tradesman, sat hunched over a table, his calloused fingers tracing the edges of a torn corner of a flyer. <words>69</words>
It depicted a windmill, its blades blurred as if caught in mid-rotation, a single word scrawled across its face: "Remember." <words>99</words>
He ran a thumb over the faded ink, a wave of comfortingly pessimistic nostalgia washing over him. <words>126</words>
He remembered the windmill, of course, but the memory was a hazy, fragmented thing, like a dream half-forgotten upon waking. <words>155</words>
He remembered the endless void, the suffocating darkness that pressed in on all sides, and the flickering candle, his only solace in the abyss. <words>190</words>
He remembered the synchronized watches, their ticking a metronome against the silence, guiding him through the swirling chaos. <words>224</words>
He remembered the vectorization process, the agonizing stretching and compressing of his being, the feeling of his very essence being torn apart and reassembled. <words>261</words>
But the why, the reason for this endless journey, remained elusive, a phantom limb aching in the recesses of his mind. <words>295</words>
He knew he had to carry the candle, that it was his purpose, his burden, his only hope. <words>325</words>
But why? <words>329</words>
He glanced at the flyer again, the windmill's blades seeming to spin faster, the word "Remember" pulsing with an eerie light. <words>360</words>
He closed his eyes, focusing on the synchronized ticking of his watch, the only anchor in the swirling vortex of his memories. <words>392</words>
He had to remember. <words>403</words>
He had to vectorize again. <words>416</words>
He had to carry the candle through the endless void. <words>438</words>
It was the final rotation of the forgotten windmill, and he was running out of time. <words>469</words>
