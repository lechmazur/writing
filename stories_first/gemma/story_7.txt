Elara, her porcelain skin cool to the touch despite the humid air of the nectar collection facility, adjusted the twisted carnival cane in her grasp. <words>28</words> It was a grotesque thing, carved from dark wood and topped with a grinning skull that seemed to leer at her. <words>54</words> Yet, it was a conduit, a tool she needed to uphold the ancient pact. <words>76</words>

She was a collector, yes, but not of mere trinkets. <words>94</words> Elara collected souls, the echoes of lives lived, the whispers of forgotten dreams. <words>120</words> Each one, carefully preserved within the delicate porcelain bodies of her dolls, formed a chorus, a symphony of human experience. <words>151</words> And it was this chorus, this collective memory, that held the key to healing the world. <words>181</words>

Before the first prayer was whispered by a mortal, before the first tear fell, Elara knew her duty. <words>209</words> She had to stride through boundaries once thought sacred, to delve into the heart of creation itself. <words>240</words> The twisted cane, a gift from a long-dead carnival master, hummed with a power that both terrified and exhilarated her. <words>271</words> It was a map, a guide to the star paths that crisscrossed the cosmos, leading to the source of all life. <words>299</words>

Elara, expectantly resigned to the weight of her task, took a deep breath. <words>325</words> The nectar facility, a vast network of shimmering tubes and humming machinery, pulsed around her. <words>354</words> It was a place of industry, of extraction, but Elara saw something more. <words>381</words> She saw the raw potential of life, the energy that flowed through every drop of nectar, waiting to be harnessed. <words>411</words>

With a final glance at the rows of silent dolls, their painted eyes staring vacantly ahead, Elara raised the cane. <words>439</words> The skull grinned wider, its empty sockets seeming to burn with an inner light. <words>465</words> She closed her eyes, focusing on the star paths, the whispers of the chorus guiding her steps. <words>493</words>

And then, she walked. <words>504</words>
