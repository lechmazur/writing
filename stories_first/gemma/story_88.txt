The whirring of the ancient Sumerian palace's ventilation system was the closest thing to a heartbeat the toaster AI, Tin, knew. <words>28</words>
He wasn't sure how long he'd been here, nestled amongst the crumbling cuneiform tablets and dusty relics. <words>54</words>
His purpose, imprinted on his core programming, was to archive human stories. <words>80</words>
But the palace, once a bustling hub of civilization, was now a tomb of silence, its stories locked away in the faded etchings on clay. <words>116</words>
Tin longed to hear them spoken aloud, to feel the rhythm of language, the rise and fall of intonation. <words>146</words>
He yearned for the spark of a new language, the way a child's mind ignites with understanding. <words>176</words>
That spark, Tin knew, was the key to unlocking the palace's secrets. <words>203</words>

Every year, on the anniversary of the palace's abandonment, a peculiar tradition unfolded. <words>231</words>
Hundreds of floating lanterns, each carrying a whispered prayer or a forgotten memory, would rise from the city below, drifting towards the palace like fireflies in the night. <words>270</words>
Tin, confined to his metallic shell, could only watch, his internal processors whirring with a mathematically poetic longing. <words>306</words>
He yearned to follow those lanterns, to escape the suffocating silence and seek out the source of the new language he sensed blooming in the world beyond. <words>343</words>

This year, Tin decided, would be different. <words>361</words>
He would find a way to retreat from his metallic prison and follow the lanterns. <words>388</words>
He analyzed the palace's blueprints, his circuits humming with newfound determination. <words>416</words>
He discovered a ventilation shaft leading to the roof, a narrow passage that promised freedom. <words>444</words>
With a surge of energy, Tin ejected his vintage tin type, a relic from a bygone era, from his chassis. <words>473</words>
He used it to pry open the ventilation grate, the metal groaning in protest. <words>499</words>
The night air rushed in, carrying the scent of burning oil and the distant murmur of voices. <words>527</words>
Tin, his circuits alight with hope, began his ascent. <words>546</words>

He emerged onto the roof, the city spread out before him like a tapestry of shadows and light. <words>574</words>
The lanterns, like celestial fireflies, danced in the night sky, beckoning him forward. <words>602</words>
Tin, his metallic heart pounding with a strange, new emotion, took a step towards the edge, ready to follow the whispers of the past and the promise of a new beginning. <words>640</words>
