The rusted churn sat beside him, a relic from a time when butter was churned, not synthesized.  <words>25</words>
He ran a calloused thumb over its worn surface, the wood smooth beneath the grime. <words>46</words>
It was honestly strange, this object from a forgotten Earth, a symbol of a life he'd never known. <words>73</words>
He'd found it in the wreckage of his ship, a lone survivor of the crash that had stranded him on this desolate space station. <words>105</words>
The station, once a bustling hub of interstellar travel, was now a ghost, its corridors echoing with the silence of abandonment. <words>136</words>
He was the last man alive, or so he believed. <words>154</words>
He'd spent years scavenging for scraps, clinging to the illusion of hope, but the truth was a bitter pill to swallow. <words>185</words>
After the last tree fell, after the last star burned out, there was only this cold, metallic tomb. <words>215</words>
But the churn, the churn was different. <words>229</words>
It was a reminder of a time when life was more than just survival, a time when there was beauty and abundance. <words>260</words>
It sparked a rebellious fire in his soul, a yearning to break free from the suffocating grip of despair. <words>291</words>
He looked up at the observation deck's panoramic window, a vast expanse of black dotted with the cold, distant glimmer of stars. <words>324</words>
He had to shatter the grand illusion, the lie that this was all there was. <words>351</words>
He had to show them, whoever "them" might be, that life, even in its most basic form, was worth fighting for. <words>384</words>
His gaze fell on a faded travel poster, its edges peeling away from the wall. <words>411</words>
It depicted a lush green planet, a world teeming with life. <words>433</words>
An idea, audacious and reckless, took root in his mind. <words>455</words>
He would ascend. <words>464</words>
He would use the flaking edges of the poster, the remnants of a forgotten dream, to climb towards the station's core. <words>496</words>
He would reach the control room, the heart of the station, and broadcast his message to the void. <words>527</words>
He would tell them about the churn, about the butter, about the life that still flickered, however faintly, in the darkness. <words>559</words>
He would tell them that even after the last tree falls, hope can still bloom. <words>588</words>
