The neon signs of the night market flickered back to life, sputtering like dying fireflies after the storm finally used up its last rumble.  <words>31</words>
Jax, a broke swashbuckler with a fashionably unfashionable air, hunched deeper into his threadbare coat. <words>58</words>
He wasn't here for the greasy noodles or the chipped cybernetic implants hawked by vendors with eyes like burnt-out bulbs. <words>86</words>
He was here for the whispers, the rumors that snaked through the crowd like smoke. <words>113</words>
Rumors of a vintage hatpin, rumored to hold the key to a forgotten fortune. <words>141</words>
Jax needed that fortune. Not for himself, but for the orphanage he'd sworn to protect, a haven of kindness in a world on fire. <words>173</words>

He pushed through the throng, his boots crunching on shattered glass and discarded synth-skin. <words>201</words>
His gaze swept over the stalls, searching for the telltale glint of antique silver. <words>228</words>
Finally, tucked away in a corner, he found her. <words>246</words>
A woman with eyes as sharp as shattered glass and a voice like gravel. <words>273</words>
"Looking for something specific, sweetheart?" she rasped, her gaze lingering on Jax's worn leather boots. <words>302</words>

Jax met her stare, his own eyes reflecting the neon glow. <words>325</words>
"A hatpin," he said, his voice rough with disuse. <words>346</words>
"Vintage. Silver. With a ruby at the top." <words>368</words>
The woman's lips curled into a knowing smile. <words>390</words>
"I might just have what you're looking for," she purred, her fingers tracing the outline of a tarnished silver box. <words>420</words>

She opened it, revealing a hatpin that seemed to hum with a faint, inner light. <words>447</words>
Jax reached for it, his fingers brushing against the cool metal. <words>470</words>
But before he could grasp it, the woman's hand shot out, stopping him. <words>494</words>
"Not so fast," she said, her voice hardening. <words>516</words>
"This ain't just any hatpin. It holds a secret. A map." <words>539</words>

She pointed to the ruby, its facets catching the flickering neon light. <words>562</words>
"Chart the swirl of antique marbles scattered under a bed," she instructed, her voice low and urgent. <words>591</words>
"That's how you'll find what you seek." <words>612</words>
Jax stared at the hatpin, his mind racing. <words>633</words>
He didn't understand, but he knew he had to trust her. <words>655</words>
He had to find that fortune, for the children. <words>676</words>
He had to shelter kindness in a world on fire. <words>699</words>

He paid the woman, his last few credits burning a hole in his pocket. <words>724</words>
As he walked away, the hatpin warm in his hand, he emitted a fervent apathy, a quiet determination to overcome the adversity that stood between him and his goal. <words>758</words>
