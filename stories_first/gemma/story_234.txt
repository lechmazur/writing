The museum was silent, save for the rhythmic drip of a leaky pipe somewhere in the cavernous hall.  <words>25</words>
Kenji, the gentle swordsman, knelt beside the towering Brachiosaurus skeleton, its long neck reaching towards the vaulted ceiling. <words>52</words>
He ran a calloused thumb over the smooth, polished bone, feeling the echoes of a life long gone. <words>76</words>
He was a late bloomer, Kenji. <words>88</words>
His swordsmanship, honed to a razor's edge, had only begun to blossom in his late twenties, a testament to his patient, unwavering spirit. <words>121</words>
But tonight, he wasn't here for sparring. <words>134</words>
Tonight, he was here for something far more profound. <words>151</words>
He reached into his pocket, his fingers brushing against the familiar weight of the empty matchbox. <words>174</words>
It was a gift from his mentor, a man who had seen the universe in a grain of sand, who had taught Kenji the art of seeing beyond the obvious. <words>206</words>
The matchbox, once filled with the promise of fire, was now a vessel for something far more potent: a coded message, hidden in the angles of a half-painted sundial. <words>250</words>
Kenji, faithfully unfaithful to the traditional ways, had embraced his mentor's xenophile tendencies, seeking knowledge and wisdom from cultures beyond his own. <words>286</words>
The sundial, a relic from a forgotten civilization, held the key to unlocking a secret, a secret that could cradle the universe in a cupped hand. <words>325</words>
He traced the angles with his finger, his brow furrowed in concentration. <words>346</words>
The orchard dog, usually a relentless barker, had finally fallen silent. <words>368</words>
It was a sign. <words>376</words>
Kenji closed his eyes, letting the silence wash over him. <words>393</words>
He felt the weight of the universe pressing down on him, the vastness of space and time swirling around him. <words>421</words>
And then, he saw it. <words>431</words>
The code, revealed in a flash of insight, unfolded before him like a map to the cosmos. <words>456</words>
He smiled, a brusque affection for the universe blooming in his chest. <words>479</words>
He had found his purpose. <words>491</words>
He would cradle the universe in his cupped hand, not through brute force, but through understanding. <words>520</words>
