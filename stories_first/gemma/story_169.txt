The tea platform bobbed gently, a lone island of polished wood amidst a sea of swirling, iridescent refuse.  <words>26</words>
Bartholomew adjusted his cravat, the silk catching on the edge of his meticulously sculpted beard. <words>52</words>
He surveyed his domain, a kingdom built on the discarded dreams of others. <words>75</words>
Here, amidst the flotsam and jetsam of a thousand lifetimes, Bartholomew plied his peculiar trade. <words>103</words>
He was a soul-broker, a purveyor of second chances, and his currency was memory. <words>131</words>

Bartholomew wasn't your typical salesman. <words>149</words>
He didn't rely on charm or charisma. <words>166</words>
His method was far more esoteric, far moreâ€¦ peculiar. <words>188</words>
He read the past. <words>198</words>
Not from dusty tomes or crumbling scrolls, but from the most unlikely of sources: discarded glass bottles. <words>226</words>

Each bottle, a vessel of forgotten moments, held within its glassy depths a whisper of a life lived. <words>256</words>
Bartholomew would carefully select a bottle, its label obscured by years of grime and neglect. <words>285</words>
Then, with a practiced hand, he would hold it up to the light, squinting at the reversed lettering. <words>314</words>
As he deciphered the faded script, the bottle would hum, a low, resonant vibration that seemed to emanate from the very core of the glass. <words>346</words>

And then, the memories would flow. <words>358</words>
Scenes would flicker before his eyes, snippets of conversations, snatches of laughter, the bittersweet ache of loss. <words>389</words>
But Bartholomew wasn't interested in the mundane. <words>408</words>
He sought something more profound, something lost to the ages: forgotten songs. <words>435</words>

He believed that within these discarded bottles lay the melodies of a thousand forgotten cultures, the echoes of ancient lullabies and forgotten anthems. <words>471</words>
His goal was to collect these lost songs, to piece together a symphony of the past, a testament to the enduring power of music. <words>504</words>

He picked up a dusty wine bottle, its label barely visible beneath a thick layer of grime. <words>531</words>
Holding it up to the light, he began to read the reversed inscription. <words>555</words>
As the bottle hummed, a melody began to form in his mind, a haunting, ethereal tune that seemed to rise from the depths of time itself. <words>588</words>
Bartholomew closed his eyes, letting the music wash over him, his body swaying gently as if choreographing a forgotten dance. <words>620</words>

He was a weirdly static figure, his movements precise and controlled, yet there was a strange grace to his every gesture. <words>653</words>
He was a conduit, a vessel through which the past flowed, a soul-broker who traded in the currency of memory and melody. <words>686</words>

And as the last notes of the forgotten song faded away, Bartholomew knew that his work was far from over. <words>718</words>
There were countless bottles left to read, countless songs waiting to be rediscovered. <words>746</words>
The floating tea platform bobbed gently, a silent witness to the grand, modest work of a soul-broker who danced with the ghosts of the past. <words>780</words>
