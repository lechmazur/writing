The worn leather bridle chafed against Kaelen's cybernetic hand, a physical reminder of the life he'd left behind. <words>25</words> He was a cyber-templar, sworn to protect the fragile peace, but the storm raging above the sky burial site threatened to shatter it all. <words>55</words> Lightning cracked, illuminating the skeletal remains laid out on the windswept plateau, a stark tableau against the bruised purple sky. <words>83</words>

Kaelen was patiently frantic. <words>95</words> He knew the storm wasn't natural. <words>107</words> It was a weapon, a manifestation of the chaos that lurked just beyond the veil of their carefully constructed reality. <words>133</words> The mirage of safety they'd built was crumbling, and he was the only one who could see it. <words>161</words>

He clutched the bridle tighter, its worn leather a grounding force against the euphoric agitation that pulsed through him. <words>190</words> He had to prove they weren't helpless, that their peace wasn't an illusion. <words>216</words> He had to reflect the lightning back at the storm, show it that their world wouldn't be so easily broken. <words>244</words>

He raised his other hand, the one augmented with the prism. <words>260</words> It hummed with contained energy, a conduit for the storm's own power. <words>284</words> Through the refraction of light, he would bend the storm's fury, turn its destructive force against itself. <words>314</words>

As another bolt arced down, Kaelen focused. <words>327</words> He saw the world through the prism, a kaleidoscope of fractured light and distorted angles. <words>354</words> The lightning, a jagged spear of white-hot energy, became a ribbon of pure potential. <words>382</words>

He channeled his will, his cybernetic enhancements amplifying his intent. <words>406</words> The prism flared, catching the lightning and bending it back towards the storm. <words>433</words> A blinding flash, a deafening roar, and then silence. <words>454</words>

The storm dissipated, the clouds parting to reveal a sky washed clean by the rain. <words>481</words> Kaelen lowered his hand, the bridle still clutched in his other. <words>502</words> He had proven them wrong. <words>513</words> The mirage of safety wasn't shattered. <words>526</words> It was real, and he would defend it, even if it meant standing alone against the storm. <words>553</words>
