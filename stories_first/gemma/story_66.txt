The cracked mirror reflected a face he barely recognized, a ghost of the soldier he once was.  <words>25</words>
He traced the jagged lines, each one a memory, a shard of a life he'd left behind. <words>51</words>
He was a deserter, a quiet one, slipping away from the endless cycle of violence, seeking solace in the dizzyingly grounded world of plant communication. <words>85</words>
The lab, filled with the soft hum of machinery and the scent of damp earth, was his sanctuary. <words>112</words>
Here, amidst the tangle of wires and the delicate dance of roots, he found a strange kind of peace. <words>139</words>
He spent his days piecing together jigsaw puzzles, each one a fragmented image of a forgotten world. <words>166</words>
But it was the shattered porcelain masks that truly captivated him. <words>185</words>
Each shard, a story waiting to be reconstructed, a life waiting to be understood. <words>212</words>
He meticulously gathered the pieces, his fingers tracing the delicate curves and the faded paint. <words>239</words>
