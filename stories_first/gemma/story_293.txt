The minstrel adjusted his lute, the worn leather straps digging into his shoulders. He glanced at the crumpled photograph tucked into his pocket, its edges softened by years of anxious handling. <words>28</words>
He rarely looked at it anymore, but tonight, with the lonely candle flame flickering on the table before him, threatening to gutter out, he felt the familiar pang of longing. <words>61</words>
This city, powered by the tireless work of bioluminescent bacteria, pulsed with a strange, artificial life. <words>83</words>
It was a marvel of engineering, a testament to human ingenuity, but it felt sterile, predictable. <words>107</words>
He yearned for something more, something beyond the endless cycle of performances and applause. <words>131</words>
He wanted to escape the ordinary, to find purpose in a world that seemed to offer none. <words>156</words>
The photograph, a faded image of a woman with eyes that sparkled like distant stars, was his only reminder of a life beyond these glowing walls. <words>181</words>
He'd heard whispers of a place beyond the city limits, a place where the stars were visible, unfiltered by the city's bioluminescent haze. <words>206</words>
A place where the night sky was a map, a guide to something greater. <words>228</words>
He'd scoffed at first, dismissing it as a fairy tale, but the longing in his heart wouldn't be silenced. <words>251</words>
Tonight, with the candle flame sputtering, threatening to plunge him into darkness, he decided to act. <words>274</words>
He pulled out the photograph, tracing the outline of the woman's face with a calloused finger. <words>296</words>
He remembered her words, spoken with a rare sincerity he'd rarely heard from her: "Follow the stars, my love. They will lead you home." <words>321</words>
He tucked the photograph back into his pocket, a newfound determination hardening his gaze. <words>344</words>
He would deploy his lute, not as a tool for entertainment, but as a compass. <words>366</words>
He would follow the star patterns, the ancient melodies etched into the strings, leading him away from the city's artificial glow and towards the unknown. <words>391</words>
He would find his purpose, even if it meant leaving everything he knew behind. <words>414</words>
The candle flame finally flickered out, plunging the room into darkness. <words>436</words>
But the minstrel didn't flinch. <words>449</words>
He smiled, a cautious revelry lighting up his face. <words>469</words>
He was finally free. <words>480</words>
