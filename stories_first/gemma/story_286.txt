The nanobotanical garden hummed with a life that felt both alien and achingly familiar.  <words>25</words>
Elias, a professional apologizer by trade, sat hunched over a table, his fingers tracing the grooves of a shard of broken vinyl. <words>52</words>
It was a relic from a time before, a time of laws and order, a time when music flowed freely, not in digitized packets but in the warm crackle of analog. <words>85</words>
He was wildly reserved, his apologies always measured, precise, devoid of the emotional outbursts that often accompanied genuine remorse. <words>121</words>
But here, in this garden of bioengineered flora, he felt a strange kinship with the broken record, a shared sense of being out of time, out of place. <words>160</words>
He was mapping the seasonal changes of the garden, not with scientific instruments, but with the nuance of his apologies. <words>190</words>
Each apology, tailored to the specific bloom or wilt of a particular plant, was a tiny echo of authenticity in a world that had forgotten the meaning of the word. <words>226</words>
He believed that by unlocking the city's folklore, scribbled on bar napkins and whispered in alleyways, he could piece together a map of the garden's soul. <words>264</words>
The last human law had been broken long ago, a law that had attempted to regulate the very essence of being human: the ability to feel, to love, to apologize. <words>306</words>
Now, in the aftermath, Elias felt a strange elation mixed with a bone-deep fatigue. <words>335</words>
He was tired of apologizing for a world that no longer understood the need for them. <words>363</words>
But he continued, driven by a faint hope that somewhere, in the rustling leaves and the fragrant blooms, he might find a way to make amends, not just to the garden, but to himself. <words>403</words>
