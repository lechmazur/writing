The air hung thick with the scent of dust and old magic, a familiar comfort to Elara, the outcast scholar. <words>25</words> She clutched the seashell tighter, its smooth surface cool against her palm. <words>43</words> The strange symbol etched into its side pulsed faintly, a rhythm that echoed the frantic beat of her heart. <words>71</words>

Elara was in the witch's flying carpet garage, a cavernous space filled with moth-eaten tapestries and the hulking forms of slumbering carpets. <words>105</words> It was a place of hushed whispers and forgotten spells, a fitting sanctuary for someone like her, someone who sought knowledge in the shadows. <words>140</words>

She had found the seashell tucked away in a dusty tome, its pages filled with cryptic verses about mirroring the soul. <words>171</words> The author, a long-dead sorcerer, claimed the shell held the key to understanding the true nature of time, a concept that had consumed Elara's every waking thought. <words>211</words>

She had spent weeks deciphering the sorcerer's riddles, her only clue a series of seemingly random dates and locations. <words>243</words> Finally, the trail had led her here, to this forgotten corner of the witch's domain. <words>273</words>

The diaries, hidden behind a loose tile in a grimy public restroom, had been her breakthrough. <words>305</words> They spoke of a ritual, a way to use the shell to glimpse into the heart of midnight, the witching hour when the veil between worlds thinned. <words>343</words>

Elara knew the risks. <words>354</words> To tamper with time was to invite chaos, but she was driven by a desperate need to prove that midnight, like all things, was finite. <words>389</words> It couldn't last forever, could it? <words>409</words>

She took a deep breath, the air catching in her throat. <words>428</words> The symbol on the shell pulsed brighter, sending a jolt of energy through her. <words>454</words>

Trusting the sorcerer's words, trusting the strange pull of the shell, Elara closed her eyes and whispered the incantation. <words>490</words>

The world dissolved into a swirl of colors and sensations. <words>511</words>
