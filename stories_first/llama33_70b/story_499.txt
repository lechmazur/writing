With a sense of determination, I slipped off my worn leather sandals, and let the cool earth beneath my feet ground me, as I began to write my own story, one that would be filled with poetry and reason, and would ultimately set me free <words>706</words>. As the music above grew louder, I smiled, knowing that I was ready to take control of my destiny, and that nothing would ever be the same again <words>746</words>. And with that, I disappeared into the underground orchard, ready to face whatever lay ahead, my heart filled with a sense of purpose and my mind filled with the poetry of my newfound freedom <words>806</words>. </story>
