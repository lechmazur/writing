<story> In the desolate expanse of the glacial orchard, suspended precariously over a crevasse of blue ice, a guarded druid named Eira stood with her feet rooted to the frozen earth, her eyes fixed on the barren trees as if willing them to bloom, a feat that seemed as impossible as her own attempt to break the silence that had shrouded her for centuries, a silence born from a crippling fear that had taken hold after the last human set foot on earth, leaving her the sole guardian of a world that seemed to have lost its purpose <words>396</words>. The druid's fingers instinctively went to the dull safety pin that hung around her neck, a token from a time long past, when humans still walked the earth and she had been a part of their world, not just a fiercely ambivalent observer of its demise <words>436</words>. As she stood there, lost in thought, Eira realized that she needed to gather the remnants of her resolve and face her fear head-on, to find a way to overcome it and reclaim her place in this new, empty world <words>476</words>. She decided that the best way to do this would be to prepare a special family meal, one that had been passed down through generations of her kin and was only ever made on birthdays, a tradition that seemed both poignant and absurd in this desolate landscape <words>516</words>. With a sense of dour amusement, Eira set about gathering the necessary ingredients, her movements economical and precise as she worked to recreate the familiar rhythms of a long-lost life <words>546</words>. As she cooked, the aroma of roasting meats and steaming vegetables wafted through the glacial orchard, a savory scent that seemed to mock the desolation around her, even as it brought a sense of comfort and peace to the druid's troubled heart <words>576</words>. And when the meal was finally ready, Eira sat down to eat, the flavors and textures transporting her back to a time when the world was full of life and laughter, and she was not alone <words>596</words>. In this moment, surrounded by the echoes of her past and the stark beauty of the glacial orchard, Eira felt the silence that had held her captive for so long begin to break, like the ice that creaked and groaned beneath her feet <words>616</words>. </story>
