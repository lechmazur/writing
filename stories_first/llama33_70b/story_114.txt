<story> In the shared dream recording studio, where the air was thick with the whispers of subconscious minds, an apathetic summoner named Kael sat amidst the eerie silence, surrounded by the remnants of a world that had lost its divine spark after the last breath of a dying god <words>156</words>. The studio, once a hub of creative expression, now felt like a hollow shell, its walls adorned with empty frames that seemed to mock Kael's lack of inspiration <words>236</words>. As an enthusiastically lazy individual, Kael had always found solace in the mundane, and their eyes wandered to a rustic coffee grinder that sat on a nearby shelf, its worn wooden handle a testament to the countless mornings it had helped brew coffee for the studio's patrons <words>316</words>. The grinder's gentle curves and soft scent seemed to embody the river wisdom that Kael had always sought to tap into, a wisdom that flowed like a tranquil stream, carrying with it the secrets of the universe <words>386</words>. With a newfound sense of purpose, Kael decided to unfold the mysteries of the empty frames, using them as a method to tap into the collective unconscious and find a way to rebuild the coral reefs that had been destroyed in the chaos following the god's demise <words>446</words>. As they began to match the frames, hanging them in a deserted hall that seemed to stretch on forever, Kael felt the gentle sharpness of their own apathy slowly giving way to a sense of determination, their enthusiasm for laziness transforming into a passion for creation <words>506</words>. And so, with each frame that fell into place, Kael felt the river wisdom flowing through them, guiding their hands as they worked to bring new life to the barren reefs, their actions a testament to the power of even the most apathetic of souls to unfold and find purpose in a world without gods <words>566</words>. </story>
