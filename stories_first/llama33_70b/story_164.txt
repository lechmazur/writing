The air was thick with the smell of smoke and ozone, but Kael's gaze was drawn to the single skylight above, where dust motes danced in the faint beam of sunlight, their swirl a reminder of the beauty that lay just beyond the city's grasp <words>306</words>.

His motivation was to weave fantasy into reality's cracks, to bring a touch of the wild into this sterile environment, and as he worked, his botanical drawings seemed to take on a life of their own, the lines and curves blending with the city's steel and concrete to create something new, something alive <words>606</words>. With a drifting arrogance, Kael felt himself becoming a master weaver, threading together the disparate elements of his world to create a tapestry of reclaiming the wild, one that would soon envelop the entire city, and as he gazed out at the skylight, he smiled, knowing that his work was only just beginning <words>756</words>.
