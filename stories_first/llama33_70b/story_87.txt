The hiss of the pipes and the tick of the clockwork machines faded into the distance as she disappeared into the crowd, leaving behind only the faintest whisper of her presence, and the wrinkled sticker sheet, a reminder of the journey she had undertaken, and the hollow victory she had won <words>586</words>.</story>
