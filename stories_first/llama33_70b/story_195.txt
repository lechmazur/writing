<story>As the nomad caravan wound its way through the desert landscape, a forlorn roustabout named Kael trudged alongside, his eyes fixed on the ground as he clutched a small spool of thread in his calloused hand, a token from his childhood that he couldn't explain, but couldn't bear to part with either <words>156</words>.
