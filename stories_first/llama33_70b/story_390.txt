But for now, she was alone with the whispers, and the botanical press, and the endless possibilities that seemed to unfold before her like a map to hidden treasure <words>516</words>. And so she stood there, poised on the threshold of discovery, the calm assassin with a heart full of wonder, and a mind full of questions <words>536</words>. </story>
