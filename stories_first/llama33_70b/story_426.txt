The cracked porcelain teapot she carried with her, a family heirloom passed down through generations, was a symbol of her connection to the past, a reminder of the folk medicines that had been all but forgotten in the wake of modernity, and it was this motivation that drove her to continue her search for the lost remedies, no matter how elusive they seemed <words>306</words>.
