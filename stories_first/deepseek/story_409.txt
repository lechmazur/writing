The bruised fighter stood in the dusty attic, his knuckles raw and his spirit weary, surrounded by clockwork animals frozen in lifeless motion. <words>25</words> He clutched a clay pot shard, its jagged edges pressing into his palm, the inscription barely legible in the dim light: "Stand for something, or fall for everything." <words>52</words> The words echoed in his mind, a reminder of the battles he had fought—and lost—both in the ring and within himself. <words>76</words> At that moment, far away, a sculptor’s chisel struck marble for the first time, the sound reverberating through the air like a distant drumbeat. <words>102</words> The fighter winced, as if the strike had landed on his own fractured resolve. <words>115</words>  

He had always been skillfully incompetent, a paradox that defined him: a man who could dodge a punch but never his own failures. <words>143</words> The attic, with its forgotten dreams and mechanical creatures, felt like a mirror of his soul—dusty, broken, and waiting for someone to wind it back to life. <words>173</words> He had come here to extinguish the last vestige of self-deception, to confront the truth he had buried beneath layers of excuses and half-hearted efforts. <words>205</words>  

As he traced the inscription on the shard, the air around him shifted, and the clockwork animals began to stir, their gears creaking with a life they had long forgotten. <words>240</words> One by one, they turned their glassy eyes toward him, their movements jerky yet deliberate. <words>258</words> The fighter stepped back, his heart pounding, as a mechanical lion lunged at him, its claws glinting in the faint light. <words>282</words> He dodged, his instincts kicking in, but the lion was relentless, its movements guided by something beyond mere mechanics. <words>309</words>  

In the chaos, he realized what was happening: the attic was abducting him, pulling him into its forgotten dreams, forcing him to face the truths he had avoided. <words>341</words> The lion’s roar was silent, but its message was clear: "Stand for something, or fall for everything." <words>362</words> The fighter gritted his teeth, his bruised body protesting every movement, but he refused to fall. <words>383</words> He grabbed a rusted gear from the floor and hurled it at the lion, shattering its glass eye. <words>403</words>  

As the lion collapsed, the attic fell silent, the clockwork animals returning to their frozen state. <words>425</words> The fighter stood amidst the wreckage, the clay pot shard still in his hand, its inscription now etched into his heart. <words>449</words> He had stood for something, and in doing so, he had found the strength to keep fighting. <words>468</words>
