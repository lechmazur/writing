The arrogant swordsman stood in the calligraphy master's courtyard, his hand resting on the hilt of his blade, his posture doubtfully confident as he surveyed the scene. <words>25</words> The air was thick with the scent of ink and the faint hum of a traditional song, one sung at every family wedding, drifting from a nearby house. <words>50</words> In his other hand, he clutched a faded tapestry fragment, its threads unraveling like the threads of his own shackled potential. <words>75</words> He had come here to authorize something—a spark, perhaps, where all lights had gone out. <words>95</words>  

The calligraphy master, an old man with hands steady as stone, looked up from his work, his gaze piercing yet softened by a harsh tenderness. <words>120</words> "You carry the weight of your blade like it’s a burden," the master said, his voice low but firm. <words>140</words> The swordsman bristled, his arrogance flaring. "I carry it as it should be carried—with purpose," he retorted, though the doubt in his voice betrayed him. <words>165</words>  

The master gestured to the tapestry fragment. "And that? What purpose does it serve?" <words>185</words> The swordsman hesitated, his fingers tightening around the cloth. "It’s a reminder," he said finally, "of what I could have been, if not for the chains I’ve placed upon myself." <words>215</words> The master nodded, as if he had expected this answer all along. "Between breaths," he said, "there is a moment of stillness, a moment where potential is neither shackled nor free. It is in that moment you must act." <words>255</words>  

The swordsman frowned, his arrogance faltering. "And how do I act? How do I deliver this spark?" <words>275</words> The master dipped his brush into the ink, the motion fluid and deliberate. "You must first understand that confidence without doubt is arrogance, and doubt without confidence is fear. You are neither, yet both." <words>310</words>  

The swordsman’s grip on the tapestry fragment loosened, the cloth slipping slightly from his fingers. "I don’t know how to begin," he admitted, his voice quieter now. <words>335</words> The master smiled, a rare expression that carried both warmth and severity. "Begin with the song," he said. "Let it guide you, as it has guided others before you." <words>365</words>  

The swordsman closed his eyes, the melody of the traditional wedding song filling his ears. Between breaths, he felt it—the spark, the moment of stillness. <words>390</words> When he opened his eyes, the courtyard seemed brighter, the air lighter. He looked at the master, who had returned to his calligraphy, and nodded. <words>415</words>  

With the tapestry fragment in one hand and his blade in the other, the swordsman stepped forward, his doubtfully confident stride now carrying a newfound purpose. <words>440</words> He would deliver the spark, not as an arrogant swordsman, but as a man unshackled. <words>455</words>
