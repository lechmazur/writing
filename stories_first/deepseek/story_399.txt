<story>The grumpy crypt caretaker shuffled into the witch's crystal scrying room, clutching an unmarked cardboard tube under his arm, his weathered face etched with lines of unresolved pain. <words>28</words> The room shimmered with an otherworldly glow, its walls adorned with intricate sand mandalas that seemed to shift and breathe, their patterns multiplying singularly as if alive. <words>58</words> He had come here not out of curiosity but to quell an uprising within, a storm of memories that threatened to consume him. <words>83</words> Throughout stargazing, he had felt the weight of his trauma pressing down, its tendrils coiling tighter with each passing hour. <words>104</words> The witch, sensing his turmoil, had gestured to the mandala, her voice a whisper of grandiose subtlety: "The answers lie in the patterns." <words>130</words>  

With a grunt, he set the tube on the table and jiggled it open, revealing a rolled parchment that smelled faintly of age and sorrow. <words>155</words> As he unrolled it, the mandala’s patterns seemed to mirror the lines on the parchment, weaving a story of loss and resilience. <words>178</words> The caretaker’s hands trembled as he traced the symbols, each one a fragment of his past, a reminder of the importance of trauma in shaping who he had become. <words>208</words> The witch watched silently, her crystal ball reflecting the mandala’s ever-shifting design, as if the room itself were alive with understanding. <words>234</words>  

He began to speak, his voice low and halting, recounting the events that had scarred him, the moments that had multiplied singularly into a lifetime of guarded solitude. <words>263</words> The mandala’s patterns seemed to respond, their colors deepening, their shapes aligning with his words, as if the room were absorbing his pain. <words>288</words> By the time he finished, the caretaker felt a strange lightness, as though the uprising within had been quelled, not by force, but by acknowledgment. <words>317</words>  

The witch nodded, her gaze piercing yet kind. "Trauma is not a burden to carry alone," she said, her voice echoing with the weight of centuries. <words>345</words> "It is a thread in the tapestry of your being, one that can be woven into strength." <words>363</words> The caretaker looked at the mandala, now still and serene, and for the first time in years, he felt a flicker of hope. <words>387</words> He rolled the parchment back into the tube, its unmarked surface now a symbol of his journey, and stepped out of the scrying room, the stars above shining brighter than he had ever noticed before. <words>425</words></story>
