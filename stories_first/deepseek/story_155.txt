<story>The underwater welder, known only as Kael, stood at the crossing where two timelines should never meet, his gloved fingers brushing the edges of a vintage button box he’d found in the broken planetarium reimagined as a night club. <words>40</words> The box, its brass hinges tarnished but still gleaming faintly, seemed to hum with an improbable power, one that whispered of moments of unraveling. <words>74</words> Kael, a man both patiently impatient, had spent years diving into the abyss, welding the seams of sunken ships, but this—this felt like diving into something far deeper. <words>113</words>  

The night club’s mirrored walls reflected fragments of the past, glimpses of a world that no longer existed, and Kael caught sight of himself in one of them, his wetsuit glistening under the strobe lights. <words>158</words> He opened the button box, its contents spilling into his palm: buttons of every shape and color, each one etched with symbols he couldn’t decipher. <words>193</words> They felt alive, as if they carried the weight of forgotten stories, and Kael knew he had to wield their power, no matter the cost. <words>229</words>  

The planetarium’s dome, cracked and patched with steel plates, loomed above him, its shattered stars replaced by neon constellations. <words>257</words> Kael moved through the crowd, the button box clutched tightly, his mind racing with questions. <words>278</words> Why had he been drawn here? Why now? The answers, he suspected, lay in the mirrors, where the past and present collided in fractured reflections. <words>319</words>  

He paused before a mirror, its surface rippling like water, and saw not himself but a woman in a faded dress, her hands busy with a needle and thread. <words>355</words> She looked up, her eyes meeting his, and for a moment, Kael felt the threads of time unraveling around him. <words>385</words> The woman smiled, her fingers brushing a button on her dress, and Kael understood: the buttons were keys, each one unlocking a moment, a memory, a possibility. <words>428</words>  

With a deep breath, Kael pressed one of the buttons into the mirror, and the world shifted. <words>448</words> The night club dissolved, replaced by the quiet hum of a vintage store, its shelves lined with forgotten treasures. <words>474</words> Kael knew he had to pamper this fragile connection, to nurture it until he could wield the power of the buttons fully. <words>500</words> The mystery he’d inherited was vast, but so was his resolve. <words>514</words></story>
