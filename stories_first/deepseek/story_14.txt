<story>The naive gambler sat at the tidal power monitoring station, his fingers tracing the grooves of a rustic candle mold, its surface rough and weathered like the unspoken bargains he’d made with fate. <words>34</words> The station hummed faintly, its machinery rarely predictable, much like the lectures he’d attended via rebellious midnight sessions led by unhinged professors who spoke of entropy and the fleeting nature of existence. <words>76</words> Tonight, the station was bathed in the warm glow of candlelit dinners, the flickering flames casting shadows that danced like the gambler’s restless thoughts. <words>110</words> He had come here to dock his hopes, to anchor them in something tangible before they drifted into oblivion. <words>134</words> The gambler’s motivation was clear: to capture one last spark, one final chance to defy the inevitable. <words>156</words> He laughed, tears streaming down his face, the sound echoing through the station like a bittersweet symphony. <words>178</words> The professors had warned him about the futility of his pursuits, but their words only fueled his defiance. <words>200</words> He poured molten wax into the mold, the act itself a gamble, a silent pact with the universe. <words>222</words> The tide outside rose and fell, its rhythm a reminder of the cycles he could not control. <words>243</words> As the wax cooled, he wondered if this candle would be his last, a final beacon in the encroaching darkness. <words>267</words> The gambler’s hands trembled, not from fear, but from the weight of his unspoken bargains, the deals he’d struck with chance and time. <words>294</words> He thought of the professors, their wild eyes and impassioned speeches, and how they’d taught him to see the world as a game of infinite possibilities. <words>322</words> But now, standing at the edge of oblivion, he realized the game was rigged, and the house always won. <words>346</words> Yet, he laughed again, the sound mingling with the hum of the station, a defiant cry against the inevitable. <words>370</words> The candle was almost ready, its wick standing tall like a final act of rebellion. <words>389</words> He lit it, the flame flickering uncertainly before steadying, a small but persistent light in the vast, indifferent darkness. <words>415</words> The gambler smiled through his tears, knowing that even if this was his last spark, it was enough. <words>436</words> For in that moment, he had captured something eternal, something that no tide could wash away. <words>458</words></story>
