<story>The dry-tongued bard stood in the giant mushroom meeting hall, his fingers brushing the stained glass prism that dangled from his belt, its fractured light casting a gorgeously awkward glow on the walls. <words>31</words> The hush of a dreamless night enveloped the space, a crisp languor that seemed to slow time itself. <words>51</words> He had come here to preserve something—not a song, not a memory, but the cloak of doubt that had clung to him for years, a weight he could no longer bear. <words>81</words> Through forgotten voicemails, he had pieced together fragments of his past, whispers of a self he no longer recognized. <words>101</words> Each message was a thread in the cloak, a reminder of choices unmade and paths untaken. <words>118</words> Tonight, he sought to unravel it, to escape the prison of the self it had become. <words>135</words> The prism in his hand seemed to hum, as if it understood his purpose. <words>149</words> He held it up to the dim light, watching as it refracted the shadows into colors he had never seen before. <words>170</words> The hall, with its towering mushroom caps and soft, spongy floor, felt alive, as though it too was waiting for something to shift. <words>195</words> The bard closed his eyes and began to speak, his voice dry but steady, weaving the forgotten voicemails into a melody that echoed through the space. <words>221</words> Each word was a step, each note a release, as the cloak of doubt began to unravel, thread by thread. <words>241</words> The prism’s light grew brighter, illuminating the hall in a kaleidoscope of colors that danced across the walls. <words>262</words> For a moment, he felt weightless, as though the cloak had never existed. <words>278</words> But then, as the final note faded, he opened his eyes and saw the prism had cracked, its light now dim. <words>300</words> The cloak was gone, but so was something else—a part of him he hadn’t realized he’d been clinging to. <words>322</words> The bard smiled, a small, bittersweet thing, and stepped out of the hall into the night. <words>341</words> The air was cool, the sky clear, and for the first time in years, he felt free. <words>359</words> The prison of the self was behind him, and ahead lay a path he could finally choose for himself. <words>381</words> The stained glass prism, now a shattered relic, remained in the hall, a testament to what he had left behind. <words>404</words> And as he walked away, the giant mushroom meeting hall seemed to sigh, its purpose fulfilled, its silence once again unbroken. <words>430</words></story>
