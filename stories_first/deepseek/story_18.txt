<story>The living statue stood motionless in the steam-powered city square, its stone eyes scanning the foggy horizon as telepathic whispers echoed in its mind. <words>28</words> Around it, the rhythmic hiss of pistons and the clatter of gears filled the air, a symphony of progress that masked the lies woven into the city’s very fabric. <words>58</words> In its cracked, weathered hand, it clutched a threadbare hair tie, a relic of a life it could no longer remember but felt deeply in its core. <words>89</words> The statue’s purpose was clear: to find truth in a world of lies, a quest that had consumed it throughout the planning of its existence. <words>118</words>
