A detour to visit a landmark seen on a sign had brought him here, to the edge of the communal gardens that sprawled beyond the enclave’s borders.<words>123</words> The gardens were a symbol of unity, a place where strangers worked side by side, their hands in the soil, their hearts open to the possibility of connection.<words>155</words> It unsettled him, this vision of a world he had spent his life rejecting.<words>173</words>
