<story>In the hush of a half-lit corridor, the outcast scholar clutched the seashell with a strange symbol, its surface cool against his trembling palm. <words>28</words> The air was thick with the scent of aged wood and the faint hum of witch's flying carpet garage nearby, where enchanted rugs hovered like restless spirits. <words>58</words> He had always been an outcast, his theories on mirroring the soul dismissed as madness, but tonight he would prove that midnight only lasts so long. <words>90</words> The seashell, strangely trustworthy in its weight and texture, had led him here, to a public restroom where diaries were hidden behind a tile. <words>121</words> His heart raced with frantic peace, a paradoxical calm that sharpened his focus as he pried the tile loose. <words>143</words> The diaries spilled out, their pages yellowed and brittle, each one a fragment of someone’s soul. <words>161</words> He opened the first, and a jolt coursed through him as the words seemed to leap off the page, echoing his own thoughts. <words>184</words> The symbol on the seashell glowed faintly, as if responding to the diaries’ secrets. <words>200</words> He read faster, his breath shallow, the corridor’s shadows deepening around him. <words>216</words> Each diary revealed a life, a soul mirrored in ink, and he realized they were all connected, all part of a greater truth. <words>240</words> The witch’s garage hummed louder, the carpets stirring as if sensing his discovery. <words>256</words> He felt the weight of the seashell again, its symbol now pulsing with light, and understood it was a key, a bridge between souls. <words>281</words> The frantic peace within him swelled, and he knew he was close to unraveling the mystery of mirroring the soul. <words>302</words> The diaries spoke of a ritual, one that could only be performed at the cusp of midnight, when the veil between souls was thinnest. <words>327</words> He glanced at the corridor’s dim clock, its hands inching toward the hour. <words>342</words> With the seashell in one hand and the diaries in the other, he stepped into the garage, the carpets parting as if to guide him. <words>366</words> The air crackled with energy, and he felt the jolt again, stronger this time, as if the souls in the diaries were urging him forward. <words>392</words> He began the ritual, his voice steady despite the chaos around him, the seashell’s light growing brighter with each word. <words>416</words> As the clock struck midnight, the light exploded, and for a moment, he saw them—the souls, mirrored in the air, their truths laid bare. <words>443</words> And then, just as quickly, the light faded, the corridor silent once more. <words>459</words> He stood alone, the seashell now cold and lifeless, but he knew he had proven it: midnight only lasts so long. <words>483</words></story>
