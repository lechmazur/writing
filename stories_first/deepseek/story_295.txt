<story>The jovial sellsword, known for his laughter that could disarm even the most hardened foes, stood boldly reluctant in the witch's herb garden, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. <words>30</words> The air was thick with the scent of withering herbs, a reminder of the vow he had made to himself—a vow now crumbling like dried leaves in the wind. <words>60</words> He had come seeking treasure, not gold or jewels, but something far more elusive: the means to dethrone doubt from his mind. <words>90</words>  

Before him stood an astronomical telescope, its brass frame gleaming faintly in the moonlight, a relic of a family tradition of making a time capsule. <words>120</words> His father had once told him that the telescope held the key to understanding the stars, and by extension, the mysteries of life itself. <words>150</words> But the sellsword had always been too restless to sit still and gaze at the heavens, until now. <words>170</words>  

The witch, her eyes sharp as thorns, watched him with a mixture of amusement and impatience. <words>190</words> "If you seek clarity," she said, her voice like the rustle of dead leaves, "you must look through the lens and confront what you see." <words>220</words> The sellsword hesitated, his jovial demeanor faltering as he peered into the telescope. <words>240</words>  

What he saw was not the stars, but a vision of himself throughout the transformation—his laughter fading, his sword growing heavy, his heart burdened by the weight of his choices. <words>280</words> It was a mirror of his soul, and it terrified him. <words>290</words> Yet, in that moment of elegant mayhem, he understood that the treasure he sought was not external, but within. <words>320</words>  

The witch handed him a small, ornate box, the final piece of the family tradition. <words>340</words> "Place your doubts here," she instructed, "and bury them in the garden. Let the earth reclaim them." <words>370</words> The sellsword did as she said, his movements slow but deliberate, as if each motion was a step toward reclaiming his own light. <words>400</words>  

As he walked away from the witch's garden, the telescope now a part of his own time capsule, he felt a strange sense of peace. <words>430</words> The withering vow had been replaced by a new promise—to face the stars, and himself, with courage. <words>460</words> And for the first time in years, he laughed, not to disarm, but to celebrate the journey ahead. <words>490</words></story>
