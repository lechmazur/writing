<story>The proud exorcist, Father Elias, adjusted his weathered hat as he climbed the rope ladder into the treehouse city in the Amazon, his boots creaking against the wooden rungs. <words>28</words> The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and the distant hum of cicadas, but his mind was elsewhere, fixated on the wizard’s battered grimoire tucked under his arm. <words>56</words> Its pages whispered secrets of forgotten spells, and though he’d never admit it, the weight of responsibility pressed heavier on his shoulders than the book itself. <words>86</words> He had come here to outshine a looming shadow—his mentor, Father Marcus, whose legendary exorcisms still haunted the Church’s halls. <words>112</words>  

The treehouse city was a labyrinth of suspended walkways and lantern-lit platforms, its inhabitants bustling with an endearingly feisty energy that made Elias smirk despite his cynicism. <words>146</words> He’d been summoned by a village elder who claimed a spirit was “youthifying” the children, turning them into giggling, mischievous versions of their former selves. <words>175</words> “When the clock dares to skip a beat,” the elder had warned, “the spirit strikes.” <words>193</words> Elias rolled his eyes but couldn’t deny the peculiarity of the case. <words>206</words>  

As he reached the elder’s treehouse, a sudden closure of a usual path—a bridge snapped by a falling branch—forced him to take a detour through a narrow, swaying plank. <words>242</words> “Of course,” he muttered, his playful cynicism masking the unease creeping into his chest. <words>258</words> The grimoire felt heavier now, as if it knew something he didn’t. <words>272</words>  

Inside the elder’s home, a child no older than six sat cross-legged, her eyes glowing with an unnatural light. <words>294</words> “Father Elias,” she said in a voice that was both hers and not hers, “you’ve brought the book. How quaint.” <words>315</words> Elias’s pride bristled, but he forced a smirk. <words>327</words> “Let’s see if you’re as clever as you think,” he retorted, flipping open the grimoire to a page he’d marked earlier. <words>350</words>  

The exorcism was a battle of wits, the spirit taunting him with riddles and laughter, but Elias held firm, his determination to outshine Marcus driving him forward. <words>383</words> When the final incantation left his lips, the child’s eyes dimmed, and the spirit vanished with a sigh. <words>405</words>  

As the villagers cheered, Elias closed the grimoire, the weight of responsibility lifting just enough to let him breathe. <words>429</words> But as he descended the ladder, he couldn’t shake the feeling that the spirit’s parting words—“You’ll never escape the shadow”—were more than just a taunt. <words>460</words> He smirked anyway, because what else could he do? <words>472</words></story>
