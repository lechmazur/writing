<story>The underachieving mage slumped in the abandoned space station control room, staring at the doll head with blinking eyes that had arrived via misdelivered packages. <words>28</words> The station, perched at the boundary of farmland soon to be sold, hummed with a bored excitement, as if it too was waiting for something to happen. <words>56</words> The mage, whose name was Kael, had always been exceptionally usual—mediocre spells, forgettable presence, and a knack for blending into the background. <words>86</words> But today, he felt a strange pull, as if the doll head was whispering secrets only he could hear. <words>106</words>  

Kael picked up the doll head, its glassy eyes blinking in rhythm with the flickering control panel lights. <words>126</words> It was unnerving, yet oddly comforting, like a relic from a past he barely remembered. <words>143</words> His family had once been renowned mages, but their legacy had crumbled into obscurity, leaving Kael with nothing but a vague sense of loss. <words>170</words> Reclaiming heritage had always seemed like a distant dream, but now, holding the doll head, it felt tantalizingly close. <words>192</words>  

The control room was a mess of broken screens and tangled wires, but Kael noticed a faint glow emanating from a corner. <words>216</words> He followed it, the doll head clutched tightly in his hand, until he found a hidden compartment. <words>233</words> Inside was an ancient scroll, its edges frayed but its symbols still vibrant. <words>248</words> Kael unrolled it, his heart pounding as he realized it was a spell—one that could unveil the true potential of a mage. <words>272</words>  

But there was a catch. <words>275</words> The spell required the caster to spring a trap on their own limitations, to confront the very thing that held them back. <words>299</words> Kael hesitated, his usual self-doubt creeping in. <words>309</words> Was he really capable of this? <words>315</words> The doll head blinked slowly, as if urging him to try. <words>327</words>  

Taking a deep breath, Kael began the incantation, his voice trembling at first but growing steadier with each word. <words>350</words> The control room seemed to come alive, the air crackling with energy. <words>365</words> As he finished the spell, a surge of power coursed through him, and for the first time, he felt extraordinary. <words>388</words>  

The doll head’s eyes stopped blinking, and Kael understood. <words>399</words> It had been a guide, a fragment of his family’s legacy, leading him to this moment. <words>418</words> The farmland outside the station was still destined to be sold, but Kael knew his journey was just beginning. <words>441</words> He had reclaimed his heritage, not through grand deeds, but by embracing the exceptionally usual and turning it into something extraordinary. <words>469</words></story>
