<story>The tired swordsman slumped into the quiet breakroom of the floating rock monastery, his plain cloth bag resting heavily on the table beside him. <words>28</words> The resignation of Brother Kael still hung in the air, a faint echo of the monastery’s usual hum, and the swordsman felt the weight of his own hidden promise pressing harder than ever. <words>63</words> He had vowed to himself years ago, in the shadow of a meteor shower, that he would overcome the apathy that had clung to him like a second skin. <words>93</words> Yet here he was, fiercely apathetic, his sword dull and his spirit duller, staring at the bag as if it held the answers he couldn’t find. <words>123</words>  

The bag was unremarkable, its fabric worn and frayed, but inside lay a fragment of the meteor he had seen that fateful night—a spark of defiance he had carried ever since. <words>163</words> He opened it now, the faint glow of the meteor shard casting a soft light on his calloused hands. <words>186</words> It reminded him of the night he had stood beneath the heavens, watching the streaks of light carve their paths across the sky, and felt something stir within him for the first time in years. <words>230</words>  

The monastery’s teachings spoke of following the meteor showers, not just as celestial events but as guides for the lost. <words>256</words> The swordsman had scoffed at first, his knowing naivety dismissing it as poetic nonsense, but now he wondered if there was truth in it. <words>287</words> The meteor showers were unpredictable, yet they always returned, a reminder that even the most fleeting moments could leave a lasting mark. <words>322</words>  

He stood abruptly, slinging the bag over his shoulder, the shard’s warmth seeping into his chest. <words>345</words> The resignation of Brother Kael had left a void, but it also offered a chance—a chance to step into the unknown, to follow the meteor showers as the monks had urged. <words>385</words> The swordsman’s apathy was still there, fierce and unyielding, but beneath it, the spark of defiance flickered brighter. <words>412</words>  

As he stepped out of the breakroom and into the open air of the floating monastery, the night sky stretched endlessly above him. <words>442</words> Somewhere out there, a meteor shower was beginning, and for the first time in years, the tired swordsman felt the faint pull of purpose. <words>473</words> He would follow the light, not because he believed it would lead him to answers, but because he had made a promise to himself—and he intended to keep it. <words>508</words></story>
