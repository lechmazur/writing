<story>The closed-off reaver wandered through the kaleidoscope park, its shifting colors and fractured reflections mocking the stillness in his chest. <words>25</words> He clutched a child’s drawing on crumpled paper, its edges crumpled from years of being tucked into his armor, a relic of a life he’d tried to forget. <words>53</words> The drawing was charmingly grotesque, a stick-figure family with too many limbs and smiles that stretched too wide, a child’s attempt to make sense of a world already broken. <words>88</words> He’d found it in the margins of his father’s journal, scrawled poems that nagged at him like a ghost’s whisper, each verse a reminder of the generational patterns he’d sworn to escape. <words>126</words>  

“You’ll never taste the stars in a single kiss,” his father had written, the words etched in jagged script, mocking affection dripping from every line. <words>160</words> The reaver had scoffed then, but now, standing in the park before the first lie was told, he felt the weight of those words like a chain around his neck. <words>193</words> The stars above shimmered, distant and untouchable, and he wondered if his father had stood here too, staring at the same sky, feeling the same ache. <words>228</words>  

He unfolded the drawing again, tracing the clumsy lines with a calloused finger. <words>244</words> The child who’d drawn it was long gone, swallowed by the same cycle of violence and regret that had claimed his father, and his father before him. <words>276</words> The reaver’s lips twisted into a bitter smile. <words>285</words> He’d tried to break the pattern, to carve a new path, but the past clung to him like a shadow, its whispers growing louder with every step. <words>320</words>  

The park’s kaleidoscope lights shifted, casting fractured rainbows across the ground, and for a moment, he saw himself in the child’s drawing, a figure with too many scars and not enough hope. <words>364</words> He folded the paper carefully, tucking it back into his armor, and turned his gaze to the stars. <words>387</words> Maybe he couldn’t taste them in a single kiss, but he could reach for them, one step at a time, and that was enough. <words>415</words> The reaver walked on, the park’s mocking colors fading behind him as he stepped into the unknown, determined to write a new verse in the margins of his life. <words>453</words></story>
