<story>The sapped herbalist sat in the glass-walled observatory on an ocean cliff, her eyes half-closed as she napped, though her mind churned with fervent indifference. <words>28</words> She had come here to study tide patterns, but the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocks below lulled her into a restless slumber. <words>53</words> On the table before her lay the blacksmith’s bellows, a relic she had cherished for years, though its purpose eluded her now. <words>81</words> It was a gift from her mentor, who had once said, “Perfection comes at a price,” a phrase that haunted her thoughts. <words>106</words>  

Outside, a lone goose cut through the sky, its flight path erratic yet deliberate, as if guided by some thoughtfully thoughtless force. <words>134</words> The herbalist stirred, her gaze following the bird as it soared toward the horizon. <words>151</words> She wondered if it, too, sought something unattainable, something perfect. <words>167</words> The bellows seemed to hum faintly in response, as though echoing her unspoken question. <words>186</words>  

She rose, her movements slow but purposeful, and approached the glass wall. <words>202</words> The ocean stretched endlessly before her, its tides rising and falling with a precision that mocked her own struggles. <words>226</words> She had spent years perfecting her craft, yet each remedy she concocted felt incomplete, as if missing some vital essence. <words>252</words> The bellows, once a tool of creation, now felt like a symbol of her failure. <words>271</words>  

The goose disappeared into the distance, and the herbalist sighed, her fervent indifference giving way to a quiet resolve. <words>296</words> She returned to the bellows, running her fingers over its worn leather. <words>312</words> Perhaps perfection wasn’t the goal; perhaps it was the pursuit itself that mattered. <words>332</words> The price of perfection, she realized, was the endless striving, the moments of doubt, the flights of thought that led nowhere. <words>360</words>  

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the observatory in a warm, golden light, the herbalist smiled. <words>386</words> She would cherish the journey, not the destination, and let the tides guide her as they would. <words>408</words> The bellows, once a burden, now felt like a companion, a reminder that even in imperfection, there was beauty. <words>434</words> And as the first stars appeared in the sky, she felt a sense of peace she hadn’t known in years. <words>458</words></story>
