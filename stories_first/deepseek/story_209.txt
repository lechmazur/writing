<story>The seasoned woodsman trudged through the radio wave garden, his boots crunching over the strange, metallic flora that hummed faintly with static. <words>25</words> He clutched the antique hairbrush in his calloused hand, its bristles artfully messy, as though it had been used to tame a storm. <words>50</words> The final beep of a hospital monitor echoed in his mind, a sound he couldn’t escape, no matter how far he wandered. <words>75</words> His motivation was clear: to map the abandoned railways that crisscrossed this desolate land, a task that felt both futile and necessary. <words>100</words> The despairing cheer of his mission clung to him like a second skin, a paradox he couldn’t shake. <words>120</words>  

As he approached the abandoned water tower, its rusted frame looming like a sentinel, he paused. <words>140</words> The woodsman had heard rumors that the tower could short-circuit the strange energies of the radio wave garden, but only by measuring the echo within its hollow chamber. <words>170</words> He climbed the creaking ladder, the antique hairbrush tucked into his belt, and stepped inside. <words>190</words> The air was thick with the scent of iron and decay, and the walls seemed to pulse faintly, as if alive. <words>210</words>  

He struck the wall with the hairbrush, the sound reverberating through the chamber. <words>225</words> The echo was measured, precise, and as it faded, the woodsman felt a shift in the air. <words>245</words> The static hum of the garden outside grew louder, then abruptly ceased. <words>260</words> The water tower had short-circuited the garden’s strange energies, and for a moment, the woodsman felt a strange sense of clarity. <words>285</words>  

It was then that he realized the truth: he had been freed by honesty. <words>300</words> The hospital monitor’s final beep had been his wife’s, and he had been running from the grief ever since. <words>320</words> The abandoned railways, the radio wave garden, even the antique hairbrush—they were all distractions, ways to avoid facing the pain. <words>345</words> But now, standing in the silence of the water tower, he could no longer hide from it. <words>365</words>  

He descended the ladder, the hairbrush still in hand, and began to walk back the way he had come. <words>385</words> The despairing cheer of his mission had shifted into something softer, something more genuine. <words>405</words> He would map the railways, not to escape, but to honor the memory of what he had lost. <words>425</words> The woodsman’s steps were steady now, his heart lighter, as he moved through the quiet garden, freed at last. <words>450</words></story>
