<story>The tense bodyguard stood at the edge of the lunar greenhouse, his gloved hands clutching a faded photograph of a woman he barely remembered—his mother. <words>28</words> The serene anger in his chest burned quietly, a fire stoked by years of servitude under a controlling influence he could no longer tolerate. <words>55</words> Amid park visits to Earth, he had serendipitously stubbornly collected fragments of overheard stories about her, piecing together a life she had lived before she vanished. <words>88</words> The greenhouse, perched precariously on the crater’s edge, was his sanctuary, a place where he could breathe and think, even if the air was artificial. <words>118</words> He had come here to ratify his decision, to break free from the chains that bound him to his employer, a man who had molded him into a weapon but never let him be human. <words>155</words> The photograph, worn and creased, was his only link to a past he barely understood, yet it held the promise of a timely rebirth—a chance to reclaim the life stolen from him. <words>190</words>  

As he stared at the Earth through the greenhouse’s translucent dome, he recalled the whispers he had gathered: his mother’s laughter, her love for the stars, her defiance against the same man who now controlled him. <words>238</words> Each fragment was a shard of truth, a piece of a puzzle that had led him here, to this moment of reckoning. <words>260</words> The lunar winds howled outside, a reminder of the desolation he had endured, but inside the greenhouse, the air was still, the plants thriving in their artificial light. <words>295</words> He felt a kinship with them, survivors in a hostile environment, yet capable of growth and renewal. <words>316</words>  

His employer’s voice echoed in his mind, a constant reminder of the power he wielded, but the bodyguard’s resolve was unshakable. <words>344</words> He would not be a pawn any longer. <words>351</words> The photograph, though faded, was a beacon of hope, a symbol of the life he could rebuild. <words>372</words> He folded it carefully and placed it in his pocket, feeling the weight of his decision settle into his bones. <words>396</words> The lunar greenhouse, with its fragile beauty, had become the birthplace of his rebellion, a place where he could finally breathe freely. <words>425</words> As he stepped out into the barren landscape, he knew the journey ahead would be fraught with danger, but for the first time, he felt alive. <words>456</words> The timely rebirth had begun. <words>462</words></story>
