<story>The apathetic summoner sat in the shared dream recording studio, her fingers idly tracing the grooves of a rustic coffee grinder, its wooden handle worn smooth by years of use. <words>30</words> The air was thick with the scent of roasted beans and the faint hum of machinery, a gentle sharpness that seemed to cut through the haze of her thoughts. <words>60</words> She had been here for hours, or perhaps days—time blurred in this place, especially after the last breath of a dying god had echoed through the cosmos. <words>90</words> The event had left the world unmoored, its rivers whispering secrets of a wisdom long forgotten, a river wisdom that now seemed to call to her. <words>120</words>  

Her motivation was clear, though it felt distant, like a dream she couldn’t quite grasp: to rebuild coral reefs, to restore the vibrant life that had once thrived beneath the waves. <words>160</words> Yet, she was enthusiastically lazy, her movements slow and deliberate, as if each action required the weight of the world to unfold. <words>190</words> She rose from her chair, the coffee grinder still in hand, and wandered into a deserted hall where empty frames hung in perfect symmetry. <words>220</words>  

The frames were not truly empty, she realized as she approached. <words>230</words> Through matching empty frames, the world beyond began to reveal itself—shimmering visions of coral reefs, their colors muted but alive, their forms shifting like memories. <words>260</words> She reached out, her fingers brushing the edge of a frame, and felt the cool touch of water, the faint pulse of life. <words>290</words> The river wisdom flowed through her, a quiet understanding that the reefs could be rebuilt, not through force, but through patience and care. <words>320</words>  

She returned to the studio, the coffee grinder now a symbol of her task, its rhythmic grinding a reminder of the slow, steady work ahead. <words>350</words> The apathetic summoner, once detached and indifferent, now felt a spark of purpose, a gentle sharpness that cut through her lethargy. <words>380</words> She began to weave the dreams of the reefs, each one a delicate thread in the tapestry of restoration. <words>400</words> The shared dream recording studio hummed with new energy, its walls echoing with the whispers of rivers and the promise of life renewed. <words>430</words>  

As the last frame unfolded its vision, she smiled, her apathy replaced by a quiet determination. <words>450</words> The coral reefs would rise again, and she would be their summoner, guided by the wisdom of the rivers and the rhythm of the grinder. <words>480</words></story>
