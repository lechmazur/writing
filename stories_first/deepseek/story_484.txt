<story>The groggy brewer stumbled through the haunted mansion graveyard, clutching a piece of a broken mirror that glinted faintly in the moonlight. <words>25</words> The encroaching darkness seemed to press in from all sides, its uniquely generic presence both familiar and unnerving. <words>45</words> He had come here to initiate something—what exactly, he wasn’t sure, but the mirror felt like a key. <words>65</words> The lull in the protest outside had given him a moment of quiet, though he could hear the voices gathering again, distant but insistent. <words>88</words> He climbed the dusty spiral staircase, each step creaking underfoot, and paused at the slightest discoloration on the banister, a faint smudge that seemed to pulse with meaning. <words>116</words> "This is it," he muttered with flippant solemnity, as though the weight of his task could be shrugged off with a joke. <words>135</words> The brewer wasn’t here to brew ale; he was here to become a living embodiment of his values, though he wasn’t entirely sure what those were anymore. <words>160</words> The mirror fragment caught the dim light, reflecting his tired face and the shadows that seemed to writhe behind him. <words>180</words> He held it up to the discoloration, and the air around him shifted, the darkness retreating momentarily as if repelled. <words>200</words> "Guess I’m doing this right," he said, his tone dry but his heart pounding. <words>213</words> The staircase seemed to stretch endlessly above him, each step a test of his resolve. <words>229</words> He climbed higher, the mirror fragment growing warmer in his hand, its edges sharp against his palm. <words>247</words> The voices outside grew louder, their chants blending with the whispers that seemed to emanate from the walls. <words>266</words> He reached the top of the staircase, where a single door stood ajar, its surface etched with symbols that matched the discoloration below. <words>289</words> Pushing it open, he stepped into a room bathed in an eerie glow, the air thick with the scent of old wood and decay. <words>312</words> In the center of the room stood a pedestal, its surface cracked and worn, and on it rested another piece of the broken mirror. <words>334</words> He placed his fragment beside it, and the two pieces fused together with a soft hum, the light intensifying. <words>354</words> The encroaching darkness surged forward, but the mirror’s glow held it at bay, its uniquely generic power both comforting and strange. <words>378</words> The brewer felt a shift within himself, as though the mirror was reflecting not just light but something deeper—his own resolve, his own values. <words>404</words> The voices outside reached a crescendo, and he knew the protest would soon spill into the graveyard, into the mansion, into this very room. <words>429</words> He stood tall, the mirror in his hand, and faced the darkness, ready to become what he had always hoped to be. <words>450</words></story>
