<story>The reclaimed orchard farmland inside the toppled skyscraper hummed with an energetically lethargic rhythm, the vines creeping lazily up the fractured walls while the air buzzed with the faint static of a frozen computer finally restarting. <words>38</words> Amid the chaos of nature reclaiming steel, a bluffing swindler named Elias paced the uneven floor, his fingers brushing against a blank price tag he’d plucked from a rusted cart. <words>72</words> He was here to bare a truth no one dared to handle, though his usual method—charming lies—felt out of place in this gentle harshness of decay and rebirth. <words>108</words>  

Elias’s plan was simple: magnetize the attention of the orchard’s caretakers, convince them the land was cursed, and sell them a “solution” he didn’t have. <words>138</words> But as he rehearsed his pitch, a dropped book tumbled from a crumbling balcony, landing at his feet with a thud that echoed like a heartbeat. <words>168</words> He glanced up to see a woman with dirt-streaked hands and a wary smile—Mara, the orchard’s keeper. <words>187</words>  

“Careful,” she said, her voice soft but edged with steel. “That book’s older than this mess.” <words>207</words> Elias picked it up, his fingers brushing the weathered cover, and felt an odd pull, as if invisible allies were nudging him toward something he couldn’t yet see. <words>237</words>  

Mara studied him, her gaze piercing. “You’re not here for the apples, are you?” <words>253</words> Elias hesitated, the blank price tag in his pocket suddenly heavy. <words>265</words> He’d come to swindle, but the orchard’s quiet defiance and Mara’s unflinching honesty made his usual tricks feel hollow. <words>289</words>  

“I was,” he admitted, surprising himself. “But now I’m not sure why I’m here.” <words>307</words> Mara’s smile softened, and she gestured to the book. “It’s about the land. The truth of it. Most people run from that.” <words>333</words>  

Elias felt the invisible allies again, a whisper in the rustling leaves. <words>347</words> He opened the book to find sketches of the orchard before the skyscraper fell, a testament to resilience. <words>367</words> “Why show me this?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper. <words>381</words>  

“Because you’re here,” Mara said simply. “And the truth doesn’t care if you’re ready for it.” <words>401</words>  

In that instant, Elias understood. <words>407</words> The blank price tag wasn’t for the land—it was for the lie he’d been selling himself. <words>425</words> He dropped it into the soil, where it vanished among the roots, and decided to stay. <words>443</words> The orchard had reclaimed him, too. <words>451</words></story>
