<story>The exorcist with stage fright clutched the pressed wildflowers in her trembling hands, their delicate petals a fragile reminder of the inheritance of lies she carried. <words>28</words> Amid the chaos of toy assembly in the cramped orbital debris, she whispered a defiant hush, her voice barely audible over the hum of machinery. <words>56</words> The wildflowers had been her mother’s, pressed into a book that now felt heavier than the weight of the lies she’d been told. <words>83</words> She had always been told her work was never usual, but today, she would sculpt possibility from the ashes of “never.” <words>106</words> The sound of a key turning in a lock echoed through the station, and she froze, her heart pounding. <words>126</words> It was time to submerge herself in the truth, to face the demons that haunted her lineage. <words>143</words> The wildflowers, once a symbol of beauty, now felt like a chain, binding her to a past she could no longer ignore. <words>165</words> She stepped forward, her stage fright momentarily forgotten, and prepared to confront the lies that had shaped her. <words>186</words> The orbital debris around her seemed to close in, a fitting backdrop for the chaos she was about to unleash. <words>207</words> As she began the exorcism, the toys around her seemed to come alive, their tiny eyes watching her every move. <words>229</words> She spoke the ancient words, her voice growing stronger with each syllable, defying the silence that had once held her back. <words>252</words> The key turned again, and she felt the lock of her fear finally give way. <words>267</words> The wildflowers fell from her hands, their petals scattering like ashes, and she knew she had found her truth. <words>288</words> In the midst of the debris, amid the toys and the lies, she had sculpted a new possibility, one that was never usual, but entirely her own. <words>315</words> The exorcist stood tall, her stage fright replaced by a quiet defiance, and she stepped into the unknown, ready to face whatever came next. <words>340</words> The orbital debris around her seemed to shift, as if acknowledging her victory, and she smiled, knowing she had finally broken free. <words>363</words> The pressed wildflowers, now scattered, were no longer a burden but a symbol of her transformation. <words>382</words> She turned away from the past, her heart light, and walked into the future, sculpting possibility from the ashes of “never.” <words>405</words></story>
