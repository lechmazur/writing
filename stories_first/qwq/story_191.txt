Elijah, a sober cardsharp with eyes that held the depth of a thousand poker games, found himself marooned on this enigmatic isle. His usual world of smoke-filled rooms and whispered bets was replaced by an otherworldly silence that both unnerved and intrigued him. <words>85</words>

The island was a place where reality bent, and the boundaries between dreams and waking blurred. Elijah had heard hushed pleas from the locals about strangers appearing in their dreams, leaving behind fragments of other lives and places.

In one particularly vivid dream, he saw himself standing in a library filled with books that held the dreams of everyone on the island.
