His followers, a motley crew of misfits and dreamers, looked up to him with unwavering devotion. They saw in him a figure who could bridge the gap between humanity and nature, a prophet in the post-apocalyptic world.

One day, while rummaging through old boxes in his quarters, Eli stumbled upon a collection of faded photographs. Each picture depicted his predecessors, cult leaders who had come before him, their eyes reflecting a wisdom he could only aspire to.

He understood that to influence others truly, one must tap into their own emotions, however painful or vulnerable they may be.
