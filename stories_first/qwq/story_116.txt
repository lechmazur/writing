In the black velvet sky-lounge that floated above the endless city, a dismayed minstrel sat, his gaze fixed on the broken watch band clutched in his hand. <words>30</words>

The sky-lounge was a marvel, a floating platform that seemed to defy the laws of physics, suspended high above the sprawling metropolis that stretched out like an infinite tapestry below. The sky was painted in deep hues of black velvet, stars twinkling like diamonds scattered across the canvas. <words>70</words>

The minstrel, known for his melancholic tunes and poignant lyrics, had always been drawn to the boundaries that defined existence. He saw lines and borders everywhere, not just physical ones but also the无形的界限 that governed human emotions and actions. His music was a reflection of these observations, a testament to the drawn boundaries that shaped lives. <words>110</words>

Subjectively rational, he believed that every action had a reason, every emotion a cause. He sought to understand the world through this lens, often finding solace in the logic that underpinned even the most chaotic of situations. <words>135</words>

Amid the garden secrets that the sky-lounge held, he had embarked on a quest to draw a map of an endless night. It was a metaphorical journey, an attempt to chart the unknown territories of the human soul within the vast expanse of the city below. <words>165</words>

To achieve this, he had chosen an unconventional method: by studying old Polaroid photographs. These snapshots captured moments frozen in time, each one a window into a past that was both familiar and distant. He believed that within these images lay clues to the underlying patterns and boundaries that governed the city's inhabitants. <words>210</words>

As he sat there, the broken watch band served as a poignant reminder of the passage of time and the impermanence of all things. It was a physical manifestation of the boundaries he sought to understand—time itself, marking the beginning and end of moments, lives, and perhaps even civilizations. <words>245</words>

With a sense of laconic exuberance, he began to excavate the photographs, delving into their layers to unearth the stories they held. His approach was methodical yet filled with a quiet enthusiasm, each discovery fueling his quest further. <words>275</words>

The sky-lounge provided the perfect setting for his endeavors. Its serene atmosphere, coupled with the breathtaking view of the city, created an environment conducive to deep reflection and creative inspiration. <words>300</words>

As he studied the Polaroids, he noticed recurring patterns—buildings that seemed to align in certain ways, people gathering at specific spots, and lights that blinked in what appeared to be a coded language. These observations fueled his belief that there was an underlying order to the chaos, a map waiting to be deciphered. <words>340</words>

His motivation was not just academic; it was personal. He yearned to make sense of his own place in this vast universe, to find his own boundaries and perhaps transcend them. Through mapping the night, he hoped to illuminate the paths less traveled and inspire others to question the limits of their own existence. <words>375</words>

The minstrel's journey was far from over. With each photograph he studied, each line he drew on his map, he came closer to understanding the intricate web of drawn boundaries that defined the endless city and, by extension, himself. <words>400</words>

In the black velvet sky-lounge, amidst the garden secrets and under the watchful gaze of the stars, the dismayed minstrel continued his quest, his broken watch band a constant companion in his pursuit of subjectively rational truths. <words>430</words>
