As she wandered through the gallery, she noticed a corner that seemed slightly out of place. It was a small nook, barely noticeable, filled with old books and what appeared to be scraps of prophecy.

One snowy afternoon, as the gallery was about to close, Evelyn had a epiphany. She realized that the prophecies weren't meant to be taken literally but were symbolic representations of the path to the secret book safe.
