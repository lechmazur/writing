The sun dipped low, casting long shadows that seemed to whisper secrets of a forgotten past. Amid the rusted metal and overgrown vines, she held an antique doorknob, its intricate patterns worn but still mysterious. This was the last fragment, she believed, the key to answering a riddle older than time.

It was a logbook, detailing bizarre housekeeping notes from what seemed like a series of haunted inns. Each entry was cryptic, filled with symbols and codes that she recognized from the doorknob's design.

With trembling hands, she opened the journal, and amid the page turns, she began to read. Each entry spoke of strange occurrences, of doors that opened to other worlds, of guests who never left, and of a riddle that had plagued the innkeepers for centuries. It was then that she realized the connection between the doorknob and the innsâ€”a thread that wound through time, leading her to this moment.

In one particularly chilling entry, the innkeeper described a door that led to a realm where time stood still. The doorknob, she realized, was the key to that door. But it was more than just a physical object; it was a conduit, a bridge between worlds.
