In the steampunk submarine's observation deck, where brass gears clicked and whirred like the heartbeat of some mechanical beast, there stood a wayward apothecary named Elara. Her eyes, behind smudged spectacles, scanned the horizon with an intensity that belied her unconventional profession. The deck was a marvel of battered elegance, its once-polished surfaces now etched with the scars of countless voyages between broken treaties.

Elara's motivation was singular: to track migratory butterflies, those delicate creatures that traversed the skies in patterns as mysterious as they were beautiful. She believed that understanding their migrations could lead to breakthroughs in apothecary science, perhaps even cures for ailments that plagued both man and machine. But her passion was met with skepticism; in a world where steam and steel were revered, the study of butterflies seemed quaint, almost laughable.

Yet, Elara was unjustly fair in her pursuit. She saw beauty in the mundane and potential in the overlooked. Her laboratory aboard the submarine was a testament to this philosophy, filled with jars of preserved specimens, charts detailing butterfly flight paths, and shelves groaning under the weight of ancient tomes on entomology and alchemy.

One day, as the submarine navigated treacherous waters between former allies now estranged by broken treaties, Elara noticed something amiss. The butterflies, usually predictable in their migrations, were veering off course, their numbers thinning alarmingly. Concerned, she decided to investigate further.

Her tools were meager: a dry highlighter pen, a relic from a previous era, and her knowledge of morse code, a language she had learned in her youth. The highlighter, though useless for its intended purpose, served as a makeshift transmitter when coupled with the submarine's antiquated communication systems. Elara believed that by sending out morse code signals, she could attract the butterflies, perhaps even communicate with them on some primal level.

The plan was audacious, bordering on madness, but Elara was resolute. She set up her apparatus on the observation deck, ignoring the curious glances of the crew. As the submarine cut through the waves, she began to tap out messages into the air, hoping against hope that the butterflies would respond.

Days turned into weeks, and still, the butterflies eluded her calls. Elara grew frustrated, her fair optimism beginning to wane. But she refused to give up. One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, she noticed a flutter in the distance. Her heart raced as she focused her spyglass.

They were butterflies, but not like any she had seen before. Their wings were iridescent, almost luminescent, and they moved in a pattern that seemed almost... organized. Elara tapped into her morse code device, sending out a greeting. To her astonishment, the butterflies responded, altering their flight paths in a sequence that mirrored morse code.

Elara's mind raced. She had done it; she had established communication with the butterflies. But her joy was short-lived. As she watched, a dark cloud approached, obscuring the sky. It was no ordinary cloud; it was alive, pulsating with an otherworldly energy. The butterflies darted towards it, disappearing into its depths.

Elara gasped, realizing too late that she had been played. The butterflies weren't just migratory; they were carriers, infecting everything they touched with some unknown entity. Her morse code signals had drawn their attention, yes, but also alerted the cloud to her presence.

Panic surged through her as she raced back inside the submarine, shouting orders to the crew to submerge immediately. Too late, she saw that the cloud had already latched onto the observation deck, its tendrils seeping into the vents.

As the submarine dove deeper, Elara knew that the infection had begun. The cloud, now inside, would spread, corrupting the machinery and, perhaps, the crew. Her unconventional love for the butterflies had brought this upon them all.

In the dimly lit corridors, Elara made a vow. She would find a cure, using her apothecary skills to counteract whatever darkness the cloud had brought. For in a world where treaties were broken and love was unconventional, only perseverance and ingenuity could save them now.
