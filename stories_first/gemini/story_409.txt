The bruised fighter, ribs aching with each shallow breath, stumbled through the dusty attic. <words>11</words>
Clockwork monkeys chattered silently from atop crumbling hatboxes, their gears frozen mid-motion. <words>20</words>
A giraffe, its brass neck bent at an unnatural angle, loomed over him like a broken god. <words>29</words>
He was here, at the moment a sculptor’s chisel first struck marble, a moment echoing across forgotten dreams, to abduct the last vestige of his self-deception. <words>48</words>
He knew, with a sickening certainty, that it resided within a specific clay pot shard, hidden amongst the attic’s detritus. <words>60</words>
His search, skillfully incompetent, was a performance for an audience of one: himself. <words>68</words>
He knocked over a stack of sheet music, sending a cloud of dust swirling around a mechanical owl with vacant glass eyes. <words>80</words>
He tripped over a rocking horse, its chipped paint a testament to forgotten childhoods. <words>88</words>
He cursed, the sound swallowed by the thick air, heavy with the scent of dried lavender and decay. <words>98</words>
He was a master of self-sabotage, a virtuoso of failure, and this charade of searching was just another act in his repertoire. <words>111</words>
He knew exactly where the shard was. <words>115</words>
He’d placed it there himself, years ago, a tangible representation of the lie he’d clung to: that he was a victim, not a participant in his own downfall. <words>136</words>
He reached under a loose floorboard, his fingers brushing against the rough clay. <words>144</words>
He pulled out the shard, its inscription barely visible beneath a layer of grime: “Stand.” <words>152</words>
The single word pulsed with an almost unbearable weight. <words>157</words>
Standing for something, anything, required a strength he wasn’t sure he possessed. <words>166</words>
It meant acknowledging his complicity, accepting responsibility, and fighting for something more than self-pity. <words>178</words>
He closed his eyes, the chisel striking the marble echoing in his ears, a sharp, decisive sound that cut through the fog of his self-deception. <words>195</words>
He opened his eyes, the dust motes dancing in the faint light filtering through the attic window. <words>204</words>
He clutched the shard, the rough clay digging into his palm. <words>210</words>
The inscription, now clear in his mind’s eye, burned like a brand. <words>217</words>
He was here, in this dusty attic filled with the ghosts of forgotten dreams, to abduct the last vestige of his self-deception, not by hiding it, but by confronting it. <words>238</words>
He was here to stand. <words>241</words>
The clockwork animals, silent witnesses to his internal struggle, seemed to hold their breath. <words>251</words>
The moment stretched, taut and fragile, poised on the edge of transformation. <words>259</words>
He took a shaky breath, the pain in his ribs a reminder of the battles he’d fought and lost. <words>270</words>
But also, a reminder of the battles he could still win. <words>276</words>
He tightened his grip on the shard, the inscription a promise, a challenge, a command. <words>286</words>
He was a bruised fighter, yes, but he was still a fighter. <words>293</words>
And he was finally ready to stand for something. <words>299</words>
He turned, the shard clutched tight in his hand, and walked towards the faint light of the attic window, leaving behind the dusty relics of his past. <words>320</words>
The chisel struck the marble again, the sound echoing through the forgotten dreams, a testament to the beginning of something new. <words>334</words>
He was no longer skillfully incompetent. <words>339</words>
He was simply, finally, standing. <words>343</words>
The dust settled, the clockwork animals remained frozen, but the attic, and the fighter within it, were forever changed. <words>357</words>
The abduction was complete. <words>360</words>
Not an abduction of a shard, but of a self. <words>366</words>
A reclamation of a spirit lost in the labyrinth of self-deception. <words>374</words>
He stood, bathed in the faint light, a bruised fighter reborn, ready to face the world, ready to stand for something more than the dust and shadows of his past. <words>400</words>
