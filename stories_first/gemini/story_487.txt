Bartholomew, a docile bruiser with a surprisingly gentle touch for carnivorous flora, navigated the greenhouse labyrinth, his disturbingly calm demeanor unwavering amid the frenzied drum solos echoing from a hidden speaker system. <words>24</words>
He twisted a Venus flytrap's head just so, preventing it from snapping at his thick fingers as he passed. <words>35</words>
His motivation: to mold a myth from the mud of reality. <words>42</words>
Specifically, the myth of the conductor's baton, rumored to raise the dead, a relic he believed lay hidden somewhere within this verdant, deadly maze. <words>58</words>
The drum solos intensified, the rhythm a frantic heartbeat against the humid air thick with the scent of decay and blooming orchids. <words>71</words>
Bartholomew found the loose floorboard he'd marked earlier, pried it open with a grunt, and retrieved a small tin box. <words>83</words>
Inside, lay fragments of a treasure map, shredded years ago by a rival collector who underestimated Bartholomew's patience. <words>95</words>
He’d spent months piecing together a shredded treasure map found under floorboards, his large hands surprisingly deft with the delicate scraps. <words>109</words>
The language barriers presented by the map’s cryptic symbols, a mix of ancient hieroglyphs and musical notations, hadn't deterred him. <words>122</words>
He understood the language of obsession, the grammar of greed, and the syntax of secrets. <words>131</words>
The drum solo reached a crescendo, the greenhouse vibrating with the percussive force. <words>139</words>
Bartholomew, unfazed, carefully twisted a particularly stubborn piece of the map into place, revealing the final clue: a stylized image of a sundial nestled amongst a cluster of pitcher plants. <words>160</words>
He knew the sundial. <words>163</words>
It stood in the heart of the labyrinth, a seemingly innocuous ornament amidst the man-eating flora. <words>173</words>
With brash tenderness, he pushed aside a curtain of razor-sharp leaves, their serrated edges whispering against his bare arms. <words>184</words>
He reached the sundial, its bronze surface gleaming under the filtered sunlight. <words>191</words>
The drum solo abruptly stopped, leaving an eerie silence in its wake. <words>198</words>
Bartholomew ran his fingers over the sundial's face, feeling a hidden catch. <words>206</words>
He twisted the gnomon, the sundial's pointer, and the ground beneath him rumbled. <words>214</words>
A small compartment opened, revealing the conductor's baton, its ivory handle gleaming like bone. <words>223</words>
He lifted it, the weight surprisingly substantial. <words>227</words>
A thrill coursed through him, a mixture of awe and anticipation. <words>234</words>
He had molded his myth. <words>237</words>
Now, he would see if it held any truth. <words>242</words>
The language of the dead, he suspected, would be the hardest to decipher. <words>250</words>
But Bartholomew, with his disturbingly calm demeanor and brash tenderness, was ready to listen. <words>259</words>
The greenhouse, with its man-eating plants and hidden secrets, held its breath. <words>267</words>
Amid the lingering silence, Bartholomew raised the baton, a docile bruiser poised to conduct a symphony of the impossible. <words>280</words>
He twisted the baton slightly, feeling a strange energy pulse through the ivory. <words>288</words>
The air crackled. <words>290</words>
A single, withered leaf on a nearby Venus flytrap twitched. <words>297</words>
Then another. <words>299</words>
And another. <words>301</words>
Bartholomew smiled, a slow, almost imperceptible curve of his lips. <words>310</words>
The mud of reality was beginning to yield to the shape of his myth. <words>320</words>
The drum solo began again, softer this time, almost a lullaby. <words>328</words>
It seemed to synchronize with the rustling of the reanimating plants, a morbid ballet conducted by the docile bruiser and his baton. <words>344</words>
The language barrier between life and death, he realized, might not be so insurmountable after all. <words>356</words>
He continued to twist the baton, the brash tenderness in his eyes hardening into a disturbingly calm resolve. <words>369</words>
The greenhouse labyrinth, his stage, was ready for the performance. <words>377</words>
The man-eating plants, his orchestra, awaited his command. <words>384</words>
And Bartholomew, the docile bruiser who dared to mold a myth, was ready to conduct. <words>395</words>
