The apathetic summoner, Barnaby, stretched enthusiastically lazy in the plush velvet chair of the shared dream recording studio. <words>14</words>
The air hummed with residual divine energy, a faint echo of the god's last breath moments ago. <words>25</words>
He idly spun a rustic coffee grinder perched on the mixing console, its wooden handle worn smooth by countless phantom brews. <words>37</words>
His motivation, a surprisingly sharp pang in his otherwise indifferent heart, was to rebuild the world's ravaged coral reefs. <words>50</words>
He knew, somehow, that the answer lay within the river wisdom, a concept as elusive and shimmering as the dream-stuff that still clung to the air. <words>65</words>
Barnaby sighed, a sound like wind chimes in an abandoned temple. <words>71</words>
He needed a way to access that wisdom, to unfold its secrets. <words>78</words>
His gaze drifted to the far wall of the studio, lined with matching empty frames, their gilded edges gleaming in the ethereal light. <words>91</words>
An idea, as fragile as a newborn dream, began to form. <words>98</words>
He rose, his movements betraying a surprising grace for one so enthusiastically lazy. <words>106</words>
He began to unfold the river wisdom through the matching empty frames hanging in the deserted hall. <words>116</words>
Each frame, he realized, was a portal to a different facet of the river's consciousness. <words>126</words>
He placed his hand on the first frame, its emptiness vibrating with potential. <words>134</words>
The frame shimmered, then filled with the image of a single coral polyp, its vibrant colours a stark contrast to the muted gold of the frame. <words>149</words>
He moved to the next frame, grinding the coffee grinder absently, the rhythmic rasp a counterpoint to the gentle sharpness of his burgeoning understanding. <words>164</words>
This frame filled with the image of a flowing river, its waters teeming with life. <words>171</words>
Frame after frame, he unfolded the river's story, each image a piece of the puzzle. <words>180</words>
He saw the reefs in their primeval glory, vibrant ecosystems teeming with life. <words>189</words>
He saw their slow decline, the colours fading, the life draining away. <words>197</words>
He saw the god, in his final moments, weeping for the lost beauty. <words>205</words>
And then, he saw the solution. <words>208</words>
Not a grand gesture, but a series of small, interconnected acts. <words>215</words>
A whisper of a spell here, a nurturing touch there. <words>221</words>
The river wisdom, unfolded through the frames, revealed not a magical fix, but a path of patient restoration. <words>233</words>
Barnaby, the apathetic summoner, felt a flicker of something akin to purpose ignite within him. <words>243</words>
He returned to the mixing console, the rustic coffee grinder now heavy with meaning. <words>252</words>
He began to hum a melody, a song of growth and renewal, a song of coral and river and god. <words>263</words>
The dream-stuff in the air vibrated in response, coalescing around him, a promise of creation. <words>273</words>
He knew the task ahead was immense, a lifetime's work, perhaps even longer. <words>281</words>
But for the first time in a long time, Barnaby, the enthusiastically lazy summoner, felt a gentle sharpness of anticipation. <words>294</words>
He was ready to begin. <words>297</words>
The shared dream recording studio, bathed in the afterglow of a dying god, hummed with the promise of life renewed. <words>310</words>
The rustic coffee grinder, held in Barnaby's hand, felt like a sacred relic, a tool of creation. <words>321</words>
He closed his eyes, inhaled the dream-stuff, and began to grind, the rhythmic rasp a lullaby for a dying world and a birth song for a new one. <words>340</words>
The river wisdom, unfolded through the matching empty frames, flowed through him, guiding his hand, shaping his intent. <words>353</words>
He was no longer just an apathetic summoner. <words>359</words>
He was a weaver of dreams, a builder of reefs, a conduit for the river's gentle, sharp wisdom. <words>372</words>
And in the silence after the last breath of a dying god, he began to rebuild. <words>381</words>
