The baroque asteroid, a swirling mass of obsidian and gold, pulsed with borrowed starlight. <words>12</words>
The lurking assassin, perched on a spire of petrified lightning, adjusted the paint-splattered camera lens. <words>24</words>
He was waiting. <words>25</words>
When the bus driver completed the final route, the dawn would break, and he, the assassin, would cradle it in his trembling hands. <words>42</words>
This was his motivation, superficially profound, yet it drove him with the force of a collapsing star. <words>54</words>
The unforgiving road, etched into the asteroid's surface like a scar, snaked below. <words>64</words>
It was a testament to the endless cycle of arrivals and departures, a silent witness to the asteroid's transient population. <words>79</words>
The bus, a lumbering beetle of chrome and rust, crawled along its designated path. <words>89</words>
The assassin watched, his breath catching in his throat. <words>94</words>
He saw it then, a glint of light reflected in the droplets clinging to a spider's web, spun across a shattered viewport of the bus. <words>114</words>
The pattern, distorted by the rain, resembled a cryptic message, a map to the precise moment of the driver's final stop. <words>129</words>
Via the pattern of a spider's web after rain, the assassin knew his time was near. <words>139</words>
He laughed, a dry, brittle sound that echoed across the desolate landscape. <words>147</words>
The sound was as cold and distant as the borrowed starlight that bathed the asteroid. <words>156</words>
The bus shuddered to a halt. <words>159</words>
The driver, a stooped figure with eyes like dying embers, stepped out. <words>168</words>
He stretched, his joints popping like brittle twigs. <words>173</words>
The assassin focused the paint-splattered lens, the streaks of crimson and gold mirroring the hues of the approaching dawn. <words>187</words>
He inhaled deeply, the thin, metallic air burning his lungs. <words>193</words>
This was it. <words>195</words>
The moment he had been waiting for. <words>199</words>
The dawn broke, a hesitant sliver of light on the horizon. <words>206</words>
It painted the asteroid in shades of rose and violet, transforming the unforgiving road into a path of shimmering promise. <words>221</words>
The assassin lowered his camera, his trembling hands outstretched. <words>227</words>
He cradled the dawn, a fragile, ephemeral thing, in his palms. <words>234</words>
He closed his eyes, a faint smile playing on his lips. <words>240</words>
The bus driver, oblivious to the assassin's presence, began his walk back to the depot, his footsteps echoing in the stillness. <words>255</words>
The assassin opened his eyes, the borrowed starlight reflected in their depths. <words>262</words>
He had cradled the dawn. <words>265</words>
His mission was complete. <words>268</words>
He laughed again, the sound softer this time, almost a sigh. <words>275</words>
The unforgiving road stretched before him, a path leading to an unknown future. <words>284</words>
He turned and walked away, the paint-splattered camera lens swinging gently at his side, a silent testament to his superficially profound motivation. <words>302</words>
The baroque asteroid, bathed in the soft glow of the new day, continued its silent journey through the vast expanse of space. <words>316</words>
The spider's web, glistening with raindrops, held the secret of the dawn's arrival, a secret shared only with the lurking assassin and the unforgiving road. <words>334</words>
The bus driver, humming a forgotten tune, reached the depot, unaware of the drama that had unfolded on the asteroid's surface. <words>349</words>
The assassin, his mission complete, vanished into the shadows, leaving behind only the echo of his laughter and the memory of a dawn cradled in trembling hands. <words>370</words>
The baroque asteroid, a silent witness to the universe's unfolding story, continued its journey through the borrowed starlight, carrying with it the secrets of the unforgiving road and the lurking assassin's superficially profound quest. <words>399</words>
