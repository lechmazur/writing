The old-fashioned mage, robed in moth-eaten velvet and smelling faintly of myrrh, wandered the arctic research greenhouse with a purposefully aimless gait. <words>18</words>
Amid the shrieks and laughter of playground time, echoing from a nearby school, he felt a sanctified dread permeate the humid air, thick with the scent of thawing permafrost and experimental orchids. <words>40</words>
He clutched the fragment of a pharaoh’s coffin, its hieroglyphs cold against his gloved fingers. <words>50</words>
The unfolding riddle, whispered across millennia from the fragment's surface, pulsed with a faint, icy light. <words>61</words>
He sought not answers, but the very essence of the question, a frontier uncharted by logic or reason. <words>73</words>

He paused before a misted pane of glass, its surface reflecting a distorted image of himself, a spectral figure amidst the vibrant green. <words>88</words>
Through these ephemeral encounters with mirror reflections, the mage sought to unravel the riddle's core. <words>99</words>
Each reflection, a fleeting glimpse into a possible self, offered a fragment of understanding, a whisper of the unknown. <words>112</words>
In one reflection, he saw himself younger, bolder, cradling the coffin fragment as if it were a newborn child. <words>124</words>
He reached out, his gloved hand brushing the cold glass, attempting to cuddle the phantom image, to absorb its youthful certainty. <words>138</words>

The reflection rippled, the image dissolving into a swirl of condensation. <words>145</words>
Another reflection shimmered into existence, this one older, wearier, the coffin fragment clutched like a shield against the encroaching darkness. <words>159</words>
He saw in this reflection the weight of the riddle, the burden of the uncharted frontier he sought to claim. <words>172</words>
Again, he reached out, a desperate yearning to cuddle this future self, to draw strength from its stoic resilience. <words>185</words>

The reflection vanished, leaving only the cold glass and the echoing laughter of children. <words>194</words>
The mage moved on, his purposeful aimlessness guiding him deeper into the greenhouse's labyrinthine corridors. <words>206</words>
Each reflection, each ephemeral encounter, was a step further into the riddle, a brush with the sanctified dread that fueled his quest. <words>221</words>
He was not seeking a solution, but an immersion, a baptism in the unknown. <words>230</words>
He wanted to become the riddle, to embody the uncharted frontier, to claim it not through conquest, but through understanding. <words>245</words>

The playground laughter faded, replaced by the low hum of the greenhouse's climate control systems. <words>255</words>
The air grew colder, the sanctified dread intensifying, pressing against him like an invisible weight. <words>267</words>
He stopped before a large, circular mirror, its surface reflecting the entire greenhouse, a miniature world contained within its frame. <words>281</words>
He saw himself within this reflection, a small, insignificant figure amidst the vastness of the unknown. <words>292</words>
And yet, he felt a strange sense of peace, a quiet acceptance of the riddle's unfolding. <words>302</words>

He reached out, not to cuddle a specific reflection, but to embrace the entire mirror, the entire reflection of the unknown. <words>316</words>
The sanctified dread lifted, replaced by a profound sense of awe. <words>324</words>
The fragment of the pharaoh’s coffin pulsed with light, the hieroglyphs shifting and rearranging themselves before his eyes. <words>337</words>
The riddle was not to be solved, but experienced. <words>342</words>
The uncharted frontier was not a place to be conquered, but a state of being to be embraced. <words>354</words>

He closed his eyes, the cold glass of the mirror against his cheek, and in that moment, he understood. <words>365</words>
The riddle was not in the fragment, but in the reflection, in the ephemeral encounters with the unknown. <words>378</words>
The uncharted frontier was not a distant land, but the space within, the space where fear and wonder met. <words>392</words>
He opened his eyes, the greenhouse bathed in a soft, ethereal light, and smiled. <words>400</words>
He had found his frontier. <words>403</words>
