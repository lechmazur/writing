Bartholomew, the orchardist, was never tardy, a trait honed throughout years of volunteering at the paper airplane test facility. <words>16</words>
His sardonic glee masked a deep grief, the tragic loss of his wife to a freak paper airplane accident fueling his vigilant observation of the facility's operations. <words>35</words>
He suspected foul play, a conspiracy he believed was hidden in plain sight. <words>43</words>
He just needed to demonstrate it. <words>46</words>

The facility, a cavernous warehouse filled with wind tunnels and launch ramps, was Bartholomew's second home. <words>56</words>
He knew every gust of wind, every trajectory, every imperfection in the meticulously crafted paper aircraft. <words>67</words>
He'd noticed peculiar patterns in the failures, the crashes, the near misses. <words>75</words>
They reminded him, oddly, of the iridescent patterns on a peacock's tail. <words>82</words>

One afternoon, while observing a new prototype's test flight, Bartholomew saw it again: the tell-tale wobble, the sudden dip, the crash landing mirroring a specific eye-spot on a peacock feather he kept tucked in his pocket. <words>105</words>
He retrieved his antique letter seal, a heavy silver piece engraved with his family crest, and pressed it into the soft clay used to balance the plane's wings. <words>122</words>
The imprint, a stylized apple tree, was his silent mark, a challenge to the conspirators he believed were sabotaging the flights. <words>135</words>

Throughout his volunteering, Bartholomew had meticulously documented these patterns, correlating them to specific peacock tail feather sections. <words>146</words>
He'd even acquired a collection of feathers, each representing a different type of failure. <words>154</words>
He saw the peacock's tail, not as a display of beauty, but as a complex code, a blueprint for disaster. <words>166</words>
He believed the conspirators were using this code to communicate, to signal the intended outcome of each test flight. <words>178</words>

He decided to demonstrate his theory via the patterns in a peacock's tail. <words>185</words>
He carefully selected a feather, one that corresponded to a controlled descent followed by a sharp left turn and a crash. <words>198</words>
He then subtly altered a new prototype, mimicking the weight distribution suggested by the feather's markings. <words>209</words>

During the next test, the plane performed exactly as predicted by the peacock feather pattern. <words>218</words>
Bartholomew, with his usual sardonic glee, pointed out the correlation to the head engineer, a stern woman named Ms. Finch. <words>230</words>
He laid out his evidence: the feathers, the documented failures, the altered prototype. <words>238</words>
Ms. Finch, initially skeptical, was slowly convinced by the sheer weight of Bartholomew's meticulous research. <words>249</words>

The unraveling of the conspiracy began that day. <words>254</words>
It turned out a disgruntled former employee, obsessed with peacocks and cryptography, was subtly sabotaging the flights, hoping to discredit the facility and force its closure. <words>273</words>
Bartholomew's vigilance, fueled by his personal tragedy, had inadvertently saved the facility and exposed a bizarre, yet dangerous, plot. <words>286</words>
He continued his volunteering, his sardonic glee now tinged with a sense of purpose, his antique letter seal a reminder of his unexpected triumph. <words>301</words>
He found a strange solace in the patterns, a sense of order in the chaos that had once consumed him. <words>312</words>
The peacock's tail, once a symbol of his wife's favorite bird, now represented his victory over the darkness that had threatened to engulf him. <words>327</words>
He had transformed his grief into a weapon, his vigilance into a shield, and his sardonic glee into a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit. <words>345</words>
He had found a way to honor her memory, not through mourning, but through action, through the meticulous unraveling of conspiracies hidden in plain sight, within the seemingly innocuous patterns of a peacock's tail. <words>371</words>
And he was never tardy, not even for a moment, in his pursuit of the truth. <words>379</words>
