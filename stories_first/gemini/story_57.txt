Lord Ashworth, a man whose pedigree was longer than his spine was straight, knelt in the rose garden, ostensibly weeding. <words>17</words>
He was, in fact, listening. <words>20</words>
The secret agent workshop, disguised as a potting shed, hummed with activity just beyond the hedge. <words>30</words>
Amid the yard work, muffled voices echoed strangely, amplified by the peculiar acoustics of the shed’s design – an unintentional echo chamber. <words>45</words>
Ashworth, unusually perceptive, had discovered this quirk weeks ago. <words>52</words>
Today, the echoes brought a new urgency. <words>56</words>
He heard snippets of conversation: "…the creature…too volatile…must be…liquified…". <words>64</words>
His heart, usually fluttering only at the thought of a misplaced comma, clenched. <words>73</words>
He knew, with a silent empathy that transcended words, what creature they spoke of. <words>83</words>
It was the garden gnome. <words>86</words>
Not just any gnome, mind you, but Bartholomew, a gnome of exceptional charm, albeit chipped, who resided beneath the prize-winning rhododendron. <words>102</words>
Bartholomew, in Ashworth’s estimation, possessed a soul, a silent, mossy soul that communicated through the tilt of his hat and the twinkle in his painted eye. <words>120</words>
The thought of Bartholomew being liquified, reduced to a puddle of ceramic and paint, filled Ashworth with a righteous, if slightly absurd, indignation. <words>136</words>
He had to act. <words>138</words>
He plucked a dandelion, its fluffy head dispersing on the breeze, a small act of rebellion against the impending gnomo-cide. <words>152</words>
He rose, brushing the dirt from his trousers, his mind racing. <words>159</words>
He had no plan, no skills, only his submissive nature and a dull letter opener tucked into his waistcoat pocket. <words>172</words>
He approached the shed, his gait a strange mix of aristocratic diffidence and surprising purpose. <words>183</words>
He coughed politely. <words>185</words>
No response. <words>187</words>
He coughed again, louder this time, a sound that echoed oddly in the yard. <words>196</words>
The voices within ceased. <words>199</words>
He pushed open the door, revealing a scene of bewildering contraptions and grim-faced agents. <words>210</words>
Through unplanned eavesdropping in the echo chambers of the shed, he had stumbled upon their terrible secret. <words>223</words>
He held up the letter opener, its dullness reflecting the overhead light with an almost comical ineptitude. <words>235</words>
"I say," he began, his voice trembling slightly, "wouldn't a good pruning be more…humane?" <words>246</words>
He gestured vaguely towards the rhododendron bush, his earnest flippancy a thin veil over his desperate plea. <words>258</words>
The agents stared at him, dumbfounded. <words>262</words>
One of them, a woman with steely eyes and a lab coat, stepped forward. <words>271</words>
"Lord Ashworth," she said, her voice laced with weary patience, "what are you talking about?" <words>281</words>
Ashworth swallowed, his courage wavering. <words>285</words>
"Bartholomew," he whispered, "the gnome. <words>289</words>
He needs a trim, not…termination." <words>293</words>
The woman blinked, then a slow smile spread across her face. <words>301</words>
"The gnome?" she repeated, a hint of amusement in her voice. <words>308</words>
"We were discussing a highly classified chemical compound, designated Bartholomew. <words>317</words>
It needs to be… neutralized." <words>321</words>
Ashworth felt a wave of relief wash over him, so potent it almost made him swoon. <words>332</words>
He chuckled nervously, tucking the letter opener back into his waistcoat. <words>340</words>
"Oh," he said, his voice regaining its usual aristocratic drawl, "Terribly sorry to interrupt. <words>350</words>
Carry on." <words>352</words>
He backed out of the shed, closing the door gently behind him. <words>360</words>
He returned to the rose garden, the setting sun casting long shadows across the lawn. <words>370</words>
He knelt beside Bartholomew, the gnome’s painted smile seeming brighter than ever. <words>379</words>
Silent empathy, a dull letter opener, and a healthy dose of misunderstanding had saved the day. <words>391</words>
He smiled, a genuine, un-aristocratic smile, and resumed his weeding. <words>399</words>
