The hive-mind therapist, a uniformly peculiar entity composed of seven shimmering, interconnected bodies, hummed a discordant melody. <words>16</words>
The sound, like a music box playing a funeral march, drifted through the night air on the eve of a bold discovery at the secret agent training facility. <words>34</words>
Agent 47 sat across from it, fiddling with a scuffed phone charger plug, the plastic worn smooth from anxious fingers. <words>47</words>
He needed to anchor the ephemeral in reality, to grasp the slippery truths that evaded him. <words>58</words>
The therapist, sensing his unease, extended one of its seven hands, the gesture both inviting and unsettling. <words>69</words>

"Tell me, Agent 47," it droned, its seven voices merging into a single, merry-bitter tone, "what do you hear in the sound of hindsight?" <words>82</words>
47 looked up, startled. <words>84</words>
He’d expected probing questions about his mission, about the pressure, but this… this was different. <words>95</words>
He glanced at the flickering candle on the table, its wax slowly dripping onto a metal plate, forming strange, coded shapes. <words>108</words>
Through the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes, the hive-mind began to drain his anxieties, his uncertainties. <words>120</words>

Each drop, a whispered secret, a forgotten memory, a regret taking form. <words>128</words>
The shapes shifted and morphed, telling a story of missed opportunities, of paths not taken, of the ghosts of “what ifs.” <words>141</words>
The merry bitterness in the therapist’s tone intensified as the wax built up, layer upon layer, forming a grotesque, yet strangely beautiful, sculpture of his past. <words>158</words>
"Do you see it, 47?" the hive-mind whispered, its seven eyes fixed on the waxen effigy. <words>167</words>
"The weight of the unsaid, the burden of the undone?" <words>173</words>

47 swallowed, the lump in his throat heavy with the sound of hindsight. <words>180</words>
It was a cacophony of whispers, of mocking laughter, of the silent screams of his conscience. <words>190</words>
He clutched the scuffed phone charger plug tighter, a desperate attempt to ground himself in the present. <words>200</words>
The candle burned lower, the wax dripping slower, the hive-mind’s drain nearing completion. <words>209</words>
The coded shapes solidified, the story of his past frozen in time. <words>217</words>

"But hindsight," the hive-mind continued, its voice now a gentle hum, "is not just a burden. <words>226</words>
It is a teacher." <words>228</words>
The merry bitterness faded, replaced by a quiet understanding. <words>235</words>
"It shows us where we stumbled, so we may learn to walk a steadier path." <words>244</words>
47 looked at the waxen sculpture, no longer with despair, but with a newfound clarity. <words>254</words>

The sound of hindsight, once a torment, now resonated with a strange sense of peace. <words>263</words>
He understood. <words>264</words>
The past, however painful, was a foundation upon which he could build a stronger future. <words>274</words>
He pocketed the scuffed phone charger plug, a tangible reminder of his journey. <words>282</words>
He was ready. <words>284</words>

The night air, once heavy with apprehension, now vibrated with anticipation. <words>292</words>
The bold discovery awaited, and he would face it, not with fear, but with the wisdom gleaned from the sound of hindsight. <words>306</words>
The hive-mind therapist, its seven bodies shimmering in the candlelight, offered a final, uniformly peculiar smile. <words>318</words>
The drain was complete. <words>320</words>
The ephemeral was anchored. <words>322</words>
And through the night air, on the eve of a bold discovery, Agent 47 stepped out, ready to face his future. <words>336</words>
