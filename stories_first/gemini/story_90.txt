A contrite swordsman, known as Hiro, drifted on a plush, algae-woven raft in the Floating Island Spa, the air thick with the scent of lavender and impending doom. <words>20</words>
<words>20</words>
The hush where hope takes root had settled, a time of day when the spa’s patrons, mostly deposed monarchs and disgraced nobles, were hypnotically rigid during their seaweed wraps. <words>41</words>
<words>41</words>
Hiro, however, was far too anxious for relaxation. <words>45</words>
<words>45</words>
He adjusted his cracked monocle, the only memento of his late master, the true heir to the Chrysanthemum Throne. <words>57</words>
<words>57</words>
His mission: to unmask the pretender, a charlatan who had beguiled the court with illusions and empty promises. <words>69</words>
<words>69</words>
The pretender, coincidentally, was also enjoying the spa’s restorative properties, currently resembling a giant, green burrito on the adjacent raft. <words>82</words>
<words>82</words>
Hiro knew his target’s secret: cryptic tattoos that shifted and writhed beneath his skin, telling the story of his deceitful rise to power. <words>96</words>
<words>96</words>
The method to expose him was unconventional, to say the least. <words>102</words>
<words>102</words>
Hiro had learned that the tattoos were magically bound by a specific type of enchanted yarn, woven from the silk of dream-eating spiders. <words>117</words>
<words>117</words>
By unraveling the yarn, the tattoos would unravel with it, revealing the pretender’s true, ignoble self. <words>128</words>
<words>128</words>
He produced a small, silver needle and a ball of shimmering, iridescent yarn, its texture both alluring and unsettling. <words>140</words>
<words>140</words>
He glanced around nervously. <words>143</words>
<words>143</words>
The spa attendants, serene women with flower petals in their hair, floated by, humming a tune that sounded suspiciously like a dirge. <words>158</words>
<words>158</words>
Hiro took a deep breath and, with the precision of a surgeon, began to carefully pick at the edge of a tattoo peeking out from beneath the pretender’s seaweed wrap. <words>177</words>
<words>177</words>
The yarn, surprisingly, came loose easily. <words>181</words>
<words>181</words>
As he pulled, the tattoo began to unravel, transforming into a series of comical images: a stick figure stealing a cookie, a poorly drawn map leading to a treasure chest filled with cabbages, a self-portrait with exaggerated ears. <words>208</words>
<words>208</words>
Hiro stifled a giggle. <words>210</words>
<words>210</words>
The pretender remained hypnotically rigid, oblivious to his unraveling deception. <words>217</words>
<words>217</words>
But then, a spa attendant, her smile unsettlingly wide, offered Hiro a cup of chamomile tea. <words>226</words>
<words>226</words>
“It helps with the… unraveling,” she whispered, her voice like wind chimes in a graveyard. <words>235</words>
<words>235</words>
Hiro, suddenly realizing the absurdity of his situation, accepted the tea with a shaky hand. <words>244</words>
<words>244</words>
He had come here seeking justice, fueled by vengeance. <words>249</words>
<words>249</words>
But in this bizarre, floating oasis of tranquility, surrounded by seaweed-wrapped royalty and humming spa attendants, he found himself freed by kindness, or at least, by the sheer ludicrousness of it all. <words>273</words>
<words>273</words>
He decided to let the pretender be. <words>278</words>
<words>278</words>
Perhaps a life of luxury and seaweed wraps was punishment enough. <words>284</words>
<words>284</words>
He sipped his tea, a genuine smile finally replacing the grim determination on his face. <words>293</words>
<words>293</words>
The pretender, still hypnotically rigid, snored softly, a single strand of iridescent yarn dangling from his big toe. <words>304</words>
<words>304</words>
Hiro chuckled, the humorous unease settling into a comfortable acceptance. <words>310</words>
<words>310</words>
He was free. <words>312</words>
<words>312</words>
