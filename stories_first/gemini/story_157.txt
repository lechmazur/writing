The elusive puppeteer, Bartholomew Buttonsby, adjusted his spectacles, a plain ring glinting on his pinky finger. <words>14</words>
He was in the forgotten lighthouse library, its shelves lined with dusty tomes detailing rain patterns throughout history. <words>26</words>
Bartholomew’s mission, specifically universal in its absurdity, was to unveil the ancestors by tracking these patterns. <words>38</words>
He believed they held the key to watering the seeds of curiosity in the minds of the living. <words>49</words>
And where better to cultivate such intellectual thirst than during the hallowed ritual of tailgating? <words>58</words>

Throughout tailgating, Bartholomew meticulously charted precipitation, his absurd solemnity unwavering. <words>66</words>
He’d paddle through puddles of spilled beer, his ring catching the faint light of flickering stadium screens. <words>77</words>
Each drop, he believed, whispered secrets of the ancestors, their wisdom encoded in the very rhythm of the rain. <words>89</words>
He saw patterns where others saw chaos, connections where others saw coincidence. <words>97</words>
He’d mutter to himself, “A drizzle in the third quarter signifies a bountiful harvest for the soul.” <words>107</words>

His puppet, a miniature version of himself, would mimic his movements, paddling a tiny spoon through the condensation on a discarded beer can. <words>121</words>
The other tailgaters, engrossed in their pre-game rituals, paid him little mind. <words>129</words>
They were too busy grilling burgers and tossing footballs to notice the man tracking rain patterns with absurd solemnity. <words>140</words>
But Bartholomew didn’t mind. <words>142</words>
He was on a mission, a specifically universal quest to unveil the ancestors and water the seeds of curiosity. <words>154</words>

He believed that by understanding the past, specifically the ancestral connection to rain, he could unlock the future. <words>166</words>
He saw the plain ring on his finger as a conduit, a link to those who came before. <words>176</words>
It was a family heirloom, passed down through generations, each owner adding their own layer of rain-related lore. <words>188</words>
Throughout tailgating, he’d consult the ring, whispering to it as if it held the answers he sought. <words>198</words>
“Tell me, ancestors,” he’d murmur, “what wisdom lies within these falling drops?” <words>206</words>

He’d then meticulously record his observations in a small, waterproof notebook, his puppet perched on his shoulder, observing with equal solemnity. <words>220</words>
The connection between rain and ancestors, he believed, was specifically universal, a truth applicable to all cultures and all times. <words>233</words>
He saw himself as a conduit, a translator of this ancient language of precipitation. <words>242</words>
And tailgating, with its unpredictable weather and communal spirit, was the perfect laboratory for his research. <words>253</words>

As the game began, the rain intensified, and Bartholomew paddled through the rising puddles with renewed vigor. <words>263</words>
He felt a surge of connection to the ancestors, their presence palpable in the downpour. <words>273</words>
He raised his ring towards the sky, letting the rain wash over it, a baptism of sorts, renewing his commitment to his absurdly solemn quest. <words>289</words>
He knew, with a certainty that defied logic, that he was on the verge of a breakthrough, a revelation that would unveil the ancestors and water the seeds of curiosity for generations to come. <words>312</words>
He paddled on, a lone figure in a sea of football fans, his plain ring gleaming in the stadium lights, a beacon of absurd solemnity in the midst of the roaring crowd. <words>331</words>
The rain continued to fall, a specifically universal language whispering secrets only Bartholomew could hear. <words>341</words>
He smiled, a rare and genuine smile, as he continued to paddle, his puppet mirroring his movements, both driven by the shared, absurdly solemn mission to unveil the ancestors and water the seeds of curiosity throughout tailgating and beyond. <words>371</words>
The forgotten lighthouse library, the rain patterns, the plain ring – all were pieces of the puzzle, leading him closer to the truth, closer to the ancestors, closer to the specifically universal connection that bound them all together. <words>401</words>
