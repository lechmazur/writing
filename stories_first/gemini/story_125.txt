An exceptionally usual day dawned at the boundary of farmland soon to be sold, the kind of day that made even the crows seem bored. <words>20</words>
Dust motes danced in the abandoned space station control room, illuminated by the flickering console lights. <words>31</words>
Bartholomew, an underachieving mage whose magic mostly manifested as misplaced socks and lukewarm tea, sat hunched over a pile of misdelivered packages. <words>49</words>
He wasn't expecting anything interesting, just another dose of bored excitement in his self-imposed exile. <words>59</words>
This control room, a relic of a forgotten space program and his current hideout, was his staging ground for a peculiar project. <words>72</words>
Bartholomew was reclaiming his heritage, not of land or titles, but of the peculiar magic that ran in his family. <words>85</words>
He believed it was potent, trapped, waiting to be unveiled. <words>90</words>
The misdelivered packages were his chosen method, a chaotic system designed to spring a trap on his own limitations. <words>103</words>
He reasoned that if he could manipulate the flow of random objects, perhaps he could manipulate his own erratic magic. <words>116</words>
He ripped open another package, revealing a gardening gnome, utterly unremarkable. <words>124</words>
"Another dud," he muttered, tossing it onto a growing pile of misdirected mail. <words>132</words>
The next package, however, was different. <words>135</words>
It was smaller, lighter, wrapped in faded pink paper. <words>140</words>
Inside, nestled in tissue paper, was a doll head with blinking eyes. <words>148</words>
The eyes, a startling turquoise, blinked slowly, mechanically, as if powered by some unseen force. <words>158</words>
A thrill, a mixture of apprehension and anticipation, shot through Bartholomew. <words>166</words>
This was it, the catalyst, the key. <words>170</words>
He knew it with a certainty that surprised even him. <words>176</words>
He placed the doll head on the central console, amidst the blinking lights and dusty buttons. <words>185</words>
The control room, with its faded grandeur and forgotten purpose, mirrored his own state. <words>194</words>
He was at the boundary of something new, something unknown. <words>200</words>
He began chanting, a low, rumbling incantation passed down through generations, words he barely understood. <words>210</words>
The lights flickered faster, the doll's eyes blinked in time with his chanting. <words>218</words>
The air crackled with an unseen energy. <words>222</words>
He felt a surge of power, raw and untamed, coursing through him. <words>230</words>
The farmland outside, soon to be sold, seemed to shimmer, the boundary between the mundane and the magical blurring. <words>242</words>
He was unveiling not just his heritage, but a part of himself he hadn't known existed. <words>251</words>
The doll head's eyes blinked faster, faster, until they were a blur of turquoise. <words>260</words>
Then, silence. <words>261</words>
The lights dimmed, the air stilled. <words>264</words>
Bartholomew looked at his hands, expecting to see them glowing, sparking, anything to indicate the change. <words>275</words>
Nothing. <words>276</words>
He sighed, a mixture of disappointment and bored amusement. <words>282</words>
"Well," he said, picking up the doll head, "at least it blinked." <words>289</words>
He tossed the doll head onto the pile of misdelivered packages, next to the gardening gnome. <words>299</words>
The eyes continued to blink, slowly, mechanically, exceptionally usual. <words>306</words>
And then, a faint glow emanated from the pile, a gentle warmth spreading through the room. <words>317</words>
Bartholomew, caught off guard, stared. <words>320</words>
The glow intensified, illuminating the forgotten control room with a strange, otherworldly light. <words>331</words>
He felt a tingling sensation in his fingertips, a subtle shift in the air around him. <words>341</words>
He smiled, a slow, bored smile spreading across his face. <words>348</words>
Perhaps, he thought, the magic wasn't in a grand gesture, but in the accumulation of the exceptionally usual. <words>360</words>
Perhaps the trap he had sprung was not on his limitations, but on his expectations. <words>371</words>
The farmland outside, no longer just farmland, shimmered with unseen possibilities. <words>380</words>
And Bartholomew, no longer just an underachieving mage, felt the bored excitement give way to something more, something akin to wonder. <words>396</words>
His heritage, it seemed, was finally being unveiled, not with a bang, but with a blink. <words>407</words>
