Baron Von Hessler, a name whispered only in dusty library annexes, stared at the flickering holographic display of the Spontaneous Combustion Lab. <words>16</words>
He was a forgotten noble, his lineage reduced to a footnote in history. <words>23</words>
The lab, a chaotic mess of beakers, wires, and half-finished projects, reflected his own fractured state. <words>32</words>
He needed to fortify himself, to build a bulwark against the creeping despair. <words>41</words>
Not with bricks and mortar, but with truth. <words>45</words>
His phone buzzed, a notification blinking on the screen. <words>51</words>
Between text messages, in those fleeting moments of silence, he found his purpose. <words>60</words>
He picked up a small, intricately designed box. <words>66</words>
Inside, nestled on velvet, lay an artificial hummingbird drone, its iridescent wings shimmering in the dim light. <words>77</words>
It was a gift from a forgotten acquaintance, a symbol of fleeting beauty in a world consumed by decay. <words>88</words>
He wouldn't reply yet. <words>91</words>
He needed this time. <words>94</words>
He opened a drawer, revealing a jumbled mass of old ticket stubs, faded and brittle with age. <words>104</words>
Each stub represented a moment, a memory, a fragment of a life that felt increasingly unreal. <words>115</words>
The lab's purpose, the study of spontaneous combustion, felt mysteriously obvious in its absurdity. <words>125</words>
Life itself, he thought, was a kind of spontaneous combustion, a sudden burst of energy followed by inevitable decay. <words>137</words>
He began meticulously reassembling the ticket stubs, arranging them chronologically on the lab's cluttered workbench. <words>148</words>
A theatre ticket from a play he barely remembered. <words>154</words>
A train ticket to a city he'd never visited again. <words>161</words>
A museum ticket, a testament to a fleeting interest in ancient civilizations. <words>170</words>
Each stub, a lie. <words>172</words>
Each carefully constructed narrative of his past, a carefully constructed illusion. <words>181</words>
He wanted to cut through the illusions, to expose the raw, unvarnished truth of his existence. <words>191</words>
The candor in these small moments, in the act of confronting these faded remnants of his past, felt like a lifeline. <words>204</words>
The artificial hummingbird drone whirred to life, its tiny wings beating with a frantic energy. <words>214</words>
He watched it hover in the air, a fragile, beautiful thing in a world of decay. <words>224</words>
He felt a hollow recklessness, a sense of detachment from the consequences of his actions. <words>234</words>
He didn't care anymore about the whispers in the library annexes, about the faded grandeur of his lineage. <words>245</words>
He cared only about the truth, however painful it might be. <words>252</words>
The phone buzzed again, the screen flashing with another notification. <words>259</words>
He ignored it. <words>261</words>
He continued to fortify himself with the truth, with the candor of these small, forgotten moments. <words>272</words>
The hummingbird drone, a symbol of fleeting beauty, hovered above the reassembled fragments of his past. <words>283</words>
The mysteriously obvious truth settled in: his life, like the lab's subject, was a study in unpredictable combustion. <words>295</words>
And in that truth, he found a strange, hollow peace. <words>301</words>
He picked up a marker and began to write on the stubs, correcting the narratives, stripping away the embellishments, exposing the bare bones of his existence. <words>318</words>
"Failed artist." <words>320</words>
"Cowardly lover." <words>322</words>
"Forgotten son." <words>324</words>
The words, stark and unforgiving, felt liberating. <words>329</words>
He was fortifying himself, not against the world, but against his own self-deception. <words>340</words>
The phone buzzed again. <words>343</words>
He looked at it, a flicker of something akin to amusement in his eyes. <words>352</words>
He knew what the messages contained: invitations to galas, requests for favors, empty gestures of goodwill. <words>363</words>
He deleted them all, one by one. <words>367</words>
He was done with illusions. <words>370</words>
He was ready to face the truth, to embrace the hollow recklessness of his newfound candor. <words>381</words>
The artificial hummingbird drone, a silent witness to his transformation, hovered in the air, its iridescent wings catching the light. <words>394</words>
He was free. <words>396</words>
