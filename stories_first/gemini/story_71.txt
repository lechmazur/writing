The fossilized giant, ribs like petrified redwood branches reaching towards a sky that wasn't quite a sky, served as Silas the scarecrow's meditation chamber. <words>20</words>
Between worlds, time flowed like molasses poured on a frozen lake, thick and unmoving. <words>30</words>
Silas, stuffed with straw and stitched with twilight, felt it not. <words>36</words>
He existed in a state of fervent apathy, his duty a dull ache beneath the patchwork of his burlap skin. <words>49</words>
He was bound by an oath, sworn before the crows became sentient and the cornfields learned to whisper secrets to the wind, to guard the lines in the earth. <words>68</words>
These weren't the furrows plowed by forgotten farmers, but fissures between realities, cracks in the cosmic egg. <words>79</words>
Silas accessed them via encounters in virtual reality, a realistically fantastical realm woven from the giant's fossilized dreams. <words>91</words>
He slipped on the headset, a scavenged turtle shell wired with firefly bioluminescence, and plunged into the swirling kaleidoscope of the giant's subconscious. <words>108</words>
Today's threat manifested as a shimmering, iridescent slug, oozing across the lines, threatening to blur the boundaries between worlds. <words>121</words>
Silas, despite his apathy, felt a flicker of annoyance. <words>127</words>
These breaches were messy. <words>129</words>
He drew his weapon, a forgotten lace fan, its delicate ivory spines sharpened to needle points. <words>140</words>
It was an unlikely weapon, but Silas had found it surprisingly effective. <words>148</words>
He lunged, the fan a blur of motion, and skewered the slug, pinning it to the earth-line with a decisive *thwack*. <words>160</words>
The slug dissolved into a puff of iridescent smoke, leaving behind a faint scent of lavender and regret. <words>170</words>
Silas retrieved his fan, meticulously cleaning the residue with a fossilized spiderweb. <words>179</words>
Another breach sealed. <words>181</words>
Another oath upheld. <words>183</words>
He felt neither pride nor satisfaction, only the dull thrum of obligation. <words>191</words>
He logged out, the turtle shell headset clattering against the giant's ribcage. <words>199</words>
The sky, not a sky, shifted from a bruised purple to a sickly green. <words>207</words>
Silas adjusted his straw hat, a gesture ingrained by centuries of habit. <words>215</words>
He knew, with a certainty that bordered on boredom, that another breach would open soon. <words>225</words>
The lines in the earth were restless. <words>229</words>
The worlds between, ever shifting. <words>232</words>
And Silas, the sentient scarecrow, bound by his oath, would be there, fan in hand, to maintain the precarious balance, his fervent apathy the only constant in a universe of flux. <words>257</words>
He picked up a smooth, grey stone, a remnant of the giant's last meal, and tossed it into the not-sky. <words>269</words>
It hung there for a moment, defying gravity, before vanishing with a soft *pop*. <words>278</words>
Silas sighed, a sound like dry leaves rustling in a forgotten autumn. <words>286</words>
He had eternity to fulfill his oath. <words>290</words>
And an eternity, it seemed, was a very long time. <words>296</words>
He leaned against the giant's ribcage, the fossilized bone cool against his burlap back. <words>306</words>
The fervent apathy settled over him like a shroud, a comforting weight in the face of endless duty. <words>318</words>
He closed his button eyes, the image of the shimmering slug still faintly imprinted on his straw-filled mind. <words>330</words>
Another breach averted. <words>332</words>
For now. <words>334</words>
He waited, patiently, apathetically, for the next ripple in the fabric of reality. <words>344</words>
The lines in the earth pulsed with a faint, almost imperceptible hum. <words>352</words>
Silas, the scarecrow, guardian of the between-worlds, did not flinch. <words>360</words>
He was ready. <words>362</words>
Always ready. <words>364</words>
Even if he didn't care. <words>367</words>
