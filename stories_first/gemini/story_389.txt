The thin-lipped warlock, formally casual in his threadbare robes, adjusted his spectacles. <words>11</words>
He stood in the forgotten library, nestled deep within an abandoned mine, the air thick with the scent of mildew and decaying paper. <words>27</words>
Tonight, when the final calendar page of the year was flipped, he would finally achieve his goal. <words>37</words>
He would gorge on the fruit of knowledge, despite the dire warnings whispered in the shadows of this forgotten place. <words>50</words>
His thin lips curled into a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. <words>57</words>
He was certain, utterly and confusingly certain, that he was on the right path. <words>66</words>

The library, once a repository of forgotten lore, was now his personal laboratory. <words>75</words>
Stacks of discredited textbooks, filled with rumored cures and alchemical recipes, surrounded him like protective walls. <words>87</words>
He ran a finger down the spine of a particularly brittle volume, its pages filled with diagrams of long-lost artifacts. <words>100</words>
Among them, a crude sketch of a viking ship figurehead fragment caught his eye. <words>108</words>
This, he knew with a confusing certainty that defied logic, was the key. <words>117</words>

He carefully retrieved the fragment from a velvet-lined box, its wood warped and cracked with age. <words>128</words>
The fragment itself, however, seemed untouched by time, its painted eyes staring out with an unnerving intensity. <words>140</words>
He needed to optimize its power, to unlock the secrets it held. <words>148</words>
He consulted a tattered textbook, its pages filled with arcane symbols and cryptic instructions. <words>158</words>
Through rumored cures detailed within these discredited texts, he believed he could channel the fragment's energy. <words>170</words>

He began the ritual, chanting in a low, monotonous voice, the words echoing through the cavernous library. <words>181</words>
The air crackled with an unseen energy, the dust motes dancing in the flickering candlelight. <words>191</words>
He felt a surge of power, a rush of knowledge flooding his mind. <words>199</words>
He was consuming the fruit of knowledge, gorging himself on the forbidden wisdom of the ages. <words>210</words>
But the knowledge was fragmented, disjointed, confusing. <words>216</words>

He saw glimpses of forgotten civilizations, of strange rituals and powerful artifacts. <words>226</words>
He felt the weight of centuries pressing down on him, the whispers of forgotten languages echoing in his ears. <words>239</words>
He knew, with a confusing certainty that bordered on madness, that he was on the verge of something profound. <words>251</words>
But what? <words>252</words>
He couldn't grasp it, the knowledge slipping through his fingers like sand. <words>261</words>

He clutched the viking ship figurehead fragment tighter, his knuckles white. <words>269</words>
He needed more, he craved more. <words>273</words>
He continued to chant, his voice rising in pitch, his formally casual demeanor dissolving into a frantic desperation. <words>286</words>
He was drowning in the sea of knowledge, lost in the currents of forgotten lore. <words>296</words>
He had gorged on the fruit of knowledge, but it had left him starving, confused, and utterly, terrifyingly certain of nothing. <words>311</words>

The final page of the year fluttered to the ground, unnoticed. <words>318</words>
The thin-lipped warlock, now a hollow shell of his former self, continued his desperate search for meaning in the dusty silence of the abandoned mine. <words>336</words>
The viking ship figurehead fragment, its painted eyes still staring out into the darkness, remained his only companion in this confusing, desolate world of forgotten knowledge. <words>355</words>
He had optimized his access to the lost artifacts, but the optimization had broken him, leaving him adrift in a sea of fragmented whispers and half-remembered truths. <words>380</words>
His confusing certainty had become a prison, trapping him in a loop of endless searching, forever seeking the knowledge that forever eluded him. <words>399</words>
He was lost. <words>401</words>
