Bartholomew "Barty" Buttercup, a small-time con artist unusually normal for the dystopian farm they called "Hope's End," sat on an overturned milk crate. <words>17</words>
During story time, when the other farmhands usually huddled around the flickering holographic projector for a dose of government-sanctioned optimism, Barty found solace in the quiet corner of the barn. <words>38</words>
He held an empty tape dispenser, a relic from a forgotten era, turning it over and over in his hands. <words>47</words>
The lull of remorse, a feeling he rarely experienced, settled over him like a thick fog. <words>56</words>
He wasn't sure why, but tonight, the usual thrill of the con, the adrenaline of narrowly escaping detection, felt hollow. <words>69</words>
He needed comfort, a strange and unfamiliar yearning. <words>73</words>
Barty’s method of finding it was, to say the least, unconventional. <words>79</words>
He interrogated ghostly apparitions. <words>82</words>
Not real ghosts, of course, but the flickering, glitching remnants of old security footage projected onto the dusty barn walls by his jury-rigged projector, powered by a stolen solar panel. <words>103</words>
These were the ghosts of Hope's End's past, former farmhands, supervisors, even the occasional government inspector, all caught in the digital amber of obsolete technology. <words>120</words>
"Alright, Silas," Barty muttered to a shimmering image of a grizzled old farmer, "tell me, did you ever feel this…empty?" <words>130</words>
The image, of course, remained silent. <words>134</words>
Barty sighed, a puff of condensation swirling in the cold barn air. <words>140</words>
He flicked to another apparition, a stern-faced woman in a lab coat. <words>146</words>
"Dr. Anya Sharma," he addressed the flickering image, "renowned geneticist, did you ever question the morality of splicing pig DNA with tomatoes?" <words>159</words>
Silence. <words>160</words>
Barty’s motivation wasn't to find actual answers. <words>165</words>
He knew these ghosts couldn't speak. <words>169</words>
His interrogation was a performance, a way to taunt the jaws of defeat and grin in its face. <words>179</words>
It was a way to externalize the gnawing emptiness, to project it onto these silent figures and, in a strange way, find a perverse sense of control. <words>198</words>
He wasn't seeking absolution, or even understanding. <words>203</words>
He was seeking a distraction, a way to fill the silence with something other than the quiet hum of his own discontent. <words>216</words>
The empty tape dispenser in his hand became a prop, a microphone, a scepter. <words>224</words>
He held it aloft, addressing a flickering image of a young boy, no older than ten, clutching a wilted sunflower. <words>235</words>
"Tell me, young Thomas," Barty said, his voice laced with a mild fervor, "did you ever dream of escaping this…Hope's End?" <words>246</words>
The boy, of course, didn't answer. <words>250</words>
But in the silence, in the flickering light of the projector, Barty felt a flicker of something akin to peace. <words>261</words>
It wasn't comfort, not exactly. <words>265</words>
It was a defiance, a refusal to succumb to the crushing weight of his own insignificance. <words>276</words>
It was a small victory, a tiny spark of rebellion in the face of a dystopian reality. <words>286</words>
And for Barty Buttercup, the unusually normal con artist, that was enough. <words>294</words>
He spun the empty tape dispenser on his finger, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on his lips. <words>305</words>
Story time was over. <words>308</words>
And Barty, for now, had found his peace. <words>313</words>
