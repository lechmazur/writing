The hush before the Galactic Cuddling Awards acceptance speech was thick enough to spread on toast. <words>14</words>
A phantom train ticket punch, cold and metallic in her sweaty palm, pulsed with a faint, rhythmic click. <words>26</words>
Elara, professional cuddler extraordinaire, felt the weight of the abandoned spaceport hangar pressing down on her, the decaying metal groaning like a forgotten lullaby. <words>42</words>
This unusually usual setting for such a prestigious event was dictated by unspoken rules, rules Elara had only begun to decipher. <words>56</words>
The decay wasn't just physical; it was a rot in the very fabric of the galaxy, a prejudice against touch, against connection, against the very thing Elara championed. <words>77</words>

A chance encounter at a farmer's market, weeks before, had set this strange night in motion. <words>86</words>
A gruff, towering Rigellian, smelling faintly of stardust and regret, had thrust the ticket punch into her hand, muttering about "the Hanger of Whispers" and "the way things used to be." <words>108</words>
The punch, he'd explained, was a key, a symbol, a relic of a time when physical affection wasn't a regulated industry, when hugs were free and plentiful. <words>125</words>
Elara, raised in a sterile, touch-deprived orphanage, had scoffed at the ancient novelty of the idea. <words>135</words>
But the Rigellian's sorrowful eyes, reflecting the vast emptiness of space, had planted a seed of doubt in her heart. <words>147</words>

Now, standing on the crumbling platform of the abandoned hangar, the hush amplifying the rustle of her award gown, Elara understood. <words>159</words>
The unspoken rules were a symptom of this decay, a fear of vulnerability masked as professional detachment. <words>170</words>
The Galactic Cuddling Awards, held in this decaying spaceport, were a testament to the irony of their profession: celebrating connection in a galaxy starved for it. <words>187</words>
The ticket punch, a relic of a more tactile past, felt strangely warm now, a conduit to a forgotten intimacy. <words>199</words>
Elara's prejudice, a deep-seated distrust of genuine affection born from her loveless upbringing, began to crumble like the hangar walls around her. <words>214</words>

She looked out at the hushed crowd, faces illuminated by the flickering holographic spotlights, and saw not clients, but individuals yearning for the very thing she could offer. <words>231</words>
The decay, she realized, wasn't irreversible. <words>235</words>
It could be countered, one hug, one touch, one moment of genuine connection at a time. <words>245</words>
The hush deepened, the anticipation palpable. <words>249</words>
Elara took a deep breath, the metallic scent of the hangar mixing with the faint sweetness of decaying fruit left behind from a long-forgotten market. <words>265</words>
This unusually usual setting, this ancient novelty of a ceremony, was not an ending, but a beginning. <words>275</words>

The announcer's voice boomed through the hangar, breaking the hush, but Elara barely heard it. <words>284</words>
She clutched the ticket punch, a symbol of a forgotten past and a promise of a more connected future. <words>295</words>
Her acceptance speech wouldn't be about her individual achievement, but about the collective need for touch, for connection, for the simple, powerful act of cuddling. <words>314</words>
It would be a call to action, a plea to dismantle the unspoken rules that kept the galaxy at arm's length. <words>327</words>
It would be a declaration of war against the decay, a fight for a future where hugs weren't a luxury, but a fundamental right. <words>342</words>

As the announcer called her name, Elara stepped forward, the phantom click of the ticket punch echoing in the hush, a tiny, persistent beat against the silence of a galaxy waiting to be embraced. <words>363</words>
She knew, with a certainty that resonated deeper than the decaying hangar, that the time for change had come. <words>375</words>
The unusually usual hush before her acceptance speech was not the end of something, but the beginning of everything. <words>387</words>
The decay would not have the final word. <words>391</words>
Connection would. <words>393</words>
