The mildly panicked soothsayer, Barnaby, squinted at the water rings on the battered wooden bar top. <words>14</words>
He magnified the concentric circles, his brow furrowed, searching for answers in their distorted reflections. <words>26</words>
"Destiny, you fickle shrew," he muttered, the neon glow of the billboard maze casting an eerie green light on his face. <words>39</words>
"Always hiding in the most probably unlikely places." <words>44</words>
Barnaby was stuck between lost years, a temporal eddy in a desert choked by advertisements for products that promised everything and delivered nothing. <words>62</words>
The air crackled with the static of forgotten jingles, a soundtrack to the slow decay of consumerism. <words>72</words>
"This," he declared, tapping a particularly wobbly ring, "is where the rot started." <words>80</words>
He pulled a pocket puzzle box with thirteen locks from his worn coat. <words>88</words>
Each lock, he believed, represented a crucial point in the environmental collapse he was desperately trying to avert. <words>100</words>
His motivation was simple: to shape destiny with his bare hands, to wrestle the future from the jaws of apathy. <words>113</words>
"Because relying on corporate responsibility," he snorted, "is about as effective as a chocolate teapot in a sauna." <words>126</words>
The barkeep, a lizard-like creature with a perpetually bored expression, slid a glass of something viscous and faintly glowing towards him. <words>140</words>
"Another prophecy cocktail, Barnaby?" he rasped. <words>145</words>
"Just trying to decipher the secrets of the universe, Ziggy," Barnaby replied, his tone dripping with molten sarcasm. <words>157</words>
"Or at least figure out why we're knee-deep in discarded hoverboards and breathable air is a luxury item." <words>170</words>
He traced the water rings again, magnifying the minute imperfections, each ripple a testament to wasted resources. <words>181</words>
The billboards loomed, their vibrant messages a mocking reminder of the society that had prioritized fleeting desires over long-term survival. <words>196</words>
Barnaby fiddled with the first lock on the puzzle box. <words>201</words>
It clicked open. <words>203</words>
A faint green light pulsed from within. <words>207</words>
"One down, twelve to go," he murmured, a flicker of hope igniting in his eyes. <words>216</words>
He knew it was probably unlikely, this quest to rewrite the past and steer humanity towards environmental stewardship. <words>230</words>
But in this neon-lit desert of discarded dreams, even the smallest chance was worth fighting for. <words>241</words>
The water rings shimmered, reflecting the distorted image of a man determined to change the world, one ripple at a time. <words>255</words>
He saw in the rings not just the past, but a potential future, one where the billboards advertised sustainable energy and community gardens, not the latest disposable gadget. <words>276</words>
He imagined a world where the air was clean, the deserts green, and the lizard-like barkeep served organic smoothies instead of glowing sludge. <words>292</words>
It was a probably unlikely vision, but Barnaby clung to it, his fingers tracing the path to a better tomorrow in the water rings on the bar. <words>309</words>
He knew the task was monumental, the odds stacked against him, but the weight of the future rested on his shoulders, heavy as the puzzle box in his pocket. <words>329</words>
He took a deep breath, the stale, recycled air burning his lungs, a constant reminder of the urgency of his mission. <words>343</words>
He had to succeed. <words>345</words>
For himself, for Ziggy, for the memory of a world that wasn't choked by its own excess. <words>357</words>
He looked at the water rings one last time, magnifying the hope reflected within them. <words>367</words>
Then, with a renewed sense of purpose, he turned his attention back to the puzzle box, ready to unlock the next piece of the future. <words>383</words>
The fate of the world, he believed, rested in his probably unlikely hands. <words>391</words>
And he wouldn't let it slip through his fingers. <words>396</words>
