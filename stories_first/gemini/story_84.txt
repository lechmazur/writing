<story>
The city of Shellhaven, built upon the colossal, moss-covered backs of ancient turtles, buzzed with the frenzied tranquility of sidewalk sales. <words>18</words>
Bartholomew Buttons, an overly dramatic actor whose career peaked with a prune juice commercial, clutched a cracked leather case to his chest like a newborn babe. <words>34</words>
He moved with an oddly seldom grace, weaving through throngs of bargain hunters, his eyes darting between flickering holographic ads and the cryptic symbols chalked onto the pavement. <words>54</words>
He was not shopping; he was on a mission to repossess the very fabric of reality. <words>64</words>
His foe? <words>65</words>
An omnipotent being known only as the Collector, who, in a fit of cosmic boredom, had pawned off existence itself. <words>78</words>

Bartholomew’s method of repossession was as peculiar as the city’s foundations: via matching riddles hidden in old commercials. <words>90</words>
The Collector, a connoisseur of vintage advertising, had embedded clues within the jingles and slogans of a bygone era. <words>105</words>
Only by solving these riddles and presenting the correct answers could Bartholomew reclaim what was lost. <words>117</words>
His motivation was not mere survival, but a grand, theatrical performance of kindness. <words>127</words>
He believed that by outplaying the Collector, he could force the being to acknowledge the inherent worth of existence, its beauty too precious to pawn. <words>146</words>

He stopped before a flickering ad for “Shell-Shine Turtle Wax,” a product oddly seldom seen these days. <words>156</words>
The riddle, whispered by a cartoon turtle polishing its shell, was: “What shines brightest when broken?” <words>167</words>
Bartholomew’s hand trembled as he flipped open the cracked leather case. <words>174</words>
Inside, nestled amongst yellowed scripts and a half-eaten prune bar, was a small, iridescent shard of turtle shell. <words>187</words>
He held it aloft, the fractured edges catching the holographic light. <words>193</words>
“A promise,” he declared, his voice a booming stage whisper, “shines brightest when broken, for it reveals the strength required to mend it.” <words>208</words>

The air shimmered. <words>209</words>
A disembodied voice, smooth as polished shell, echoed through the square. <words>216</words>
“Correct. One point to the melodramatic mortal.” <words>221</words>
Bartholomew bowed deeply, the frenzied tranquility of the market swirling around him. <words>229</words>
He knew this was only the first act. <words>233</words>
The Collector’s riddles were woven into the very fabric of Shellhaven, hidden in every flickering ad, every chalked symbol, every oddly seldom whispered rumour. <words>251</words>
But Bartholomew was ready. <words>253</words>
He was an actor, after all, and this was his greatest performance yet, a performance of performed kindness on a cosmic stage. <words>269</words>
He tucked the shell shard back into his cracked leather case, a determined glint in his eye. <words>278</words>
The sidewalk sales continued, the gargantuan turtles beneath the city oblivious to the cosmic game unfolding above. <words>290</words>
Bartholomew, however, was far from oblivious. <words>294</words>
He was present, engaged, and utterly, theatrically, committed to his role. <words>302</words>
He had a universe to repossess, one riddle at a time. <words>309</words>
And he would do it with a flourish. <words>313</words>
