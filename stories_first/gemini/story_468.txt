The overly curious mortician, Elias, hummed a loudly serene tune as the night yielded to golden embers in the mangrove labyrinth. <words>18</words>
Singing spirits, their voices like wind chimes in a soft breeze, echoed through the tangled roots and branches. <words>28</words>
Elias was there for a singular purpose: to collect dream journals. <words>34</words>
He believed the whispers of the departed lingered in the ink, secrets rustling like dried leaves in the wind, a rustle of revelation he craved. <words>52</words>
He spotted a set of footprints leading deeper into the labyrinth, vanishing after a single heartbeat. <words>61</words>

The spirits’ song intensified, a chorus of whispers swirling around him, as if welcoming his peculiar mode of transport. <words>104</words>
Deeper into the labyrinth he ventured, the golden embers painting the leaves in hues of fire and shadow. <words>115</words>
He found a small, moss-covered altar, upon which lay a single, tarnished silver bracelet. <words>124</words>
It pulsed with a faint, warm light, resonating with the rhythm of the spirits’ song. <words>133</words>

Elias slipped the bracelet onto his wrist, the metal warming against his skin. <words>168</words>
The spirits’ song shifted, becoming a lullaby, soothing and serene. <words>176</words>
He understood then. <words>178</words>
The bracelet was a key, a conduit to the dream journals he sought. <words>186</words>
He continued his silent journey, the vanishing footprints leading him ever deeper, the spirits’ lullaby guiding his way. <words>199</words>
He found a hidden grove, bathed in the soft glow of the embers, where countless dream journals lay scattered amongst the roots. <words>212</words>
