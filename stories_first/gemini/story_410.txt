The astute hermit, Bartholomew, chuckled dryly, a sound that echoed strangely in the cavern cathedral. <words>12</words>
The phosphorescent flora pulsed around him, a sickly green heartbeat in the vast, echoing space. <words>21</words>
At the precise moment the elevator dinged on an empty floor far above, he knew. <words>30</words>
His isolation, strangely effective at amplifying his despair, had reached a new, absurd peak. <words>40</words>
“Of course,” he muttered, brandishing a blunt scissor like a ceremonial dagger. <words>47</words>
“The waterworks choose now to fail.” <words>51</words>
He’d been alone for so long, the silence broken only by the drip, drip, drip of a leaky stalactite, that the elevator’s arrival felt like a cosmic joke. <words>70</words>
Bartholomew’s motivation, to restore the cavern’s ancient water systems, had become a Sisyphean task, a monument to his solitary existence. <words>85</words>
He sighed, the sound swallowed by the cavern’s immensity. <words>90</words>
His plan, however outlandish, hinged on the scent of a fresh loaf of bread. <words>98</words>
He’d discovered, through a series of increasingly desperate experiments, that the phosphorescent flora reacted strangely to the aroma. <words>112</words>
Their glow, already unnervingly bright, would amplify, casting long, distorted shadows that danced across the cavern walls. <words>124</words>
And within those amplified shadows, for a fleeting moment, the hidden pathways of the ancient water system would reveal themselves. <words>137</words>
He’d tried everything to trigger this phenomenon – chanting ancient hymns, playing a rusty harmonica he’d found tucked away in a crevice, even attempting to yodel. <words>155</words>
But only the scent of baking bread, that most communal of aromas, seemed to hold the key. <words>165</words>
The irony wasn’t lost on him. <words>168</words>
He, a hermit, reliant on the phantom scent of human connection to fix a system designed for a community long gone. <words>182</words>
Bartholomew snipped a sprig of phosphorescent moss with the blunt scissor, its dull blades surprisingly effective. <words>192</words>
He crushed it in his palm, the green luminescence coating his skin like spectral paint. <words>200</words>
He closed his eyes, inhaling deeply, trying to conjure the phantom scent of warm yeast and crusty bread. <words>211</words>
Nothing. <words>212</words>
He imagined a bustling bakery, the chatter of customers, the warmth of the ovens. <words>221</words>
Still nothing. <words>223</words>
He pictured himself, a younger, less isolated Bartholomew, sharing a loaf with… with whom? <words>234</words>
The image dissolved, leaving only the aching emptiness of the cavern. <words>241</words>
He opened his eyes, the phosphorescent moss fading on his palm. <words>248</words>
The elevator dinged again, a mocking reminder of the world beyond the cavern. <words>256</words>
Bartholomew let out a hollow laugh, the despairing humor a thin shield against the crushing weight of his solitude. <words>269</words>
He knew, with a certainty born of isolation, that the water would remain unrestored, the cavern’s secrets locked away in the shadows. <words>284</words>
And yet, he couldn’t help but feel a flicker of… something. <words>291</words>
Hope? <words>292</words>
Resignation? <words>294</words>
Perhaps, he thought, as he picked up the blunt scissor and began to hum a tuneless melody, it was simply the stubborn refusal to let the darkness win completely. <words>315</words>
He would keep trying, keep imagining the scent of bread, keep searching for the hidden pathways, even if it was all a cosmic joke. <words>330</words>
Because in the echoing silence of the cavern cathedral, even the smallest act of defiance, however absurd, was a victory against the encroaching despair. <words>347</words>
He closed his eyes again, this time imagining not the bread itself, but the warmth of the hands that kneaded it, the shared laughter around a table, the simple act of breaking bread together. <words>371</words>
And for a fleeting moment, the phosphorescent flora pulsed a little brighter, the shadows shifted, and a faint, almost imperceptible line appeared on the cavern wall. <words>389</words>
A smile, tinged with despairing humor, touched Bartholomew’s lips. <words>396</words>
The game, it seemed, was still afoot. <words>400</words>
