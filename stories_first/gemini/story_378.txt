As the carnival’s last glittering tent collapsed under the peach-tinged dawn, Mayor Mildred McMillan, a woman who’d accidentally inherited the position after a bizarre radish-judging contest gone awry, trudged through the mud of the swamp orchard. <words>28</words>
The air, thick with the cloying sweetness of rotting fruit and the metallic tang of pollution, clung to her like a damp shroud. <words>41</words>
She was lovably grumpy, her face a permanent furrow of disapproval, but today, even her usual grumbling was subdued. <words>53</words>
The reclusive monks who tended the orchard, their robes stained the color of rust and decay, were nowhere to be seen. <words>65</words>
Mildred clutched the clockwork beetle in her pocket, its intricate gears ticking a frantic rhythm against her palm. <words>76</words>

She’d overheard a conversation in a crowded cafe during the carnival’s peak, a hushed exchange between two fortune tellers about a prophecy concerning the orchard, the swamp, and her own unlikely destiny. <words>101</words>
They spoke of water wisdom, a forgotten knowledge held within the heart of the swamp, and how she, the accidental mayor, was the key to unlocking it. <words>119</words>
The prophecy claimed that only she could reverse the swamp’s slow, agonizing death, but the method was… unconventional. <words>131</words>
She had to metamorphose. <words>133</words>
The thought filled her with reluctant awe. <words>137</words>

Mildred reached the heart of the orchard, a gnarled, ancient peach tree draped in moss and decay. <words>148</words>
Beneath its branches, a pool of murky water shimmered, reflecting the strange, distorted colors of the sunrise. <words>159</words>
This was it, the source of the water wisdom. <words>165</words>
Her motivation, to change the course of fate, both the swamp’s and her own, pushed her forward. <words>178</words>
With a deep breath, Mildred pulled the clockwork beetle from her pocket. <words>186</words>

The fortune tellers had instructed her to submerge the beetle in the pool. <words>193</words>
They’d said it was a key, a catalyst, a vessel for the water wisdom. <words>200</words>
As the beetle touched the water, a ripple spread outwards, and the air crackled with an unseen energy. <words>210</words>
The metallic tang of pollution faded, replaced by the fresh, clean scent of living water. <words>220</words>
The murky pool began to glow, a soft, ethereal blue. <words>226</words>

Mildred felt a strange tingling sensation spread through her body, starting from her fingertips and radiating outwards. <words>238</words>
Her skin shimmered, her bones creaked, and her vision blurred. <words>245</words>
She looked down at her hands, watching as they slowly transformed, becoming webbed and scaled. <words>254</words>
Her legs fused together, forming a powerful, sinuous tail. <words>260</words>
Gills sprouted on her neck, and her lungs filled with the cool, invigorating water. <words>269</words>

The transformation was complete. <words>272</words>
Mildred, the accidental mayor, was gone. <words>276</words>
In her place was a creature of the swamp, a guardian of the water wisdom, a being of both beauty and power. <words>290</words>
She looked at the revitalized pool, the water now crystal clear, and a sense of reluctant awe washed over her. <words>302</words>
She had changed the course of fate, and in doing so, had changed herself. <words>310</words>
The swamp orchard, once dying, now pulsed with renewed life, a testament to the power of water wisdom and the unlikely hero who had unlocked it. <words>326</words>
The first rays of dawn, now fully risen, illuminated the scene, painting the swamp in a vibrant tapestry of greens and golds. <words>340</words>
Mildred, no longer grumpy, but filled with a quiet sense of purpose, dove into the clear water, ready to embrace her new destiny. <words>354</words>
The carnival was gone, but the real magic had just begun. <words>361</words>
