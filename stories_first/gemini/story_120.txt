The quantum tunnel shimmered, a kaleidoscope of forgotten recess bells echoing in the non-Euclidean space. <words>14</words>
Elias, the time-looping paramedic, felt the familiar excited boredom prickle his skin. <words>21</words>
He’d been here countless times, at the bell’s echo, trapped in this shimmering purgatory, trying to baptize his nightmares in acceptance. <words>35</words>
He clutched the weathered fishing lure, its chipped paint a testament to his endless iterations. <words>44</words>
It was his anchor, a privately public symbol of the trauma he couldn't escape. <words>53</words>
The trauma of the accident, the one he kept reliving, trying to fix, only to be thrown back to the tunnel at the sound of a single raindrop. <words>71</words>
He knew the sound was coming. <words>74</words>
He always did. <words>76</words>
It was the harbinger of reset, the cosmic click of the universe’s rewind button. <words>87</words>
He closed his eyes, picturing the faces of the victims, their fading cries echoing in his ears. <words>98</words>
He’d saved them a thousand times, a million times, yet the guilt remained, nested deep within his soul, a festering wound. <words>113</words>
He opened his eyes, the tunnel’s colors swirling around him like a mocking lullaby. <words>122</words>
Excited boredom. <words>124</words>
That’s what it felt like. <words>127</words>
The thrill of potential change mixed with the weary acceptance of inevitable failure. <words>137</words>
He knew he couldn’t save them, not truly. <words>142</words>
Not in the way that mattered. <words>146</words>
He could patch them up, restart their hearts, but he couldn't undo the fear in their eyes, the knowledge that their world had shattered. <words>162</words>
He couldn't erase his own failure from the equation. <words>168</words>
He looked at the lure again, its hook snagged on nothing, a metaphor for his own futile efforts. <words>179</words>
He was fishing in a quantum sea, hoping to catch a ghost of redemption. <words>188</words>
He sighed, the breath catching in his throat like a sob. <words>195</words>
He was privately public in his grief, trapped in this loop, his pain a secret screamed into the void. <words>208</words>
No one else knew. <words>210</words>
No one else could know. <words>213</words>
He was alone in his endless recess, a paramedic playing God, failing every time. <words>223</words>
The single raindrop fell. <words>226</words>
He felt it, not on his skin, but in the fabric of the tunnel itself, a ripple in the quantum foam. <words>240</words>
The sound, tiny yet deafening, echoed through the space, a mournful chime signaling the end and the beginning. <words>252</words>
The colors intensified, the bells grew louder, and Elias braced himself for the inevitable rewind. <words>261</words>
He closed his eyes, clutching the lure, nesting the cold metal against his palm. <words>270</words>
This time, he told himself, this time would be different. <words>277</words>
This time, he would accept his failure, baptize it in the echoing silence of the reset. <words>288</words>
This time, he would try to find peace, not in saving them, but in accepting that he couldn't. <words>301</words>
The bell’s echo reached a crescendo, the colors exploded, and the world dissolved into white. <words>311</words>
Then, silence. <words>313</words>
And the faint, distant sound of a siren. <words>318</words>
He opened his eyes. <words>320</words>
He was back in the ambulance, the rain falling softly on the windshield. <words>329</words>
The radio crackled to life, dispatch calling him to the scene of an accident. <words>338</words>
He looked at his hand, the weathered fishing lure nestled in his palm, a cold reminder of his endless journey. <words>350</words>
He took a deep breath, the excited boredom replaced by a quiet resolve. <words>359</words>
He knew what he had to do. <words>363</words>
Not save them, but be there. <words>367</words>
To witness, to acknowledge, to accept. <words>371</words>
To baptize his nightmares, not in the illusion of control, but in the quiet grace of surrender. <words>384</words>
He started the engine, the siren wailing, a mournful song echoing through the rain-slicked streets. <words>395</words>
The loop continued, but this time, Elias was ready. <words>400</words>
