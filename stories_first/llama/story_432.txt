In the depths of a subterranean waterfall, where the roar of rushing water masked the whispers of the unknown, a poison taster named Kael stood at the edge of a tranquil pool, gazing up at an ice sculpture that teetered on the brink of collapse. <words>36</words>

With a death wish that had long been his constant companion, Kael felt an eerie sense of calm as he awaited the inevitable, his eyes fixed on the frozen form that seemed to defy gravity. <words>54</words>

In his hand, he clutched a simple cloth bookmark, its frayed edges a reminder of the countless nights he had spent poring over ancient texts in search of answers to the mysteries that shrouded his existence. <words>73</words>
