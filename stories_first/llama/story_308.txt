In the heart of the floating yoga studio, where the soothing tides gently rocked the wooden floorboards, a bashful executioner named Kaito stood out among the serene surroundings. <words>29</words> His rugged appearance and intimidating profession seemed at odds with the peaceful atmosphere, but his kind eyes and gentle demeanor told a different story. <words>43</words> As he prepared for the upcoming festival, Kaito's thoughts were consumed by his motivation to preserve the traditional dance movements of his family's unique celebration. <words>61</words>
