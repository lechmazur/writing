In the depths of the flooded opera house, lit by flickering lanterns that cast eerie shadows on the walls, a reticent scholar named Emilia sat huddled in a corner, surrounded by stacks of dusty books and papers. <words>30</words> She was a woman of few words, but her eyes sparkled with a technically mischievous glint as she delved into her latest project. <words>40</words> Amidst the musty smell of old books and the sweet aroma of cake baking in the nearby kitchen, Emilia's fingers moved deftly, hiding sketches in the binding of a vintage dictionary. <words>55</words>
