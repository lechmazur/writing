In the heart of the celestial grotto, where living shadows danced across the walls, a cooking class was underway. <words>19</words> The students, a mix of beings from different realms, gathered around the instructor, a wise and aged chef. <words>29</words> Among them was Lyra, a radio host with a unique gift – she could channel the dead. <words>39</words> Her show, "Beyond the Veil," had gained a massive following, but Lyra's true motivation for being here was to outrun a living nightmare. <words>51</words>
