As the snow fell gently outside, a mute courier named Aria stepped into the run-down opera house, her eyes scanning the dimly lit space with a mix of caution and enchantment. <words>29</words> The once-grand building now stood as a testament to the harbor's faded glory, its ornate chandeliers shrouded in dust and cobwebs. <words>43</words> Aria's gaze settled on a lone figure seated in the front row, an old man with a wild look in his eye and a pocket guide to interdimensional travel clutched in his hand. <words>61</words>

With an unassumingly bold stride, Aria approached the old man, her silence a stark contrast to the creaking of the wooden floorboards beneath her feet. <words>75</words> He looked up, startled, and Aria held out a small, leather-bound book, its cover embossed with a symbol that seemed to shimmer in the faint light. <words>90</words> The old man's eyes widened as he took the book, his hands trembling as he opened it to reveal pages filled with cryptic notes and sketches. <words>106</words>
