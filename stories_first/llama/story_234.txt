Kaito's faithfully unfaithful nature had led him down many paths, but none had ever felt as true as this one. <words>53</words> He was a xenophile, drawn to the foreign and unknown, and the museum's collection of prehistoric relics was his happy place. <words>64</words> As he approached the half-painted sundial on display, he noticed something peculiar – the coded angles seemed to be pointing to a specific location within the museum. <words>77</words>

In that moment, Kaito felt a sense of connection to all things – past, present, and future. <words>196</words> The gentle swordsman had finally found his place in the world, and it was one of brusque affection – rough around the edges but full of love and wonder. <words>210</words>

As he stood there, bathed in the soft light of the cup, Kaito knew that he would never let go of this feeling – this sense of being a part of something greater than himself. <words>225</words>
