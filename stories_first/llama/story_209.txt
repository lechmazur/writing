As the final beep of the hospital monitor faded away, Jack, a seasoned woodsman, felt a mix of emotions: grief, relief, and a hint of freedom. <words>29</words> He had spent the last few weeks by his father's side, watching him slip away, and now that he was gone, Jack felt lost. <words>43</words> His father had been his guide, his mentor, and his friend, and without him, the woods seemed emptier. <words>58</words>

As he walked out of the hospital, Jack's hand instinctively went to his pocket, where he kept an antique hairbrush that had belonged to his father. <words>72</words> It was an odd thing to carry around, but it brought him comfort. <words>82</words> The hairbrush was artfully messy, with tangled bristles and a worn wooden handle. <words>95</words>

Jack's thoughts turned to his father's last words: "Be honest with yourself, son. <words>105</words> Don't be afraid to get lost." <words>113</words> Jack had always been driven to map abandoned railways, to uncover the secrets of the past. <words>127</words> But now, he felt uncertain. <words>132</words>

He wandered through the radio wave garden, a strange and beautiful place where old broadcasting equipment grew like flowers. <words>148</words> The air was thick with the hum of static and the whispers of forgotten messages. <words>159</words>

As he walked, Jack stumbled upon an abandoned water tower, its metal latticework rusting away. <words>173</words> He had an idea - by measuring the echo in the tower, he might be able to short-circuit his doubts and find a new path forward. <words>190</words>

The sound of his own voice, bouncing off the walls of the tower, was like a slap in the face. <words>203</words> Jack realized that he had been living someone else's dream, trying to fulfill his father's ambitions instead of his own. <words>219</words>

With a newfound sense of freedom, Jack began to explore the radio wave garden in earnest. <words>233</words> He discovered hidden corners and secret paths, each one revealing a piece of himself that he had never known existed. <words>249</words>

As the sun set over the garden, casting long shadows across the equipment, Jack felt a sense of despairing cheer. <words>264</words> He was lost, but he was free. <words>269</words>

And as he walked away from the water tower, Jack tossed the antique hairbrush into the air, watching as it spun end over end, its bristles tangled in a joyful mess. <words>286</words>

He smiled to himself as he disappeared into the trees.
