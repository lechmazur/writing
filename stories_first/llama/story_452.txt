Nova's visits to the planetarium became more frequent, and their connection to the plain brown belt buckle grew stronger. <words>184</words> It was as if the buckle had become a key to unlocking the secrets of the universe. <words>197</words>

One fateful night, as Nova stood beneath the stars, they felt an energy unlike anything they had ever experienced before. <words>211</words> The cosmos aligned in a pattern that seemed to spell out a message – a message that only Nova could decipher. <words>225</words>

With trembling hands, Nova reached out and touched the celestial map etched across the sky. <words>238</words> In that moment, they knew that their quest had been successful – a new cosmic signature had been etched into the fabric of existence. <words>253</words>

As the city's inhabitants gazed up at the stars in wonder, Nova smiled knowingly. <words>264</words>
