As the last rays of sunlight faded, casting a warm orange glow over the abandoned customs office, Prince Arin stood at the dusty counter, his eyes fixed on the antique mortar and pestle that lay before him. <words>29</words> The worn wooden handle and chipped ceramic bowl seemed to whisper secrets of a long-forgotten past, one that he was desperate to uncover. <words>43</words> Exiled from his kingdom, Arin had been searching for a cure for the loneliness that had been eating away at him for years. <words>56</words>

Just as he was about to give up for the day, a sudden snowstorm swept in, shrouding the office in a thick veil of white. <words>67</words> The howling wind and creaking wooden beams made it seem as though the very foundations of the building were shifting, as if unseen forces were stirring beneath his feet. <words>82</words> And then, out of the swirling snow, a figure emerged. <words>90</words>

It was a young woman, her hair and clothes blown back by the wind, her eyes shining with a fierce determination. <words>103</words> She stumbled into the office, slamming the door shut behind her, and Arin felt a jolt of surprise as their eyes met. <words>115</words> For a moment, they simply stared at each other, the only sound the creaking of the old wooden beams and the soft ticking of a clock in the corner. <words>129</words>
