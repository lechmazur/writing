In her hand, a dry highlighter pen served as a talisman from the world above—a reminder of colors lost to the deep sea. <words>48</words>
Between broken treaties of surface nations, she found solace in tracking migratory sea butterflies, their luminescent wings a battered marvel against the darkness. <words>85</words>
