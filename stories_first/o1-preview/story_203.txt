Celeste's fingers trembled as she attempted to fit the miniature wing onto the toy spaceship, the tiny screws evading her grasp. <words>21</words>
Amid the low hum of the failing life support systems, the cabin lights flickered, casting long shadows across the scattered components. <words>41</words>
Outside the viewport, a graveyard of orbital debris drifted silently—a haunting reminder of missions past and dreams deferred. <words>59</words>
She was never usual; an exorcist with stage fright stranded on an abandoned space station was a paradox even she struggled to comprehend. <words>81</words>
Her vocation had always been met with skepticism, but here, in the void, the specters were all too real. <words>97</words>
Pressing the last piece into place, she glanced at the pressed wildflowers encased in glass beside her—a relic from Earth and her only keepsake. <words>118</words>
They were a gift from her grandmother, who had whispered tales of their family's legacy—a tapestry woven with threads of truth and lies. <words>138</words>
"Inheritance of lies," Celeste muttered, recalling the secrets that had shadowed her lineage. <words>152</words>
A sudden chill swept through the compartment, and the distant sound of metal groaning echoed—a prelude to the phantoms' arrival. <words>171</words>
Stage fright clenched her throat; though she had trained to confront the ethereal, performing the rites felt impossible under their gaze. <words>189</words>
She heard it then, the unmistakable sound of a key turning in a lock—a paradox in a place with no doors to lock. <words>208</words>
A panel slid open, revealing a passage descending into darkness she hadn't known existed. <words>222</words>
This was her moment to submerge herself into the unknown depths, to face the specters and the lies they embodied. <words>238</words>
Clutching the pressed wildflowers close, she stepped forward, the defiant hush of the station enveloping her. <words>253</words>
"Celeste," a voice whispered, echoing off the walls, "You cannot escape the truth." <words>266</words>
Her heart pounded, but she steadied herself, remembering her motivation: to sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never." <words>282</words>
She was tired of being shackled by the deceit of her predecessors, tired of the never-ending cycle of doubt. <words>297</words>
The corridor led her to a chamber bathed in an otherworldly glow, where apparitions lingered—embodiments of the lies passed down to her. <words>317</words>
They circled her, murmuring words of failure and futility, their ethereal forms shimmering like distorted reflections. <words>333</words>
Drawing a deep breath, she raised the wildflowers, their delicate petals a symbol of fragility and resilience. <words>348</words>
"These lies end with me," she declared in a voice that defied the silence, her stage fright melting away. <words>362</words>
The phantoms recoiled, their whispers fading as she submerged them beneath her unwavering resolve. <words>376</words>
The chamber shuddered, and beams of light pierced the darkness, dissolving the shadows that had long haunted her. <words>390</words>
By the sound of a key turning in a lock, she had unlocked not just a door, but the truth within herself. <words>406</words>
Ascending back to the main deck, she felt lighter, the oppressive weight lifted. <words>417</words>
The toy spaceship sat completed, a testament to her newfound determination. <words>429</words>
She was never usual, and she embraced it; her uniqueness was her strength, not her burden. <words>443</words>
With renewed purpose, Celeste initiated the station's revival systems, channels long dormant sparked to life. <words>458</words>
The orbital debris outside began to clear, paths aligning for her journey home. <words>471</words>
Clutching the pressed wildflowers, she took her place at the helm, ready to chart a course unbound by the past. <words>487</words>
In the defiant hush of the cosmos, Celeste whispered, "I am the architect of my own fate." <words>501</words>
