Ernest stood at the gates of the paper airplane test facility, never tardy for his volunteer shift. <words>18</words> He glanced at his watch with sardonic glee; punctuality was his silent rebellion against chaos. <words>34</words> Since the personal tragedy that uprooted his life, the vigilant orchardist sought solace among flying paper creations. <words>54</words> As he walked in, the scent of paper and glue replaced that of apples and earth. <words>67</words> "Good morning, Ernest," called out Julia, the facility coordinator. <words>76</words> He nodded, eyes catching an antique letter seal on her desk adorned with a peacock's tail pattern. <words>92</words> "That's an interesting seal," he remarked, tracing the intricate design with his gaze. <words>105</words> "Oh, this old thing?" Julia shrugged. "It's been here forever." <words>116</words> Ernest felt a familiar tug at his curiosity, the same that kept his orchards free of pests. <words>131</words> Throughout his volunteering, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. <words>144</words> Children folded airplanes, but some designs bore peacock motifs hidden within their folds. <words>159</words> He began to notice patterns—whispers among staff, secretive meetings behind the supply closets. <words>175</words> With sardonic glee, he pieced together the puzzle that others overlooked. <words>187</words> One afternoon, Ernest decided to demonstrate his findings. <words>195</words> He assembled the staff, unfolding a large chart covered in peacock feather patterns. <words>207</words> "See these designs?" he began, pointing to the vibrant eyespots. <words>217</words> "They mimic the patterns appearing in our facility's projects." <words>227</words> The room fell silent as he connected the dots. <words>235</words> "Are you suggesting a conspiracy?" Julia scoffed. <words>244</words> "Precisely," Ernest replied with a wry smile. <words>252</words> He revealed that the peacock symbols linked to a covert group smuggling secrets via paper airplanes. <words>268</words> "That's preposterous," another staff member objected. <words>277</words> "Is it?" Ernest's eyes gleamed. "Why else would an orchardist volunteer here?" <words>291</words> He held up the antique letter seal. "This seal is the key." <words>302</words> "The patterns in the peacock's tail hold encrypted messages." <words>313</words> Julia's facade cracked; her expression shifted from disbelief to resignation. <words>326</words> "You're sharper than you look," she muttered. <words>335</words> "Vigilance is a habit," Ernest quipped. <words>342</words> The authorities arrived shortly after, unraveling the conspiracy he had exposed. <words>356</words> As they led Julia away, Ernest felt a weight lift—a small victory over his own grief. <words>371</words> Returning to his orchards, he found peace in the rhythmic harvest. <words>383</words> The peacocks in his memories no longer taunted him but danced in sardonic glee. <words>397</words> His personal tragedy had not defeated him; he had turned it into purpose. <words>410</words> And he was never tardy for life again. <words>419</words>
