Elias leaned against a gnarled apple tree atop the colonial town's rooftops. <words>13</words>
The labyrinth orchard spread around him, a secret maze few knew existed. <words>29</words>
He was a jaded locksmith, holding embroidered gloves depicting hunting scenes. <words>49</words>
He wished to preserve the old hunting methods of his ancestors. <words>65</words>
Blossom scents permeated the air, mingling with sea salt. <words>81</words>
Below, buildings were being freshly painted under the sun. <words>96</words>
He was due at a pottery class, an unusual place for him. <words>112</words>
Descending stairs, his steps echoed softly. <words>124</words>
The studio entrance was delightfully menacing, draped in dark curtains. <words>143</words>
Inside, artisans molded clay with demure audacity. <words>158</words>
He spotted Mira shaping a vessel. <words>172</words>
"You're late," she said. <words>184</words>
"The orchard detained me," he replied. <words>197</words>
"Still unlocking the past?" <words>212</words>
"Some doors are worth opening." <words>229</words>
They worked in silence. <words>242</words>
"The unclaimed throne," Mira began, "it's real, isn't it?" <words>263</words>
He nodded. <words>266</words>
"A legacy waiting for its heir." <words>284</words>
"And preserving hunting methods leads there?" <words>305</words>
"Every tradition holds a key." <words>322</words>
A warm breeze permeated the studio. <words>339</words>
"Perhaps some secrets are worth unveiling," she said with demure audacity. <words>364</words>
"Will you help me?" <words>377</words>
She touched his embroidered glove. <words>393</words>
"Together, we might find that throne." <words>412</words>
Outside, sun painted the sky with hues of orange and pink. <words>431</words>
Blossoms and fresh paint scents mingled, permeating the air. <words>450</words>
They left, shadows stretching ahead, path uncertain but shared. <words>473</words>
