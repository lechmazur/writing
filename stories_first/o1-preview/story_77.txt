Lumen sat alone in the dim corner of the asteroid hideout, feeling emotions seep through metallic walls. <words>19</words> An introverted empath among space pirates, he was an anomaly, obviously hidden in plain sight. <words>38</words> In his hands, he turned a dried starfish, relic from an ocean world he'd once visited. <words>57</words> The starfish reminded him of mountain wisdom—a unity despite isolation. <words>75</words> The crew plotted their next raid, but Lumen's mind was elsewhere, lost in drowsy enthusiasm for a different cause. <words>105</words> He yearned to marshal scattered souls around him, championing outcasts of reason the galaxy forgot. <words>134</words> Fragments of a shattered marionette lay nearby, neglected like many dreams here. <words>157</words> An idea stirred; through reassembling it, he could piece together more than a puppet. <words>183</words> He gathered the pieces, fingers nimble, movements echoing mountain wisdom. <words>206</words> Others watched with curiosity, their rough exteriors softening at his quiet passion. <words>234</words> Pages of a forgotten journal lay strewn—the closing thoughts of one seeking meaning. <words>264</words> Lumen felt a connection, their final words resonating with his desires. <words>289</words> Hours passed; the marionette took shape, mirroring the crew's suppressed emotions. <words>318</words> He stood it up, letting it dance in the low gravity. <words>338</words> Silence fell as the crew gathered, eyes reflecting a lost wonder. <words>366</words> Through creation, Lumen had marshaled their spirits, uniting them briefly. <words>393</words> The obviously hidden empathy within surfaced, bridging gaps of piracy. <words>418</words> In that drowsy hour before dawn, the outcasts found solace together. <words>449</words> Lumen smiled, the dried starfish warm in his palm—his silent mission had begun. <words>480</words>
