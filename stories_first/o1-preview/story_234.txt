<story>The museum's doors creaked as Hiro stepped inside, sword at his side. <words>13</words> He preferred the company of ancient bones to that of people. <words>23</words> Hiro was a gentle swordsman, more attuned to silence than to the clashing of blades. <words>37</words> The dinosaur skeletons towered over him like guardians from another world. <words>48</words> He came here every night when the orchard dog finally stopped barking, signaling his secret hour. <words>63</words> He pulled an empty matchbox from his pocket, a keepsake from his past travels. <words>76</words> Inside, he kept a small folded note, the last message from his unfaithful love. <words>90</words> She was faithfully unfaithful, always returning to him after each voyage abroad. <words>103</words> Her thirst for foreign lands made her a xenophile; he both admired and resented it. <words>116</words> He gazed up at the half-painted sundial mounted on the ceiling. <words>127</words> Its coded angles held the secrets he sought—directions to the stars. <words>138</words> He was a late bloomer, slow to understand her yearning for the universe. <words>151</words> But now he wanted to cradle the universe in a cupped hand, just as she did. <words>164</words> Hiro's fingers traced the sundial's lines, decoding the path she had taken. <words>176</words> His affection was brusque, hidden beneath a stoic exterior. <words>186</words> But tonight, he would follow her, embracing the unknown. <words>195</words> He left the museum, stepping into the night that was both familiar and foreign. <words>206</words> The stars above beckoned, shimmering like distant promises. <words>214</words> He was drawn to them, a newfound xenophile seeking his own journey. <words>225</words> The empty matchbox felt light in his pocket, a symbol of letting go. <words>236</words> He would become faithfully unfaithful, loyal to his quest yet unbound. <words>247</words> As the orchard dog barked once more, he smiled softly. <words>256</words> He was ready to bloom at last. <words>262</words> He journeyed through the sleeping town, shadows stretching under lantern light. <words>273</words> His sword, though a symbol of defense, was sheathed in peace. <words>283</words> Hiro recalled how he once refused to leave his homeland, fearing the unfamiliar. <words>294</words> She had tried to persuade him, her eyes alight with stories of distant places. <words>306</words> Now, he understood; the universe was vast, and he wanted to hold it close. <words>319</words> He reached the harbor as dawn approached, ships swaying gently. <words>328</words> Among them was a vessel destined for lands unknown to him. <words>337</words> Aboard, he found others like him—late bloomers seeking new horizons. <words>347</words> They welcomed him with brusque affection, nodding in silent camaraderie. <words>356</words> He felt a kinship, a shared yearning that needed no words. <words>365</words> As the ship set sail, the orchard dog’s distant barks faded. <words>374</words> Hiro stood at the bow, the wind whispering promises of the universe. <words>385</words> He opened the empty matchbox and released the folded note into the sea. <words>397</words> Letting go of the past, he embraced the faithfully unfaithful within himself. <words>407</words> The journey ahead was uncertain, but his heart was open. <words>416</words> He was ready to cradle the universe in his cupped hands. <words>426</words> The sun rose, painting the sky with hues of possibility. <words>435</words> Hiro smiled—a late bloomer blossoming at last. <words>442</words> He knew she was out there somewhere, perhaps looking at the same horizon. <words>453</words> Perhaps their paths would cross again under foreign stars. <words>462</words> Until then, he would walk his own path, driven by the same wanderlust. <words>473</words> The gentle swordsman had become a voyager, a seeker of worlds. <words>483</words> With brusque affection for himself, he stepped into his new life. <words>492</words></story>
