In the vast silence before recorded history, Lior wandered among ancient trees, his footsteps whispering on the forest floor. <words>20</words> He was the tribe's quiet matchmaker, uniting souls through unspoken understanding. <words>39</words> Silently talkative, he conversed with roots and winds, his thoughts flowing like an unseen river. <words>58</words>

Tasked with mapping root systems to decode natural patterns, he delved deep into the earth. <words>77</words> In the labyrinthine chambers of the root system mapping facility, he traced lines of energy pulsing beneath his feet. <words>100</words> One day, he discovered a hidden alcove bathed in ethereal light. <words>113</words>
