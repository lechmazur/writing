<story>In the sprawling corridors of the ancient Chinese palace, Li Wei moved with the grace of a whisper.<words>17</words>He was a calm assassin, known for his unruffled demeanor even amidst chaos.<words>30</words>Tonight, he carried a botanical press under his arm, an odd tool for someone in his profession.<words>47</words>Li Wei had a plan to amalgamate whispers of longing into a single, potent prophecy.<words>62</words>He believed that by the pattern of a butterfly's wings, fate could be altered.<words>76</words>Li Wei's methods were figuratively literal; he took metaphors and made them tangible.<words>89</words>As he slipped into the Empress's garden, the humorous unease settled in—who brings a botanical press to an assassination?<words>109</words>He chuckled silently, acknowledging the absurdity of his mission.<words>118</words>The palace walls were adorned with tapestries depicting butterflies, their wings forming intricate patterns.<words>132</words>He knew the patterns held secrets—guidelines for spinning prophecy into raw possibility.<words>145</words>Before the first question is asked, the answer lies hidden—that was the palace's old saying.<words>161</words>Li Wei intended to find that answer and change it.<words>171</words>He carefully selected blossoms from the garden, each one representing a whisper of longing from the court's people.<words>189</words>He placed them into the botanical press, harmonizing their essences.<words>199</words>The press was no ordinary tool; it was an artifact imbued with alchemical power.<words>213</words>As the petals compressed, a faint glow emanated, and Li Wei felt the whispers coalesce.<words>228</words>He sensed the prophecy spinning into raw possibility, ready to be unleashed.<words>240</words>Suddenly, a guard's footsteps approached, and the humorous unease intensified.<words>250</words>Li Wei hid behind a shrub, pondering how absurd it was to be crouching with a glowing botanical press.<words>269</words>The guard paused, muttering about butterflies disrupting his night.<words>278</words>Once the guard left, Li Wei emerged and proceeded to the inner chambers.<words>291</words>He needed to place the amalgamated essence where it could alter the course of destiny.<words>306</words>In the throne room, he found the great map of the empire, etched with butterfly motifs.<words>322</words>He spread the compressed petals over the map, aligning them with the butterflies.<words>335</words>A soft wind stirred in the closed room, and he knew the prophecy was set in motion.<words>352</words>Just then, the Empress herself entered, catching him in the act.<words>363</words>She looked at the scene and raised an eyebrow.<words>372</words>“Is this a new method of interior decoration?” she asked wryly.<words>383</words>Li Wei, ever calm, replied, “I'm just pressing matters into place, Your Majesty.”<words>396</words>She smirked, the humorous unease hanging in the air.<words>405</words>“Well, as long as you're not plotting anything too drastic,” she said, eyeing the glowing petals.<words>421</words>“Just a little change in the pattern,” he answered, nodding to the butterfly motifs.<words>435</words>They both stood there, each aware of more than they let on, wrapped in figuratively literal expressions.<words>452</words>Finally, the Empress broke the silence.<words>458</words>“Before the first question is asked, the answer changes,” she mused.<words>469</words>Li Wei smiled, “Perhaps the questions have yet to catch up.”<words>480</words>With a subtle nod, he departed, leaving the botanical press behind as a silent testament to possibilities spun anew.<words>499</words></story>
