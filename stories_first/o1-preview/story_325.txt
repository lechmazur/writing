He laid out a black-and-white film reel on the table, its edges frayed from years of handling.<words>67</words> With a comically serious expression, he leaned in closer, his monocle gleaming under the dim lights.<words>83</words> "If only they knew," he whispered to his Venus flytrap, tucked safely in his lapel pocket.<words>99</words>

The waiter glanced over again, torn between amusement and concern for the odd gentleman.<words>363</words> His fickle loyalty leaned towards interference, but he decided against it.<words>376</words> After all, who was he to interrupt a man conversing with plants?<words>388</words>
