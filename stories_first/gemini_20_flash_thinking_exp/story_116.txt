First I will write a draft answer to the query:
<story>The dismayed minstrel, Elias, adjusted his lute, the silver strings catching the faint, ethereal glow of the black velvet sky-lounge. <words>17</words>  Below, the endless city pulsed with unseen lights, a sprawling tapestry he felt compelled to chart. <words>31</words>  His motivation, to draw a map of this endless night, was a subjectively rational obsession, a way to impose order on the beautiful chaos. <words>50</words>  He glanced at his wrist, the broken watch band a tangible reminder of time’s irrelevance in this timeless place. <words>66</words>  Time here was measured not in seconds, but in the blooming and fading of the garden secrets whispered on the lounge’s gentle breezes. <words>84</words>  Elias believed the secrets held the key to understanding the city’s impossible geography, its drawn boundaries shifting like dreams. <words>102</words>  He decided to excavate those secrets, not with shovels and picks, but with memories. <words>116</words> His method was peculiar: studying old polaroid photographs, each a faded glimpse into the sky-lounge’s past. <words>132</words>  The photos, scattered across a low, cloud-shaped table, depicted long-gone patrons, their faces blurred, their laughter silent. <words>150</words>  Elias, with a laconic exuberance, traced the lines of a woman’s dress in one photo, a dress adorned with flowers he recognized from a recent garden secret. <words>174</words>  He cross-referenced the flower’s bloom cycle with the position of a distant, glowing spire visible in another photograph. <words>192</words>  Each polaroid was a fragment, a clue in his self-imposed archaeological dig of the present. <words>207</words>  He meticulously noted the angles, the subtle shifts in the cityscape visible through the lounge’s panoramic windows. <words>224</words>  The broken watch band lay beside the photos, a symbol of his detachment from conventional time, his immersion in this subjective pursuit. <words>244</words>  He felt like an explorer charting uncharted territories, even though those territories existed only in the echoes of moments past. <words>263</words>  The garden secrets, the whispers of fleeting romances and forgotten dreams, were his geological strata. <words>280</words>  He believed the boundaries of the city, though seemingly endless, were defined by these ephemeral moments, these emotional cartographies. <words>299</words>  Another photograph showed a group gathered near a now-vanished fountain, its location hinted at by the angle of a specific constellation visible through the window. <words>322</words>  Elias hummed a quiet tune, his fingers dancing over the lute strings, translating the visual data into musical patterns. <words>340</words>  His map wasn't one of streets and buildings, but of feelings and memories, a testament to the subjective reality of the sky-lounge. <words>359</words>  The endless night, he realized, wasn't a void, but a palimpsest, each layer a story waiting to be unearthed. <words>377</words>  The broken watch band, a constant companion, served as a reminder that his time was his own, dedicated to this singular, self-defined task. <words>398</words>  He continued his excavation, driven by the laconic exuberance of a man finding meaning in the ephemeral, mapping the boundaries of an endless, subjective night. <words>421</words>

I will self-critique my draft answer to ensure that the draft answer is valid:
The draft answer is valid and does not fail any of the requirements mentioned in the initial query.
