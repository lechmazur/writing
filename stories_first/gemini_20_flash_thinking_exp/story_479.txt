First I will write a draft answer to the query:
<story>Genevieve Dubois, the glamorous undertaker, adjusted the silk scarf draped over her shoulders, its crimson a stark contrast to the muted tones of the social network archive. <words>19</words>  Dust motes danced in the simulated sunlight filtering through the digital windows, illuminating rows upon rows of archived profiles. <words>34</words>  She held a tarnished brass measuring tape, its numbers faded with age, a relic from a time before digital footprints. <words>50</words>  Genevieve was fruitlessly patient, a trait honed by years of coaxing reluctant souls into their final repose and now applied to the stubborn resistance of the archive’s interface. <words>73</words>  Today, however, her patience was buoyed by a peculiar excitement, a jubilant remorse for the task ahead. <words>88</words>  Her motivation was simple: to preserve ancient practices, specifically a unique family tradition passed down from her great-great-aunt, Esmeralda. <words>108</words> Esmeralda, a woman whispered to have negotiated with the very fabric of time, had discovered a way to elongate moments, to stretch the ephemeral. <words>128</words>  The tradition involved meticulously measuring the “aura” of a significant life event, a practice Genevieve believed could somehow anchor these moments against the relentless tide of digital erasure. <words>154</words>  She’d chosen this moment, during the digital “paint mixing” phase of a profile’s creation – the chaotic aggregation of data that formed a virtual life – as the most potent point to intervene. <words>184</words>  According to Esmeralda’s meticulously kept journals, the paint mixing was when the essence of a person, their digital soul, was most malleable. <words>206</words>  Genevieve carefully unfurled the brass measuring tape, its metallic scent a comforting anchor in the sterile digital environment. <words>224</words>  The myth of ordinariness, the idea that any life could be considered commonplace, was anathema to her. <words>241</words>  Every life, even a digital one, held unique threads, and Esmeralda’s tradition was a way to capture and celebrate that singularity. <words>262</words>  She selected a profile, a young artist whose vibrant digital presence was about to be homogenized into the vast, indifferent network. <words>284</words>  With a practiced hand, Genevieve began to measure the invisible contours of the profile’s data stream, the brass cool against her fingertips. <words>305</words>  She wasn't measuring length or width, but something far more elusive: the resonance of their interactions, the intensity of their passions, the unique timbre of their digital voice. <words>334</words>  As she measured, she felt a subtle shift in the archive’s hum, a slight distortion in the simulated light. <words>351</words>  The moment, the paint mixing, was elongating, stretching like taffy, holding onto its vibrant hues just a little bit longer. <words>372</words>  Genevieve smiled, a small, satisfied curve of her lips. <words>379</words>  She wasn't just an undertaker; she was a curator of moments, a guardian against the digital oblivion, armed with a brass measuring tape and a belief in the extraordinary within the ordinary. <words>413</words>  The jubilant remorse she felt was for the lives lost to the relentless march of time, but also for the small victory she was enacting, a tiny rebellion against the myth of ordinariness, one measured moment at a time. <words>448</words>  The brass tape clicked softly as she retracted it, the echo a whisper in the vast digital graveyard, a testament to a tradition stubbornly kept alive. <words>472</words>
