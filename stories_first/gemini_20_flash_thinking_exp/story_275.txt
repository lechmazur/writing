First I will write a draft answer to the query:
<story>The comet blazed overhead, a celestial wound weeping fire onto the ghostly orchard. <words>14</words>  Elias, the mysterious hermit, barely glanced up. <words>19</words> His attention was fixed on the pressed flower album, its brittle pages whispering tales of seasons long past. <words>31</words> He was theoretically rebellious, not in grand pronouncements, but in the quiet defiance of coaxing life from this barren ground. <words>46</words>  The orchard, once vibrant, now stood skeletal against the crimson sky, a testament to some forgotten cataclysm. <words>59</words>  Elias believed the album held the key, a forgotten language of growth. <words>69</words> His motivation wasn't scientific; it was a deep, almost primal urge to mend the broken earth. <words>82</words>  He needed to translate the secrets held within the dried petals and stems. <words>92</words>  The method was peculiar, born from years of solitary observation. <words>101</words> He’d noticed patterns, subtle shifts in the orchard’s energy that coincided with the weathervane’s movements. <words>116</words>  Specifically, the exact angle of the half-bent weathervane seemed to unlock something in the album’s faded script. <words>130</words>  Each morning, as the comet arced across the sky, Elias would position the album, aligning its spine with the weathervane’s crooked arm. <words>147</words>  The shadows cast by the bent metal fell across specific flowers, illuminating faint symbols etched beside them. <words>161</words>  It was a slow, deliberate process, a mindful choice to engage with the world on its own cryptic terms. <words>175</words>  He wasn't deciphering words, but rather the intent behind their placement, the energy imbued in each pressed bloom. <words>190</words>  The album spoke of mindful choices made by those who tended this orchard before the fire fell. <words>203</words>  Choices about where to plant, when to prune, how to nurture. <words>213</words>  Each flower, a record of a decision, a whisper of a life lived in harmony with the land. <words>227</words>  Elias understood that coaxing life back wasn't about brute force, but about understanding these subtle choices. <words>241</words>  The comet’s fiery breath was a constant reminder of destruction, but the album offered a path to renewal. <words>255</words>  He meticulously translated the angles, the shadows, the subtle energies, his movements as deliberate as the turning of the earth. <words>271</words>  He wasn't just reading; he was listening to the land’s memory, learning the language of resilience. <words>285</words>  His theoretically rebellious spirit found its expression not in outward defiance, but in this quiet, persistent act of translation. <words>300</words>  He chose to believe in the possibility of rebirth, a mindful choice in the face of overwhelming desolation. <words>314</words>  Days bled into weeks, the comet’s fiery tail a constant backdrop to his work. <words>325</words>  Slowly, almost imperceptibly, tiny green shoots began to emerge from the ashen soil near where the album indicated. <words>341</words>  It wasn't magic, but the result of understanding, of aligning himself with the orchard’s forgotten rhythm. <words>355</words>  The pressed flowers, once silent witnesses, were now guides, their stories slowly rewriting the landscape. <words>369</words>  Elias, the hermit, continued his translation, a solitary figure coaxing life from the ashes, one mindful choice at a time. <words>386</words> The ghostly orchard, under the burning comet, held a fragile promise of renewal. <words>397</words>

I will self-critique my draft answer to ensure that the draft answer is valid:
The draft answer is valid and does not fail any of the requirements mentioned in the initial query.
