First I will write a draft answer to the query:
<story>The fluorescent lights of the dystopian farm’s communal hall flickered, casting long shadows as story time began. <words>16</words>  Elias, a small-time con artist with an unusually normal face, leaned against the peeling paint of the wall. <words>29</words>  He clutched an empty tape dispenser in his hand, its emptiness a familiar echo of his own pockets. <words>44</words>  Tonight’s story was about the Great Uprising, a tale meant to inspire, but Elias felt only the familiar lull of remorse. <words>60</words>  It was a dull ache, a constant companion he’d learned to ignore, but tonight, it felt sharper. <words>75</words>  He sought comfort, not in the saccharine words of the storyteller, but in his own peculiar method. <words>90</words>  He saw them then, the ghostly apparitions that clung to the edges of the room, the echoes of past failures and broken promises. <words>108</words>  He approached one, a shimmering figure with hollow eyes. <words>116</words>  “So,” Elias began, his voice a low murmur, “you thought you could trust them, didn’t you?” <words>131</words>  The apparition remained silent, its sorrow palpable. <words>138</words>  Elias pressed on, interrogating the ghostly apparitions, each question a tiny barb twisting in their spectral wounds. <words>155</words>  He asked about their regrets, their betrayals, the moments they knew they’d lost. <words>168</words>  With each spectral confession, Elias felt a strange sense of satisfaction bloom in his chest. <words>182</words>  He wasn't seeking redemption; he was there to taunt the jaws of defeat and grin. <words>196</words>  The empty tape dispenser became a prop in his spectral theater, a symbol of the nothingness he often peddled. <words>213</words>  He’d always been good at exploiting vulnerabilities, even those of the dead. <words>225</words>  The mild fervor in his eyes intensified as he moved from one apparition to the next. <words>240</words>  He relished their silent suffering, a twisted balm to his own gnawing guilt. <words>253</words>  The story time droned on, oblivious to the spectral interrogations happening in the shadows. <words>267</words>  Elias found a perverse comfort in their misery, a confirmation that he wasn't alone in his failures. <words>283</words>  He was a small-time con artist in a dystopian farm, finding solace by tormenting ghosts during story time. <words>300</words>  The lull of remorse still lingered, but now it was accompanied by a chilling sense of triumph. <words>315</words>  He was a survivor, even if his victories were measured in the silent tears of phantoms. <words>330</words>  The empty tape dispenser felt heavier now, imbued with the weight of their spectral confessions. <words>345</words>  As the story time concluded, Elias slipped away, the unusually normal expression on his face betraying nothing of the spectral drama he’d just enacted. <words>367</words>  He had faced the ghosts of defeat, and for tonight, at least, he had grinned. <words>381</words>  The dystopian farm remained, a bleak landscape for both the living and the lingering dead, and Elias, the small-time con artist, continued his strange, solitary dance with despair. <words>407</words>

I will self-critique my draft answer to ensure that the draft answer is valid:
The draft answer is valid and does not fail any of the requirements mentioned in the initial query.
