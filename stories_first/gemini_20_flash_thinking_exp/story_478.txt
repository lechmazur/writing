First I will write a draft answer to the query:
<story>The critical midwife, Elara, lived on an orchard island adrift in a swirling maelstrom. <words>13</words>  The waxing moon cast a spectral glow on the gnarled apple trees, their branches heavy with fruit that tasted of salt and storm. <words>30</words> Elara was openly secretive, her pronouncements on births and deaths delivered with an unsettling blend of certainty and veiled knowledge. <words>48</words>  Her small cottage, perched precariously on the island’s edge, held the scent of pressed herbs and the faint ghost of smoke. <words>65</words>  She clutched a bundle of these herbs now, their fragrance a familiar comfort in the dissonant calm of the evening. <words>82</words>  Her motivation was a gnawing emptiness, the phantom ache of stolen memories. <words>94</words>  She knew they were close, shimmering just beyond her grasp like the moon’s reflection on the churning water. <words>111</words>  Tonight, under the waxing moon’s glow, she would transcend her limitations. <words>122</words> Her method lay scattered across her hearth: the charred fragments of half-burned diaries found in a fireplace. <words>140</words>  Each brittle page, rescued from oblivion, held a sliver of her past, a whisper of who she once was. <words>159</words>  She carefully pieced together the fragments, the burnt edges like jagged teeth in a forgotten smile. <words>175</words>  As she deciphered the faded ink, a sense of growing wisdom bloomed within her, fragile yet persistent, like a seedling pushing through cracked earth. <words>198</words>  The diaries spoke of rituals performed under this very moon, of knowledge passed down through generations of midwives on this isolated isle. <words>220</words>  They hinted at a power, a connection to the maelstrom itself, a way to navigate its chaotic currents. <words>239</words>  Elara recognized names, faces, and places that felt both intimately familiar and heartbreakingly distant. <words>257</words>  One entry described a memory-weaving ceremony, a way to store and retrieve experiences, a secret guarded fiercely by her ancestors. <words>279</words>  The theft, she now understood, wasn't of objects, but of essence, of the very fabric of her being. <words>297</words>  The pressed herbs, she realized, were not just for healing, but for focusing the mind, for unlocking the dormant pathways of memory. <words>319</words>  The dissonant calm she felt was the eye of the storm within her, a stillness born of grim determination. <words>337</words>  She arranged the diary fragments around her, the waxing moon illuminating the scorched words. <words>352</words>  The orchard island, her prison and her sanctuary, seemed to hold its breath. <words>365</words>  Tonight, piecing together the remnants of her past, Elara would transcend the amnesia that had shrouded her life, reclaiming the wisdom that was rightfully hers. <words>392</words> The half-burned diaries, silent witnesses to her forgotten history, were the keys to unlocking her stolen self. <words>411</words>  With each fragment she deciphered, the swirling maelstrom outside seemed to mirror the tempest within, a chaotic dance of loss and rediscovery. <words>433</words>  Under the waxing moon’s glow, Elara, the critical midwife, was on the precipice of remembering, of becoming whole once more. <words>454</words> The growing wisdom, gleaned from the ashes of her past, promised not just understanding, but power. <words>471</words>  The openly secretive woman was finally ready to unveil the secrets she had unknowingly kept from herself. <words>489</words>  She would transcend the boundaries of her fractured identity, emerging from the flames of her past, reborn. <words>507</words>

I will self-critique my draft answer to ensure that the draft answer is valid:
The draft answer is valid and does not fail any of the requirements mentioned in the initial query.
