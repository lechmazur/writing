Marcus fidgeted with his tour guide badge as the last tourist's camera flash faded in the spiral hallway of the Giant Nautilus Museum. <words>23</words>

The ancient seashell structure, converted into an architectural marvel decades ago, had always made him uneasy with its perfectly mathematical curves and unexplained whispers. <words>45</words>

When he discovered the wooden puzzle box wedged between the pearlescent walls that evening, its intricate patterns matching the shell's internal chambers, his hands trembled with recognition. <words>71</words>

According to the prophecy passed down through generations of guides, whoever aligned the box's shifting panels under a waning moon would inherit the shell's power to grant wishes in reverse. <words>103</words>

Marcus had spent years deliberately leading tours away from the shell's heart chamber, knowing that if anyone solved its mystery, their desires would manifest backward – healing would bring sickness, wealth would spawn poverty, love would turn to loss. <words>143</words>

But tonight, as the tide rose unusually high around the museum's base, he realized that leaving the box untouched was no longer an option. <words>169</words>

With gentle precision that belied his racing heart, Marcus worked the sliding panels beneath the moonlight streaming through the shell's natural skylight. <words>195</words>

Each click of the puzzle box felt like a key turning in a lock that had waited centuries to be opened, and as the final piece settled into place, the shell's walls began to pulse with a soft, pearl-white glow. <words>237</words>

Fighting his instincts to flee, Marcus closed his eyes and wished for darkness to consume the shell – knowing that in reverse, it would fill the structure with protective light. <words>270</words>

He wished for silence, and the shell sang with warning sirens that evacuated the nearby town moments before a massive tidal wave struck. <words>297</words>

He wished for solitude, drawing crowds of people to higher ground. <words>308</words>

He wished for fear, filling everyone with inexplicable courage. <words>318</words>

As the wave crashed harmlessly around the illuminated shell, Marcus sat in its heart chamber, surrounded by the box's scattered pieces, finally understanding why the prophecy had chosen him – not because he was brave, but because he was cautious enough to use its power with reluctant wisdom. <words>375</words>

The next morning, as cleanup crews marveled at the mysterious light that had saved countless lives, Marcus quietly pocketed the reassembled puzzle box, knowing that sometimes the most heroic acts come from those who never wanted to be heroes at all. <words>424</words>

The shell's secrets were safe with him, at least until the next prophecy found its reluctant keeper. <words>444</words>
