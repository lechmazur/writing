The reaver slouched against the kaleidoscope park's twisted metal sculpture, her scarred fingers tracing the edges of a child's drawing she'd found crumpled near the swings. <words>27</words>

In the margins, someone had scrawled poetry about tasting starlight, the same saccharine nonsense her own mother used to write before she turned. <words>49</words>

The park's fractured mirrors caught her reflection a thousand times over, each one showing a different version of her grotesquely beautiful face – some smiling, some snarling, all wearing the same knowing smirk. <words>80</words>

Her daughter would be here soon, already showing signs of the family curse, already beginning to feel the pull of the void that had claimed three generations of women before her. <words>112</words>

The drawing showed a family holding hands beneath a star-filled sky, stick figures with too many teeth and elongated fingers, exactly like the ones she used to draw before her own transformation began. <words>144</words>

"Mommy, mommy, mommy," came the singsong voice, nagging at the edges of her consciousness, just as she had once called out to her own mother in this very park. <words>173</words>

She watched her daughter skip toward her, still innocent, still untouched by the hunger that would soon twist her into something both horrifying and oddly endearing, just like all the women in their line. <words>207</words>

The poems in the margins grew more urgent as she read them: "Kiss the stars before they fade / Before the truth makes love afraid / Before the first lie parts your lips / Before the darkness fully slips." <words>245</words>

Her daughter reached her now, dark eyes gleaming with that familiar otherworldly shine, and the reaver knew she had only moments left before the child's first lie would spill forth, starting the cycle anew. <words>283</words>

With mocking tenderness, she pressed her lips to her daughter's forehead, tasting the celestial fire that burned within all their bloodline, knowing this kiss would be their last moment of pure truth together. <words>319</words>

The kaleidoscope mirrors spun faster now, reflecting their embrace in countless fractured images, each one showing a different stage of what was to come – past, present, and future colliding in a dizzying display of their shared fate. <words>359</words>

As her daughter opened her mouth to speak, the reaver held her tighter, savoring these final precious seconds before the first lie would transform them both, adding another layer to their charmingly grotesque family legacy. <words>398</words>

The crumpled drawing burst into stardust between them, its margins glowing with the poetry of their ancestors, as mother and daughter stood frozen in time, caught between truth and deception, love and monstrosity, in their kaleidoscope world of endless reflections. <words>444</words>
