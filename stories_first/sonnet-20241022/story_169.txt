The soul-broker real estate agent, Ms. Meridian, pirouetted across the floating tea platform, her movements precisely choreographed to match the gentle bobbing of the wooden planks above the misty lake. <words>33</words>

She approached her latest client, a translucent figure who remained weirdly static against the swaying backdrop of paper lanterns and steam. <words>54</words>

"This particular location," she said, lifting a dusty wine bottle from a weathered crate, "has been recycling souls since the Ming Dynasty, each spirit leaving behind a fragment of their favorite melody." <words>84</words>

With practiced grace that barely concealed her excitement, Ms. Meridian held the bottle up to the moonlight, reading the reversed text through the glass – a technique passed down through generations of supernatural realtors. <words>116</words>

The art of persuasion, she had learned, lay not in grand promises but in revealing the hidden songs trapped within these vessels, each one a potential memory for wandering spirits seeking their eternal homes. <words>149</words>

"Listen closely," she whispered, her voice carrying the weight of centuries as she traced her finger along the bottle's surface, releasing a haunting melody that seemed to dance between the tea leaves swirling in abandoned cups. <words>183</words>

Her client's form flickered with interest as the forgotten song emerged – a lullaby from three centuries past, when this very platform had hosted emperors and poets who sipped dragon well tea and composed verses under lantern light. <words>223</words>

Through the evening, Ms. Meridian continued her delicate work, matching spirits to songs, each bottle containing a different piece of history waiting to be rediscovered and rehomed. <words>252</words>

"The true value," she explained with characteristic grandiose modesty, "isn't in the square footage or the view of the spirit realm, but in finding the precise resonance between a soul and its ancestral melody." <words>290</words>

As she worked, generations of discarded bottles clinked together softly, their labels revealing snippets of forgotten symphonies – drinking songs, war chants, love ballads, and funeral dirges – each one a potential key to unlock a spirit's perfect resting place. <words>332</words>

The static spirit finally began to sway, its form dissolving into mist that matched the rhythm of an ancient merchant's shanty, and Ms. Meridian smiled, knowing she had found another perfect match in her unique corner of the afterlife real estate market. <words>376</words>

She carefully recorded the transaction in her ledger, using ink made from morning dew, while around her, the floating tea platform continued its eternal drift through the boundary between what was and what would be, carrying its cargo of souls and songs into the endless night. <words>432</words>
