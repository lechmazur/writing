Marcus had always been terrible at calculating odds, which made him both the worst gambler and the perfect mark for Professor Thaddeus's midnight lectures at the abandoned tidal power station. <words>33</words>

The old professor, dismissed from the university for increasingly erratic theories about harnessing chaos energy from ocean currents, had promised to teach Marcus how to predict the unpredictable – for a price. <words>65</words>

Every evening as the sun set, Marcus would dock his small boat at the station's weathered pier, carrying his grandfather's antique rustic candle mold like a sacred offering. <words>95</words>

The professor's lectures, delivered by candlelight during their shared evening meals, zigzagged between quantum mechanics and fortune-telling, while Marcus desperately tried to understand how melting wax patterns could reveal winning lottery numbers. <words>134</words>

Their unspoken arrangement was simple: Marcus would provide the professor company and candles, while Thaddeus would ramble about probability matrices and the moon's influence on electron behavior. <words>165</words>

As weeks passed, Marcus found himself laughing through tears at the absurdity of it all – the candlelit dinners in an abandoned monitoring station, the professor's wild gesticulations sending shadows dancing across rust-stained walls. <words>201</words>

Yet something kept drawing him back: perhaps it was the professor's infectious conviction, or maybe the way the ocean's rhythmic power seemed to pulse through the station's metal bones in perfect harmony with Thaddeus's most outlandish theories. <words>245</words>

The night everything changed, Marcus arrived to find the professor particularly animated, babbling about capturing the essence of probability itself within the crystalline structure of cooling wax. <words>276</words>

"My boy," Thaddeus had exclaimed, eyes reflecting candlelight like a man possessed, "tonight we harness that final spark, that moment when possibility collapses into certainty – before the universe swallows it whole!" <words>314</words>

What followed was either brilliant madness or mad brilliance: the professor connected Marcus's candle mold to the station's ancient monitoring equipment, creating an impossible machine that hummed with the tide's energy. <words>352</words>

As the final candle burned down, Marcus realized that the professor's true lesson hadn't been about gambling at all – it was about finding beauty in chaos, meaning in randomness, and friendship in the most unlikely places. <words>394</words>

Years later, people would ask Marcus why he'd given up gambling, and he'd just smile, fingering the wax-stained candle mold in his pocket, knowing some odds were better left uncalculated. <words>428</words>
