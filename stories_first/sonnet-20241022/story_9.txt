The soothsayer Madame Vex traced her trembling fingers through the sticky rings left by countless glasses on The Last Stop Bar's ancient wooden counter, her anxiety mounting as the neon signs from the billboard labyrinth outside cast shifting shadows across her face. <words>42</words>

"Oh, just wonderful," she muttered, squinting at the overlapping circles that magnified themselves into impossible patterns beneath her gaze, "another prophecy about the end of everything – because we clearly haven't had enough of those lately." <words>71</words>

The pocket puzzle box, with its thirteen intricate locks that had taken her seven lost years to master, grew warm in her other hand as if responding to the dire message written in the bar's water stains. <words>104</words>

Between the garish billboards advertising everything from synthetic air to artificial deserts, real nature had long since vanished, though Madame Vex knew – with the peculiar certainty that came with her unlikely gift – that she alone could redirect humanity's path. <words>143</words>

"Save the last trees, prevent the final drought," she recited sarcastically to her empty glass, "because apparently the universe thinks a washed-up fortune teller with anxiety issues is the perfect candidate for environmental heroism." <words>176</words>

Yet as her fingers worked the puzzle box's sequences – each lock clicking open with the precision of atomic clockwork – she couldn't deny that the prophecy in the water rings aligned perfectly with the ancient warnings contained within. <words>214</words>

The final lock sprang open just as the largest billboard outside flickered and died, plunging half the desert into darkness and revealing, for the first time in decades, a glimpse of actual stars. <words>247</words>

"Right then," Madame Vex sighed, pulling from the box a seed that glowed with impossible potential, "time to literally shape destiny with my bare hands – though I'd much prefer to shape it wearing gardening gloves." <words>284</words>

The water rings on the bar had shown her exactly where to plant it: at the heart of the billboard maze, where the corporations' monuments to excess cast their longest shadows. <words>319</words>

As she stepped out into the artificial twilight, puzzle box tucked safely away and seed burning against her palm, Madame Vex allowed herself a sardonic smile – because really, how completely absurd that the fate of Earth's remaining ecosystems rested with someone who could barely keep a cactus alive. <words>373</words>

Yet the prophecy had chosen her, and as she navigated through the towering advertisements that stretched endlessly into the dark desert, she knew with grim certainty that this unlikely path was the only one that mattered in all the lost years between humanity's downfall and its possible redemption. <words>432</words>

"Well," she announced to the empty desert as she knelt to plant the seed, "at least if I fail spectacularly, there won't be anyone left to leave bad reviews about my fortune-telling services." <words>469</words>
