The old-fashioned mage shuffled through the arctic research greenhouse, his robes collecting condensation as he meandered between rows of experimental crops. <words>21</words>

His seemingly aimless wandering had purpose - each reflection in the glass walls revealed fragments of an ancient Egyptian puzzle he'd been pursuing for decades. <words>43</words>

The fragment of a pharaoh's coffin tucked in his satchel had led him here, its hieroglyphs suggesting that only in a place where life defied the frozen death of winter could the final riddle be solved. <words>76</words>

Outside, children's laughter drifted from the research station's makeshift playground, their recess providing the precise window of time when the greenhouse's angles would align with the wan arctic sun. <words>108</words>

The mage paused, watching his reflection splinter and multiply across the frost-etched glass panels, each mirror image cradling and cuddling a different piece of the mystery like a mother with countless children. <words>143</words>

In one reflection, he saw himself as a young apprentice; in another, an aged master; in yet another, a figure that hadn't come to pass - all versions of himself reaching across time and space toward an undiscovered magical frontier. <words>186</words>

The coffin fragment grew warm in his bag, its ancient wood remembering the heat of Egyptian sands even as ice crystals formed intricate patterns across the greenhouse windows. <words>219</words>

A deep, sanctified dread settled in his bones as the reflections began to move independently, each one tracing different paths through their mirrored greenhouses, leaving trails of hieroglyphs hanging in the humid air. <words>256</words>

The children's playground songs outside transformed into something older, something that might have been sung in temple courtyards along the Nile, their innocent voices carrying the weight of millennia. <words>291</words>

As the last reflection aligned with its brothers, the mage understood - the uncharted frontier he sought wasn't a place at all, but rather the space between reflections, where reality folded like pages in an infinite book. <words>334</words>

The riddle had never needed solving; it had needed witnessing, here in this impossible garden where tropical plants defied the arctic waste, where past and future cuddled together like siblings sharing secrets. <words>374</words>

With trembling hands, the mage reached out to touch his nearest reflection, and as flesh met glass, the greenhouse filled with the light of a thousand desert suns, the pharaoh's fragment singing its final truth into the frozen air. <words>421</words>

The children returned from their playground to find the greenhouse empty of all but thriving plants and a lingering scent of ancient incense, while somewhere between mirrors, a mage stepped into the frontier he'd finally claimed as his own. <words>470</words></story>
