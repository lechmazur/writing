Madame Noir scrolled through her great-grandmother's archived MySpace posts while waiting for the mortuary's new shade of "Eternal Slumber Peach" to blend in the industrial mixer. <words>27</words>

Her perfectly manicured fingers, adorned with miniature brass measuring tapes as rings - a tradition started by her undertaker ancestor in 1882 - traced the screen as she discovered yet another piece of her family's legacy. <words>71</words>

"Every body deserves to be extraordinary in death," read the post from 2006, accompanied by a grainy photo of her great-grandmother elongating a corpse's features with her signature cosmetic technique. <words>116</words>

Madame Noir had spent fifteen fruitless years trying to replicate that particular method, which transformed the most mundane faces into ethereal masks of transcendence, proving that no death was ordinary. <words>157</words>

The paint mixer hummed its hypnotic rhythm as she clicked through hundreds of posts, her sequined black dress catching the fluorescent lights while she maintained her patient vigil for both the perfect shade and the elusive secret. <words>208</words>

Her red lips curved into a bittersweet smile as she remembered all the bodies she'd prepared - each one a canvas that, despite her best efforts, fell short of her ancestor's legendary transformations. <words>251</words>

Then she saw it: a video clip, poorly compressed and nearly lost to digital decay, showing her great-grandmother's hands performing the technique in perfect detail - the same technique she'd been seeking through countless death masks and endless experimentation. <words>309</words>

Tears of joy streaked her immaculate makeup as she realized the secret lay not in elongating the features themselves, but in creating an optical illusion using precisely measured angles of rouge and shadow. <words>359</words>

The paint mixer dinged just as she finished watching the video, and Madame Noir felt both elated at her discovery and remorseful for all the faces she'd worked on without this knowledge - but now, she could finally preserve her family's true art. <words>421</words>

She unspooled her brass measuring tape with newfound purpose, knowing that tonight's client would be the first to receive the authentic Noir treatment in over two decades, transforming yet another ordinary death into something magnificent. <words>470</words>
