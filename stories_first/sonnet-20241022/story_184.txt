Mira wiped down the quantum-glass tables in the vacuum chamber garden, her tavern-hand rag leaving streaks of possibility in its wake. <words>21</words>

The broken seashells she'd collected from the dried-up riverbed clinked in her apron pocket, each fragment a memory of when time flowed in the proper direction. <words>45</words>

"Another day serving drinks to time tourists," she muttered, watching them point their chronometers at fossilized footprints while sipping their temporal tonics. <words>65</words>

She'd inherited this peculiar establishment from her grandmother, who'd always said Mira's predictably unpredictable nature made her perfect for managing a bar where causality was merely a suggestion. <words>93</words>

Every evening, she would randomize the seating arrangements by tossing her broken shells onto the floor, letting their patterns dictate where the tables should float in the zero-gravity section. <words>124</words>

The regulars had learned to trust her system, even though they couldn't understand how a simple tavern-hand could read the cosmic arrangements in calcium carbonate fragments. <words>150</words>

But Mira knew what they didn't: that her grandmother had encoded the secrets of time-manipulation in these shells, leaving them for someone whose mind could catapult beyond conventional imagination. <words>180</words>

As the chronometric sands in the garden's central hourglass began their nightly reverse flow, Mira felt that familiar tug – the inescapable calling that had brought her grandmother here decades ago, or perhaps decades from now. <words>219</words>

She watched with practiced nonchalance as reality rippled around her patrons, their conversations becoming increasingly philosophical as temporal paradoxes accumulated like dust bunnies under quantum tables. <words>245</words>

"Time for last calls," she announced with flippant solemnity, "though technically, we haven't opened yet, and we closed tomorrow." <words>265</words>

The fossilized footprints along the garden's edge began to glow, each one marking a moment when someone had stepped between seconds, leaving their mark on the fabric of spacetime. <words>297</words>

Mira's fingers traced the edges of her shells, feeling the encoded vibrations that whispered of possibilities beyond the garden's vacuum-sealed walls. <words>319</words>

She knew that one day – perhaps yesterday – she would decode the final pattern, and the garden would reveal itself as more than just a waystation for temporal wanderers. <words>349</words>

For now, though, she continued her duties: polishing paradoxes, serving drinks that existed in multiple states simultaneously, and maintaining the delicate balance between what was, what is, and what might never be. <words>385</words>

After all, someone had to keep order in a place where chaos was the special of the day, and who better than a scrappy tavern-hand with a collection of broken seashells and a talent for reading the impossible? <words>424</words>
