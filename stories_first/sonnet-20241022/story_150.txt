Jake Redwood carved verses into bullet casings while hiding from the law in the brass-and-copper dome of the abandoned Sterling Observatory. <words>21</words>

The wanted outlaw had stumbled upon this peculiar sanctuary during rehearsals for the annual Mechanist's Theatre production, where he'd been masquerading as a stagehand to avoid the sheriff's posse. <words>45</words>

In his weathered saddlebag, alongside stolen gold and gunpowder, he carried a set of ancient bone dice marked with Norse runes – a gift from a mystic who'd sworn they could reveal tangled threads of fate. <words>73</words>

The observatory's curved walls, lined with steam-powered calculation engines and brass telescopes, had begun displaying shifting text in gleaming copper letters, first appearing as astronomical calculations before morphing into fragments of poetry that seemed to echo Jake's own unwritten verses. <words>116</words>

He'd roll those worn dice each dawn, watching them clatter across the metal floor while drinking coffee from a dented tin cup, their runic faces somehow always aligning with the ever-changing words that crawled across the dome's surface. <words>157</words>

The more he studied the walls' metamorphosing text, the more Jake noticed how the astronomical formulae would misalign with reality, showing impossible stellar configurations that nonetheless matched the cryptic patterns revealed by his dice. <words>195</words>

During each day's rehearsal below, the clank of steam-powered automatons and the actors' voices would drift up through the dome's ventilation shafts, creating an otherworldly symphony that seemed to conduct the dance of words across the walls. <words>237</words>

Jake found himself caught between fascination and unease, unable to leave this mechanical oracle despite knowing the law was closing in, his outlaw's instincts warring with an insatiable curiosity about the connection between his dice, his poetry, and the observatory's mysterious messages. <words>284</words>

The bone dice grew warmer with each roll, their runes beginning to glow with a pale light that matched the gleam of the wall-text, and Jake's poetry evolved from simple frontier verses into prophetic riddles that spoke of brass clockwork and stellar alignments. <words>334</words>

As weeks passed, his wanted posters yellowed and curled while Jake remained transfixed by the endless cycle of revelation, his criminal past feeling increasingly distant as he discovered his true destiny was not in robbing stagecoaches but in deciphering the cosmic poetry that bound together dice, dome, and destiny. <words>390</words>

The final rehearsal approached, and Jake understood at last that he wasn't reading the walls – the walls were reading him, using his outlaw poet's soul as a lens to focus truths too vast for ordinary minds to comprehend. <words>432</words>

He'd come seeking refuge but found purpose instead, his fugitive's heart finally at peace with the knowledge that some treasures were worth more than all the gold in any bank vault he'd ever robbed. <words>469</words>
