Marcus traced his fingers along the brass sundial's weathered surface, its shadow stretching across the abandoned platform like a desperate pointing finger. <words>21</words>

The disused railway station, its Victorian bones wrapped in decades of determined ivy, had become his sanctuary for composing verses about forgotten places and lost moments. <words>45</words>

When the letter arrived, bearing those strange symbols pressed into burgundy wax, he knew the pattern matched the cryptic engravings he'd been documenting in his poetry for months. <words>71</words>

His formally rebellious stance against the city's modernization had led him to protect these ruins, but now the sundial's ancient markings seemed to compel him toward a deeper mystery. <words>101</words>

The riddles had appeared one by one - in the curve of dying leaves, in the arrangement of fallen tiles, in the shadows cast by broken window frames - and Marcus had solved them all, filling notebook after notebook with possible meanings. <words>143</words>

Each solution revealed fragments of a story about the station's last stationmaster, who had vanished on a moonless night in 1923, leaving behind nothing but a collection of unusual timepieces. <words>173</words>

As Marcus broke the seal, the paper inside bore a single line of text that made his heart stop: "Time flows backwards for those who dare to remember." <words>201</words>

The sundial's shadow suddenly shifted against all natural law, and the ivy began to retreat like a film in reverse, revealing the station's walls as they had been a century ago. <words>237</words>

He watched, transfixed, as the delicate undoing of time itself transformed the decrepit platform into its former glory, and ghostly figures began to materialize around him, going about their long-forgotten routines. <words>273</words>

Among them stood the stationmaster, young and alert, holding an identical brass sundial and staring directly at Marcus with eyes that held both recognition and relief. <words>301</words>

"We've been waiting for a poet," the stationmaster said softly, "someone who could see the patterns, someone who would stand by the unremembered until time itself yielded its secrets." <words>335</words>

Marcus understood then that his years of defending this place, of capturing its essence in verse, had been preparation for this moment - when past and present could merge through the power of devoted observation and patient witness. <words>376</words>

As he stepped forward to join the stationmaster, Marcus realized that some mysteries don't need solving so much as they need someone willing to preserve them, to hold them gently in the space between what was and what could be again. <words>424</words>

The letter floated to the ground, its broken seal now showing nothing but smooth wax, its purpose fulfilled in bringing together two guardians of time's forgotten platforms. <words>454</words>
