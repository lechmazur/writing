Mira, an understudy sorcerer with an insufferably proper demeanor, bowed deeply to each salt crystal she passed in the underground growing chamber. <words>21</words>

"Do excuse me, most magnificent specimens," she chirped while tiptoeing between the crystalline formations that sparkled beneath magical grow-lights, her laundry tumbling in the adjacent facility's machines. <words>45</words>

She clutched a small cardboard box against her apprentice robes, its contents rattling with each exaggerated curtsy – a collection of enchanted recording devices she'd crafted to capture the whispers of the ancient oak grove above. <words>76</words>

Her master had tasked her with tracking the evolution of magical culture through the ages, but Mira had discovered something far more intriguing: the salt crystals were speaking to each other in voices that mimicked the trees' long-forgotten tongues. <words>116</words>

"I do hope you'll pardon my frightfully rude intrusion," she murmured, setting up her devices while performing little apologetic bows, even as she deliberately positioned herself to hinder the crystals' communications. <words>147</words>

The washing machine's rhythmic thumping provided cover for her eavesdropping, but she couldn't shake the creeping sensation that the crystals were watching her with their faceted faces. <words>175</words>

As she recorded their whispers, Mira began to understand: the salt formations weren't merely echoing the oak grove's ancient memories – they were evolving them, twisting the old stories into something new and unsettlingly alive. <words>214</words>

"Oh my, how absolutely fascinating," she tittered nervously, her studied politeness wavering as the crystals' voices grew stronger, no longer just whispers but a chorus of urgent murmurs that made her bones vibrate. <words>250</words>

The dryer's final buzz coincided with a sudden shift in the chamber's atmosphere – the crystals had stopped growing upward and were now oriented toward her, their formations bending like curious heads. <words>285</words>

"I really must apologize most profusely," Mira stammered, backing toward the laundry room door, her cardboard box of recordings clutched protectively to her chest, "but I believe I've overstayed my welcome." <words>319</words>

The crystals chimed in harmony, a sound that translated in her mind as laughter, and Mira realized with dawning horror that her relentless politeness had actually awakened something ancient that had been sleeping in the salt – something that had been waiting for someone to listen closely enough. <words>373</words>

As she fled up the stairs with her fresh laundry and forbidden recordings, she could still hear them singing, their voices a playful warning that echoed through the underground chamber: "Thank you ever so much for waking us, little sorcerer – do come back soon, won't you?" <words>428</words>
