The minstrel Pip counted his coins with a scowl, certain the immortal trickster had somehow stolen half his earnings again, despite the enchanted lockbox. <words>27</words>

He'd tracked the shapeshifting menace to this abandoned ink factory, where the fading sunlight caught dust motes dancing above rows of empty vats that once held formulas for vanishing messages. <words>71</words>

Clutching his only piece of evidence – a scrap of dragon-scale armor that the trickster had carelessly dropped during their last encounter – Pip crept past the rusted machinery, following the telltale hiss of ancient steam vents that still somehow functioned after decades of neglect. <words>134</words>

The timing had to be perfect: midday, when the trickster checked the factory's old mailbox for letters from other immortals (a habit as predictable as it was peculiar). <words>169</words>

Pip had spent his last coins on an absurd plan, buying hundreds of rubber bands to fashion a massive slingshot between two support beams, which even he had to admit was either brilliant or completely mad. <words>214</words>

As the steam vent's hiss reached its daily crescendo, Pip loaded the dragon-scale scrap into his makeshift launcher and waited for his target, humming an irreverent tune about immortals and their ridiculous obsession with postal services. <words>263</words>

When the trickster materialized by the mailbox, Pip released the dragon-scale, letting physics and ancient factory steam do the rest – the scrap flew true, caught the pressurized blast from the vent, and struck the immortal's back with impossible precision. <words>317</words>

The resulting explosion of magic was both spectacular and strangely logical, as the dragon-scale's inherent properties combined with the factory's lingering ink enchantments to trap the trickster in a cage of permanently disappearing and reappearing bars. <words>369</words>

"A gift," Pip announced with a flourish, strumming his lute, "from a mere mortal who spent his last penny to teach you a lesson about stealing from working musicians." <words>405</words>

The trickster's laughter echoed through the factory as coins began raining from thin air – not just Pip's stolen earnings, but a fortune in golden pieces, for in all the immortal's centuries of existence, no one had ever caught him through such beautifully ridiculous means. <words>465</words>
