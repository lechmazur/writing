Sir Edmund traced his fingers along the weathered hedge wall, his armor catching the last gasps of the dying streetlamp above. <words>21</words>

The maze had taunted him for years, holding within its depths the Regret Engine that tortured the township with endless cycles of what-ifs and could-have-beens. <words>45</words>

In his pocket, he carried a peculiar piece of evidence – the edge piece of a jigsaw puzzle that had appeared on his doorstep every night for a month, each time showing a different fragment of the maze's solution. <words>82</words>

His heart fluttered with both dread and anticipation as he followed the path revealed by those puzzle pieces, knowing his seeming naivety in trusting such mysterious clues might actually be his greatest strength. <words>119</words>

The air grew thick with the scent of impossible fruits as he finally breached the maze's center, discovering an otherworldly orchard where crystalline trees bore memories instead of apples. <words>153</words>

The Regret Engine stood among them, a brass and shadow contraption that hummed with frequencies that made his bones ache and his mind swim with bitter remembrances. <words>185</words>

Edmund had spent years studying the ancient texts about frequency manipulation, learning that the machine's power could be neutralized by matching its resonance with that of a pure heart. <words>221</words>

He removed his gauntlet and pressed his palm against the machine's core, feeling its cryptic rhythms pulse through his flesh as he began to sync his own heartbeat with its dark song. <words>259</words>

The orchard around him blazed with auroral light as memories – both sweet and painful – cascaded from the trees like falling stars, each one a story of what could have been, what should have been, what might still be. <words>303</words>

Pain and euphoria mingled in his chest as he forced himself to maintain the connection, knowing that only by embracing both the agony and the bliss of existence could he break the machine's hold over the town. <words>348</words>

As the last streetlamp outside the maze sputtered and died, Edmund felt the Regret Engine's frequencies finally align with his own, and in that moment of perfect harmony, its power dispersed into the night like morning dew. <words>394</words>

Standing in the now-quiet orchard, Sir Edmund smiled as the first rays of dawn filtered through the crystal branches, knowing that sometimes the most hopeful act is not to erase regrets, but to accept them and move forward. <words>441</words>
