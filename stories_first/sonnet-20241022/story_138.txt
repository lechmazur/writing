Lady Marianne Blackwood hadn't used her family name in decades, preferring the anonymity of her work in the Spontaneous Combustion Research Division. <words>21</words>

The artificial hummingbird drone hovered near her workbench, its crystalline wings catching the fluorescent light as she pieced together the fragments of her past through weathered theater tickets. <words>45</words>

Each stub represented a night she'd spent watching performances instead of attending noble gatherings, and now they formed a peculiar protective barrier around her latest experiment. <words>71</words>

Between incoming texts from the Department Head demanding results, she noticed something mysteriously obvious about the pattern emerging from her arranged tickets – they mapped perfectly to documented cases of unexplained fires across the city. <words>103</words>

The hummingbird's sensors chirped, detecting a thermal anomaly in the lab's eastern corner, where her grandfather's pocket watch lay ticking among the monitoring equipment. <words>130</words>

"The nobility never understood," she muttered, recognizing how her family's obsession with maintaining illusions had driven her to seek raw, unfiltered truth in the physics of spontaneous human combustion. <words>159</words>

The tickets, arranged in concentric circles, began to glow faintly – not with the chemical reaction she'd expected, but with an older magic that her bloodline had long denied. <words>190</words>

Her phone buzzed again, but she ignored it, watching as the hummingbird drone recorded the impossible data of ancestral power interfacing with modern science. <words>216</words>

Each ticket stub pulsed with memories: the opera where she'd first witnessed spontaneous combustion, the ballet when she'd decided to abandon her title, the theater where she'd learned to fortify her heart against family expectations. <words>252</words>

The truth had always been embarrassingly simple – the noble houses hadn't lost their magic; they'd buried it beneath layers of propriety and pretense. <words>278</words>

As the hummingbird's readings confirmed her theory, Marianne felt a hollow recklessness sweep through her, knowing this revelation would shatter centuries of carefully maintained social facades. <words>306</words>

She reached for her phone, thumbs hovering over the keys, wondering how to compress generations of deception into a text message that would upend the entire aristocratic system. <words>335</words>

The drone's wings caught the light one final time before the magic surged, transforming the mechanical construct into actual flesh and feathers – proof that authenticity, however small the moment, could pierce even the most elaborate of illusions. <words>374</words>

Marianne smiled, finally understanding why her grandfather's watch had always run perfectly despite never being wound, and began composing the message that would remind the noble houses of what they'd chosen to forget. <words>408</words>
