Miranda Thorne arranged funeral flowers with the same precision she used to decode ancient petroglyphs, each stem positioned to create maximum psychological impact. <words>21</words>

Her scuffed plastic comb, stolen from an archaeological dig in Wales twenty years ago, served as her secret weapon for both pursuits - spacing carnation stems and tracing the worn grooves of prehistoric art. <words>45</words>

As the folk singer at the stone circle paused between verses of an ethereal ballad, Miranda distinguished a pattern in the lichen-covered megaliths that she'd missed during her previous seventy-three visits. <words>71</words>

"Pull over here," she commanded her reluctant research assistant, their spontaneous road trip conversations having evolved from polite academic discourse to increasingly frantic theories about the circle's true purpose. <words>95</words>

The burden of watching these stones had been passed down through her family for generations, each watcher combining seemingly unrelated expertise - in her case, aggressive floral design and archaeoastronomy - to protect the circle's secrets. <words>127</words>

Her intellectually spontaneous approach to decoding the rock art had scandalized her colleagues, but Miranda knew that only by understanding the chaos could one grasp the underlying order. <words>153</words>

The singer's voice drifted through the misty air again as Miranda traced the ancient symbols with her comb, her other hand absently rearranging the wild flowers growing between the stones into precise geometric patterns. <words>186</words>

"The flowers are the key," she muttered, ignoring her assistant's concerned glance as she matched the petal arrangements to the weathered carvings. <words>208</words>

Each placement was a calculated act of polite anarchy against traditional archaeological methods, her seemingly erratic behavior masking a deeper understanding of the site's mathematical harmony. <words>234</words>

The singer hit another pause, and in that moment of silence, Miranda's flower-arranged constellation bloomed into perfect alignment with the stone circle's astronomical markers, revealing a code that had remained hidden for millennia. <words>270</words>

Her assistant gasped as the ground began to hum, but Miranda simply smiled and continued combing the air in precise patterns, conducting an ancient symphony of stone and stars with the same ruthless dedication she applied to her award-winning funeral arrangements. <words>308</words>

"You see," she said, adjusting a daisy with surgical precision, "sometimes the most profound discoveries require a certain elegant violence - whether you're breaking the rules of archaeology or simply ensuring that every flower tells the right story at exactly the right moment." <words>347</words>
