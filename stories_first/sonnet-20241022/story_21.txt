Ambassador Chen traced her fingers along the fox tail tassel, a trophy taken from the bandit who had murdered her sister twenty years ago. <words>27</words>

Through the musty air of the abandoned children's theater beneath city hall, she could hear the steady beating of drums from the protest gathering above. <words>52</words>

The synthetic lighting cast strange shadows across the dusty props and forgotten costumes, making the space feel both artificial and strangely alive. <words>76</words>

She had spent decades cultivating her reputation as the measured voice of reason in international relations, all while secretly funding research to decode the genetic markers that would lead her to the bandit's descendants. <words>116</words>

"Quite the jest, isn't it?" she whispered to the empty theater seats, her calm voice carrying an edge that could cut glass. <words>139</words>

The drums grew louder as she uploaded the final DNA sequence to her tablet, her diplomatic credentials having granted her access to restricted genetic databases that others could only dream of reaching. <words>174</words>

In the faint light, she could almost see her sister's ghost among the moth-eaten curtains, still wearing the costume from her final performance on this very stage before the attack. <words>214</words>

The bandit had thought it funny to leave his fox tail tassel behind, his calling card meant to mock the authorities, but he hadn't counted on her sister's final act - biting him and preserving his DNA under her fingernails. <words>263</words>

Now, as the protest drums reached a fevered pitch above, Ambassador Chen smiled at how her patience had paid off - the genetic pattern matching complete, revealing three living descendants in the city. <words>305</words>

She stood, straightening her immaculate suit, the perfect picture of diplomatic composure even as she calculated how to make their deaths appear as random accidents. <words>337</words>

The theater's heavy air seemed to whisper warnings about the price of revenge, but she had made peace with that cost long ago. <words>366</words>

As she climbed the stairs back to the main hall, she slipped the fox tail into her briefcase alongside official peace treaties and trade agreements, her measured smile never wavering. <words>401</words>

The drums would mask any sounds of resistance, and her carefully crafted reputation would deflect any suspicion - the perfect cover for a revenge decades in the making. <words>436</words>
