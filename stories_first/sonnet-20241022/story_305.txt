Professor Chen traced the runes on the clay tablet with trembling fingers, her usual reserve melting as she recognized their significance. <words>21</words>

The ancient symbols matched perfectly with the curious sketches she'd discovered tucked into the binding of her grandmother's 1892 Webster's dictionary. <words>42</words>

Standing knee-deep in the stagnant waters of the abandoned opera house, she couldn't suppress a small, knowing smile as she held her lantern higher to illuminate the crumbling baroque ceiling. <words>71</words>

The recipe had been clear: the echoes must be gathered precisely when the timer for her cardamom cake at home reached twenty-three minutes remaining. <words>97</words>

She knocked three times against different marble columns, each impact sending ripples across the flood water and creating overlapping resonances that seemed to dance with the flickering shadows. <words>127</words>

It was a delightfully technical form of mischief, she mused, using acoustical mathematics to disrupt the centuries-old enchantment that had kept the city's magical bureaucracy comfortably numb. <words>157</words>

The echoes began to coalesce into visible waves of silver light, swirling around her like curious spirits as she matched them to the patterns on the tablet. <words>189</words>

With methodical precision, she began to recite the incantation from her tablet, her quiet voice gaining strength as the echoes amplified each word into a thunderous chorus. <words>349</words>

The water at her feet started to swirl, and she allowed herself another small smile, knowing that by the time she returned home to her freshly baked cake, the magical bureaucracy would be thoroughly shaken from its comfortable stupor. <words>391</words>

Sometimes, she reflected, watching the portal grow stronger, the most effective revolution could be orchestrated by a quiet scholar with a penchant for obscure references and perfect timing. <words>421</words>
