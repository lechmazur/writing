In the Forbidden City's herb chamber, Ming Wei arranged specimens in her botanical press while calculating the exact pressure needed to preserve both the plants and the encrypted messages hidden within their delicate veins. <words>33</words>

As the palace's most peculiar assassin, she had discovered that the best way to hide her lethal trade was behind the gentle persona of an imperial botanist, though she did occasionally wonder if someone might notice how her preserved flowers formed patterns suspiciously similar to battle strategies. <words>84</words>

The butterfly that had landed on her worktable seemed to mock her methodical nature, its wings displaying an amalgamation of all the secrets she'd pressed between pages over the years. <words>116</words>

"Do stop reading my correspondence," she whispered to the insect with deadpan courtesy, noting how its wing pattern eerily matched the prophecy she'd received that morning about the Emperor's impending doom. <words>147</words>

The ancient scrolls had been quite specific about this moment - before the first question of succession would be asked, before anyone could suspect that the careful preservation of plants might literally preserve the empire's future through figuratively preserved omens. <words>189</words>

Ming Wei's calm demeanor barely flickered as she heard the whispers of longing echo through the palace halls - courtiers already plotting, servants already gossiping, and her butterfly informant already revealing which ambitious noble would try to seize power first. <words>233</words>

She found it rather amusing that while others schemed with swords and poison, she simply pressed flowers and let destiny unfold according to the patterns nature so graciously provided. <words>267</words>

"Your wings suggest Lord Chen will make his move at midnight," she told the butterfly with professional courtesy, carefully adding another specimen to her press, "though I do wish prophecies wouldn't always insist on such dramatic timing." <words>308</words>

The butterfly fluttered its agreement before dissolving into a shower of prophetic symbols that scattered across her collection of pressed flowers, each petal now bearing the weight of imperial succession. <words>341</words>

Ming Wei allowed herself a small smile as she closed the botanical press with a decisive snap - she had just turned whispered prophecies into tangible possibilities, and all it took was following the pattern of a butterfly's wings and maintaining a perfectly straight face while the fate of China arranged itself between sheets of blotting paper. <words>401</words>

"I suppose this means I should wear my formal assassination robes to dinner," she mused, carefully storing her botanical press in its lacquered cabinet, "One should always dress appropriately when helping prophecies fulfill themselves." <words>443</words>
