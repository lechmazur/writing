The lone trapper adjusted his gravity boots as he paced the curved windows of the floating observatory, rolling a piece of sea glass between his fingers like a worry stone. <words>33</words>

In the vast silence of space, he could somehow hear the glass whispering stories of Earth's lost oceans, now nothing but dried basins under geodesic domes. <words>63</words>

Between his monitoring shifts, when the station drifted through the shadow of the nearby black hole, he would recommence his secret project: decoding strips of contraband microfilm he'd discovered hidden in the observatory's dusty archives. <words>103</words>

The films contained coordinates to something the previous station crew had discovered – something that made them disappear without a trace, leaving behind only their encrypted messages and this single piece of sea-smoothed glass. <words>143</words>

He'd been tracking solar anomalies for fifteen years, but it was the darkness that truly fascinated him; the way the black hole seemed to drink the starlight like a cosmic vampire, leaving behind only questions and whispered possibilities. <words>186</words>

Each decoded fragment revealed more about the crew's discovery: they'd found a way to harvest energy from the void itself, to siphon pure radiance from the heart of absolute darkness. <words>223</words>

The sea glass, he'd learned, wasn't just glass – it was a crystalline key, transformed by centuries of waves into something that could channel and store the stolen light. <words>259</words>

His fingers traced the smooth curves of the glass as he worked, its clouded surface occasionally catching the starlight in ways that seemed to defy physics, as if it held memories of both ocean and cosmos within its translucent depths. <words>308</words>

The trapper had lost everything earthside – family, home, purpose – but here, suspended between stars and shadow, he was finding something greater: a way to transform loss itself into light. <words>347</words>

When the final piece of microfilm yielded its secrets, he held the sea glass up to the black hole's event horizon and watched in wonder as it began to glow with an impossible radiance, proving that even in the darkest spaces, hope could be found – if you knew where to look for it. <words>408</words>

The station's artificial gravity hiccupped, and he smiled, knowing that soon he would share this discovery with a world desperate for light, turning his solitary vigil into humanity's salvation. <words>444</words>
