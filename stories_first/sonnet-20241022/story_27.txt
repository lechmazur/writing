Marcus stood at the abandoned prize booth, his cursed tongue compelling him to speak only brutal truths while watching a rare warbler flit between rusted carnival games. <words>27</words>

The vintage pencil box he'd won here decades ago sat heavy in his hands, its brass hinges gleaming under the waxing moon that filtered through cobwebs and shattered glass. <words>52</words>

"Your soul is as dusty as this booth," he told the figure approaching through the mist, his words carrying that familiar sting of unwanted veracity that had cost him so many friendships over the years. <words>84</words>

Sarah, his former mentor, smiled that knowing smile he'd grown to detest, setting her binoculars aside as she traced her fingers along the intricate tapestry hanging behind the counter – a medieval scene depicting the phases of the moon controlling human fate. <words>124</words>

"You've become quite politely vindictive with your truth-telling," she observed, her voice carrying the same serene wisdom that had once guided him through ornithology studies, before the curse. <words>157</words>

Marcus opened the pencil box, revealing crystalline dust that sparkled like trapped starlight, and said, "You cursed me to speak truth because you couldn't bear to hear how your teachings had grown stagnant, how you'd stopped evolving." <words>196</words>

The warbler's song echoed through the decrepit park as Sarah's eyes widened with recognition, understanding finally dawning that her own fear of change had led her to trap her promising student in this prison of perpetual honesty. <words>237</words>

"Each moon phase in your tapestry," Marcus continued, his voice gentle yet unyielding, "represents a chance for growth you ignored, and now it's time for you to experience true transformation." <words>270</words>

With practiced grace, he blew the crystalline dust toward her just as the moon reached its apex, and Sarah's form began to petrify, her flesh transforming to stone with the same deliberate patience she'd once used to teach him about bird migrations. <words>317</words>

As dawn approached and the last warbler took flight, Marcus hung his own small tapestry beside hers – this one showing a stone figure surrounded by soaring birds – and placed the pencil box at her feet, knowing that when the moon completed its cycle, she would emerge with a mind finally open to change. <words>380</words>

The morning light filtered through the booth's weathered walls, casting prismatic patterns across Sarah's stone face, and Marcus whispered one final truth: "Sometimes the kindest act is forcing someone to see their own reflection." <words>419</words>
