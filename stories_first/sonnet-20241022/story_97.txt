The oracle adjusted her brass compass for the thousandth time, desperately trying to appear casual as reality rippled around her like disturbed water. <words>21</words>

Numbers, probabilities, and cold facts had always been her refuge, but they offered no comfort in this unstable dimension where even time flowed like mercury through her fingers. <words>45</words>

"Three point seven seconds until the next shift," she muttered, watching the compass needle spin wildly as another wave of heartbreak-induced visions washed over her. <words>69</words>

In these visions, she saw what her analytical mind had always failed to grasp: the raw, unquantifiable emotion of every soul she'd ever read, every future she'd ever predicted with such clinical precision. <words>103</words>

The dimension buckled again, and she forced herself to recompose, knowing she had mere fragments of a whispered minute to find what she'd come here for – those forgotten places where logic and feeling intertwined. <words>139</words>

Each pulse of dimensional instability brought new understanding: the tears of a mother whose child she'd once coldly predicted would fall ill, the joy of lovers whose meeting she'd calculated with mathematical certainty, the grief of those whose fates she'd delivered like weather forecasts. <words>185</words>

The compass grew warm in her hands, its brass surface reflecting fractals of every emotion she'd dismissed as irrelevant data. <words>205</words>

"Probability of success: unknown," she whispered, and for the first time in her existence, the uncertainty felt like freedom rather than failure. <words>228</words>

Through the kaleidoscope of others' pain and joy, she began to understand that her gift for prophecy had never needed more accuracy – it had needed more heart. <words>259</words>

As the dimension shuddered around her, threatening to collapse, she finally saw the path she'd been seeking: not a linear trajectory of cause and effect, but a spiral dance of interconnected feelings, each one leading to deeper understanding. <words>300</words>

The compass needle steadied, pointing not north or south but inward, and she laughed through her tears as empathy flooded her consciousness, transforming cold statistics into living, breathing stories. <words>334</words>

In the final moments before the dimension stabilized, she clutched the compass to her chest, no longer trying to maintain her professional distance, finally embracing the beautiful chaos of emotional truth. <words>368</words>

"Forecast for today," she declared to the swirling reality around her, "one hundred percent chance of feeling everything, with scattered moments of profound connection and an overwhelming probability of becoming whole." <words>401</words>

The dimension settled like a sigh, and the oracle emerged transformed, her brass compass now guiding her not to predicted futures, but to the beating hearts within them. <words>435</words>
