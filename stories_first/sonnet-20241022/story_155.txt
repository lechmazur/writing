Marcus adjusted his diving mask in the fractured planetarium mirror, the constellations once projected overhead now replaced by strobing dance lights. <words>21</words>

As an underwater welder by day, he was used to existing between worlds, but tonight felt different as he clutched his grandmother's antique button box against his chest. <words>45</words>

Each brass button inside held a memory she'd collected - snippets of time she'd somehow managed to trap and preserve, though he'd never believed her claims until now. <words>71</words>

The club's rotating mirrors caught his reflection at odd angles, and in each flash he saw himself in different timelines: sometimes older, sometimes younger, sometimes not quite human at all. <words>103</words>

He'd discovered his inheritance granted him an impossible power: the ability to splice moments together like the metal joints he welded beneath the waves, but only here, where the planetarium's old magic lingered in its broken dome. <words>143</words>

Patiently, he waited by the bar, though his fingers drummed restlessly against the button box's worn leather surface - he knew his past self would walk through those doors at exactly midnight. <words>176</words>

The box had shown him how to pamper time itself, to coax it into new shapes like bending metal underwater, but meeting himself could unravel everything his grandmother had worked to protect. <words>213</words>

Through the kaleidoscope of mirror fragments, he watched two versions of himself drift closer, like celestial bodies approaching their inevitable collision point. <words>236</words>

The button box grew warm in his hands, its contents clicking like tiny gears as the timeline intersection approached - his grandmother's final mystery unfolding in this repurposed temple of stars. <words>270</words>

His reflection multiplied across the mirrored walls, each one showing a different choice, a different fate, while the dance floor's inhabitants moved in slow motion beneath the cracked dome. <words>305</words>

When midnight struck, Marcus opened the box and watched as buttons spilled into the air like constellation points, each one containing a moment his grandmother had saved for precisely this convergence. <words>341</words>

The other Marcus appeared through the crowd, and together they began the delicate work of weaving time back together, their welding skills finding new purpose in mending the fabric of reality itself. <words>376</words>

As the night deepened and the club's broken planetarium wheels turned overhead, both versions of Marcus understood why his grandmother had chosen him - some repairs required not just skill and power, but the patience to let mystery reveal itself. <words>424</words>

The button box closed with a final click, and the mirrors settled into showing just one reflection - but Marcus knew he'd forever exist in that space between moments, guardian of the timeline his grandmother had entrusted him to protect. <words>470</words>
