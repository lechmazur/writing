Maya adjusted her "Professional Cuddler" name tag as she wandered through the makeshift farmer's market, set up in the cavernous abandoned spaceport hangar where colony ships once launched toward distant stars. <words>33</words>

The unspoken rules of her profession weighed heavily on her mind - never initiate contact outside of sessions, maintain professional boundaries, keep emotional distance - yet here was Mr. Chen, her most regular client, examining heirloom tomatoes two stalls ahead. <words>71</words>

She fingered the phantom train ticket punch in her pocket, a family heirloom that somehow still made the same satisfying clicking sound it had made a century ago when her great-grandfather worked the lunar express. <words>108</words>

The vast metal ceiling creaked above them, its once-gleaming surface now spotted with decay, much like the prejudices Maya had harbored about people who paid for professional cuddling before she'd started this unusually usual career. <words>145</words>

Through the hangar's massive windows, she could see the crowd gathering in the plaza outside, all waiting for the colony's new governor to deliver their acceptance speech, but in here time seemed suspended in the dusty shafts of sunlight. <words>186</words>

Mr. Chen looked up, their eyes meeting across pyramids of produce, and Maya realized with sudden clarity that the ancient novelty of human connection transcended all her preconceptions about touch, intimacy, and necessity. <words>223</words>

The ticket punch clicked in her palm - once, twice - a nervous habit she'd developed since inheriting it, its sound echoing off the hangar walls like the ghost of departed ships. <words>259</words>

"I didn't expect to see you here," Mr. Chen said softly, and in the hush that fell over the market as the governor's music began playing outside, Maya understood that sometimes the most meaningful connections happened in the spaces between professional obligations and personal growth. <words>308</words>

She smiled, setting down the vintage apple she'd been pretending to examine, and replied, "Sometimes the best things happen when we least expect them," thinking of how her journey from skeptic to empathetic practitioner had begun with a similar chance encounter in this very hangar months ago. <words>365</words>

As the first notes of the anthem drifted through the old launch doors, Maya and Mr. Chen stood in comfortable silence among the produce stalls, two people who had moved beyond the constraints of provider and client to find something more authentic in the shadow of spacecraft that once carried humanity's dreams to the stars. <words>432</words>

The ticket punch made one final click in her pocket, as if punctuating the moment when her last prejudices about her profession finally fell away, like the layers of paint peeling from the hangar's weathered walls. <words>474</words></story>
