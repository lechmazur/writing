In the phosphorescent ruins of St. Electronic's Cathedral, where holographic saints flickered like broken pixels, Marcus shuffled through the debris of humanity's final chapter. <words>27</words>

As a wary explorer of abandoned places, he'd seen countless remnants of the before-times, but something about this neon-bathed sanctuary made his usually quiet nature surge forth in nervous humming. <words>71</words>

The damaged music CD he'd found earlier caught the pink and blue light streaming through fractured stained glass, its scratched surface reflecting fragments of what might have been the last song ever recorded. <words>116</words>

Fireflies, the only other living things in this ghost-world, pulsed through the thick fog that had become Earth's permanent blanket, their gentle morse code seeming to beckon him deeper into the cathedral's depths. <words>164</words>

He meandered between towering columns that glowed with bioluminescent moss, following the insects' dance while clutching the CD like a compass pointing to something he couldn't yet understand. <words>208</words>

Each step revealed ancient emblems carved into the floor – symbols of valor, persistence, and courage that humanity had left behind when the stories ran out and silence claimed the world. <words>251</words>

Marcus's footsteps echoed as he suddenly began speaking aloud to the empty space, his voice carrying the weight of someone who'd spent too many years in solitude: "I know you're here, the person I used to be." <words>300</words>

The fireflies converged ahead, forming a shimmering doorway that pulsed in sync with his heartbeat, and for the first time since the world went quiet, he felt the familiar spark of his old fearlessness stirring. <words>351</words>

In the reflection of a chrome altar, he caught glimpse of his younger self – the bold child who once faced the unknown with wonder instead of wariness – and understood why the fireflies had led him here. <words>401</words>

Standing beneath the cathedral's central spire, where neon angels danced their endless digital waltz, Marcus placed the scratched CD on the altar and began to sing the last human story ever written – not as an ending, but as an invitation to begin again. <words>466</words>
