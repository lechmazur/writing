In the floating metropolis of Neo-Cirrus, where buildings drifted like crystalline clouds, Marcus Vale made his living absorbing other people's mistakes. <words>21</words>

As a professional scapegoat, he possessed a robustly delicate reputation – strong enough to weather any scandal, yet precisely calibrated to appear vulnerable enough for believable blame. <words>45</words>

The job had stripped away his original identity years ago, leaving only a collection of borrowed names and fabricated pasts, each one carefully refashioned to suit his clients' needs. <words>71</words>

Tonight, as the last library card was scanned and returned to the circulation desk far below his apartment, Marcus studied the ancient metal washer he'd found embedded in a client's case file. <words>103</words>

The washer's scratched surface bore markings that matched the sacred symbols he'd been researching for months, symbols that appeared in every case where he'd taken the fall for high-ranking cloud city officials. <words>137</words>

His apartment's holoscreen flickered as another cryptic midnight call illuminated the room – these anonymous communications had become his sole connection to the truth behind the symbols. <words>164</words>

"The washer is the key," whispered the distorted voice, "Each groove corresponds to a name you've worn, each scratch maps to a lie you've shouldered." <words>191</words>

Marcus traced the washer's circumference with trembling fingers, maintaining his characteristically calm demeanor even as obsessive thoughts raced through his mind. <words>214</words>

The symbols seemed to pulse beneath his touch, revealing connections between every identity he'd assumed, every scandal he'd absorbed, forming a pattern that stretched across the city's highest echelons. <words>247</words>

As dawn's light filtered through the perpetual mist surrounding his floating apartment, Marcus realized that his years of professional blame-taking hadn't been random assignments – they were carefully orchestrated steps in a vast conspiracy. <words>284</words>

Each disgrace he'd endured had been a brushstroke in a larger canvas, and the washer was the cipher that would decode it all. <words>309</words>

His fingers moved faster now, mapping each mark to a memory, each dent to a ruined reputation he'd accepted, building a framework of understanding that both thrilled and terrified him. <words>341</words>

The next midnight call would be different – instead of receiving instructions, he would finally reveal how his scattered identities formed a testament to the city's darkest secrets, all encoded in this simple circle of metal. <words>378</words>

As Neo-Cirrus's spires caught the morning light, Marcus clutched the washer to his chest, knowing that for the first time since becoming a professional scapegoat, he would soon reclaim not just one identity, but the truth behind them all. <words>421</words>
