Agent Sarah Chen stared at her reflection in the cracked holo-display, barely recognizing the person gazing back from beneath the neon-stained grime of New Shanghai's lower levels. <words>27</words>

The unused sticky label in her pocket – meant for marking the dead drop location – felt like it was burning through her synthleather jacket, a reminder of the mission she'd abandoned when she'd spotted Marcus in the crowd. <words>71</words>

Her target's identical twin, the man she'd fallen for during their shared urban exploration of abandoned arcology levels, had somehow survived the avalanche that had claimed Marcus six months ago in the Himalayan safe house. <words>116</words>

The steaming bowl of black market memory-noodles sat before her, a new recipe she'd tracked down specifically because it promised to erase selective memories, yet she remained curiously indifferent to its potential as she watched Not-Marcus gloat over his successful infiltration of the slum's security network. <words>182</words>

The way he moved through the decrepit food stall, the casual grace with which he interfaced with the ancient tech – it was all wrong, yet somehow right, like a familiar song played in a different key. <words>234</words>

She lifted the chopsticks, the synthetic proteins writhing with nano-preservatives, knowing that in moments she would either forget her love for Marcus or confirm this impostor's identity. <words>271</words>

The avalanche that had separated them still haunted her dreams: the wall of white death that had chased them down the mountain, Marcus pushing her into the escape pod, his smile as he'd sealed her inside. <words>319</words>

As the first bite of noodles hit her tongue, time seemed to stretch like old plastic, and in that instant, she saw the truth in Not-Marcus's reflection in the stall's scratched steel wall – the subtle tells of a deep-cover operative who'd studied his twin brother's mannerisms for years. <words>383</words>

The memory-noodles worked their chemistry through her system, but instead of erasing her love for Marcus, they stripped away the comfortable lies she'd been telling herself since she'd spotted his double, revealing the mission she'd been unconsciously pursuing all along. <words>442</words>

She let her chopsticks clatter to the table, her handler's final words now echoing with new meaning: sometimes the best way to catch a spy was to become the thing they couldn't resist – a mirror of someone they'd lost, reflected in the shattered fragments of a life they'd left behind. <words>500</words>
