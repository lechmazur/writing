The last human footprint had long since frozen over when Eldrin began gathering frost-apples in the hanging orchards of New Svalbard. <words>21</words>

As the druid moved cautiously along the crystalline branches, his ceremonial robes billowing over the endless blue crevasse below, he couldn't help but feel fiercely ambivalent about maintaining the ancient birthday traditions. <words>45</words>

The dull safety pin that held his late mother's recipe scroll to his sleeve caught the pale light, reminding him of her insistence that someone must keep preparing the family's sacred midwinter meal, even after humanity's exodus to the stars. <words>76</words>

Eldrin had inherited both her recipes and her debilitating fear of heights, though the latter seemed a cruel joke given his calling as caretaker of the suspended orchards. <words>101</words>

The silence of the glacial garden was absolute, broken only by the occasional crack of ice and his own carefully measured breathing as he inched along the frozen limbs. <words>129</words>

With each frost-apple he plucked and added to his basket, a hint of dour amusement crossed his features – here he was, the last druid, gathering ingredients for a feast no family would attend. <words>162</words>

Yet the weight of tradition pressed upon him like the perpetual winter sky, and he knew that breaking the silence of his self-imposed solitude meant facing the very fears that had kept him bound to this floating orchard while others sought the stars. <words>204</words>

As he reached for the final frost-apple, a deep rumble shook the ancient ice beneath the orchard's roots. <words>222</words>

Eldrin froze, his hand outstretched, as chunks of blue ice crashed into the depths below, and for the first time in decades, he felt something beyond his carefully maintained guardedness – raw terror mixed with an unexpected thrill. <words>256</words>

The recipe scroll fluttered in the sudden wind, and he realized that his mother's birthday feast was never meant to be eaten alone – it was meant to be shared with whoever was brave enough to join him in this precarious paradise. <words>296</words>

With trembling fingers, he unpinned the scroll and let it fly free, watching as it danced away on the arctic breeze, carrying with it his fear and isolation. <words>324</words>

That evening, as the aurora painted the ice-orchard in ethereal colors, Eldrin prepared the feast anyway, setting places for guests who might never come, but finally understanding that some traditions were meant to be transformed rather than merely preserved. <words>366</words>

And as he sat at his table suspended between ice and stars, the silence broke – not with human voices, but with the song of the glacier itself, a chorus of cracks and groans that felt, somehow, like conversation. <words>406</words>

For the first time in years, Eldrin smiled genuinely, raised his glass to the empty chairs, and celebrated his birthday with the only family he had left – the ancient ice that had taught him to embrace his fears rather than guard against them. <words>447</words>
