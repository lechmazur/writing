The assassin watched through her paint-splattered camera lens as the last transport pod made its final arc across Asteroid MB-742's crystalline surface. <words>21</words>

Through the baroque architecture of the mining colony's cathedral spires, she traced the vehicle's path via the pattern of a spider's web after rain, each dewdrop a potential point of interception. <words>45</words>

She laughed softly at the superficially profound graffiti someone had tagged across the pod's hull: "To cradle the dawn in trembling hands," a popular phrase among the asteroid's teenage philosophers. <words>71</words>

The unforgiving road stretched before the pod like a ribbon of borrowed starlight, its surface carved from centuries of mineral haulers and pilgrim vessels wearing grooves into the rock. <words>99</words>

Her target was the bus driver, though that term seemed quaint for someone piloting a pressurized transport through the void between automated mining stations. <words>124</words>

She'd studied his route for weeks, memorizing each pause at the crystalline outcrops where he collected workers, each moment his pod slowed to navigate the treacherous turns of the asteroid's equatorial highway. <words>157</words>

The driver had been smuggling more than workers between stations – he carried encrypted data about the colony's defense systems, selling them to the highest bidder in the outer rings. <words>187</words>

As the pod approached its final stop, she adjusted her position among the gothic buttresses of the cathedral, her body perfectly still against the ancient stone as stars wheeled silently overhead. <words>219</words>

The assassin's finger tensed on her trigger, the lens capturing every detail: the way the pod's lights caught the crystal formations, how the driver's silhouette moved with practiced ease in the cockpit, the elegant arch of mineral bridges spanning the cosmic abyss. <words>264</words>

For a moment, she felt a strange kinship with her target – they were both creatures of routine and precision, following their own careful patterns across this glittering rock suspended in space. <words>298</words>

But when the pod slowed for its final approach, she didn't hesitate. <words>311</words>

The shot pierced the reinforced glass with surgical precision, and as the pod's emergency systems engaged, she watched through her spattered lens as the vehicle settled gracefully onto its designated platform. <words>345</words>

No one would question the driver's death – not here on the asteroid's dark side, where accidents were common and the baroque spires kept their secrets in shadows deeper than space itself. <words>379</words>

She packed away her weapon and lens, leaving only footprints in the mineral dust that would soon be erased by the eternal wind of the atmosphere processors, her mission complete as artificial dawn began to creep across the asteroid's jagged horizon. <words>424</words>
