The sellsword Garrick laughed heartily as he planted his boots among the witch's carefully tended moonflowers, his characteristic mirth at odds with the solemn task ahead. <words>27</words>

His grandmother's astronomical telescope, polished to a mirror shine, caught the dying light as he positioned it between patches of wolfsbane and nightshade. <words>47</words>

Every generation of his family had buried a time capsule here in Madame Thornheart's garden, each containing a piece of themselves they wished to shed, but Garrick found himself boldly reluctant to continue the tradition. <words>76</words>

The withering vow he'd made years ago – to never love again after his beloved's death – had served as both shield and prison, and now it sat heavy in his palm like a tarnished coin. <words>108</words>

Through the telescope's lens, he watched the stars align into the pattern his grandmother had specified, their celestial dance marking the beginning of his transformation. <words>134</words>

"Come now, dear warrior," Madame Thornheart called from her crooked cottage, her voice carrying the weight of centuries, "you cannot treasure what you've locked away forever." <words>159</words>

Elegant chaos erupted as Garrick began to dig, disturbing a patch of singing roses that wailed their displeasure into the twilight air. <words>182</words>

His laughter, though quieter now, still bubbled up as he placed the written vow into the ornate box alongside his grandmother's compass, his mother's broken wedding ring, and his sister's tear-stained handkerchief. <words>217</words>

The witch moved through her garden like smoke, gathering herbs that would help dethrone the doubt that had ruled Garrick's mind since that fateful day, her ancient fingers weaving spells of unbinding. <words>250</words>

As moonlight spilled across the garden, Garrick buried the time capsule beneath a flourishing rosemary bush, feeling the weight of his vow already beginning to lift from his shoulders. <words>280</words>

"The stars will keep your pain," Madame Thornheart whispered, directing his eye back to the telescope, where through the lens he could see his vow transforming into a new constellation. <words>312</words>

His mercenary's heart, so long confined by grief, expanded with each breath of the herb-scented air, and for the first time in years, Garrick felt the possibility of love unfurling like the witch's night-blooming jasmine. <words>351</words>

The garden hummed with magical energy as the transformation completed itself, and Garrick's booming laugh returned in full force, scattering a murder of crows from the witch's roof into the star-strewn sky. <words>389</words>

"Well then," he grinned, sheathing his sword and bowing dramatically to Madame Thornheart, "shall we celebrate this unburdening with a drink, or must I return to my sellsword duties with only the memory of this elegant mayhem to warm my evenings?" <words>432</words>

The witch's answering smile held all the wisdom of the ages as she produced a bottle of luminescent liquid from her robes, proving that some family traditions were worth keeping, while others were better left buried beneath the healing herbs of a magical garden. <words>478</words>
