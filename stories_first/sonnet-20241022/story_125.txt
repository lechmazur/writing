Marcus slouched in the creaky chair of his grandmother's old farmhouse, staring at the misdelivered package that had somehow found its way to this last remnant of his family's property. <words>33</words>

As a mage who could barely conjure a light orb, he felt a familiar numbness as he unwrapped the peculiar parcel, revealing a vintage doll head with unnervingly realistic blinking eyes. <words>65</words>

The porcelain face looked exceptionally usual – the kind you'd pass a thousand times in an antique shop without a second glance – except for the way it seemed to track his movements with an ancient intelligence. <words>103</words>

When the third blink synchronized with a distant flash from the abandoned space station control room at the edge of the property, Marcus finally understood why his grandmother had always insisted this worthless tract of land would be his salvation. <words>147</words>

The doll head whispered in his mind, showing him visions of his ancestors conducting celestial magic through that very control room, using the old satellite arrays to amplify their spells across the cosmos. <words>186</words>

With the bank's foreclosure looming tomorrow, Marcus trudged through the overgrown field toward the control room, the doll head tucked under his arm like a compass pointing him toward his birthright. <words>224</words>

Inside the dust-covered facility, rows of dead monitors reflected his tired face until, one by one, they flickered to life in response to the doll head's pulsing energy. <words>259</words>

"Your family never failed at magic," the doll head's voice echoed in his thoughts, "they simply operated on a different frequency – one that required this exact location, this exact moment, and this exact confluence of celestial bodies." <words>307</words>

As Marcus placed the doll head onto the central console, its eyes projected a holographic star chart that unveiled the hidden magical ley lines connecting the farmland to the stars themselves. <words>344</words>

The trap he had unknowingly set for his own limitations sprung shut as power surged through him, and he realized with a mixture of boredom and exhilaration that his years of magical mediocrity had simply been the universe's way of preparing him for this moment. <words>401</words>

Standing at the boundary between his past and future, Marcus initiated the station's long-dormant sequences, finally understanding that sometimes the most extraordinary magic looks perfectly ordinary to the untrained eye. <words>441</words>

As the satellite dishes above him creaked to life, he smiled at how the universe had conspired to deliver him exactly where he needed to be – through a simple wrong address on a package containing his grandmother's last gift. <words>487</words>
