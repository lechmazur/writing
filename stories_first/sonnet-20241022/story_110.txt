The water clock repair shop had always been Madame Voss's cover, though her real art lay in the precise calibration of death rather than time. <words>24</words> Her quietly flamboyant manner of dress – all black velvet with hidden daggers disguised as brass clockwork ornaments – drew just enough attention to seem ordinary in a street of eccentric artisans. <words>63</words> She adored how her victims' eulogies often contained coded messages for those who knew where to look, little hints of her artistry slipped between lines of grief and remembrance. <words>97</words> Tonight, she sat beneath a moss-covered lantern in her shop's back garden, reading yesterday's obituary of Mr. Henderson, her latest masterpiece, while the steady drip of her favorite water clock kept time with her thoughts. <words>143</words> "He lived life like a perfectly wound timepiece," the eulogy read, making her smile at the bleak irony – she had, after all, stopped his clockwork with a specially calibrated poison that mimicked natural heart failure. <words>186</words> Between chapters of her leather-bound ledger of contracts, Madame Voss found herself increasingly drawn to the domestic mysteries that brought clients to her door: wives discovering husbands' secret families, business partners uncovering decades of theft, children learning of inheritances stolen. <words>237</words> Each death she orchestrated was a transformation of their pain into something precise and purposeful, like converting the crude mechanics of revenge into the delicate gears of justice. <words>271</words> The latest obituary continued: "He kept his affairs as ordered as the mechanisms he collected," causing Madame Voss to chuckle darkly – if only they knew about the chaos of ledgers she'd found in his study, revealing years of embezzlement from the orphanage fund. <words>324</words> She traced her fingers along the worn brass of the water clock, remembering how Mr. Henderson had brought it to her for repair just three weeks ago, never suspecting that his request to fix its timing would lead to the perfect orchestration of his own end. <words>377</words> As midnight approached, Madame Voss closed her ledger and smiled at the moss-covered lantern swaying gently in the breeze, its green-tinted light casting shadows that danced like the secrets she kept, the pain she transformed, and the justice she dealt in measures as precise as the drops in her beloved water clocks. <words>441</words>
