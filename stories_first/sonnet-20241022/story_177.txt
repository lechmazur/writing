Marcus climbed the towering shelves of the giant's library, his notebook filled with pre-written obituaries for those still walking the earth. <words>21</words>

The leather-bound volumes around him vibrated with a deep, resonant hum that seemed to emanate from somewhere above, where ancient pipe organs lay concealed between dusty tomes. <words>45</words>

His latest subject, a theater mask discovered in a forgotten first edition, had been changing its carved expression each time he looked away, cycling through emotions he couldn't quite catalogue. <words>73</words>

As a professional pre-death obituarist, Marcus had always rebelled against the notion that stories should wait until their subjects were gone, but this mask – this impossible object – promised to help him restore the lost art of living eulogies. <words>110</words>

The humming grew stronger as he ascended, causing the mask to quiver in his satchel, while whispers of revolution filtered up from the city streets far below, where his subjects lived their unknowingly documented lives. <words>147</words>

Each shelf presented a choice: left toward the histories, right toward the prophecies, up toward the sound, down toward safety – a labyrinth of decisions that seemed to mirror the countless paths he wrote for his still-breathing clients. <words>186</words>

When he finally reached the hidden organ chamber, the mask practically leaped from his bag, its face now bearing an expression of such profound revelation that Marcus felt compelled to place it against the nearest pipe. <words>224</words>

The resonance peaked, and in that moment, stories began to manifest – not just words, but actual scenes playing out in the air around him: lives yet to be lived, deaths yet to be died, all spinning out in gossamer threads of possibility. <words>270</words>

His rebellious craft had always been about capturing the essence of the living before they passed, but here, in this impossible space between the giant's books, he watched as the mask conducted an orchestra of human potential through the pipes. <words>314</words>

Time seemed to fracture as the stories swirled around him, each one a perfect obituary for a life still in progress, each one changing and shifting like the mask's expressions, guided by the deep vibrations of the organ. <words>356</words>

In his feverish state of clarity, Marcus realized he wasn't just writing endings anymore – he was conducting the symphony of lives in progress, using the mask as his score and the organ's hum as his orchestra, while revolution brewed below like a drumbeat to his composition. <words>406</words>

As he worked through the night, the mask's expressions flowed like liquid poetry, and Marcus knew he had found what he'd been seeking: not just the preservation of stories, but their living, breathing manifestation, captured in the space between what was and what could be. <words>456</words>
