Miranda oscillated between the apple trees, her pressed penny collection jingling softly in her coat pocket as she dodged the marble sentinels' unwavering gaze. <words>27</words>

As a vivid dreamer who'd spent years mapping the moon paths that crisscrossed this enchanted orchard, she knew exactly how to slip through the statues' blind spots while maintaining an air of rational mischief. <words>71</words>

The living statues, she'd discovered, were rather poor guardians when it came to the phases of the moon – their stone eyes could only track straight lines, never the curved trajectories of lunar light that painted secret pathways through the twisted branches. <words>127</words>

Tonight's mission felt particularly weighty, as the words of apology she needed to deliver to her sister still sat unspoken on her tongue, but the cosmic deception she'd uncovered in her dreams demanded immediate attention. <words>177</words>

Each pressed penny in her collection corresponded to a different constellation, and she'd finally realized why the patient guardian of the orchard – that ancient stone figure at its heart – had been collecting them from visitors for centuries. <words>234</words>

With dour amusement, Miranda noted how the universe's greatest practical joke had been hidden in plain sight: each pressed penny was actually a key, imprinted with the true names of stars, while every constellation map ever drawn was deliberately wrong. <words>297</words>

The guardian had been waiting for someone like her, someone who could both dream true and think sideways, to finally understand that humanity's entire conception of the night sky was an elaborate misdirection. <words>347</words>

As she approached the central statue, Miranda felt the weight of her sister's hurt competing with the magnitude of her discovery – perhaps the same force that bent moonlight through the orchard had also twisted their relationship into its current painful shape. <words>409</words>

With a wry smile, she placed her penny collection at the guardian's feet, knowing that once the true star patterns were revealed, she could finally find the right words to heal both the cosmic and personal rifts she straddled. <words>465</words>

The stone guardian's eyes flickered with ancient starlight as Miranda began to unravel the universe's oldest deception, her sister's forgiveness and the truth of the heavens somehow woven into the same solution. <words>508</words>
