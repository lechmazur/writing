The unsteady sentinel swayed at his post in the derelict docking bay, watching the strange automaton bird piece together fragments of ancient correspondence with its brass beak. <words>27</words>

Through the viewport, he could see two planetary bodies drawing inexorably closer, their atmospheres already beginning to mingle in swirling, toxic patterns. <words>48</words>

The sentinel's coyly furious demeanor masked a deeper desperation as he observed the mechanical creature methodically reassembling the prophecy he had torn apart decades ago in a fit of denial. <words>76</words>

"I recommend you hurry," he whispered to the automaton, his voice echoing through the abandoned space freighter's cavernous hold, where twisted metal and forgotten cargo created shadows that seemed to pulse with each gravitational wave from the impending collision. <words>110</words>

The bird's ruby eyes flickered as it matched torn edges with impossible precision, revealing words that had haunted the sentinel since his assignment to this forsaken post: "When worlds merge, truth emerges from scattered fragments, and the guardian's vigil ends." <words>143</words>

Each reconstructed letter seemed to burn with an otherworldly glow, casting an eerie luminescence across the sentinel's weathered face as he finally understood why he had been stationed here, alone, for all these years. <words>174</words>

The prophecy had never been about preventing the collision – it had been about ensuring he would be here to witness the revelation hidden in these shredded messages, a truth that filled him with a cheerless ecstasy as the pieces aligned. <words>213</words>

As the automaton bird completed its task, the sentinel felt the fog of misunderstanding lift from his mind: he wasn't meant to guard against intruders, but rather to protect this moment of clarity, this precise intersection of time and space where cosmic forces would reveal their purpose. <words>259</words>

The mechanical bird chirped once, a sound like grinding gears, before spreading its bronze wings and dissolving into a shower of sparks that illuminated the final message: "The collision is not an end, but a beginning." <words>296</words>

The sentinel's unsteady legs finally found their strength as he stood straight, watching the worlds above begin their final approach, understanding at last that his decades of solitude had served a greater purpose – to ensure these reconstructed words would survive to guide humanity through the metamorphosis to come. <words>348</words>

As the docking bay began to shudder and break apart, the sentinel smiled, knowing that his vigil had not been in vain – the ambush of fate had been perfectly orchestrated, and he had played his part in the cosmic dance of destruction and rebirth. <words>397</words>

The last thing he saw before the worlds collided was the scattered letters rising from the floor, swirling around him like a constellation of paper stars, each fragment glowing with the promise of a new universe being born from the ashes of the old. <words>445</words></story>
