Dr. Elena Vale adjusted her amber earrings as she watched another lovelorn time traveler's reflection ripple across the sky pool's surface. <words>21</words>

Her specialty was helping those who'd broken hearts across centuries, though she never mentioned how she'd gained such expertise. <words>41</words>

The client today, a restlessly curious physicist named Sarah, had tracked her lover through cloud trails across three different decades, only to discover all paths led to the same crushing revelation. <words>71</words>

"You see," Elena said, her voice carrying the weight of countless similar conversations, "desire has its own gravity – it bends time itself around our deepest wants." <words>97</words>

Sarah's tears fell into the pool, causing temporal ripples that made Elena's reflection zip between past and present versions of herself. <words>120</words>

As a heartbreak counselor, Elena had built her reputation on an uncanny ability to help clients accept the immutable laws of love across timestreams, though few suspected she'd once been the most notorious temporal home-wrecker in history. <words>159</words>

The sky pool, her chosen office since 2157, reflected not just the clouds above but fragments of every possible future – a perfect setting for those who needed to face their own illusions. <words>195</words>

"I thought if I could just find the right moment," Sarah whispered, "I could make him choose me instead." <words>215</words>

Elena touched her earrings – a nervous habit from when they'd been given to her by a Victorian gentleman she'd pursued through decades before understanding the futility of changing love's trajectory. <words>248</words>

"We all cage ourselves in that belief," Elena replied, watching cloud trails dissipate overhead like fading timelines. <words>266</words>

The truth she'd learned, and now helped others accept, was that freedom came not from changing the past but from releasing its hold on the present. <words>295</words>

Sarah's fingers traced patterns in the pool's surface, sending chronological echoes across the water as she struggled with this revelation. <words>316</words>

"How do you let go?" she asked, her voice carrying the same desperate hope Elena had once felt. <words>335</words>

Elena smiled, remembering her own journey from temporal predator to healing guide. <words>348</words>

"By accepting that true freedom isn't found in changing someone else's heart," she said, watching the clouds shift above them, "but in allowing your own heart to beat in its own time." <words>385</words>

As Sarah nodded slowly, Elena saw the familiar transformation begin – the moment when acceptance started to eclipse desire, and the weight of temporal possibilities gave way to the lightness of letting go. <words>424</words>

Above them, the clouds parted, and both women's reflections in the sky pool finally aligned with their present selves, free from the distortions of what-ifs and might-have-beens. <words>456</words>
