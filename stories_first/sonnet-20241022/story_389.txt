The thin-lipped warlock adjusted his perfectly pressed jeans as he descended deeper into the abandoned mine shaft, his formal casualness a stark contrast to the rough-hewn walls. <words>27</words>

Ancient tomes had whispered of a forgotten library hidden within these depths, where discredited medical texts held secrets of optimization that the modern world had dismissed as mere superstition. <words>52</words>

The wooden viking ship figurehead fragment in his messenger bag grew warmer with each step, its carved eye socket glowing with an inner light that seemed to pulse in rhythm with distant drips of groundwater. <words>85</words>

He'd discovered the artifact in a Norwegian flea market, immediately recognizing it as one of the lost pieces of the Bibliotheca Compass â€“ a mystical pathfinder to forbidden knowledge. <words>116</words>

As December's final calendar page curled and blackened in his apartment fireplace miles above, he knew the time had finally come to unlock the library's location. <words>143</words>

The fragment suddenly burst into brilliant blue flames that didn't burn, its light revealing ancient runes carved into what he'd previously thought was just another mining tunnel wall. <words>173</words>

With unwavering certainty that felt oddly disconnected from reality, he traced the runes with trembling fingers, watching as the stone dissolved to reveal rows upon rows of leather-bound books stretching into impossible darkness. <words>210</words>

His colleagues had warned him about the price of consuming knowledge meant to stay buried, but he could already taste the forbidden fruit of ancient wisdom on his tongue. <words>241</words>

The warlock moved through the stacks with precise purpose, pulling volumes of discredited healing arts that promised to optimize human potential beyond mortal limitations. <words>267</words>

Each page he turned released clouds of dust that formed shapes just at the edge of comprehension, whispering secrets that seemed to make perfect sense until he tried to grasp their meaning. <words>301</words>

Time bent strangely around him as he gorged himself on forgotten formulas and condemned cures, his thin lips moving silently as he absorbed knowledge that felt simultaneously profound and nonsensical. <words>335</words>

The viking fragment pulsed with increasing urgency, but he ignored its warning as he discovered a particularly promising text about transcending the barriers between knowledge and reality. <words>368</words>

As he read the final word of the final page, the warlock realized with absolute clarity and total confusion that he had become both the optimization and the thing being optimized, both the seeker and the forbidden knowledge itself. <words>409</words>

The library folded in on itself like origami made of shadows, leaving behind only a thin-lipped smile floating in the darkness of the mine, still perfectly casual despite its formal transformation into something that was neither knowledge nor knower. <words>450</words>
