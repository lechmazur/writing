Marcus folded laundry at midnight, his conventionally rebellious nature evident in the way he precisely creased each sock while wearing a tattered punk jacket adorned with a wilted paper flower. <words>33</words>

The fluorescent lights flickered as an elderly woman shuffled in, her eyes gleaming with an unsettling wisdom that made Marcus pause mid-fold. <words>60</words>

"You're the one who'll bridge the gap," she declared, her weathered fingers tracing glimmering transitions in the air between them, leaving trails of ethereal light that shouldn't exist in a mundane laundromat. <words>91</words>

Before Marcus could protest, the walls of the laundromat dissolved, revealing the towering bookshelves of a giant's study, where ancient tomes stretched endlessly upward and the air smelled of dusty parchment and forgotten prophecies. <words>127</words>

The unlikely prophet – for that's what she was – explained how Marcus had been chosen to unify scattered minds under a single vision, to gather the fragments of humanity's broken dreams that existed in the spaces between scenes of reality. <words>169</words>

"But I've spent my whole life trying to estrange myself from everything normal," Marcus whispered, watching as his paper flower suddenly straightened, its petals regaining their original vibrancy in this impossible place. <words>206</words>

The prophet smiled, her teeth gleaming like stars in a midnight sky, "That's precisely why you're perfect – you understand both conformity and rebellion, the spaces between order and chaos." <words>241</words>

Books began floating around them, their pages fluttering open to reveal moving images of countless lives, all disconnected, all searching for meaning in their own ways. <words>272</words>

"These are the moments between moments," she explained, gesturing to the swirling visions, "where reality holds its breath and possibility blooms like your paper flower – they need someone who can walk between worlds to weave them together." <words>317</words>

Marcus touched one of the floating books, and suddenly he could feel every lonely soul doing laundry at midnight, every dreamer staring at their ceiling, every heart searching for connection in the dark. <words>352</words>

The giant's study began to fade, the familiar hum of washing machines returning, but the prophet's words echoed in his mind as he noticed his paper flower now glowed with a subtle inner light. <words>391</words>

As dawn approached, Marcus finished folding his laundry, each precise movement now feeling like a small act of prophecy, knowing that his ordinary rebellion had become something extraordinary – a bridge between scattered souls in the haunting delight of midnight hours. <words>441</words>
