In the nectar collection facility's highest tower, Madam Thistle arranged her sentient dolls with trembling fingers, each porcelain face watching her with knowing eyes. <words>21</words>

Their tiny whispers guided her through the perpetual twilight that existed before mortals learned to pray, before they knew the gods were listening. <words>42</words>

She gripped her twisted carnival cane, a relic from when reality still wore masks, its spiraling stripes pulsing with ancient magic that helped her uphold the barriers between what was and what could be. <words>71</words>

The dolls began their chorus of healing, their crystalline voices weaving through the sticky-sweet air of the facility, where star-nectar dripped from celestial flowers that bloomed in impossible geometries along the walls. <words>103</words>

Madam Thistle stood expectantly resigned, knowing that tonight's ritual would either shatter everything she'd spent centuries preserving or finally free her from her role as guardian of the in-between. <words>134</words>

Following the star paths that her smallest doll, a one-eyed ballerina, traced in the air with phosphorescent fingers, she began to dance between the collection vats, her cane marking symbols in the condensation that gathered on the copper surfaces. <words>172</words>

The dolls' chorus grew stronger, their song carrying the weight of a thousand unspoken prayers, as Madam Thistle prepared to stride through boundaries once thought sacred – the very walls that separated the realm of collecting pure star-nectar from the chaos of raw creation. <words>215</words>

Each doll represented a different fragment of reality she'd gathered over the millennia: a porcelain shepherd who knew the secret names of cosmic winds, a mechanical geisha who could fold space like origami, a raggedy sailor who had mapped the currents between dreams. <words>263</words>

As the ritual reached its crescendo, the star-nectar began to rise from its vats, forming luminous ribbons that danced around Madam Thistle and her chorus of dolls, their combined purpose burning away the ancient restrictions that had kept the facility's power contained for so long. <words>309</words>

The cane's carnival stripes began to unwind like serpents of light, wrapping around each doll and connecting them in a web of power that pulsed with the rhythm of unborn stars. <words>341</words>

In that moment, as reality's edges began to blur and the dolls' chorus reached impossible harmonies, Madam Thistle finally understood why she'd been chosen as their collector – not to preserve the boundaries, but to know precisely where they needed to be broken. <words>385</words>

The star-nectar facility trembled as the last notes of the chorus pierced the veil between what was permitted and what was possible, and Madam Thistle, surrounded by her beloved dolls, stepped through the threshold of creation itself, their song becoming the first prayer ever whispered in the universe. <words>441</words>
