The apathetic summoner slouched in her recording booth, watching other dreamers' coral memories unfold through matching empty frames hanging in the deserted hall of their shared consciousness. <words>27</words>

She ground her morning beans in her grandmother's rustic coffee grinder, the same one that had helped her stay awake through countless failed attempts to rebuild the world's dying reefs through dream manipulation. <words>71</words>

The river wisdom she'd inherited from her ancestors whispered that even the most enthusiastically lazy person could change the world, if only they found the right current to float upon. <words>108</words>

In the aftermath of the ocean deity's last breath – a moment that had turned all sea water to crystal for one heartbeat – she'd discovered that the collective unconscious held more power than any single god. <words>147</words>

Her method was elegantly simple: gather the dreams of those who remembered living coral, let them cascade through the empty frames like waterfalls of memory, and weave them together into templates for resurrection. <words>186</words>

The other dreamers called her work station "the lazy lotus" because she never seemed to move, just drifted there with her coffee, but none of them understood that stillness was essential to holding the delicate patterns of reef dreams together. <words>237</words>

Each night, more frames filled with luminous recollections: a child's first glimpse of a clownfish darting through anemones, a diver's wonder at purple-tipped staghorn colonies, an old fisherman's grief over bleached skeletal remains. <words>284</words>

She sifted through these memories with gentle sharpness, discarding the clouded ones, preserving the pure moments of connection between humans and coral life. <words>314</words>

The summoner's apparent apathy was merely the surface tension of a deep pool of concentration; beneath it, she worked tirelessly, matching dream to dream, building a blueprint of revival from humanity's shared remembrance. <words>359</words>

When the last frame finally filled with light, she lifted her coffee cup to her lips and smiled – the pattern was complete, and somewhere in the physical world, the first polyps of new coral were already beginning to grow, nourished by the dreams she'd gathered. <words>421</words>

The empty frames would soon fill again with new memories, but for now, she allowed herself to be enthusiastically lazy, watching the dream-light dance across the studio walls like sunlight through clear waters. <words>464</words>
