The frail guard traced his fingers over the latest message carved into the gnarled oak, the only tree standing sentinel on the tidal island's highest point. <words>27</words>

Each day brought new cuts in the bark, secret communications from the mainland rebels who knew he watched this lonely outpost with resolutely wavering loyalty. <words>49</words>

In his pocket, the sour-smelling alchemy phial weighed heavily – a potion that would either grant him freedom or seal his fate, depending on which side's claims were true. <words>76</words>

The sorting had begun months ago, when the Kingdom started dividing its citizens based on painted allegiances: blue marks for the crown's devoted servants, red for suspected dissidents, and gray for those still under evaluation. <words>109</words>

He'd received his gray mark with both relief and dread, knowing it bought him time but also meant closer scrutiny from both sides as they tried to claim him for their cause. <words>140</words>

Tonight's message was different – not just intelligence about troop movements or propaganda, but a real chance to choose his own path. <words>163</words>

The tide was rising, slowly swallowing the causeway that connected his lonely post to the mainland, and with it came the moment of decision he'd both craved and feared. <words>195</words>

His trembling hands yanked the cork from the phial as he read the final words carved into the oak: "Drink to reveal your true colors." <words>221</words>

The sorting ceremony would end tomorrow, and all gray marks would be permanently converted to either blue or red, binding their bearers to a predetermined fate he desperately wished to escape. <words>254</words>

The guard's reflection wavered in the tide pools gathering around his feet, his gray mark seeming to pulse in the fading light. <words>278</words>

With a bitter smile, he poured the potion into the rising water instead of drinking it, watching as it created swirling patterns of both red and blue before dissolving into nothing. <words>309</words>

As darkness fell, he carved his own message into the oak: "Some colors cannot be sorted." <words>326</words>

When they found his post abandoned the next morning, they discovered only his uniform, painted with stripes of every color imaginable, hanging from the old oak's branches. <words>357</words>

Some say on quiet nights, when the tide is just right, you can still see a figure walking the ever-changing line between sea and shore, belonging to neither land nor water – the guard who chose to paint his own path. <words>401</words>
