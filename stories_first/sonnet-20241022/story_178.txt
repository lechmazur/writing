Marcus adjusted his pressure suit's oxygen gauge as he filed specimens in the Nautilus Greenhouse, his clerk's mindset making even this otherworldly task feel mundane. <words>27</words>

The bioluminescent coral outside cast shifting shadows through the reinforced windows, making his prized stamp collection, displayed in waterproof cases along his workstation, shimmer with an almost supernatural quality. <words>71</words>

He'd brought the stamps down here six months ago, when he'd first discovered that certain vintage postmarks contained mathematical patterns that seemed to quantize reality itself – tiny windows into parallel dimensions. <words>116</words>

During tonight's research facility trivia night, between questions about marine biology and deep-sea pressure gradients, Marcus had finally understood that the stamps' patterns matched the genetic sequences of the coral plague destroying reefs worldwide. <words>164</words>

Each dimension he glimpsed through the stamps showed slightly different versions of the plague's progression – some worlds where the coral thrived, others where it had completely collapsed – making truth itself feel absolutely relative. <words>214</words>

In the space between heartbeats, as he held a particularly rare 1922 Prussian Blue under his microscope, Marcus felt reality ripple like the water outside his window. <words>247</words>

The stamp's intricate patterns began weaving between worlds, showing him glimpses of alternate undersea laboratories where other versions of himself had found different approaches to fighting the coral plague. <words>290</words>

In one reality, he saw the cure; in another, total devastation; the dissonant calm of the greenhouse only amplified the weight of what he was witnessing. <words>324</words>

His hands trembled as he carefully documented each dimensional variant, knowing that somewhere in this quantum philately lay the key to saving their world's coral – and by extension, the entire marine ecosystem. <words>372</words>

As the trivia night's final buzzer echoed through the facility's corridors, Marcus realized that his mundane job of cataloging and filing had uniquely prepared him for this moment – organizing the multiverse's secrets into a coherent cure. <words>424</words>

In the ephemeral pause of a breath, surrounded by the gentle sway of sea fans and the soft glow of his dimensional stamps, Marcus finally understood why he'd been drawn to both collecting and clerking – he was meant to be an archivist of realities. <words>483</words>
