Marcus shuffled through the witch's incantation chamber, his morning walks having become an odd ritual of self-imposed penance. <words>19</words>

The chipped bowl in his hands contained ashes from a thousand funeral programs - the remnants of his years spent selling fabricated family histories to desperate clients. <words>42</words>

As the city's most notorious black market genealogist, he had mastered the art of weaving elaborate ancestries by analyzing the subtext in funeral eulogies, finding the spaces between truth and desire where his lies could flourish. <words>71</words>

"You're atypically typical for a fraud," the witch had told him last week, her eyes gleaming with something between amusement and judgment as she prescribed his daily dawn pilgrimages to her chamber. <words>100</words>

The morning light would zoom through her stained glass windows, casting prismatic shadows that danced across his face as he contemplated each falsified lineage he'd sold. <words>127</words>

Today felt different though - the weight of the bowl seemed lighter, and the witch's countless bottles and herbs appeared to lean toward him like curious spectators. <words>153</words>

"Pour the ashes into the scrying pool," she commanded from her perch among the rafters, her voice carrying that familiar blend of brazen modesty that suggested she knew exactly how powerful she was but chose to downplay it. <words>190</words>

As Marcus tipped the bowl, memories swirled with the ashes: the widow who wanted royal ancestry, the orphan seeking any connection to his past, the dying man desperate to leave a legacy - each false history he'd crafted had seemed like mercy at the time. <words>234</words>

The witch's incantations grew louder, and the ashes began to form patterns in the pool - family trees sprouting and withering, bloodlines interweaving and dissolving, until finally, his own true ancestry emerged. <words>270</words>

"Your gift for understanding human longing wasn't meant for deception," the witch said softly, descending to stand beside him. <words>289</words>

"You're standing on the brink of renewal, Marcus - your talent for reading between the lines of loss and love could help people find their authentic stories, not false ones." <words>321</words>

The revelation hit him like a ray of sunlight through the chamber's dusty air: he could become a different kind of genealogist, one who helped people embrace their real histories rather than flee from them. <words>359</words>

As the morning light strengthened, Marcus watched the last of the ashes dissolve in the pool, each disappearing mote carrying away a fraction of his guilt. <words>387</words>

"The path to self-forgiveness," the witch mused, taking the chipped bowl from his trembling hands, "often begins when we stop trying to rewrite the past and start helping others read it more clearly." <words>422</words>

Marcus nodded, finally understanding that his morning walks to the witch's chamber hadn't been punishment but preparation for a new chapter in his story. <words>447</words>
