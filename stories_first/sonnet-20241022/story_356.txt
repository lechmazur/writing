The caretaker of the SS Nostalgia traced cloud patterns through the cargo hold's viewport, her wry smile reflecting off the glass as nebulae drifted by like cosmic chalk dust. <words>33</words>

She maintained a warmly aloof relationship with the contraband timepieces stacked in crates around her, each one ticking away someone else's stolen moments. <words>60</words>

"Time isn't meant to be hoarded," she would tell the space pirates who employed her, though they never seemed to understand why she spent her shifts tracking the paths of stellar clouds instead of counting their chronological loot. <words>95</words>

The ancient phone in her pocket – her last connection to Earth's measured minutes – finally gave up its dial tone with a whimper, and she felt something unlock inside her chest. <words>127</words>

She pulled a piece of chalk from her coveralls, the same chalk she'd used for years to mark inspection dates on the crates, and began drawing constellations on the metal floor. <words>159</words>

The "what if" sirens that had haunted her since she'd left Earth – what if she'd stayed, what if she'd chosen differently, what if time itself was just another commodity to be bought and sold – grew fainter with each stroke of calcium carbonate against steel. <words>207</words>

Her drawings grew more intricate as the clouds outside shifted, their cosmic dance revealing patterns that spoke of time's true nature: not a line to be measured, but a wave to be ridden. <words>245</words>

The chalk clicked against the floor one final time as she completed her masterpiece: a map of temporal currents that flowed through space like rivers of light. <words>276</words>

With gentle harshness, she crushed the remaining chalk beneath her boot, letting the dust scatter across her star chart like the remnants of old certainties. <words>303</words>

The pirates would find the cargo hold empty the next morning, the timepieces still locked away but their caretaker gone, having finally understood that the only way to silence the endless questioning was to vanish into time's embrace. <words>348</words>

They would discover her chart, chalk dust swimming in shaft of starlight, but none would recognize it for what it was: a blueprint for letting go, drawn in the language of drifting clouds and fading dial tones. <words>391</words>

Years later, new crew members would whisper about the ghost who sometimes appears in the cargo hold, tracking patterns only she can see, her knowing smile both present and absent – like time itself. <words>428</words></story>
