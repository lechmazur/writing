In the creaking treehouse library, where ancient books gathered dust and memories went to fade, Marcus counted his stolen dreams for the thousandth time, though numbers had never been his friend. <words>33</words>

The flimsy photo album in his lap contained fragments of himself – pieces he'd extracted from others' minds during his criminal years – each one a glossy snapshot of possibilities that were never his to claim. <words>71</words>

He recognized the recurring theme in every stolen reverie: baseball diamonds gleaming under summer suns, the crack of bats, and the roar of phantom crowds that now existed only in the collective unconscious of a dying humanity. <words>116</words>

Since the birth of Luna, officially recorded as humanity's final child, Marcus had felt an urgent need to reconstruct himself from these borrowed pieces, to somehow summon the energy of life back into a world growing quieter by the day. <words>164</words>

His fingers trembled as he traced the faces in the photos – strangers whose dreams he'd plunged into and emerged from with these precious mental souvenirs, all of them sharing his desperate love for a sport that now existed only in memories. <words>214</words>

The library's wooden walls seemed to pulse with his mounting obsession as he arranged and rearranged the photos, trying to mathematically decode a pattern that would make him whole again, muttering calculations that never quite added up. <words>263</words>

Outside, the perpetually gray sky mocked his efforts to recreate the electric atmosphere of those long-gone baseball games, but Marcus knew that if he could just align these fragments perfectly – these stolen moments of joy and triumph – he might generate enough psychic energy to spark thunder in the empty heavens. <words>324</words>

Each stolen dream-photo contained a spark of that old magic: the perfect curve ball, the game-winning home run, the unexpected double play that turned the tide – pieces of other people's baseball glory that he'd collected like rare trading cards. <words>377</words>

As darkness crept through the treehouse windows, Marcus continued his quiet, manic assembly of the fragments, certain that when he finally solved this impossible puzzle of stolen memories and borrowed passion, the sky would remember how to roar with the same intensity as a stadium full of fans. <words>434</words>

The last human child would never know the crack of a bat or the thrill of a ninth-inning rally, but Marcus, fractured and incomplete as he was, would not rest until he could summon back the thunder of humanity's favorite pastime, even if only in echoes and dreams. <words>495</words>
