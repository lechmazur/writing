Marcus stood at his post in the lighthouse keeper's bedroom, his weathered hands clutching a frayed piece of rope as he crossed off the last name from his list of dance students. <words>33</words>

As the lighthouse sentinel, his dry commentary on the foolishness of teaching traditional Romanian folk dancing in a haunted bedroom had earned him quite a reputation among the locals. <words>65</words>

The ghost of the former keeper, Madame Vasilescu, had initially terrified him, until they discovered their shared passion for the precise footwork and spinning movements of the hora dance. <words>100</words>

"It's certainly possible," he'd told his skeptical supervisor, "that confiscating my dance students' modern devices before lessons actually helps them connect with the traditional methods." <words>134</words>

The rope in his hands – once part of the lighthouse's warning bell system – now served as a training tool, helping students maintain proper distance during the circular formations. <words>169</words>

Each evening, as the maritime fog rolled in, Marcus would watch his promises to maintain the lighthouse's dignity slowly erode, while Madame Vasilescu's spectral form twirled through the ancient steps with reckless abandon. <words>210</words>

Tonight was different; with the final name crossed off, he had successfully taught every interested soul in the coastal village the traditional movements that had once saved his own life during that strange storm five years ago. <words>255</words>

The ghost appeared right on schedule, her translucent form casting no shadow in the lantern light, and Marcus felt the familiar pull of their peculiar arrangement. <words>289</words>

"They all think I'm mad," he muttered, taking his position across from her, "teaching dance in a haunted lighthouse instead of simply keeping watch." <words>319</words>

Madame Vasilescu's ethereal laugh echoed off the worn floorboards as they began their nightly ritual, their movements perfectly synchronized through years of practice. <words>349</words>

The rope swayed gently from its hook on the wall, marking time like a metronome as they danced, keeper and ghost, guardian and teacher, bound by their devotion to preservation of something ancient and vital. <words>390</words>

As the night deepened and their dance continued, Marcus realized that some promises, like the ones made to the dead, couldn't erode – they only grew stronger with each precise step and every shared moment in this haunted room above the sea. <words>441</words>
