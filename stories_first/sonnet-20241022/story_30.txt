Captain Zara Lin rolled the ancient bone dice between her fingers, letting her telekinetic gift warm them as ancestral whispers filled the navigation room of her commandeered vessel. <words>27</words>

The fragment of medieval tapestry floating in its preservation field beside her navigation console depicted dragons breathing golden flames across forgotten fields, their scales annotated with scripts no modern scholar could read. <words>71</words>

"Every dead language holds the key to lost agricultural wisdom," her grandmother had taught her, while they planted the traditional family oak for Zara's birth, just as they had done for generations, even after leaving Earth. <words>116</words>

The dice clattered across her star charts as she channeled her power, each face inscribed with symbols from civilizations that had mastered sustainable farming across a thousand worlds before vanishing into cosmic dust. <words>164</words>

Her latest mark, a notorious collector of forbidden artifacts, had wagered the tapestry fragment against her ship in a game of chance, never suspecting her ability to guide the dice's fall while her crew waited in the shadows of nearby asteroids. <words>218</words>

The ancient fabric's hidden text, when combined with similar fragments scattered across the galaxy, would reveal cultivation methods that could save dozens of failing colony worlds – if she could decode it in time. <words>267</words>

Flames from the nearby sun cast prismatic shadows through the viewports as Zara traced the dragon's sinuous form with trembling fingers, recognizing in its curves the same patterns her family had used to plant their memorial trees, a mathematical sequence as old as photosynthesis itself. <words>328</words>

"Practical solutions wrapped in mystical packaging," she murmured, her grandmother's favorite saying taking on new meaning as she realized the dragons weren't breathing fire – they were seeding clouds with mineral-rich plasma, an agricultural technique lost to time. <words>380</words>

The dice grew warm in her palm as she prepared for one final throw, knowing that each roll brought her closer to preserving not just farming knowledge, but the sacred disorder of life itself, hidden in plain sight among the stars. <words>434</words>

Her ship's sensors detected the collector's vessel approaching, and Zara smiled, understanding that some traditions – like her family's trees, her loaded dice, and the ancient wisdom she sought – were meant to be kept alive through whatever means necessary. <words>485</words>
