In the sprawling treehouse metropolis of Nueva Altura, where ancient kapok trees cradled entire neighborhoods in their branches, Magdalena Santos strutted across rope bridges with her prized possession - a wizard's grimoire she'd "borrowed" from her rival. <words>39</words>

As the city's youngest exorcist at twenty-three, she felt she had something to prove, especially with her former mentor's shadow constantly looming over her reputation. <words>65</words>

"Who needs traditional banishing methods when you've got forbidden magic?" she muttered, flipping through the battered pages while balancing precariously on a swaying walkway. <words>89</words>

The humid Amazon air made the grimoire's pages stick together, but Magdalena's feisty determination wouldn't let a little tropical weather stop her from finding the perfect spell to outshine her mentor's latest exorcism record. <words>124</words>

Just as she located a promising youthification ritual - one that could theoretically make spirits so young they'd cease to exist - the familiar path to her usual exorcism grounds suddenly collapsed, sending wooden planks tumbling into the misty canopy below. <words>164</words>

"Universe," she smirked, "if you're trying to tell me this is a bad idea, you really don't know me at all." <words>185</words>

Time seemed to stutter, like a clock skipping a beat, as she began reciting the incantation, her voice carrying through the verdant labyrinth of elevated streets and hanging gardens. <words>216</words>

The spell worked - sort of - transforming not just the troublesome spirit she'd been hired to banish, but accidentally youthifying half the neighborhood's spectral residents into giggling ghost babies. <words>244</words>

As ethereal toddlers floated past her, playing spectral peek-a-boo with bewildered citizens, Magdalena couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of her situation while simultaneously calculating how to fix it before word reached her mentor. <words>280</words>

"Well," she sighed, watching a phantom infant attempt to eat a spiritual rattle, "at least they're not possessing anyone anymore." <words>301</words>

The weight of responsibility settled on her shoulders like a heavy cloak as she realized she'd have to admit her mistake and ask for help - but first, she took a moment to appreciate how the ghost babies had formed a floating conga line above the city's highest platforms. <words>352</words>

Three days, fourteen reversed spells, and one very awkward conversation with her mentor later, Magdalena had restored all spirits to their proper ages and learned a valuable lesson about rushing to prove herself - though she kept the grimoire, just in case. <words>397</words>

After all, she reasoned while sipping coconut water in her treehouse office, sometimes the best way to step out of a shadow is to create your own light, even if that light occasionally comes from accidentally created phosphorescent ghost babies. <words>441</words></story>
