Sister Elena's hands trembled as she arranged pressed wildflowers across the control panel of the abandoned satellite, each dried petal a reminder of the Earth she'd left behind to perform this most unusual exorcism. <words>37</words>

The demon had taken residence in humanity's orbital graveyard, nesting in defunct communications arrays and twisted solar panels like a cosmic parasite feeding on forgotten frequencies and dead dreams. <words>71</words>

As she assembled the toy spacecraft her grandmother had left her—the last piece of a puzzle that had spanned three generations of family deceit—Elena fought against the familiar tightness in her throat that came whenever she had to perform in front of others, even if those others were only the ghost-white astronaut suits drifting lifelessly outside the viewport. <words>134</words>

The inheritance of lies had led her here: her grandmother's stories of being a simple toymaker, her mother's claims of mental illness, all masking the truth that they had been guardians, keeping watch over this thing that had fallen from the stars. <words>181</words>

She submerged her consciousness in the ritual words, letting them flow through her like static, waiting for the precise moment when the demon would reveal itself. <words>214</words>

The toy spacecraft in her hands clicked into its final configuration, and the sound—like an ancient key turning in a celestial lock—echoed through the dead satellite's chamber. <words>247</words>

In the defiant hush that followed, Elena watched as the pressed wildflowers began to glow, each one illuminating with the same otherworldly light that had haunted her family's dreams for generations. <words>285</words>

The demon emerged from the debris field, a writhing mass of darkness and stolen signals, but Elena stood her ground, no longer the shy exorcist who couldn't speak before a crowd, but the culmination of her lineage's secret purpose. <words>334</words>

This was her moment to sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never"—never tell, never acknowledge, never face the truth—as she raised her grandmother's toy spacecraft, now humming with power that had nothing to do with batteries or circuits. <words>382</words>

In the vacuum of space, surrounded by humanity's discarded dreams and forgotten satellites, Sister Elena performed the exorcism that would cleanse not only this orbital graveyard but also her family's legacy, her voice carrying across the cosmos with the strength of three generations of hidden knowledge finally set free. <words>447</words>
