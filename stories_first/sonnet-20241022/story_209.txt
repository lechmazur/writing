The seasoned woodsman traced his fingers along the antique hairbrush, its tarnished silver catching the strange light that pulsed through the radio wave garden. <words>24</words>

He'd found the brush among the twisted antenna arrays, its bristles still holding strands of his late wife's auburn hair from that last morning in the hospital, when the monitor's final beep had torn his world apart. <words>65</words>

Now he wandered through this artfully messy collection of receivers and transmitters, using the brush's metal back to measure the echo in an abandoned water tower, desperately trying to map the forgotten railway lines that had once connected him to her. <words>116</words>

Each ping against the tower's rusty walls sent back coordinates he carefully recorded, while the garden's ethereal frequencies made his instruments short-circuit in unpredictable patterns that somehow matched his scattered thoughts. <words>159</words>

"I know you're not really out there," he whispered to the humming air, and for the first time since her death, he felt the weight of truth free something inside his chest. <words>195</words>

The radio waves seemed to dance around him as he admitted what he'd known all along – that his elaborate system of measuring echoes and tracking phantom trains was just his grief speaking in the language of desperation and denial. <words>245</words>

Yet there was a strange comfort in finally being honest, in acknowledging that all his precise measurements and careful calculations were really just ways to stay connected to the memory of her sitting on their porch, brushing her hair in the evening light. <words>300</words>

He slumped against the water tower's base, clutching the hairbrush to his chest, and let out a laugh that carried both joy and sorrow – joy for the love they'd shared, and sorrow for accepting its end. <words>347</words>

The garden's signals pulsed with newfound clarity as he stood, finally ready to leave behind his maps of railways that led nowhere and his measurements of echoes that held no answers. <words>389</words>

With one last look at the brush, he placed it gently among the antenna array, a silver tribute to both truth and memory, before walking away from the garden where grief had taught him that sometimes the most important discoveries come not from measuring echoes, but from listening to your heart. <words>452</words>
