The tuneless bard slouched against the brass-fitted windows of the airship's dining room, his fiercely nonchalant posture betraying years of practiced indifference. <words>27</words>

He clutched a stained manuscript in trembling fingers, watching the assembled aristocrats nibble their mechanical canapés between poetry readings. <words>46</words>

The legends of his peculiar talent had spread through twisted word-of-mouth across the floating cities – they said he could tame chaos itself through deliberately awful verses. <words>71</words>

"Next up," announced the automaton master of ceremonies, steam hissing from its brass joints, "the infamous Bartholomew Blank and his renowned anti-poetry." <words>93</words>

The bard approached the podium, accidentally-on-purpose knocking over a champagne tower while fishing a tinderbox from his threadbare coat. <words>113</words>

He'd learned long ago that the universe's entropy could be temporarily contained by performances so magnificently horrible that reality itself recoiled in embarrassment. <words>137</words>

As he lit the ceremonial reading candle, the ship's engines sputtered and groaned – the chaos that plagued their world was gathering, threatening to tear apart the delicate machinery keeping them aloft. <words>170</words>

"My latest piece," he mumbled, "is called 'Ode to a Partially Rusted Sprocket in Precisely Seventeen Syllables and Three Metaphysical Mistakes.'" <words>195</words>

The audience cringed appropriately as he began his intentionally discordant recitation, each mangled metaphor and tortured rhyme acting as a net to catch the wild entropy swirling around them. <words>228</words>

Through the windows, they could see the storm of chaos dissipating, even as his words grew more magnificently awful, pushing the boundaries of sense and sensibility toward that sweet horizon of madness he so desperately sought to kiss. <words>270</words>

Some said he'd once been a proper poet before discovering his true calling – that his deliberate descent into artistic mediocrity was the greatest sacrifice a performer could make. <words>301</words>

Others whispered that he'd never had talent to begin with and had simply stumbled upon a way to weaponize his inadequacy for the greater good. <words>329</words>

As he finished his final verse, comparing a gear's teeth to "the dreams of clockwork butterflies drowning in mechanical honey," the ship's engines purred contentedly, order temporarily restored. <words>359</words>

The bard bowed with exaggerated humility, secretly proud of how perfectly terrible his performance had been, and shuffled back to his corner while the aristocrats applauded with equal parts relief and revulsion. <words>397</words>

He tucked the manuscript back into his coat, already composing his next atrocity in his head, knowing that sometimes the most brazen act of heroism was to be magnificently, purposefully, and precisely bad at exactly the right moment. <words>441</words>
