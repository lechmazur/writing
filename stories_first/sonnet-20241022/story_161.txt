Marcus Chen, the most vigilant orchardist in the valley, had never been late to anything in his life – not even to discover the truth about his sister's suspicious death at the experimental paper airplane facility where she'd volunteered. <words>39</words>

He'd spent months volunteering at the same facility, meticulously cataloging every detail while maintaining his carefully crafted facade of enthusiastic incompetence. <words>63</words>

The breakthrough came when he noticed how the test flight patterns mimicked the precise arrangement of eyes in a peacock's tail – the same bird his sister had obsessively sketched in her final days. <words>95</words>

Using his grandfather's antique letter seal as a makeshift decoder, Marcus demonstrated to himself how each circular impression, when overlaid on his sister's drawings, revealed coordinates to classified testing zones. <words>127</words>

"Fascinating how they hide military drone protocols in plain sight," he muttered with sardonic glee, watching another batch of "paper" airplanes slice through the facility's cavernous testing chamber. <words>157</words>

The conspiracy had begun unraveling the moment he'd recognized that the facility's supposedly innocent origami experiments were actually testing microscopic metallic compounds disguised as paper. <words>186</words>

His years of analyzing growth patterns in his orchard had trained him to spot the unnatural symmetry in these flights – no paper airplane could maintain such perfect trajectories without hidden propulsion systems. <words>219</words>

Each morning, he'd arrive precisely on schedule, cheerfully folding planes while secretly documenting every test, knowing his sister must have discovered the same truth before her "accident." <words>247</words>

The facility's director had made one crucial mistake: assuming that a simple orchardist wouldn't recognize the mathematical precision required to maintain such complex flight patterns. <words>273</words>

Marcus's sister had left him one final clue – a peacock feather pressed between the pages of her journal, its eye pattern deliberately altered to match the facility's test flight sequences. <words>306</words>

As he assembled his evidence, Marcus maintained his punctual schedule and pleasant demeanor, even as his heart raced with the thrill of imminent vindication. <words>333</words>

The truth would emerge not through confrontation, but through the methodical documentation of flight patterns that proved these weren't just paper airplane tests, but something far more sinister. <words>367</words>

His sister's death would not be in vain – her final message, hidden in those peacock patterns, would demonstrate exactly how deep this conspiracy ran. <words>395</words>

And as Marcus prepared to release his findings to the press, he allowed himself a moment of grim satisfaction, knowing that his reputation for reliability and perfect timing would make his revelations impossible to dismiss. <words>436</words>
