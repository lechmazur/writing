The prophet Miranda stood in her cramped lunar quarters, rolling a cracked marble between her fingers as she contemplated her latest vision with characteristic uncertainty. <words>27</words>

Her collection of damaged marbles, gathered from the colony's recycling bins, caught the artificial light like frozen tears as she arranged them in patterns that might reveal the future. <words>71</words>

In the midst of her divination, she'd discovered an ancient jigsaw puzzle at the monthly colony rummage sale, its edges worn smooth by countless hands on Earth. <words>116</words>

The pieces seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy that matched the rhythm between her heartbeats, where all her prophecies lived. <words>143</words>

Miranda knew, with a mixture of pride and embarrassment, that she alone could defragment the universal constants using these humble tools. <words>169</words>

As she worked, fitting puzzle pieces between the marbles, she felt the familiar bittersweet joy of one who glimpses both humanity's triumph and folly in the same moment. <words>214</words>

The mining colony's generators hummed beneath her feet, harvesting helium-3 from the lunar soil, while above her head, the cosmic scoreboard of humanity's achievements and failures hung like a weight. <words>263</words>

With trembling fingers, she placed the final marble – the most deeply cracked one – into the center of her completed puzzle pattern, and spoke her last oath with a voice that wavered between confidence and doubt. <words>315</words>

"By these broken spheres and scattered edges, I unmake the tallies of our species," she whispered, knowing her words would ripple through space-time with both magnificent and terrible consequences. <words>359</words>

The marbles began to spin, the puzzle pieces rose into the air, and in that eternal space between one heartbeat and the next, Miranda rewrote the cosmic ledger, erasing humanity's debts and glories alike with equal measures of mercy and mischief. <words>428</words>

As the dust settled in her quarters, she allowed herself a small, knowing smile – the smile of someone who had both saved and complicated the world, and wasn't entirely sure which had been the right thing to do. <words>478</words>
