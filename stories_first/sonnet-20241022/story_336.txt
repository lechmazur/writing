The undertaker Mahmoud traced his fingers along the astronomical clock's brass meridians, his shoulders heavy with generations of deathwork in this reimagined Persian palace-turned-mortuary. <words>27</words>

Ancient tribal knowledge whispered through his bloodline that souls could be imprisoned by following sun paths across the great mechanism, a rarely practical pursuit that his ancestors nevertheless swore by. <words>52</words>

When the car backfired in the empty street outside, shattering the pre-dawn silence, Mahmoud seized the moment of disruption to begin the ritual his grandmother had taught him in whispered verses. <words>82</words>

His calloused hands moved with placid ferocity across the clock's intricate face, following the arc of Venus as it crossed the House of Death, seeking desperately to capture his daughter's fleeing spirit before it could slip beyond the veil. <words>120</words>

The palace's restored chambers, with their LED-lit mirror mosaics reflecting infinitely into the dark, seemed to pulse with each tick of the astronomical gears, marking time's relentless march away from the moment of her last breath. <words>159</words>

He had prepared countless bodies in these halls, but never had he imagined preparing his child's, and as his fingers traced the celestial paths encoded in brass and gold, he clung to the hope that this ancient art might grant him one last chance to say goodbye. <words>208</words>

The constellations carved into the ceiling seemed to swim in his tear-blurred vision as he worked, their patterns matching the intricate movements his hands made across the clock's face, weaving together modern grief and ancient ways. <words>245</words>

In the absolute darkness of his despair, each constellation clicked into place, each gear turned true, until finally, impossibly, a whisper of warmth brushed his cheek like a familiar kiss. <words>276</words>

The clock's mechanisms hummed with an otherworldly resonance as starlight pooled in its center, and for one breathless moment, Mahmoud saw his daughter's reflection in its polished surface, her smile as bright as he remembered. <words>314</words>

Though he knew the vision would fade with the coming dawn, this glimpse was enough â€“ proof that some impractical magics still worked, that hope could be found even in death's shadow, that love could transcend the barriers between worlds through the turning of ancient gears and the wisdom of ages. <words>373</words>

As morning light crept through the palace's geometric windows, casting rainbow patterns across the floor, Mahmoud finally stepped back from the clock, his heart lighter despite his grief, knowing that some souls could never truly be lost if one knew the proper paths to follow. <words>424</words>
