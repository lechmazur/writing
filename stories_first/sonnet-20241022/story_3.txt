The surly watchman paced between weathered headstones in the sailor's graveyard, a short piece of yarn wound tightly around his gnarled fingers. <words>21</words>

In that liminal time between autumn and winter, when the veil between worlds grew thin, he practiced the ancient art of thread-reading his grandmother had taught him decades ago. <words>45</words>

Each night, as fog rolled in from the harbor, he would knot and unknot the yarn in intricate patterns, his movements serenely frantic as he sought to decode the messages hidden in the threads. <words>73</words>

"When the string speaks, the markets whisper," his grandmother had told him, her own fingers dancing with yarn as she predicted the rise and fall of trading ships that would never return to port. <words>103</words>

Tonight, the watchman felt particularly close to understanding the cosmic patterns that governed both the wool in his hands and the endless cycle of commerce that flowed through the harbor below. <words>134</words>

He muttered ancient riddles as he worked – "What binds the dead to gold, yet flows like water through merchants' hands?" – his voice carrying across the dignified chaos of tilted tombstones and salt-weathered angels. <words>168</words>

The answer, he knew, lay in the way the yarn twisted, in how the fog wrapped around the graves, in how the moon pulled at both tide and trade with equal gravity. <words>200</words>

Other watchmen mocked his nightly ritual, but they hadn't seen what he had: the perfect correlation between his grandmother's knots and the fortune of ships, between simple wool patterns and the complex dance of supply and demand. <words>237</words>

As his fingers worked the yarn with practiced precision, he felt the familiar tingle that preceded market wisdom – that moment when the universe's grand design revealed itself through the humble medium of twisted fiber. <words>272</words>

A ship's bell tolled in the distance, and the watchman smiled grimly as the yarn formed the pattern he'd been waiting for – the same one his grandmother had shown him on the night she passed, the one that foretold both prosperity and doom. <words>315</words>

He carefully tucked the yarn into his coat pocket, knowing that tomorrow's traders would dismiss his warnings as the ramblings of a cemetery keeper, yet the pattern never lied – it spoke of storms and shipwrecks, of fortunes lost and found. <words>359</words>

In the end, he understood that his role was not to prevent the inevitable but to witness it, to maintain the delicate balance between commerce and fate, between the living harbor below and the dead sailors who watched from their eternal rest. <words>406</words>

The yarn had spoken its truth, and now he would return to his rounds, guardian of both the physical graves and the invisible threads that connected them to the endless dance of market and mortality. <words>443</words>
