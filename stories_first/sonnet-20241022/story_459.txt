Marcus adjusted his tool belt as he rode the service elevator down to the sand castle preservation laboratory, trying not to disturb the dried flower crown he'd found abandoned in the corner. <words>33</words>

The ghosts always left him little gifts like this, their ethereal hands arranging delicate objects in places only he would look. <words>57</words>

As the building's sole elevator technician, he'd grown accustomed to their presence, the way they drifted through walls and machinery with an elegantly clumsy grace that reminded him of dancers underwater. <words>90</words>

During his lunch breaks, he would dissect their patterns, staking out local ghost tours that passed by the building, noting how the spirits responded to the embellished stories guides told about their deaths. <words>127</words>

The preservation lab, with its climate-controlled chambers and intricate misting systems, created a peculiar dissonance of silence – the kind that felt both empty and full, like a seashell held to the ear. <words>165</words>

Today's ghost was different: a young woman in Victorian dress who hovered near a particularly detailed sand castle, her translucent fingers tracing the tiny turrets with impossible tenderness. <words>200</words>

Marcus recognized her from last week's ghost tour – the guide had called her Elizabeth, claiming she'd died waiting for her sailor husband to return from sea, though the spirits had shown Marcus how stories rarely captured their true essence. <words>247</words>

He watched as she placed another dried flower from her own crown onto the castle's highest tower, the delicate petals floating down through the protective glass case as if the laws of physics were merely suggestions. <words>288</words>

The other technicians thought the lab's strict humidity controls were malfunctioning when they found dried flowers scattered throughout the facility, but Marcus understood these offerings as messages, each petal a word in a language he was slowly learning to read. <words>334</words>

As his lunch break drew to a close, Marcus gathered the fallen petals, no longer feeling the need to prove what he saw or convince others of his daily encounters. <words>369</words>

Instead, he carefully placed the flower crown on a shelf near Elizabeth's favorite castle, finally understanding that some truths were meant to float in the space between reality and imagination, finding liberation in letting go of the need to make others believe. <words>421</words>

The ghost smiled at him as he turned to leave, and in that moment, the complex simplicity of their shared understanding filled the silence with something that felt remarkably like peace. <words>459</words>
