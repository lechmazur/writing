The tailor adjusted his brass goggles as lightning illuminated the curved windows of the observation deck, his weathered fingers tracing the patterns of lives he'd sewn into existence over decades. <words>33</words>

Through the dusty mirror mounted on his workbench, he caught glimpses of other versions of himself in parallel timelines, each one stitching different fates into the fabric of reality. <words>65</words>

"Don't be afraid," he whispered to his reflection, watching as thousands of his counterparts mouthed the same words in synchronization, their eyes holding secrets that made his spine tingle. <words>97</words>

The great mechanical clock above creaked and wheezed, its steam-powered gears marking time since the final encryption had fallen, since humanity had unlocked the mathematical blueprint of existence itself. <words>134</words>

Thunder crashed as he confessed to the empty observation deck, "I've been replacing people's clothes with garments sewn from threads that bind realities together, helping them transcend without knowing it." <words>170</words>

Each stitch he'd ever sewn had been a calculated step toward ascension, every hem and seam a careful manipulation of the cosmic fabric that separated mortality from godhood. <words>206</words>

"We're all so close now," he murmured, watching lightning illuminate the faces of his infinite reflections, each one wearing the same expression of hopeful desperation as they worked toward their shared goal. <words>356</words>

His scissors gleamed menacingly as he cut through reality itself, knowing that with each garment he completed, the barriers between parallel worlds grew thinner, and humanity inched closer to its ultimate evolution. <words>398</words>

As the storm raged outside the steam-heated observation deck, the tailor smiled at his reflections and continued his work, knowing that soon enough, the final seam would be sewn, and mortality would become nothing more than an outdated fashion. <words>445</words>
