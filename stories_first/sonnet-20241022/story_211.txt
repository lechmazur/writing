Marcus had typically never considered himself lucky until he started gambling with memories instead of money. <words>17</words>

In the abandoned schoolhouse where he now made his home, surrounded by the dust of a ghost town that had survived the great collapse, he meticulously documented each win in his botanical diary - pressing forgotten flowers between pages of recorded bets. <words>47</words>

The game had started innocently enough, with survivors gathering to duplicate their most precious recollections through spin-the-bottle confessions, sharing fragments of the world-that-was to keep hope alive. <words>76</words>

But Marcus discovered he could do more than just collect memories - he could trade them, reshape them, and eventually own them, watching with a cheerful smile as others gradually forgot what they'd wagered away. <words>108</words>

His botanical diary grew thick with both dried flowers and the essence of lost moments: first kisses, childhood birthdays, wedding days, all carefully preserved and labeled like rare specimens. <words>136</words>

The power to possess others' happiness was intoxicating, and Marcus found himself hosting more gatherings, his smile growing wider as the bottle spun and spun, each confession adding to his collection while leaving its original owner mysteriously emptier. <words>173</words>

He justified it as a service - after all, wasn't it better to forget in these harsh times? <words>190</words>

Yet deep in the schoolhouse's hollow halls, where children's laughter once echoed, Marcus began to realize that his lucky streak came with a price. <words>215</words>

The more memories he won, the more they blurred together, becoming a kaleidoscope of borrowed joy that felt increasingly hollow. <words>234</words>

Still, he continued his games, driven to defy the gravity of hopelessness that threatened to crush what remained of civilization, even as he recognized the corruption of his own power. <words>267</words>

One evening, as the setting sun painted the schoolhouse windows in shades of amber, a young woman spun the bottle and shared a memory of tending a garden - the same flowers he'd been pressing into his diary. <words>304</words>

The coincidence shook him, and for the first time, Marcus lost a game, forfeiting his own cherished memory of learning to press flowers from his grandmother. <words>334</words>

As that memory transferred to another, something unexpected happened - genuine laughter erupted in the room, pure and untainted by the usual despair that colored their world. <words>365</words>

Marcus looked down at his botanical diary, understanding at last that true hope couldn't be won or owned, but only grown and shared, like the resilient wildflowers that still pushed through the cracks in the schoolhouse foundation. <words>404</words>

That night, he began removing the pressed flowers from his diary, returning them to those who needed their memories most, finding more luck in giving than he ever had in winning. <words>441</words>
