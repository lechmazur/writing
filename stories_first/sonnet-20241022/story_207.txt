Marcus Chen, a forthright peddler of salvaged medical supplies, traced his fingers along the dusty examination tables of the abandoned Helios-7 space station's medical bay. <words>27</words>

The dried flower bouquet he'd carried across three star systems trembled in his other hand, a reminder of the blood oath he'd sworn to his dying sister never to reveal the location of her experimental healing protocols. <words>71</words>

As the universe hummed its familiar melody through the station's hollow corridors, Marcus meekly but determinedly sifted through old data tablets containing medical gossip columns, searching for any mention of the plague that had claimed her life. <words>126</words>

He needed to divide truth from fiction, to separate genuine hope from desperate speculation, knowing that somewhere in these records lay the key to understanding why she had made him promise to keep her research hidden. <words>173</words>

The solitude of the medical bay felt oddly comforting as he worked, a peculiar joy filling him despite – or perhaps because of – being the only living soul within fifty million kilometers. <words>216</words>

Each withered petal that fell from his sister's bouquet seemed to whisper secrets, leading him through archived rumors of corporate espionage and banned genetic modifications. <words>254</words>

When he finally found it – a small note about experimental nanotherapy gone wrong – Marcus understood with crushing clarity why his sister had demanded his oath: her cure had worked too well, granting immortality but at the cost of humanity itself. <words>313</words>

His hands shook as he realized that breaking his oath wasn't just about unburdening his conscience; it was about protecting countless lives from those who would abuse her discovery. <words>356</words>

With newfound purpose, he began systematically downloading and encrypting the vital information, knowing he would need to distribute it to the right authorities who could ensure it never fell into the wrong hands. <words>406</words>

As he worked, a single dried flower fell from the bouquet and landed on the keyboard, and Marcus smiled, feeling his sister's presence and knowing that sometimes redemption meant having the courage to break one promise to keep a greater one. <words>465</words>
