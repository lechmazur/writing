Marcus had been pursuing his PhD for three centuries, his eternal student status a peculiar side effect of the very immortality he studied. <words>27</words>

In the lightless underground city of the mole people, where humanity had retreated after the death of the final star, his research continued with mundane persistence. <words>52</words>

The coal miner's headlamp he wore—salvaged from the Great Collapse of 2847—cast a weak beam through the perpetual darkness, illuminating the ancient travel journals scattered across his desk. <words>82</words>

Each leather-bound volume contained accounts from other immortals, their experiences swapped and traded like currency in this subterranean world, their collective wisdom his path to understanding the burden of endless existence. <words>116</words>

Marcus had spent decades digitizing these journals into the city's quantum archives, converting centuries of immortal observations into data patterns that might reveal the underlying mechanics of their condition. <words>147</words>

The mole people, with their evolved sensitivity to vibration and their intricate network of tunnels, had become the unwitting custodians of humanity's longest-running experiment: the search for mastery over reality itself. <words>180</words>

His fingers traced the worn pages with detached reverence, each entry a testament to the glorious banality of eternal life—births witnessed countless times, deaths observed but never experienced, civilizations rising and falling like breaths. <words>219</words>

The gift of immortality had become his burden, just as the burden of knowledge had become his gift. <words>238</words>

In the dim light of his lamp, Marcus noted how the mole people's children would gather at his door, their pale skin and enlarged eyes adapted to the darkness, listening to him read tales of the long-dead stars. <words>277</words>

He documented their evolution with the same clinical devotion he applied to his own unchanging existence, knowing that these observations too would join the vast digital repository of eternal life's footnotes. <words>313</words>

Sometimes, in the quiet hours between the city's artificial day and night cycles, Marcus wondered if his true purpose was not to master reality, but to serve as its patient chronicler. <words>348</words>

The weight of the headlamp pressed against his forehead, a constant reminder of the collapse that had driven humanity below, yet also a symbol of persistence in the face of cosmic darkness. <words>384</words>

As he carefully digitized another journal, converting its yellowed pages into streams of data, Marcus accepted that perhaps the most profound mastery of reality lay in simply bearing witness to its endless permutations. <words>424</words>

In the end, he realized, immortality was neither a curse nor a blessing, but rather a mundanely glorious duty to carry the weight of accumulated wisdom through the ages, even as the last stars faded from memory. <words>469</words>
