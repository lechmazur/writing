The stoic wanderer traced his fingers along the weathered floorboard, feeling the grooves where countless witch's familiars had practiced their first transformations. <words>23</words>

He'd stolen it from the abandoned cabin after following a trail of nightmares that leaked from the dreams of failed apprentices, each one marked by the mesmerizingly bland residue of incomplete spells. <words>47</words>

As the last teacher in the valley wiped away the final formula from her blackboard, declaring the age of familiar training officially over, he knew he had to impose himself into this fading tradition. <words>76</words>

"I've documented everything," he told her with brash confidence masking his tender concern, pulling journals from his pack that detailed every ritual he'd gathered across the continent. <words>103</words>

The teacher's eyes narrowed as she recognized the necessary lies woven through his stories – he wasn't just a wandering scholar, but the last familiar who'd escaped the great purge fifty years ago. <words>134</words>

"You were there when they burned the original training grounds," she whispered, her fingers trembling as they traced the same patterns in the air that he'd carved into the stolen floorboard. <words>164</words>

He nodded, remembering how he'd spent decades methodically archiving every ritual practice he could find, preserving them in a code that only true familiars could decipher. <words>190</words>

"The bland conceals the brilliant," he said, pressing his palm against the floorboard until it began to glow with the accumulated power of generations of familiar transformations. <words>217</words>

The teacher's classroom shimmered as ancient magic leaked from the wood, transforming the mundane space into a spectral echo of the original training ground, complete with the ghostly forms of familiars past. <words>247</words>

"They tried to erase us," he continued, his stoic demeanor cracking slightly as phantom cats, ravens, and foxes swirled around them, "but I've kept every secret, every lesson, every transformation ritual safe." <words>278</words>

Together, they watched as the spectral familiars performed their training exercises, their forms shifting between animal and human with a grace that had been nearly lost to time. <words>306</words>

"We can start again," the teacher said, understanding now why he'd chosen this moment, this final erasure, to reveal himself and the preserved knowledge. <words>333</words>

The wanderer placed the floorboard in the center of the classroom, where it pulsed with the collected power of countless practiced transformations, ready to teach a new generation the old ways. <words>366</words>

As new students began to filter into the classroom, drawn by the awakening magic, the wanderer and teacher shared a knowing look – sometimes the most necessary lies were the ones that kept hope alive until truth could safely return. <words>407</words>
