Marcus adjusted his leather tool belt as he studied the torn corner of a flyer he'd found wedged in his workshop door that morning. <words>23</words> The fragment showed only a partial address and the words "...remember what was," rendered in fading ink that seemed to shift and vectorize before his tired eyes. <words>47</words> Living inside a colossal mushroom house had its peculiarities, but the way memories distorted within its spongey walls was becoming more than he could bear. <words>71</words> He checked his watch – synchronized precisely with the ancient timepiece in the village square – knowing the last rotation of the forgotten windmill would align exactly with the moment he needed to act. <words>103</words>

The bioluminescent veins running through his fungal dwelling cast everything in a comfortingly pessimistic glow, matching his disposition as he prepared for the task ahead. <words>131</words> As a tradesman who specialized in repairing the impossible, Marcus had seen his share of strange phenomena, but carrying a flickering candle through the endless void that manifested nightly in his living room was pushing the boundaries of his expertise. <words>173</words>

The walls seemed to breathe around him, distorting his memories of when the house had been normal – or had it ever been? <words>195</words> He couldn't recall anymore if the mushroom had grown around his original home or if he'd always lived within its damp confines. <words>219</words> The flyer fragment trembled in his calloused hands, its partial message somehow holding the key to understanding why every resident's memories had begun to blur and fade like watercolors in rain. <words>251</words>

As the final creak of the windmill's ancient bones echoed across the village, Marcus lit his candle and stepped into the void that had opened in his kitchen. <words>280</words> The darkness felt almost solid, but the flame cut through it like a knife through velvet, revealing glimpses of what might have been memories, or perhaps possibilities, or even lies. <words>315</words> Each step forward illuminated fragments of the past – children playing in streets that never existed, markets selling impossible fruits, and faces that seemed to be everyone and no one at once. <words>349</words>

The synchronization of the watches had been crucial; he had exactly seven minutes to reach the center of the void before the windmill's last rotation completed its cycle. <words>377</words> In the blurry vividness of the void, Marcus finally understood why he'd been chosen for this task – as a tradesman, he knew that sometimes the only way to fix something was to first let it completely fall apart. <words>416</words> He held the torn flyer piece before the candle's flame, watching as the partial address resolved itself into a complete map of everything they'd collectively forgotten, and everything they needed to remember. <words>452</words>
