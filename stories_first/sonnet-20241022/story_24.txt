The bard wandered the twisted corridors of Thornspine Books, his footsteps echoing through shelves that spiraled up into the mountain's heart. <words>21</words>

He carried his most precious possession in a velvet pouch: George Washington's alleged dentures, though most assumed they were merely carved from particularly convincing whale bone. <words>43</words>

The warmth they emanated was subtle but undeniable, like sunshine through autumn leaves, and he'd discovered their peculiar power quite by accident during one of his puppet shows in a dingy tavern near the mountain's base. <words>76</words>

Tonight, as patrons browsed dusty tomes and whispered between towering shelves, he felt the familiar ache in his chest—the same hollow feeling he'd carried since sending that bitter message to his daughter three hours ago. <words>109</words>

His fingers trembled as he checked his phone again: still no response. <words>120</words>

The puppet theater he'd built from discarded book covers fit perfectly between Ancient Philosophy and Forgotten Myths, and as he positioned the dentures behind his makeshift stage, their warmth seemed to pulse in time with his regret. <words>159</words>

His puppets—crafted from torn pages and binding thread—began their dance, telling stories of reconciliation and forgiveness, while the historic teeth cast an otherworldly glow that drew browsers from their literary pursuits. <words>195</words>

Each performance was ordinarily extraordinary: mundane tales transformed by the inexplicable radiance that made cynical hearts flutter and cold spirits thaw. <words>218</words>

As his audience grew, their faces illuminated by that strange light, he wove tales of parents and children, of harsh words and healing, his own pain seeping into every gesture of his paper players. <words>255</words>

Between shows, he would relocate to different sections of the labyrinthine store—from Cartography to Forbidden Romance, from Astronomical Studies to Lost Languages—sowing seeds of warmth in the mountain's chilly corners. <words>290</words>

The dentures' glow strengthened with each performance, until the entire bookstore seemed to pulse with a gentle luminescence that caused even the most hardened readers to pause and reflect on their own unresolved stories. <words>327</words>

In the Maritime History section, his phone finally buzzed: "Dad, I'm sorry too." <words>340</words>

The tears that fell onto his puppet stage were illuminated by the dentures' strongest burst yet, and as he performed his final show of the night, the wooden teeth sang with all the accumulated warmth of countless reconciliations they'd witnessed through centuries. <words>391</words>

His audience never knew why this particular puppet show in this peculiar bookstore moved them so deeply, but as they descended the mountain that night, each carried a spark of that mysterious warmth home in their hearts. <words>432</words>

And somewhere, in a glass case in Mount Vernon, a set of real presidential dentures sat in darkness, having never known such purpose as their carved impostor. <words>464</words>
