Maya hadn't spoken directly to another person in three years, but her puppet Sebastian had plenty to say about the three moons hanging over this version of Venice Beach. <words>33</words>

Through Sebastian's painted wooden lips, she documented the peculiar atmospheric conditions that only existed in this parallel dimension she'd stumbled into while seeking shelter in that quantum-shifting diner at 2 AM. <words>71</words>

The cardboard coffee sleeve from that fateful night had become her most precious possession, covered in hastily scrawled measurements of purple rain and sideways gravity that she'd been archiving ever since. <words>108</words>

Sebastian, ever the optimist, insisted that somewhere in these weather patterns was the key to finding others who had slipped through the cracks between universes – her true family, he called them. <words>145</words>

When the locals patronized her, dismissing her puppet-spoken theories as the ramblings of a beach eccentric, Sebastian would just laugh and adjust his tiny bowtie, absolutely certain their breakthrough was coming. <words>180</words>

It was through the fragments of phone conversations, caught on the salt-heavy breeze between dimensions, that Maya began piecing together the truth about others like her. <words>214</words>

"Another one crossed over at Jimmy's Diner," she'd heard someone say, their voice crackling with quantum static, and Sebastian had practically danced with joy in her hands. <words>245</words>

The puppet's painted eyes seemed to gleam brighter as more displaced travelers' conversations filtered through the dimensional static, each one adding another data point to her coffee sleeve archives. <words>280</words>

Maya's hands trembled with euphoric energy as Sebastian announced to the empty beach that the weather patterns were finally aligning – just like the three moons overhead – revealing a map of temporal crossing points. <words>321</words>

Other dimension-displaced wanderers began appearing on her beach, drawn by Sebastian's voiced predictions of quantum weather phenomena, each carrying their own stories and methods of coping with their displacement. <words>359</words>

They didn't seem to mind that Maya only spoke through Sebastian, and soon their mismatched group of reality refugees formed a kind of family, sharing quantum coffee and watching the impossible weather patterns paint the sky. <words>401</words>

Maya's silence felt less like a barrier and more like a gift now, as Sebastian helped her connect these lost souls through their shared experience of finding home in a place where physics itself refused to follow the rules. <words>447</words>

As the group huddled together under an umbrella during a shower of luminescent raindrops, Sebastian whispered what Maya had known all along – sometimes family isn't about where you're from, but where you end up together. <words>487</words>
