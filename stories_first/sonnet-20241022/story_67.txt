Marcus the blacksmith whistled cheerfully as he climbed the creaking stairs to old Edison's attic workshop, his hammer swinging at his belt with each step. <words>27</words>

The inventor's latest contraption sat in the center of the room, a brass pendulum marking time with methodical precision while strange gears clicked and whirred beneath its crystalline housing. <words>71</words>

"They all said darkness couldn't be measured," Marcus announced to the empty room, his single gold earring catching the late afternoon light as he circled the device with an air of manufactured confidence. <words>116</words>

He had endured their mockery for months – the other craftsmen who claimed his obsession with quantifying shadow and light was madness – but today would prove them wrong. <words>156</words>

The machine's steady tick-tock reminded him of his own heartbeat as he made the final adjustments, knowing the evening train's passage would cast the perfect moving shadow across the attic's western window. <words>206</words>

His calloused hands, usually so sure in shaping metal, trembled slightly as he positioned the device's sensors, his perpetual smile masking the desperate need to validate his theory that even darkness followed measurable patterns. <words>263</words>

The train whistle pierced the air, and Marcus held his breath as the massive steam engine began its journey past the workshop. <words>290</words>

Shadow and light danced across the floorboards as the train's windows flickered by, each passenger's silhouette becoming a data point in his experiment. <words>321</words>

Then he saw it – the final wave from a familiar figure in the last car, his daughter leaving for university, her farewell gesture creating the perfect oscillation in the machine's readings. <words>367</words>

Marcus stared at the results with a strange mixture of triumph and detachment, his jovial demeanor momentarily cracking as he realized that in proving darkness could be tamed, he had missed his last chance to embrace the very human shadows of goodbye. <words>432</words>

The metronome continued its steady beat as dusk settled over the workshop, neither celebrating nor mourning, while Marcus carefully folded the results and tucked them into his leather apron pocket, whistling a slightly hollow tune. <words>485</words>
