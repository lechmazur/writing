The necromancer Twitch couldn't stop fidgeting as he traced the dripping pixels along the underground tunnel's wall, his nervous fingers following the rebellious paint that formed a crude portrait of Pac-Man. <words>33</words>

Each footstep echoed through the 8-bit labyrinth, multiplying into an unsettling chorus that made him question whether he was truly alone in this digital catacomb. <words>60</words>

He'd discovered something typically bizarre about the beloved yellow icon – a glitch in the system that occurred only when the ancient gaming deities entered their centennial hibernation. <words>89</words>

The fishhook in his satchel pulsed with an eerie blue glow as moonlight filtered through the screen-like ceiling, its enchanted metal detecting traces of spiritual corruption in the arcade realm. <words>120</words>

His research into the paint patterns had revealed a disturbing truth: the drips weren't random at all, but a coded message left by the original programmers, warning of Pac-Man's true nature. <words>153</words>

Twitch's power to commune with dead code had shown him fragments of deleted characters, all pointing to a darker purpose behind the maze-running mascot. <words>180</words>

As he rounded another pixelated corner, his steps faltered – there stood the legendary circle himself, but something was wrong with his familiar form. <words>206</words>

The necromancer watched in horror as Pac-Man's sprite flickered, revealing not the cheerful ghost-eater of legend, but a void-mouthed harvester of digital souls, sustaining the game world through countless deleted entities. <words>241</words>

"Your high scores," Twitch declared, his voice trembling but determined, "they're not points at all – they're death counts, aren't they?" <words>264</words>

The icon's response was a distorted warble that shattered nearby pixels, confirming every terrible theory hidden in those ancient protest murals. <words>287</words>

Using his fishhook like a dowsing rod, Twitch began the complex ritual he'd pieced together from the cryptic paint drips, drawing upon the power vacuum left by the slumbering gods. <words>321</words>

Lines of code rose around them like spectral serpents as Pac-Man's cheerful yellow facade began to crack, revealing the true form that countless gamers had unknowingly worshipped for decades. <words>356</words>

The necromancer's jumpy demeanor finally steadied as he completed the ritual, watching as the mascot's mask shattered into thousands of pixels, exposing the eternal hunger that had powered the arcade's dark heart all along. <words>401</words>

In the end, it wasn't the ghosts players should have feared – it was the hero they'd been controlling all along, and now, in the gods' absence, the truth would finally escape the maze. <words>441</words>
