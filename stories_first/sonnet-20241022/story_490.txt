The caravan repair station's neon sign flickered weakly against the salt-crusted windows as Marina, the fading caretaker, traced her fingers across dusty diagnostic screens. <words>27</words>

She'd been gorging herself on ancient data streams ever since the tsunami warning systems had failed, leaving the coastal settlement empty except for the rhythmic sound of water draining back to sea. <words>71</words>

The dried lavender bundle hanging above her workstation – a remnant from more orderly days – swayed with methodically random patterns in the breeze from her jury-rigged cooling system. <words>116</words>

By hacking ancient archives buried deep within the station's maintenance protocols, Marina had discovered something the evacuation authorities had missed: a pattern in the chaos, a sequence in the destruction that spoke of deliberate design. <words>177</words>

Her enthusiasm for uncovering the truth warred with her carefully cultivated apathy – the same emotional shield that had allowed her to remain behind while others fled inland. <words>224</words>

The forbidden data streams whispered of artificial tides, of engineered disasters, of someone or something conducting experiments with the ocean itself. <words>262</words>

Each night, she cradled the unknown like a newborn galaxy in her palms, watching the numbers dance across her screens, building constellations of conspiracy from the digital debris of a drowning world. <words>315</words>

Travelers still came through occasionally, their solar caravans creaking with salt damage, but Marina barely noticed them anymore, lost in her obsessive data mining, even as she mechanically repaired their vehicles. <words>366</words>

The lavender's fading scent had become a timer of sorts, marking how long she'd been chasing digital ghosts, and she knew that when the last trace of fragrance disappeared, she would have to choose between exposing the truth or maintaining the comfortable numbness of her isolation. <words>441</words>

As the waves continued their endless cycle of advance and retreat beyond the station's walls, Marina smiled at the peculiar beauty of her self-imposed exile, knowing she was perhaps the only person left who could decode the rhythms of this manufactured apocalypse. <words>500</words>
