The neon sign repair shop's buzzing lights cast shifting shadows across Mai's face as she traced the labyrinthine carvings on the tribal mask with calloused fingers. <words>27</words>

Her sword lay wrapped in silk beside her, a constant reminder of the blood she'd spilled in pursuit of this artifact. <words>48</words>

The half-truth historians had led her through a maze of contradicting tales, each one bringing her closer to understanding the mask's connection to the door of release. <words>76</words>

Outside, the last withered petal from Old Man Chen's prized rosebush spiraled down, marking the moment the ancients had foretold. <words>97</words>

Mai's reservedly bold nature had served her well in gathering information, allowing her to blend into shadows while maintaining the resolve to strike when necessary. <words>124</words>

The shop owner, hunched over his workbench repairing a flickering beer sign, remained oblivious to the fact that his basement concealed the very door she sought. <words>153</words>

Each historian's fragment of truth had pointed here, to this unremarkable building with its carnival of broken lights and humming transformers. <words>175</words>

The guilt of her past deeds weighed heavily as she remembered the faces of those who'd stood between her and this moment, yet the promise of the unknown beyond that door pulled at her soul. <words>214</words>

When midnight struck, Mai slipped the mask over her face, feeling ancient magic pulse through its wooden contours as she descended the cramped stairs to the basement. <words>244</words>

The door stood before her, its surface blank yet somehow alive with possibility, waiting for the mask's touch to reveal its true nature. <words>270</words>

Neon light leaked through the floorboards above, painting strange patterns that seemed to dance with the mask's carved designs. <words>291</words>

Her sword hand trembled not from fear but from anticipation as she pressed the mask against the door's surface, watching as the carvings began to glow with an inner light that matched the pulsing signs above. <words>328</words>

The door's outline emerged in brilliant azure, a perfect match to the pattern she'd seen in her dreams, confirming every fragmented prophecy she'd gleaned from those unreliable sages. <words>359</words>

As the portal slowly opened, revealing a shimmer of otherworldly light, Mai finally understood why the historians had only spoken in half-truths â€“ some knowledge was too vast, too profound to be contained in mere words. <words>396</words>

With one fluid motion, she drew her sword and stepped through the threshold, leaving behind the weight of her guilt and embracing the unknown that had called to her for so long. <words>432</words>
