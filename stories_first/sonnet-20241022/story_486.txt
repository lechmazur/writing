Marcus adjusted his audio equipment with clumsily dexterous fingers, the stained glass fragment hanging from his neck catching the green glow of the witch's bubbling cauldron. <words>27</words>

As a sound engineer who had discovered how to manipulate reality through frequency modulation, he knew the importance of perfect acoustic balance in this ancient chamber. <words>52</words>

The crowd outside the castle walls grew louder, their angry chants threatening to break through the temporal barriers he'd carefully constructed over months of sonic experimentation. <words>80</words>

He'd been critiqued, mocked, and dismissed when he first demonstrated his abilities through elaborate pantomime confessions in public squares, using soundwaves to make objects float and reality bend. <words>110</words>

The witch had been the only one to recognize his talent, offering her cauldron room as a sanctuary where the acoustics would amplify his powers exponentially. <words>139</words>

Now, as the mob approached with their torches and pitchforks, Marcus felt the familiar sensation of time slowing around him – like the hush that follows the erasing of a chalkboard, when dust motes hang suspended in afternoon light. <words>176</words>

His fingers danced across the mixing board, each adjustment sending ripples through the fabric of local reality, while the stained glass fragment resonated with harmonics that made the witch's brews shimmer and dance. <words>213</words>

This would be his silent retribution: not a violent response to their threats, but rather a subtle restructuring of their perceived reality. <words>236</words>

The practical illusion he was crafting would make them forget why they'd come, transform their anger into confusion, their hatred into mild curiosity. <words>263</words>

As the final frequencies aligned, Marcus watched through the window as the crowd began to move in reverse, their movements becoming dreamlike and uncertain, until they dispersed like morning mist under summer sun. <words>300</words>

The witch nodded approvingly from her corner, her ancient eyes understanding the elegant solution he'd crafted – how he'd managed to silence the mob without a single act of violence. <words>335</words>

In the newfound quiet, Marcus traced the edges of the stained glass fragment, remembering how it had once been part of a church window that shattered during his first public demonstration, now serving as both a reminder and an amplifier of his unusual talents. <words>380</words>

The cauldron's bubbling provided a perfect baseline frequency as he began to fine-tune reality back to its natural state, knowing that his message had been received: some sounds need not be heard to be understood. <words>421</words>
