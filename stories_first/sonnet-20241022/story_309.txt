Detective Sarah Chen stared at the Queen of Hearts lying in the center of the empty gallery floor, her mind cycling through possibilities like a broken record. <words>27</words>

"Of course it had to be hearts," she muttered, watching the emergency lights fade outside the Vanishing Point's windows, their red glare finally surrendering to the night. <words>52</words>

She rummaged through her coat pocket, fingers brushing against the kaleidoscope her daughter had given her before the accident – before everything changed. <words>75</words>

Holding it up to her eye, Sarah watched the fractured mirrors transform the sterile gallery walls into a carnival of broken geometries, each twist revealing and concealing possible truths with mocking precision. <words>104</words>

"Real professional," she chided herself, "solving crimes with a toy while the commissioner breathes down my neck about the gallery heists." <words>127</words>

But something about the way the playing card caught the light reminded her of another piece of evidence, another time, another gallery – memories she'd rather keep locked away, tumbling through her mind like the kaleidoscope's shifting patterns. <words>165</words>

The silence after the final siren felt heavy, pregnant with possibilities, and Sarah found herself moving through the space with the confident uncertainty of someone who knew they were right but couldn't prove why. <words>199</words>

Each step brought new fragments: the card, her daughter's laugh, the kaleidoscope's broken rainbow, the way the thief always seemed to know exactly when to strike – pieces of a puzzle that refused to align. <words>235</words>

"Time's running out," she whispered to the empty room, her voice dripping with bitter amusement at her own melodrama, even as she recognized the truth in those words. <words>264</words>

The next heist was coming, as inevitable as sunrise, and here she was dancing around the edges of a solution that felt just out of reach. <words>291</words>

Raising the kaleidoscope once more, Sarah froze as the fractured image suddenly crystallized into clarity – the card, the timing, the patterns – all reflecting a truth she'd been too close to see. <words>324</words>

Her daughter had always loved magic tricks, had always known how to make things disappear, and now, staring through the kaleidoscope at the Queen of Hearts, Sarah finally understood why the gallery's security footage always showed the art vanishing at exactly 9:47 PM. <words>369</words>

The time of the accident. <words>374</words>

Some part of her had known all along, had recognized the signature in the careful precision of each theft, but she'd been too afraid to face what that meant. <words>406</words>

Sarah pocketed the kaleidoscope and picked up the playing card, her chest tight with the knowledge that sometimes the hardest mysteries to solve are the ones we hide from ourselves. <words>438</words>

Tomorrow, she would have to make a choice between justice and mercy, but for now, she allowed herself one more moment in the gallery's silence, watching the last traces of emergency lights fade like memories in a broken mirror. <words>477</words>
