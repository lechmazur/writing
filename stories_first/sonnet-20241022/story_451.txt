Sarah Chen studied the baseball's faded signature as morning fog rolled across the farmers market, the mysterious inscription claiming to be from someone born in 2157. <words>27</words>

As identical faces passed through the crowd, she clutched the prophetic baseball tighter, knowing that somewhere among these weekend shoppers was her separated-at-birth twin sister – the one person who could help her decode the apocalyptic warning scrawled beneath the signature. <words>71</words>

She'd hired a dozen actors who matched her appearance to patrol the market, hoping their presence would draw out her sister, who she knew was searching for her too after discovering her own piece of the temporal puzzle. <words>116</words>

The mountain looming above the market square held secrets of its own, its peak shrouded in what locals called "crystal shadows" – ethereal refractions that seemed to bend both light and time. <words>149</words>

Sarah's research had led her to believe that only identical twins possessed the unique genetic markers needed to access the forbidden knowledge hidden within the mountain's crystalline core, knowledge that might prevent the catastrophe foretold by the time-traveling baseball player. <words>196</words>

As her hired doubles wove through the market stalls, Sarah noticed one of them moving with uncanny familiarity – not the studied mimicry of an actor, but the natural grace of shared DNA. <words>235</words>

Their eyes met across a display of local honey, and Sarah instantly knew this was no actor – this was her sister, who had apparently employed the same strategy of hiring lookalikes. <words>272</words>

Without a word, they converged at the base of a hidden trail that led up the mountain, their identical faces reflecting the same mix of relief and urgency. <words>303</words>

The clandestine meeting point was marked by a peculiar arrangement of crystals half a mile up the slope, where the sisters would need to combine their genetic signatures to subdue the temporal guardians protecting humanity from knowledge it wasn't meant to have. <words>359</words>

As they ascended together, their hired doubles continued their market patrols below, creating the perfect alibi for the twins' absence as they raced against time to prevent a future that only a baseball-playing time traveler had dared to warn them about. <words>414</words>

The crystal shadows deepened around them as they climbed, their identical DNA the key to unlocking secrets that would either save humanity or confirm its doom – assuming they could trust a warning written on a baseball by someone not yet born. <words>465</words>
