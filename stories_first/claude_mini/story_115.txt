As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the city in a warm, reddish glow, Ava found herself at the doorstep of a suspiciously straightforward workshop. <words>92</words> Without hesitation, she pushed open the door and stepped inside, her eyes immediately drawn to the glowing forge at the center of the room. <words>107</words>

"I've been expecting you, Ava," a voice called out, and she turned to see a familiar figure emerge from the shadows. <words>120</words> It was her enemy, their face obscured by the very mask Ava had discovered, and she felt a surge of ruminative exasperation wash over her. <words>135</words>
