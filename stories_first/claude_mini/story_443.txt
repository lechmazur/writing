With a fearful joy, <words>74</words> the reaper began to map the hidden springs <words>82</words> that flowed through the pages, <words>88</words> her fingers tracing the words as if they held the secrets <words>99</words> to mending her own broken heart. <words>107</words> The story unfolded before her, <words>113</words> a tale of love and loss, <words>120</words> of the fragility and resilience of the human spirit. <words>130</words>
