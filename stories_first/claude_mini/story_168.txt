As she examined the symbols, a figure emerged from the shadows, a scuffed plastic comb in hand. <words>67</words> It was Liam, a self-proclaimed "watcher" who had been observing the site for years, burdened by the weight of its secrets. <words>84</words> Amelia approached him, her intellectually spontaneous nature sparking a conversation that flowed like a spontaneous road trip. <words>98</words>
