In the shadowed depths of the ocean, aboard the steampunk submarine *Leviathan*, the wayward apothecary, Elara, stood on the observation deck, her eyes fixed on the flickering morse code signals from a distant, submerged buoy. <words>34</words> The signals, a series of dots and dashes, were her only connection to the surface world, a world she had left behind to track the migratory butterflies that somehow found their way into the submarine's airlocks. <words>81</words> Elara's love for these delicate creatures was unconventional, a passion that had driven her to the brink of madness and exile. <words>108</words> Her dry highlighter pen, once a tool for marking her notes, now lay forgotten on the deck, a symbol of her past life as a respected scholar. <words>143</words> The pen, now useless, was a constant reminder of the unjustly fair world that had cast her aside, a world that could not understand her unique bond with the butterflies. <words>185</words> As the submarine drifted between broken treaties, Elara's mind wandered to the surface, where the butterflies she loved were free to roam. <words>215</words> She had infected the submarine's communication system with a code that mimicked the butterflies' flight patterns, using morse code signals to guide them through the airlocks. <words>249</words> The crew, unaware of her actions, continued their duties, oblivious to the small, fluttering visitors that brought Elara a sense of peace and purpose. <words>282</words> Each signal from the buoy was a message from the butterflies, a reminder that even in the darkest depths, there was a connection to the world above. <words>316</words> Elara's heart ached with a battered marvel, a sense of wonder and sorrow that she could never fully express. <words>341</words> As the *Leviathan* continued its journey, the morse code signals grew fainter, but Elara knew that her love for the butterflies would never fade, no matter how deep the submarine dove. <words>385</words> In the end, it was this love that kept her going, a love that transcended the boundaries of the world she had left behind. <words>400</words>
