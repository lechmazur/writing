In the underground city of the goblins, where the air was thick with the scent of damp earth and the echoes of distant laughter, a meek necromancer named Elowen wandered through the labyrinthine tunnels. <words>34</words> The city, a sprawling network of caverns and narrow passages, was alive with the sounds of children playing, their voices mingling with the soft hum of ancient machinery. <words>61</words> Elowen, peculiarly sincere in his demeanor, clutched a fountain pen with a broken nib, a relic from a time long forgotten. <words>84</words> The pen, once a symbol of his scholarly pursuits, now lay in his hand as a reminder of his failed attempts to decode a universal riddle. <words>112</words> This riddle, a cryptic message etched into the walls of the deepest caverns, had eluded him for years, driving him deeper into the underground city's mysteries. <words>144</words> Amid the playground sounds, Elowen paused, his eyes drawn to a dew drop hanging from a stalactite, glistening in the dim light. <words>168</words> He had heard an old goblin legend that spoke of the way light reflects off a dew drop, revealing hidden truths and forgotten knowledge. <words>201</words> With a sense of renewed purpose, Elowen approached the dew drop, his heart pounding with a mix of hope and trepidation. <words>229</words> As he gazed into the tiny droplet, the light began to dance, casting intricate patterns on the cavern walls. <words>251</words> The patterns shifted and merged, forming a tangled tapestry of symbols and images, each one more complex than the last. <words>276</words> Elowen's mind raced as he tried to make sense of the tapestry, his fingers tracing the broken nib of the pen against the stone. <words>302</words> Slowly, the symbols began to align, and the riddle that had haunted him for so long started to unravel. <words>322</words> Through the way light reflected off the dew drop, Elowen regained the knowledge he had sought, the answer to the universal riddle. <words>349</words> With a deep breath, he inscribed the solution on the wall, his hand steady and sure. <words>372</words> The underground city of the goblins, with its playground sounds and ancient secrets, had finally revealed its greatest mystery to the meek necromancer. <words>400</words>
