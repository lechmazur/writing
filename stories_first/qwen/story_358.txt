In the heart of the arctic, where the cold seeps into the bones and the sky is a perpetual twilight, stood an old-fashioned mage named Elric. <words>24</words> His beard, as white as the snow that surrounded him, fluttered in the biting wind as he gazed through the glass walls of the research greenhouse. <words>46</words> Inside, the air was warm and humid, a stark contrast to the frozen world outside. <words>58</words> Elric had come here not for the warmth, but for the fragment of a pharaoh’s coffin that lay hidden within the greenhouse’s most secluded corner. <words>84</words> The fragment was said to hold the key to an uncharted frontier, a place where the boundaries between the physical and the mystical blurred. <words>106</words> Elric’s purpose was clear: to claim this frontier for himself, to unravel the riddle that had eluded scholars for centuries. <words>128</words> But his journey was purposefully aimless, a meandering path that led him through the labyrinth of his own mind. <words>148</words> Each step he took was a step into the unknown, each breath a whisper of the ancient magic that coursed through his veins. <words>168</words> 

Amid playground time, when the researchers and their children took a break from their work, Elric wandered the greenhouse, his eyes fixed on the ground. <words>194</words> He moved through the rows of exotic plants, their leaves rustling softly in the artificial breeze. <words>208</words> His mind was a tapestry of thoughts, each thread a memory, a dream, a fragment of the riddle he sought to solve. <words>226</words> As he passed by a large, ornate mirror, he paused, his reflection staring back at him with a knowing gaze. <words>244</words> Through ephemeral encounters with mirror reflections, Elric found moments of clarity, glimpses of the truth that eluded him. <words>266</words> The mirror seemed to hold a piece of the riddle, a clue that he could not yet decipher. <words>280</words> He reached out, his fingers brushing the cool glass, and for a moment, he felt a connection, a pulse of energy that resonated deep within him. <words>299</words> 

The fragment of the pharaoh’s coffin lay in a small, shadowed alcove, its surface etched with hieroglyphs that glowed faintly in the dim light. <words>321</words> Elric approached it slowly, his heart pounding with a mix of excitement and dread. <words>334</words> He knelt before the fragment, his hands trembling as he reached out to touch it. <words>346</words> The moment his fingers made contact, a surge of power coursed through him, and the riddle began to unfold. <words>359</words> Visions of ancient Egypt, of pyramids and temples, of a pharaoh whose name had been lost to time, flooded his mind. <words>375</words> The fragment was a key, a portal to a world beyond the physical, a world where the uncharted frontier lay waiting. <words>392</words> With a deep, steadying breath, Elric embraced the sanctified dread that filled him, and he cuddled the fragment to his chest, ready to claim his destiny. <words>409</words>
