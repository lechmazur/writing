In the glacial orchard, where the air was as crisp as the apples that hung from the ancient trees, the druid, Eira, stood at the edge of the crevasse, her eyes fixed on the blue ice below. <words>29</words> The orchard, a relic from a time long forgotten, was suspended over the abyss, a testament to the world's resilience and the druid's own guarded nature. <words>54</words> Eira had always been fiercely ambivalent about the orchard, a place of both solace and sorrow, where the silence was as thick as the ice beneath her feet. <words>82</words> She clutched a dull safety pin in her hand, a relic from a time when humans still walked the earth, a time she could barely remember. <words>112</words> The pin was a symbol of her past, a reminder of the world she had left behind, and the fear that still gripped her heart. <words>139</words> Today, however, was different. <words>147</words> Today was her birthday, and she had a special family meal to prepare, a tradition that had been passed down through generations of druids. <words>175</words> The meal was a way to gather, to break the silence, and to confront the fears that had kept her isolated for so long. <words>204</words> Eira moved through the orchard, her steps deliberate, gathering the ingredients she needed. <words>222</words> The apples were ripe, the herbs fragrant, and the ice water from the crevasse was as pure as it had always been. <words>244</words> As she worked, she thought about the last human who had set foot on earth, a figure she had only heard about in stories. <words>271</words> The human had spoken of a world that was both beautiful and broken, a world that had been left behind in the rush to the stars. <words>300</words> Eira's hands trembled as she prepared the meal, the dull safety pin still clutched in her palm. <words>320</words> She placed the pin on the table, a silent promise to herself that she would not let fear control her any longer. <words>342</words> As the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the orchard, Eira sat down to eat, the silence around her slowly breaking. <words>368</words> With each bite, she felt a sense of peace, a connection to the world and the generations that had come before her. <words>395</words> The meal was a beginning, a step towards overcoming her crippling fear, and a reminder that even in the silence, there was always a way forward. <words>425</words>
