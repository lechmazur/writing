In the capsule hotel for time travelers, where the walls whispered secrets of the past and the air hummed with the static of displaced moments, a dutiful scholar named Lin found solace in the quiet. <words>34</words> Amid the calm that settled before a crucial test, Lin's mind wandered to the small wire coil he had discovered in an ancient library, a relic that seemed to hum with a life of its own. <words>72</words> It was an uncommonly typical object, yet it held a peculiar allure, as if it were a key to unlocking something profound and forbidden. <words>104</words> Lin's fingers traced the coil's intricate patterns, each loop a reminder of the unspoken heart that beat within the fabric of time. <words>132</words> The scholar's duty was to preserve the integrity of the timeline, to ensure that no one contaminated the past with their own desires or regrets. <words>168</words> Yet, as he stood at the edge of the old well in the hotel's courtyard, the echo of a voice from long ago resonated within him, a voice that spoke of a tale that had never been told. <words>211</words> The well, deep and dark, seemed to beckon, its depths a mirror to the uncharted territories of the soul. <words>235</words> Lin knew that to let this forbidden tale be told was to risk everything, to challenge the very foundations of his duty and the order of the universe. <words>271</words> But the coil in his hand pulsed with a gentle insistence, a reminder that sometimes, the heart's unspoken truths must be heard. <words>303</words> With a deep breath, Lin lowered the coil into the well, letting it fall into the darkness, where it would carry the echo of the voice, contaminating the past with a story that had waited too long to be told. <words>356</words> As the coil disappeared, the well's echo grew louder, a symphony of whispers that filled the air with the earthbound flight of a tale finally free. <words>398</words> Lin stood there, a dutiful scholar no longer bound by silence, his heart light with the knowledge that sometimes, the unspoken must be spoken. <words>436</words>
