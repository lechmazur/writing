In the hush after a car backfires in a silent street, the weary undertaker, Zahir, stepped into the ancient Persian palace, its grandeur a stark contrast to the desolate world outside. <words>34</words> The palace, reimagined with intricate mosaics and towering arches, was a sanctuary of forgotten knowledge, a place where the past whispered through the stones. <words>56</words> Zahir’s eyes were drawn to the astronomical clock, a marvel of ancient engineering, its gears and dials a testament to the ingenuity of those who had once walked these halls. <words>85</words> The clock, rarely practical in its complexity, was a symbol of the tribal knowledge that had been passed down through generations, a knowledge that Zahir now sought to preserve. <words>118</words> He moved with a purpose, his steps echoing through the vast chambers, the weight of his task heavy on his shoulders. <words>138</words> The palace was a labyrinth, and Zahir knew that to find what he sought, he must follow the sun paths, a method as ancient as the stones themselves. <words>164</words> Each turn, each corridor, was a step closer to the heart of the palace, where the secrets of the past lay hidden. <words>182</words> The sun, now setting, cast long shadows that danced along the walls, guiding Zahir deeper into the palace’s depths. <words>201</words> As he approached the inner sanctum, the air grew thick with the scent of incense, a reminder of the rituals that had once been performed here. <words>222</words> The door to the sanctum was sealed, but Zahir knew the way, his hands moving with practiced ease to unlock the ancient mechanism. <words>242</words> Inside, the room was bathed in a soft, golden light, the astronomical clock at its center, its hands frozen in time. <words>260</words> Zahir approached the clock, his fingers tracing the intricate engravings, each one a story, a piece of the tribal knowledge that he had sworn to protect. <words>282</words> As he stood there, the weight of his mission pressing down on him, he realized that the clock was not just a timepiece, but a key to the future. <words>304</words> In the absolute dark, the clock was a beacon of hope, a reminder that even in the most desperate of times, there was a way forward. <words>326</words> Zahir made his decision, knowing that to hold onto hope, he must imprison the knowledge within the clock, safeguarding it for those who would come after him. <words>354</words> With a final, reverent touch, he set the clock’s gears in motion, the mechanism whirring to life, the hands beginning to turn once more. <words>376</words> As the last light of the sun faded, Zahir left the palace, the weight of his task lighter, the hope within him burning bright. <words>400</words>
