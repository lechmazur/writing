<story>The forthright peddler, Silas, his face etched with the joyful loneliness of a thousand star systems, entered the abandoned space station medical bay. <words>22</words> The universe hummed its secret song, a low thrum that vibrated through the metal floor, as Silas surveyed the decaying equipment. <words>34</words> He clutched a dried flower bouquet, its colors faded but still holding a hint of the vibrant life they once represented. <words>47</words> Silas wasn't here for salvage; he was here to break an oath sealed in blood, a promise that had haunted him for cycles. <words>61</words> He was meekly assertive, his voice a soft rumble that belied the steel in his resolve. <words>71</words> He began to divide the bouquet, carefully separating each stem, each petal, as if they were precious artifacts. <words>84</words> His method was unusual: he sifted through rumor-laden gossip columns, the digital remnants of the station's former inhabitants, searching for clues. <words>100</words> Each flower represented a person, a life he had been complicit in ending, a debt he now sought to repay. <words>114</words> The gossip columns, filled with half-truths and exaggerations, were his only guide to finding the families of those he had wronged. <words>130</words> He read of a scientist, a botanist, whose research had been stolen, her life cut short, and he matched a withered bluebell to her name. <words>149</words> Another column spoke of a security guard, a father of three, who had been silenced for knowing too much, and Silas carefully placed a dried rose beside his name. <words>170</words> The medical bay, once a place of healing, now echoed with the ghosts of those who had died here, their stories whispered in the static of the old comms system. <words>189</words> Silas, with each flower he separated, felt a weight lift from his soul, a small step on his redemption's path. <words>203</words> He wasn't trying to erase his past, but to acknowledge it, to make amends in the only way he knew how. <words>217</words> The joyful loneliness he felt wasn't a burden, but a companion, a reminder of the long journey he had undertaken. <words>232</words> He imagined the faces of the families, their grief, their anger, and he knew that his task was far from over. <words>247</words> He would use the information he gleaned from the gossip columns to track them down, to offer them what little solace he could. <words>264</words> He would tell them the truth, not to seek forgiveness, but to give them the closure they deserved. <words>277</words> The dried flower bouquet, once a symbol of his guilt, was now a map, a guide on his path to redemption. <words>292</words> He carefully placed each flower in a small, sealed container, ready to be delivered to its rightful recipient. <words>305</words> The universe continued to hum its secret song, a melody of sorrow and hope, as Silas prepared to leave the abandoned station. <words>321</words> He knew that the road ahead would be long and arduous, but he was no longer the man who had made the oath. <words>337</words> He was a peddler of truth, a seeker of justice, and he would not rest until his debt was paid. <words>351</words> The meekly assertive peddler, his heart filled with a strange mix of sorrow and purpose, stepped back into the vastness of space. <words>368</words> He carried with him not only the dried flowers, but the weight of his past and the hope for a better future. <words>383</words> The joyful loneliness that had once defined him was now a source of strength, a reminder of the path he had chosen. <words>399</words> He was on his way, one flower, one truth, one step at a time, towards the redemption he so desperately sought. <words>415</words>
