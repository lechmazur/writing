<story>The fluorescent lights of the abandoned spaceport hangar hummed, a discordant lullaby in the hush before the acceptance speech began. <words>19</words>  Elara, a professional cuddler, adjusted the worn fabric of her unusually usual cardigan, the one she always wore for these pre-speech jitters. <words>33</words>  She wasn't here for the speech, of course; she was here for the quiet, the space between the words, the unspoken rules of this strange, liminal place. <words>50</words>  Sheâ€™d found it by chance, a detour on her way back from the farmer's market, a place where the scent of overripe peaches still clung to her fingers. <words>68</words>  The hangar, once a bustling hub of interstellar travel, was now a monument to decay, its metal skin peeling like sunburnt flesh. <words>82</words>  She wandered deeper, the echo of her footsteps a lonely counterpoint to the expectant silence outside. <words>94</words>  Then she saw him, a man hunched over a rusted console, his fingers tracing the outline of something small and metallic. <words>110</words>  He looked up, startled, and Elara saw the glint of something ancient in his eyes, a novelty that belied his age. <words>125</words>  He held up a phantom train ticket punch, its metal cold and smooth, a relic of a time when travel was a tangible thing. <words>141</words>  "They say it still works," he whispered, his voice raspy, "if you know the rules." <words>153</words>  Elara, who made a living navigating the unspoken rules of human touch, felt a strange pull towards this man and his strange object. <words>170</words>  She had always been judged for her profession, seen as someone who offered a cheap imitation of intimacy, a prejudice she carried like a heavy cloak. <words>189</words>  But here, in this decaying space, with this man and his phantom punch, she felt a flicker of something else, a possibility of connection beyond the usual. <words>209</words>  He explained that the punch only worked on those who understood the unspoken rules of the spaceport, the echoes of its past. <words>225</words>  He demonstrated, pressing the punch against the console, and a faint hum resonated through the hangar, a sound that seemed to vibrate in Elara's bones. <words>245</words>  She realized that the rules weren't about the spaceport, but about the shared human experience, the unspoken language of longing and connection. <words>263</words>  The decay around them wasn't just physical; it was the decay of understanding, the erosion of empathy. <words>277</words>  She reached out, not for a cuddle, but for the punch, her fingers brushing his, a spark of understanding passing between them. <words>294</words>  He didn't flinch, didn't recoil, but instead, he smiled, a genuine smile that reached his eyes, a smile that said, "I see you." <words>313</words>  Elara took the punch, the cold metal a grounding force in the swirling emotions of the moment. <words>326</words>  She pressed it against the console, and the hum intensified, a symphony of shared understanding filling the hangar. <words>341</words>  The prejudice she carried began to crumble, replaced by a sense of belonging, a feeling that she was finally seen, not as a professional cuddler, but as a human being. <words>364</words>  The acceptance speech began outside, but here, in the heart of the decaying spaceport, a different kind of acceptance had already taken place. <words>382</words>  The ancient novelty of the phantom punch had unlocked something within her, a recognition that connection could be found in the most unexpected places, even in the hush before a speech. <words>405</words>  She looked at the man, a silent understanding passing between them, a shared secret in the heart of the abandoned hangar. <words>421</words>
