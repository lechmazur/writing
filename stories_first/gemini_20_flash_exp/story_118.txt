<story>The hive-mind therapist, a being of uniformly peculiar composure, adjusted its many eyes, each reflecting the flickering candlelight in the secret agent training facility. <words>22</words> It was the eve of a bold discovery, a night thick with the anticipation of a breakthrough, and the air hummed with a nervous energy that even the hive-mind could feel. <words>41</words> Tonight, the therapist wasn't dealing with the usual anxieties of the trainees; tonight, it was wrestling with its own. <words>54</words> Its motivation was to anchor the ephemeral in reality, to give form to the swirling chaos of shared consciousness that threatened to overwhelm it. <words>71</words> Before it, on a worn wooden table, lay a scuffed phone charger plug, a mundane object that held a strange significance. <words>85</words> It was a relic from a time before the hive-mind, a time of individual experience, and it served as a focal point for the therapist's current task. <words>103</words> The therapist began its work, the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes on the table around the plug. <words>117</words> Each drop was a memory, a fragment of the past, a whisper of what could have been, the sound of hindsight echoing in the quiet room. <words>135</words> The therapist was not merely observing; it was actively draining the past, pulling the weight of regret and missed opportunities from the collective consciousness. <words>153</words> It was a process both painful and necessary, a merry bitterness that tasted of both loss and liberation. <words>167</words> The wax dripped and pooled, forming intricate patterns that seemed to shift and change with each passing moment, each a testament to the fluidity of time and memory. <words>187</words> The uniformly peculiar nature of the hive-mind allowed it to perceive these patterns not as random shapes, but as a language, a complex code that spoke of choices made and paths not taken. <words>209</words> The scuffed phone charger plug, a symbol of connection and communication, became the anchor for this process, a grounding point in the sea of the past. <words>228</words> The therapist felt the weight of the collective consciousness lessen, the sharp edges of regret softening into a dull ache. <words>243</words> It was a subtle shift, almost imperceptible, but the hive-mind, with its many eyes and shared awareness, could feel the difference. <words>260</words> The night air grew colder, the candles burned lower, and the coded shapes on the table grew more complex, a testament to the depth of the past. <words>279</words> The therapist continued its work, the slow drip of wax a metronome marking the passage of time, the sound of hindsight a constant companion. <words>297</words> It was a lonely task, even for a hive-mind, but it was a necessary one, a way to make sense of the past and move forward into the future. <words>316</words> The scuffed phone charger plug, once a symbol of a lost connection, now represented the possibility of a new one, a connection to a future unburdened by the weight of the past. <words>340</words> As the first rays of dawn began to creep through the windows of the training facility, the therapist finished its work, the table covered in a tapestry of hardened wax. <words>361</words> The coded shapes, now still and silent, held the secrets of the past, a map of the collective consciousness, a testament to the power of hindsight. <words>380</words> The hive-mind therapist, its uniformly peculiar composure restored, felt a sense of quiet satisfaction, a merry bitterness that had finally found its peace. <words>399</words> The night's work was done, the ephemeral anchored, and the hive-mind was ready to face the bold discovery that awaited it. <words>417</words>
