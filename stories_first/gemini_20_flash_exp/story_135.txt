He had to document them, to preserve them, to ensure that they wouldn't be lost forever <words>220</words>. The cold seeped into his bones, but Silas didn't falter; he continued to trace the faded lines, his breath misting in the frigid air <words>236</words>. He was not just a brewer; he was a keeper of stories, a guardian of the past, and he would withstand any hardship to fulfill his purpose <words>255</words>.

He would continue to trace the lines, to decipher the whispers, to bring the lost paths back into the light, one faint bruise at a time <words>380</words>.
