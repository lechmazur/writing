He imagined the faces of the players, their eyes wide with curiosity, as he unveiled his creation, a game born from the city's resilience and his own peculiar brand of ambition <words>228</words>. The Molar wasn't just a vigilante; he was a curator of forgotten joys, a testament to the enduring power of play, even in the most desolate of places <words>247</words>.
