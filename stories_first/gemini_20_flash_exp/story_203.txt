<story>Sister Agnes, an exorcist whose hands trembled more before a crowd than a demon, clutched the pressed wildflowers, their fragile beauty a stark contrast to the cold, metallic walls of the orbital debris she called home. <words>29</words> This wasn't the usual setting for her work, not by a long shot; most exorcists preferred the musty confines of ancient churches, not the silent, spinning graveyard of forgotten satellites. <words>50</words> She’d inherited this life, this strange, isolated existence, along with the lies that had built it, a legacy she was determined to dismantle. <words>68</words> Her grandmother, a renowned exorcist herself, had claimed this place was a sanctuary, a place to escape the prying eyes of the world, but Agnes suspected it was more of a prison, a gilded cage built on a foundation of deceit. <words>99</words> Today, amid the rhythmic clatter of toy assembly – a bizarre side hustle she’d picked up to keep her mind occupied – she felt the familiar tremor of stage fright, a cold sweat prickling her skin. <words>124</words> She wasn't facing a crowd, but the entity she was about to confront was far more terrifying than any audience. <words>140</words> The entity, a manifestation of her family's lies, was drawn to the sound of a key turning in a lock, a specific, ancient lock that secured a hidden compartment in the debris. <words>165</words> Agnes knew this, had learned it from the cryptic notes her grandmother had left behind, notes that hinted at a power that could be both destructive and transformative. <words>188</words> She took a deep breath, the defiant hush of her resolve settling over her like a cloak, and inserted the key, the metallic click echoing in the confined space. <words>210</words> As the lock turned, a low hum filled the air, and the entity began to coalesce, a swirling mass of shadows and whispers. <words>227</words> Agnes, her heart pounding, didn't falter; she knew what she had to do, what she had always been meant to do. <words>243</words> She had to submerge herself in the entity, not to be consumed, but to understand, to unravel the tangled threads of her family's past. <words>262</words> She closed her eyes, the pressed wildflowers clutched tightly in her hand, and stepped into the swirling darkness, the cold of the entity a stark contrast to the warmth of the flowers. <words>286</words> This wasn't about vanquishing a demon; it was about sculpting possibility from the ashes of “never,” about rewriting the narrative of her life, about forging her own truth. <words>310</words> She would not be defined by the lies of her ancestors; she would be the architect of her own destiny, a defiant whisper in the vast emptiness of space. <words>333</words> The entity pulsed around her, its whispers trying to pull her under, but Agnes held firm, her resolve fueled by the fragile beauty of the wildflowers and the burning desire to break free. <words>359</words> She would not be a victim of her inheritance; she would be its master, transforming the darkness into light, the lies into truth, the never into now. <words>382</words> The toy assembly clattered on, a strange, mechanical counterpoint to the cosmic battle raging within her, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit, even in the most unusual of circumstances. <words>410</words> She was an exorcist, yes, but she was also a sculptor, a weaver of possibilities, a defiant whisper in the face of the void, and she would not be silenced. <words>436</words>
