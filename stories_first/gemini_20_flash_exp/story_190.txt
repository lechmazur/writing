Elias, a cautious smuggler by trade, fidgeted with the pressed butterfly tucked inside his worn leather jacket <words>28</words>.

He heard the rustling of dry leaves, the whisper of wind through parched fields, the silent scream of the dying earth, all translated into a strange, haunting melody <words>224</words>. Elias closed his eyes, letting the music wash over him, the butterfly pressed against his chest, a tangible link to the painter's subconscious <words>240</words>. He began to predict, not just the weather, but the very heart of the drought, the desperation that drove men to madness, the hope that flickered like a dying ember <words>260</words>. He saw the patterns, the subtle shifts in the wind, the way the light fell on the cracked earth, all echoing the painter's delirious symphony <words>278</words>. The drought wasn't just a meteorological event; it was a symphony of suffering, and Elias, the cautious smuggler, was finally learning to conduct it <words>296</words>.
