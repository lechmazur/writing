The faded tapestry fragment hanging on the wall behind him whispered tales of glory and defeat, a constant reminder of what could be. <words>61</words>

With a deep breath, he began to hum the traditional song, the notes flowing from him like a river breaking through a dam. <words>273</words>
The courtyard seemed to come alive, the calligraphy master's brushes dancing in the air as if moved by an unseen force. <words>293</words>

As the last note of the song faded, the tapestry fragment seemed to glow, its colors vibrant once more. <words>348</words>
The swordsman knew then that he had found his purpose, his potential unshackled at last. <words>365</words>
With a final nod to the calligraphy master, he stepped out of the courtyard, ready to face whatever lay ahead with a newfound resolve. <words>393</words>
The harsh tenderness of his journey had transformed him, and he was now truly doubtfully confident. <words>411</words>
