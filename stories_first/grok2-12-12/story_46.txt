In the orchard of giant ferns overshadowed by waterfalls, a blank-faced performer practiced her piano during the twilight hours. <words>17</words> Her fingers danced across the keys with a uniquely typical precision, each note a step in her quest to learn the language of dreams. <words>44</words> The performer, known only as the Guardian of Rumors, was on a mission that required her to track the moon paths, a method she believed would unlock the secrets she sought. <words>80</words> As the moon rose above the cascading waters, casting a silver glow over the ferns, she played on, her music blending with the sound of the falls in a symphony of precise madness. <words>124</words>
