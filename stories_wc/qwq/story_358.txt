In the arctic research greenhouse, time seemed to stand still, especially amid playground time, when the usual hum of scientific inquiry gave way to a serene silence. Here, in this unlikely setting, an old-fashioned mage found solace, his purposefully aimless wanderings leading him to the heart of the glass-enclosed sanctuary. The air was crisp, filled with the scent of exotic flora thriving against the odds, their leaves glistening under artificial lights that mimicked the sun's warmth.

It was during one such aimless stroll that he stumbled upon a fragment of a pharaoh’s coffin, resting incongruously among the potted plants. The artifact, weathered yet imbued with an ancient aura, seemed out of place in this modern, scientific environment. Curiosity piqued, the mage approached it, his steps slow and measured, as if treading on sacred ground.

As he neared the fragment, he noticed something peculiar: the surface of the coffin piece was etched with symbols that seemed to shimmer faintly, almost as if they held some hidden power. His fingers traced the intricate designs, and for a moment, he felt a tingling sensation, a whisper of magic that spoke to his very soul.

Determined to unravel the mystery, the mage decided to employ an unconventional method: through ephemeral encounters with mirror reflections. He believed that by gazing into mirrors placed strategically around the greenhouse, he could catch glimpses of the past, fragments of memories tied to the pharaoh’s coffin.

Over the following days, he set up mirrors in various positions, each reflecting different angles of the artifact. As he looked into these mirrors, he began to see fleeting images—visions of a bygone era, of a pharaoh in all his regal glory, and of rituals long forgotten. Each reflection offered a piece of the puzzle, but the images were transient, like shadows dancing on water.

Despite the challenges, the mage was undeterred. His motivation was clear: to claim an uncharted frontier, to explore realms of magic and history that had remained untouched for centuries. He saw this as his calling, his chance to make a lasting impact in a world that often dismissed such pursuits as outdated or irrelevant.

However, with each new discovery, a sense of sanctified dread crept over him. He realized that the power contained within the coffin fragment was both immense and dangerous. The more he delved into its secrets, the more he understood the responsibility that came with unlocking such ancient magic.

One evening, as the greenhouse fell into darkness, save for the soft glow of emergency lights, the mage found himself drawn once again to the coffin fragment. He picked it up, cradling it in his hands as one might cuddle a long-lost friend. In that moment, the artifact seemed to pulse with life, responding to his touch.

Suddenly, the mirrors around the room began to flicker, their surfaces distorting as if disturbed by unseen forces. The mage watched in awe as the reflections coalesced into a single, coherent image: a vision of the pharaoh himself, standing in his tomb, surrounded by treasures and guarded by supernatural entities.

The pharaoh’s eyes locked onto the mage’s through the mirror, and for an instant, their gazes met across millennia. Then, just as abruptly, the vision vanished, leaving the mage with more questions than answers.

In that moment, he understood that the unfolding riddle of the coffin fragment was far from solved. It was merely the beginning of a journey that would test his resolve, challenge his beliefs, and perhaps, change the course of his life forever.
