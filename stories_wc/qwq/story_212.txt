Alright, I have this set of elements to weave into a story: an apocalyptic farmer breeding new seeds, a magician’s deck of trick cards, the song of boundaries, typically atypical, jabber, through the messages in a bottle carried by the sea, ethereal plains, after the last resource war, to escape a life dictated by another, raw solace. It's a diverse mix, and my goal is to create a cohesive, engaging story that incorporates all of these elements naturally.

First, I need to establish the setting. It's after the last resource war, which suggests a post-apocalyptic world where resources are scarce, and people have had to adapt to survive. The setting is ethereal plains, which could mean a place that's both beautiful and otherworldly, perhaps a stark contrast to the devastation of the war.

The main character is an apocalyptic farmer breeding new seeds. This farmer is likely trying to rebuild agriculture in this new world, perhaps experimenting with new types of plants that can thrive in the altered environment. The fact that he's breeding new seeds implies innovation and resilience.

Now, introducing a magician’s deck of trick cards seems a bit out of place at first, but maybe there's a reason for it. Perhaps the farmer has a hidden talent for magic or uses the cards for entertainment to lift spirits in his community. Alternatively, the cards could hold some symbolic or practical value in this new world.

The "song of boundaries" is an interesting element. It could represent a literal song that defines or crosses certain limits, perhaps cultural, physical, or even magical boundaries. It might be something the farmer listens to or creates as a form of expression.

"Typically atypical" suggests that the farmer is unusual in some way, perhaps in his approach to farming or his personality. He might not conform to the norms of his society, which could be a driving force in his actions.

"Jabber" could refer to his manner of speaking—perhaps he talks a lot, maybe in a nervous or excited manner. This could be a trait that endears him to others or sets him apart.

"Through the messages in a bottle carried by the sea" introduces an element of communication across distances, perhaps connecting the farmer to others who are far away. The sea could be a central feature of this ethereal plains setting, allowing for this unique form of correspondence.

The farmer's motivation is to escape a life dictated by another, suggesting that he's seeking independence and freedom. Maybe he was once under the control of a authoritative figure or system and is now striving to live on his own terms.

The tone is "raw solace," which seems like a contradiction but could indicate a comfort found in the harsh realities of the post-apocalyptic world. It's about finding peace in the midst of difficulty.

Let me start piecing this together.

<story>

On the ethereal plains, where the sky stretched infinitely above, Apollyn tended to his fields, a solitary figure in a world reborn after the last resource war. <words>42</words>

The soil, once barren, now bore signs of life—sprouts of experimental seeds he'd bred, each one a testament to his resilience. <words>57</words>

Apollyn was typically atypical, his methods often questioned but his results undeniable. He believed in pushing boundaries, in creating something new from the ashes of the old world. <words>75</words>

In his pocket, a worn deck of magician’s trick cards jingled with every step. They were a gift from a traveling performer who had passed through the plains, leaving behind more than just entertainment. <words>93</words>

He'd learned a few tricks himself, not with sleight of hand but with words. Jabbering to his plants, he claimed it helped them grow, a notion his neighbors found amusing but didn't dismiss entirely. <words>111</words>

One day, as he worked, a bottle washed up at the edge of his field, carried by the sea that bordered the plains. Inside was a message, ink smudged but legible: "Seek the song of boundaries. It will set you free." <words>134</words>

Apollyn pondered this. The song of boundaries—was it a real thing, or just a phrase? He decided to interpret it as a call to explore the uncharted areas beyond his familiar plains. <words>152</words>

But more pressing was his desire to escape a life dictated by another. Ever since the war, the council had imposed strict regulations on farming, dictating what could be grown and how. Apollyn chafed under their control, yearning for autonomy. <words>175</words>

He decided to send his own message in a bottle, expressing his intentions and hopes. Maybe someone out there felt the same way. <words>186</words>

As days turned into weeks, Apollyn continued his work, sometimes singing to his crops, a raw solace in his voice that seemed to mirror the plains' quiet beauty. <words>203</words>

Then, another bottle appeared, this one containing a small seed pod and a note: "Plant it with intention. The song lies within." <words>218</words>

Intrigued, Apollyn planted the pod in his field, surrounding it with his other experimental seeds. He talked to it, jabbered encouragement, and waited. <words>233</words>

Months later, a plant unlike any other emerged. Its leaves were iridescent, and it produced a flower that hummed with a gentle melody, a song that seemed to vibrate with the essence of freedom. <words>252</words>

Apollyn realized that this was the song of boundaries, a living embodiment of breaking constraints and growing beyond limits. He shared his discovery with the council, but they dismissed it as unnatural. <words>271</words>

Undeterred, Apollyn continued to cultivate the plant, using its seeds to create a whole field of singing flowers. The melody carried on the wind, a beacon of hope and defiance. <words>288</words>

One night, under the vast sky, Apollyn played with his trick cards, performing a magic show for the few who had gathered. As he concluded with a flourish, he announced his plan to leave the plains, to seek a place where he could live without dictates, where he could truly be free. <words>309</words>

His audience was silent, some with tears in their eyes, others with looks of admiration. Apollyn had given them a taste of what could be, beyond the boundaries they'd accepted as unchangeable. <words>326</words>

As he prepared to embark on his journey, he wrote one last message in a bottle: "Freedom is not just a place; it's a song we sing together. Find your note and join in." He cast it into the sea, watching as it drifted away, carrying his hope to those who would listen. <words>347</words>

And so, Apollyn walked away from the ethereal plains, the song of boundaries echoing in his heart, a raw solace that guided him towards a future of his own making. <words>360</words>
