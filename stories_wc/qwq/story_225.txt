Alright, I have this prompt to create a story incorporating a bunch of specific elements. It seems a bit challenging, but I think I can make it work. Let's see...

So, the main character is a "wayward apothecary." That sounds interesting. An apothecary is like an old-timey pharmacist, right? And "wayward" suggests that this person is maybe a bit rebellious or doesn't follow the rules. Maybe they've been expelled from the apothecary guild or something like that. That could give them a motive for being on a steampunk submarine, which is the setting.

The object is a "dry highlighter pen." That's curious. In a steampunk world, pens might be different, but a highlighter pen that's dry doesn't seem very useful. Maybe it's a family heirloom or has some sentimental value. Or perhaps it has a hidden compartment with a message or something.

The core concept is "unconventional love." So, there must be some kind of romantic element in the story, but it's not going to be your typical boy-meets-girl scenario. Maybe the apothecary falls in love with someone unexpected, like another crew member on the submarine or even the submarine itself, if that makes sense.

The attribute is "unjustly fair." I'm not entirely sure what that means. Maybe the character is perceived as fair by others, but there's some underlying injustice or unfairness in their situation. Or perhaps they are fair in their dealings but face unfair treatment from others.

The action is "infect." That sounds a bit violent, but in context, maybe it means to influence or spread an idea. Maybe the apothecary is trying to infect someone with their love or their ideas about medicine or something.

The method is "through morse code signals." So, communication is key here. Maybe the apothecary can't speak openly due to some constraint, so they use morse code to communicate their feelings or their plans.

The setting is a "steampunk submarine observation deck." That sounds like a great backdrop. Steampunk means it's got lots of gears and steam-powered machinery. A submarine observation deck would be a windowed area where you can look out at the ocean depths. Maybe there are periscopes or other instruments there.

The timeframe is "between broken treaties." So, there's some political tension going on. Maybe countries or factions have broken treaties, and this is during a period of instability or even war.

The motivation is "to track migratory butterflies." That's really specific and interesting. In a steampunk world, maybe butterflies have some special property, like their migratory patterns indicate valuable resources or something. Or maybe the apothecary is studying them for medicinal purposes.

The tone is "battered marvel." That suggests that despite wear and tear, there's still something wonderful and amazing about the setting or the character. Maybe the submarine is old and beaten up but still functions marvelously.

Alright, let's try to weave all these elements into a coherent story.

<story>

The wayward apothecary, Elara, stood at the steampunk submarine's observation deck, her eyes fixed on the migratory butterflies dancing in the ocean's twilight zone. Between the broken treaties, this was her sanctuary, a battered marvel of gears and steam, gliding silently through the depths. She had been expelled from the apothecary guild for her unorthodox methods, but her passion for medicine burned brighter than ever.

In her pocket, a dry highlighter pen—a relic from her childhood—served as a reminder of simpler times. Little did she know, it held a secret that could change everything. The pen's body was hollow, containing a tiny roll of paper with morse code signals, a message from her past that could expose the true reasons behind the treaties' collapse.

Elara's mission was to track the migratory patterns of the butterflies, which were believed to carry pollen from underwater flora, essential for certain medicines. But there was more to it; she suspected that the butterflies were being manipulated, their routes altered by unknown forces, possibly linked to the broken treaties.

As she observed the butterflies, she noticed a pattern in their flight, reminiscent of morse code. Could they be communicating? The idea was preposterous, yet her scientific mind couldn't dismiss it entirely. Perhaps, through some evolutionary quirk, the butterflies had developed a way to signal each other, and possibly, to others.

On the submarine, tensions were high. The crew was a mix of misfits and exiles, bound together by necessity more than camaraderie. Among them was Thorne, the chief engineer, whose unjustly fair reputation masked a deep-seated resentment towards those who had wronged him. Elara found herself drawn to his quiet strength and the way his eyes sparkled when he talked about the submarine's mechanics.

One night, as the submarine navigated through a swarm of butterflies, Elara noticed that the creatures were clustering around the periscope. Intrigued, she decided to investigate. Using her knowledge of apothecary and some quick thinking, she created a device that could translate the butterflies' movements into morse code signals.

As she decoded the messages, she realized that the butterflies were being infected—with information, perhaps, or even a subtle form of control. The signals pointed to a location where the treaties had been brokered, suggesting that there was more to the butterflies than met the eye.

Elara shared her findings with Thorne, and together, they devised a plan to investigate the location indicated by the butterflies. But time was running out; the political climate was volatile, and their actions could have far-reaching consequences.

In the end, it was their unconventional love for each other and for their cause that drove them forward. They faced numerous challenges, from mechanical failures to hostile encounters, but their bond remained unbroken.

As they neared their destination, Elara held the dry highlighter pen tightly, its significance now profound. It represented not just her past, but the key to unlocking the mysteries of the butterflies and, perhaps, restoring justice to a world torn apart by broken treaties.
