In the hush of a deserted intersection late at night, a cold-natured knight, lawfully rebellious in his own right, found a child’s lost mitten. It was a simple thing, really—a small, worn glove, probably cotton, maybe wool, its mate long since lost or abandoned. He picked it up, feeling the softness against his gloved hand, and for a moment, he was transported. Not to a battlefield or a throne room, but to a quiet, snow-covered village where children laughed and played, their mittens flapping in the wind. It was an artistic awakening, unexpected and profound.

He had been on a mission, a secret one, at the agent center. His cover was that of a knight, upholding the law, but his true purpose was to collect folk remedies, ancient knowledge passed down through generations, hidden in plain sight among the common folk. The mitten, he thought, could be a symbol, a clue, leading him to the information he sought.

As he walked, the mitten clutched in his hand, he noticed the incomplete family altars scattered around the city. These were places where families would set up shrines, photos, and mementos of loved ones, but many were incomplete, missing pieces, like the mitten he held. It was a poignant sight, a city full of longing and loss.

He decided to support these families, to help complete their altars, perhaps in exchange for the folk remedies he was collecting. It was a risky move, stepping outside his mission parameters, but he felt compelled. Maybe it was the mitten, reminding him of childhood, of innocence lost.

At one altar, a young woman tended to the shrine, adding a fresh flower to a photo of her brother. He approached her, the mitten in hand. “I found this near here,” he said, offering it to her. “I thought it might belong to your brother.”

She took it, tears welling up in her eyes. “Yes, thank you. He loved that mitten.” She looked at him, curiosity in her gaze. “You’re a knight, aren’t you? What brings you here?”

He hesitated, then decided to be honest. “I’m collecting folk remedies, ancient knowledge. I believe your community has some wisdom to share.”

She nodded, understanding. “We do. In exchange for your kindness, I can show you some of our remedies. But you have to promise to keep them safe, to use them for good.”

He agreed, and she led him to a small cottage on the edge of the city. Inside, it was warm and filled with herbs, potions, and ancient texts. She taught him about natural cures, about the power of plants and the importance of community.

As he left that night, he felt a sense of closeness, not just to the woman but to the city and its people. His mission had expanded beyond collecting remedies; he was now supporting a community, helping to heal not just physical ailments but emotional wounds.

The mitten, once lost, had become a symbol of connection, of the human need for warmth and belonging. He realized that sometimes, the greatest battles aren’t fought with swords, but with acts of kindness and understanding.

And so, the cold-natured knight, lawfully rebellious, continued his journey, armed with knowledge and compassion, ready to face whatever came next.
