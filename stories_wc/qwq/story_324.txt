Alright, I have this prompt to create a story incorporating all these specific elements: an insecure advisor, a brain in a jar labeled "duplicate," the dreamer's calling, something that's clearly ambiguous, an action of jabbing, a method involving the echo of footsteps in an abandoned place, set in secret agent headquarters, in the hush of a simmering future, motivated by chasing a rumor beyond all reason, with a fractured idyll tone. And it needs to be between 320 and 360 words.

First, I need to understand how all these elements can fit together in a coherent story. Let's start by sketching a basic plot.

Setting: Secret agent headquarters in a future that's described as "simmering," which probably means it's tense, on the brink of something. Maybe a coming conflict or a society teetering between order and chaos.

Character: An insecure advisor. This person likely works within the headquarters, perhaps providing strategic advice or intelligence analysis. Their insecurity could make them vulnerable or prone to doubt, which might affect their decisions.

Object: A brain in a jar labeled "duplicate." This sounds like some kind of scientific experiment or artifact. Maybe it's related to the main conflict or holds key information.

Core Concept: The dreamer's calling. This could refer to a vision or a mission that the main character is driven by, perhaps something they've dreamed of achieving.

Attribute: Clearly ambiguous. This might be something that's supposed to be clear but is actually open to interpretation, adding confusion or tension to the story.

Action: Jab. This could be a physical action, like punching or stabbing, or perhaps a verbal jab, like making a sharp comment.

Method: Through the echo of footsteps in an abandoned place. This suggests movement in a deserted area, perhaps the advisor is moving through empty halls, and the echoes signify solitude or perhaps hint at being watched.

Motivation: To chase a rumor beyond all reason. The advisor is driven by a rumor, perhaps about the brain in a jar or related to their calling, and they're pursuing it even when it doesn't make sense to do so.

Tone: Fractured idyll. This seems like a contradictory tone: idyll suggests a peaceful, ideal setting, while fractured implies it's broken or imperfect. So, perhaps the story will have elements of both, maybe showing a once-ideal situation that's now deteriorating.

Given these elements, here's a possible storyline:

In the secret agent headquarters of a future world on the brink of conflict, an insecure advisor named Eli struggles with self-doubt as he navigates the echoey halls of the abandoned sections of the base. He's driven by a rumor he's heard about a "dreamer's calling," which he believes holds the key to his own purpose and perhaps even to saving the organization from impending doom. This rumor is ambiguous, meant to be clear but open to interpretation, which fuels Eli's confusion and determination.

During his quest, Eli stumbles upon a lab containing a brain in a jar labeled "duplicate." He's not sure what it is but feels it's connected to the rumor. As he examines it, he's jolted by a sudden realization or perhaps a physical jab, either from himself in frustration or from someone else who doesn't want him meddling in things beyond his understanding.

The action of jabbing could be literal, like someone trying to stop him, or metaphorical, like a sudden insight that stings or challenges him. The method of moving through the abandoned place with echoing footsteps heightens the sense of isolation and danger, emphasizing the fractured idyll of the once-mighty headquarters now falling into disrepair and secrecy.

Eli's motivation to chase this rumor beyond all reason stems from his insecurity; he seeks validation and a sense of belonging. His journey forces him to confront ambiguous clues and dangerous obstacles, testing his resolve and challenging his perceptions.

In the end, whether he succeeds or fails, Eli's quest will have deepened his understanding of himself and his place within the organization, perhaps revealing truths that are both idyllic and fractured, reflecting the complex nature of his world and his own identity.

Now, I need to write this story, ensuring it falls within the 320-360 word limit, integrating all the elements seamlessly.

<story>

Eli stood at the crossroads of his own uncertainty, the dimly lit corridor stretching before him like an endless question mark. The headquarters, once a beacon of efficiency and secrecy, now echoed with the hush of a simmering future, where every shadow held the promise of betrayal or salvation.

As an advisor, his contributions were often met with silence, his ideas drowned in the sea of more confident voices. Insecurity gnawed at him, but a rumor—a whisper of a dreamer's calling—had ignited something within. It was a beacon, ambiguous yet compelling, urging him to chase it beyond all reason.

He navigated the abandoned wings, footsteps echoing off cold walls, each sound a testament to the place's former glory and current decay. The air was thick with the scent of old technology and forgotten dreams.

In a lab shrouded in dust, he found it: a brain in a jar, labeled "duplicate." His heart pounded. Was this the key to the rumor? He reached out, fingers trembling, and touched the cool glass.

A sharp jab pierced the silence—a voice, harsh and urgent. "What are you doing here?" Startled, Eli spun around. A figure stepped from the shadows, eyes narrowed.

"Who are you?" Eli stammered, fear gripping him.

"The question is, who are you, prying into things beyond your understanding?" The figure advanced, each step echoing through the room.

Eli backed away, his mind racing. This was not part of the plan. The dreamer's calling was supposed to lead him to clarity, not confrontation.

"Please," he pleaded, "I mean no harm. I just need to understand."

"Understand what?" the figure sneered. "This is top secret. You shouldn't be here."

Eli's desperation fueled his next words. "I'm chasing a rumor. About a dreamer's calling. I believe it's connected to this."

The figure paused, considering. "Ambiguous, isn't it? Everything here is clearly labeled, yet nothing makes sense."

Eli nodded, relief washing over him. Maybe this person could help.

"But why are you here? This place is off-limits."

"I needed to see for myself. To find proof that my pursuit isn't in vain."

The figure studied him, then sighed. "Look, Eli, if that's your name, this isn't a game. The brain in the jar is a duplicate, created to house the thoughts of a high-ranking agent. It was meant to ensure continuity in case of... well, you know."

Eli's eyes widened. "So, it's real? The dreamer's calling—is it related to this project?"

The figure hesitated. "Perhaps. But you can't let this information out. It's too dangerous."

Eli nodded fervently. "I promise. I just need to know that I'm not crazy for following this lead."

With a final warning glance, the figure turned and left, footsteps fading into the echoing silence.

Alone again, Eli stared at the brain in the jar. It pulsed with life, a duplicate consciousness waiting to be awakened. His calling was clear now: to protect this secret, to ensure that the dreamer's potential was used for good.

The path ahead was fraught with ambiguity and danger, but Eli felt a newfound resolve. In the hush of the simmering future, he would stand his ground, insecure but determined, chasing rumors beyond reason to preserve the fractured idyll of his world.
