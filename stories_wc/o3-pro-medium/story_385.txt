During the quiet shift before sunrise in the hospital ward, Mallory Whitcombe hummed through disinfectant corridors.<words>16</words>
Her reputation as a pleasant meddler preceded her, yet patients still smiled when she rearranged their flowers.<words>33</words>
That morning, though, she carried a pair of rusted ice skates wrapped inside a sterile specimen bag.<words>50</words>
The skates had been dredged from beneath Pavilion Lake, their blades engraved with swirling glyphs she could not read.<words>69</words>
She suspected the symbols mapped scattered seeds of forgotten dynasties, a botanical code disguised as winter equipment.<words>86</words>
To decode them, Mallory believed she had to weaken the boundary between waking routine and visionary trance.<words>103</words>
Her method, learned from a retired neurologist, was oddly specific: travel via the receding footprints of a nighttime beach wanderer.<words>123</words>
Although the hospital occupied an obsidian skyscraper far from the shore, Mallory saw no contradiction.<words>138</words>
Lucid confusion was her natural climate, and she cultivated it like orchids in a sunless greenhouse.<words>154</words>
She switched off corridor lights, allowing only emergency beacons to sketch a hallway coastline of flickering tide.<words>171</words>
Then she slipped the skates on, rust flaking like dried blood, and pushed across polished linoleum.<words>187</words>
Every few meters, glowing sandy impressions appeared ahead, delicate arcs of toes retreating toward some inaudible surf.<words>204</words>
She followed, her blades singing, until the ward dissolved into a shoreline auditorium filled with briny antiseptic air.<words>222</words>
Footprints led to a solitary wheelchair, salt-encrusted, where an elderly man in nightgown watched constellations glued to the ceiling.<words>241</words>
Mallory recognized him: Dr. Archer, the neurologist who had retired after claiming tidewater could carry memories inland.<words>258</words>
"You've arrived precisely when the footprints end," he murmured, voice as brittle as the skates' rusted edge.<words>275</words>
He confessed that he, the wanderer, had seeded those glyphs across ice decades ago, hoping someone would listen.<words>293</words>
The hospital, he said, was merely the obsidian shell protecting a germinating archive of migratory thought.<words>309</words>
To open it, Mallory must scatter the translation like seeds into receptive minds, not hoard it in journals.<words>327</words>
She realized his wheelchair wheels formed circles identical to the skate engravings, a mobile cypher waiting to spin stories.<words>346</words>
But first, she needed leverage, so she became openly manipulative, praising his brilliance while gently shifting his chair.<words>364</words>
The motion aligned rusted blades with wheel rims, generating a soft magnetism that weakened the corridor's concrete certainty.<words>382</words>
Symbols on the skates pulsed, projecting diagrams of orchards, tides, and stars onto sterile curtains.<words>397</words>
Mallory, still humming, memorized the living constellations, ready to sow them at dawn among patients hungry for dreams.<words>415</words>
As the emergency beacons dimmed, she skated back toward reality, leaving new footprints for the next wanderer to pursue.<words>434</words>
