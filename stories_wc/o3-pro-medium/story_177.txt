<story>
Ink-laced boots thudded along the cedar plank, slipping between titles on the giant's bookshelf. <words>14</words>
Joryn, a traveler who wrote obituaries for the living, balanced on a dust-furred spine. <words>28</words>
His consistently rebellious quill twitched, eager to summarize tomorrow before tomorrow dared arrive. <words>41</words>
But tonight the air rattled with rumors of revolution murmured by moths nesting in chapter margins. <words>57</words>
The murmurs guided Joryn toward a gap where moonlight revealed a theater mask wedged like a bookmark. <words>74</words>
Its porcelain grin shifted to grief as he touched it, then to sly conspiracy when he listened. <words>91</words>
From behind the shelfboard rose a humming resonance, low as thunder yet shaped like a question. <words>107</words>
He pressed the mask to the wood, and an aperture manifested between the letters of a gilded title. <words>125</words>
Joryn slipped through, descending into a hidden pipe organ chamber carved inside the giantâ€™s hollow spine. <words>141</words>
Bronze pipes towered like stalagmites, their throats pulsing with the same melody that animated the mask. <words>157</words>
Every note opened another corridor, composing a living labyrinth of choices that rewrote itself mid-measure. <words>172</words>
Joryn understood the organ answered only to intentions voiced in lucid frenzy, not calm petitions. <words>187</words>
He closed his eyes and proclaimed the motive etched beneath his ribcage: to restore a lost art form. <words>205</words>
Centuries ago, obituarists had sung futures into being, but the craft had been outlawed as sedition. <words>221</words>
Now, amid insurrection whispers, the world needed that melody of grief and possibility once more. <words>236</words>
The mask warmed, its expression flickering between martyrdom and mischief like lanterns in high wind. <words>251</words>
Guided by rebellious instinct, Joryn slammed a fist against the largest pipe, letting the resonance speak. <words>267</words>
Words manifested from the vibration, ribboning into sentences that hovered as silver vapors above the keys. <words>283</words>
Each vapor became an obituary for a still-breathing dreamer somewhere on the uprising's front line. <words>298</words>
The obituaries foretold not death but the exact moment their subjects would choose courage over silence. <words>314</words>
Read aloud, they would detonate hearts into decisive song, igniting the revolution before tyrants could disarm it. <words>331</words>
Yet a wrong cadence could twist destiny into atrocity, and the labyrinth hissed reminders of peril. <words>347</words>
Joryn inhaled the metallic scent of ink and thunder, letting rebellion steady rather than shake him. <words>363</words>
He danced along the organ's pedals, translating obituary after obituary into chord and counterpoint. <words>377</words>
Behind him, the mask stabilized into a serene, defiant smile, approving every daring modulation. <words>391</words>
When the final note rang, scrolls of condensed mist coiled into his satchel like obedient dragons. <words>407</words>
These living obituaries would travel with him, ready to be read where courage most needed to manifest. <words>424</words>
The labyrinth folded itself silent, yet Joryn heard its promise echo through the ivory tubes. <words>439</words>
Restore the song, it whispered, and the living will finally write their own endings. <words>453</words>
With boots dripping starlight and a mask of unwavering rebellion, Joryn climbed back to the shelf-world above. <words>470</words>
Outside, dawn gathered like an audience, waiting for the music of obituary and uprising to begin. <words>486</words>
