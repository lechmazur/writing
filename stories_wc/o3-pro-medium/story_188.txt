Rain licked the mossy stone of the ancient Japanese castle, tasting like rusty memory. <words>14</words>
Satoru Kondo, once the region's uncompromising lawman, waited beneath a fractured torii. <words>26</words>
He carried vintage spectacles lacking a lens, tokens plucked from the wreckage of yesterday. <words>40</words>
Through the intact glass, the courtyard blurred like a ghost kneeling to plant seeds. <words>54</words>
The village was entering seed planting season, though famine rumors still prowled the alleys. <words>68</words>
He had come seeking harvests of peace, not grain, to escape a cycle of violence. <words>83</words>
But peace seemed probably improbable amid creaking gates and the stench of armored patrols. <words>97</words>
Tomorrow, shogunate inspectors would arrive, stirring old grudges like mud in the moat. <words>110</words>
Satoru touched the spectacles, reminding himself how fragile vision became when justice shattered. <words>123</words>
He remembered the shootout that cost his badge, his partner, and the missing lens. <words>137</words>
Ever since, he wandered Japan gathering broken pieces of stories, hoping they'd assemble absolution. <words>151</words>
A messenger's mistake finally promised such assembly. <words>158</words>
Yesterday, a misplaced letter had been slipped under his tatami, addressed to another S. <words>172</words>
Curiosity stirred like embers; he unsealed it and found a map of hidden armories. <words>186</words>
The writer begged the recipient to destroy the weapons before spring conscription swallowed more sons. <words>201</words>
Satoru realized the wrong address had chosen the right person. <words>211</words>
If he could scorch those caches, the cycle might finally starve. <words>222</words>
Night unfurled like black lacquer as he crept through corridors faded with corroded rapture. <words>236</words>
Every step echoed ancestral drums, stirring guards who mistook echoes for spirits and fled. <words>250</words>
Deep within the armory, swords lay like dormant vipers beside kegs of gunpowder. <words>263</words>
He gathered broken pieces of flint, mirrors, and regret, arranging a trail toward the sake barrels. <words>279</words>
One spark from his flint struck the mirror, igniting fumes that would swallow the vipers. <words>294</words>
He sprinted, vintage spectacles clutched, the castle behind him coughing fire into predawn drizzle. <words>308</words>
Villagers woke early for planting, mistaking the crimson glow for a merciful sunrise. <words>321</words>
Satoru revealed the letter, urging them to plow soil, not flesh; their eyes widened. <words>335</words>
They saw through his cracked lens a future where harvests replaced headcounts. <words>347</words>
Ash settled like pale snow, fertilizing fields that had long known only iron. <words>360</words>
Exhausted, he knelt, feeling the earth stir beneath him, whispering thanks through warming seeds. <words>374</words>
For the first time since losing his badge, he removed the spectacles and smiled. <words>388</words>
Broken pieces, improbably gathered, had formed a vision clearer than any uncracked glass. <words>401</words>
