Harlan Briggs, once the freckled darling of Saturday morning musicals, now lurched into the university's vibration analysis chamber with blistered curiosity.<words>21</words>
The room hummed like a gigantic tuning fork testing the bones of God, and Harlan felt that irreverent awe buzz behind his teeth.<words>44</words>
Clutched in his fist was a crumpled treasure map he had once traded for his last royalty check and a lifetime of respectability.<words>67</words>
Ink blots shaped like yawning serpents promised that somewhere beneath seismic noise lay a door only fame-weary dreamers could squeeze through.<words>88</words>
Harlan's ambition, stage-managed since he could lisp jingles, now snarled for a comeback so loud it might fracture glass.<words>107</words>
"Let's see what price the spotlight charges in ruins," he muttered, an authentically odd prayer echoing amid the oscillating machines.<words>127</words>
He slid the map into a laser scanner rigged to convert cartographic pigment into frequencies, watching colors trickle across monitors like neon rain.<words>150</words>
Data peaks aligned with the cathedral standing across campus, infamous for panes etched by monks who allegedly chatted with poltergeists.<words>170</words>
Legend claimed hidden layers in that glass encoded spells audible only to those who had sacrificed everything except their own ringing ears.<words>192</words>
So, after the last secret is revealed by the scanner's algorithm, Harlan sprinted toward the cathedral like a disgraced angel chasing a cue light.<words>216</words>
Night wind whipped his trench coat, and the campus security drones only recorded him with sympathetic static, as though machinery rooted for this misfit.<words>240</words>
Inside the nave, moonlight poured through stained saints whose smiles seemed edited by mischievous directors, and Harlan located the panel the map had whispered about.<words>265</words>
He pressed his forehead to the glass; sound waves from his earlier scan guided vibrations that unlocked a spiral shimmer no mortal choir had rehearsed.<words>290</words>
Melodies trickled through the hidden layers of etched glass in a cathedral window, spilling onto the marble like liquid sheet music.<words>311</words>
Each note promised access to the wild magic of madness that fueled both prophets and paparazzi, and Harlan's pulse danced accordingly.<words>332</words>
But the melody also carried invoices: flashes of talk-show meltdowns, child labor lawsuits, and fans who'd burned their VHS tapes when he aged.<words>355</words>
The price of ambition, the window sang, is that your reflection becomes public property even after the public forgets your name.<words>376</words>
Harlan laughed, sounding like a cracked bell daring lightning, and answered, "Then charge me double and autograph the receipt in starlight."<words>397</words>
The window burst outward into a staircase of ringing air, each step a chord only he could hear, because nobody else had mortgaged childhood so completely.<words>423</words>
He ascended singing his forgotten theme song in reverse, letting ambition trickle from his pockets like coins, until night swallowed him into dazzling anonymity.<words>447</words>
