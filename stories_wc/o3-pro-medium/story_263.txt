Along the fluorescent streets of Acantha, the coral reef city, I commence my nature walk.<words>15</words>
Down here, seawater replaces breeze, yet the ritual still qualifies, schedule being everything to a zealot assassin.<words>32</words>
I carry no gleaming blade today, only a faded carnival prize plush shaped like a pufferfish.<words>48</words>
Its stuffing leaks salt, and its smile, once garish, now droops with the weary wisdom of gutters.<words>65</words>
My handler claims sentimental baggage hinders stealth, yet I keep it for the reflection of morality it offers.<words>83</words>
When waves roll against glass domes above, I listen for reversed echoes, instructions whispered backward through conch transmitters.<words>101</words>
Obeying them demands thinking inside out, which suits my calculatedly playful imagination.<words>113</words>
Today's mission is not murder but narrative: consolidate scattered legends into a single, villain-voiced epic.<words>128</words>
The Council of Tides wants propaganda with teeth yet polish, tragedy repackaged as instructive stand-up.<words>143</words>
They believe hearing the monster's thoughts will scare unruly urchins straight, as though conscience sprouts from dread.<words>160</words>
I, naturally, plan to make morality wobble like sea-jello, tasting sweet, slipping away.<words>173</words>
First stop is the Shellibrarium, where scrolls made of kelp record heroic conquests sanitized for polite clams.<words>190</words>
I sneak between shelves, trading my plush for stolen footnotes, the way magicians exchange doves for scarves.<words>207</words>
Through reversed echoes, my handler chuckles, reminding me to keep tone one part humorous, two parts solemnity.<words>224</words>
I reply by squeezing the plush until it squeaks a note of defiance none but I decipher.<words>241</words>
Next, during a coral-tower nature walk attended by unknowing tourists, I perform street theatre as the villainous emperor.<words>259</words>
My monologue drips with regret and victory, waving moral questions like ribbon eels across their curious faces.<words>276</words>
Laughter bubbles; then silence sinks, because humor here is ballast, not buoy.<words>288</words>
I watch reflections in the tourists' helmet domes and see morality distorted, yet undeniably present.<words>303</words>
Mission nearly complete, I must consolidate these moments into one saga before night currents change.<words>318</words>
So I retreat to the Echo Chapel, a limestone grotto tuned to replay whispers in reverse.<words>334</words>
There, I speak the compiled tale backward, trusting currents to flip it for forward-thinking listeners tomorrow.<words>350</words>
Every alias, atrocity, and accidental kindness becomes foam, then phrase, then polished pearl of persuasion.<words>365</words>
Satisfied, I reclaim my faded prize plush, its drooping grin mirroring mine in the anemone lamplight.<words>381</words>
The toy reminds me villains once won it by cheating ring-toss odds, proving even innocence is negotiable.<words>398</words>
As I stroll home, I wonder whether morality's true reflection is the glassy dome or the warped water, and the thought giggles solemnly inside me.<words>423</words>
