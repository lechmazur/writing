In the drowned vaults of a forgotten underwater city market, Lyshe the shy diviner whispered prophecies to drifting eels. <words>19</words>
Customers were rare, but wrecked stalls still displayed barnacle-crusted trinkets, and silence felt like stubborn commerce. <words>35</words>
What she truly sold was the echo of regret, bottled in single sentences nobody wanted to hear twice. <words>53</words>
One twilight tide, a capsule of vintage photographs floated through a shattered skylight, precipitating a flood of futures. <words>71</words>
The images, impossibly dry, showed Lyshe standing amid neon drones above the market, wearing tomorrow's coral crown. <words>88</words>
Their caption was confusingly clear: 'Balance breaks again at 9:19 across parallel timelines; mend it or drown forever.' <words>106</words>
Lyshe felt a surge of passionate disinterest, the paradoxical mood she adopted to survive prophecies that begged caring. <words>124</words>
Still, duty prickled; a cosmic imbalance somewhere had angled the photographs toward her hands like magnetic guilt. <words>141</words>
She scanned the prints, noticing behind her future self a holographic vendor sign flashing an unfamiliar social-media icon. <words>159</words>
If the sign existed, a trail of social media posts must already spiral uptime, revealing a hidden truth. <words>177</words>
She surfaced through kelp chimneys to the city above sea level, borrowed a cracked tablet, and started searching. <words>195</words>
The icon matched an account called @RegretRefracted, posting timestamped apologies from countless realities where markets never sank. <words>212</words>
Each apology ended with coordinates converging on her submerged stall, tonight, this timeline. <words>225</words>
Followers begged whoever read to retrieve the source of their sorrow before the sorrow multiplied again. <words>241</words>
Lyshe returned underwater, carrying portable lights whose beams wavered like uncertain premonitions. <words>253</words>
Crowded by ghost-voices of parallel shoppers, she arranged the photographs in concentric rings upon the barnacled cobblestones. <words>270</words>
Water quivered, and the echo of regret resonated through rusted pipes, sounding like distant applause slowed to mourning. <words>288</words>
One by one, spectral duplicates of Lyshe flickered into the ring, each clutching broken tokens from misaligned destinies. <words>306</words>
They spoke in unison, a confusingly clear instruction: 'Choose the original memory, and the rest will recalibrate.' <words>323</words>
Heart drumming like muted sonar, Lyshe selected the first photograph where she still looked uncertain, still shy. <words>340</words>
Instantly the water precipitated into threads of light, weaving timelines together the way kelp weaves abandoned nets. <words>357</words>
Spectral duplicates dissolved, stalls straightened, and @RegretRefracted's feed refreshed into ordinary recipes for seaweed tea. <words>372</words>
Lyshe, alone again, realized passionate disinterest had protected her heart, yet earnest action had righted the cosmic imbalance. <words>390</words>
She tucked the chosen photograph into her robe, the market lamps brightening with futures no longer begging to be mended. <words>410</words>
Far above, across countless calm skies, nobody felt anything unusual, and that serene ignorance was her quiet triumph. <words>428</words>
