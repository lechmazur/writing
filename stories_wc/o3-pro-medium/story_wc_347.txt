No one volunteers to watch the orchard that clings to the cliff like a bruise, so the duty falls to Liora. [21]  
She accepts only because turning away the council's plea feels heavier than the wind that already bends her shoulders. [40]  
The orchard is rumored cursed, but to Liora it merely looks tired, rows of twisted pear trees oozing amber resin. [60]  
At dawn she passes the cliffside labyrinth that separates the village from the orchard, watching mechanical birds wheel above its stone corridors. [82]  
Brass wings creak; glass eyes scan; their gears tick like impatient hearts. [94]  
The birds were built to guard travelers from falling, yet they now serve only to confuse paths that once led home. [115]  
Liora knows that every few moons someone enters the maze and never returns. [128]  
Guiding such wanderers to safety becomes her hidden vow, though she never says so aloud. [143]  
Still, she is a reluctant caretaker, not a hero, and the orchard's silence suits her. [158]  
She spends the first week pruning rot, collecting oddities that drop from the branches. [172]  
One morning a small nut rolls to her boot, uncracked though the crows have pecked everything else open. [190]  
The nut bears faint sigils that seem to glow when she blinks, leaving impressions without touching her skin. [208]  
She pockets it, unsettled yet oddly comforted. [215]  
That night she dreams of a blueprint spread upon weathered boards, lines intersecting with offhandedly exact grace. [232]  
When she wakes, the nut sits open beside her cot, its two halves holding fragments of the forgotten blueprint from her dream. [254]  
The parchment pieces are too tiny to read, yet the pattern drifts into her mind like pollen. [271]  
She realizes the blueprint belongs to the labyrinth, and that someone long ago disassembled guidance into riddles. [288]  
Now she must assemble the whole map before the night frost forms, or another soul will be lost. [306]  
The mechanical birds sense the orchard's curse and spiral closer each dusk, rattling warnings nobody hears. [322]  
Liora gathers fallen twigs, resin, and the nut shells, guided by impulses that feel older than speech. [339]  
With graceless beauty she arranges them on the orchard floor, letting shadows mark distances. [353]  
Her hands hover a hair above the pieces, leaving impressions without touching, and the fragments drift into alignment. [371]  
Resin hardens into lines, twigs knot into arrows, and the nut shells become turning mechanisms small as teardrops. [389]  
Before sunset she holds a flexible model of the labyrinth, shimmering with amber light. [403]  
She senses that inserting the model into the maze will rewrite its stairways, opening a path cliffward. [420]  
But first she must reach the central courtyard, past birds that mistake change for threat. [435]  
Carrying the model under her cloak, she enters the labyrinth at twilight, feet steady despite screeching metal overhead. [453]  
The corridors smell of salt and rust, and every corner drops toward the surf crash below. [469]  
A brass gull dives, wings saw-toothed, but she lifts the model; amber light dazzles its optic lenses, stalling pursuit. [488]  
By reflecting the light along walls, she paints signals the birds obey, her motions offhandedly exact despite sweat. [506]  
They circle upward, policing an invisible threat, leaving her safe passage. [517]  
She reaches the courtyard just as pale crystals of frost begin forming on distant treetops. [532]  
If the frost touches the maze, metal joints will seize and fix the corridors forever. [547]  
Liora kneels, sets the model into a shallow socket discovered by intuition alone. [560]  
It clicks like a lark cracking seed, and beneath her feet the stones rearrange with a sigh. [577]  
Passageways smooth, turning from traps to terraces; the birds alight peacefully on rails now aligned with sunset. [594]  
Down at the village gate, lanterns bob as three miners, lost since yesterday, stumble toward the orchard. [611]  
The new path guides them with gentle declivity, no longer shifting under fear. [624]  
Liora waits amid pear shadows until the men pass, their eyes wide at the graceless beauty surrounding them. [642]  
They thank her, though none understands what she has done; that, she thinks, is proper. [657]  
Caretakers should leave only a harvest of safety, never the taste of power. [670]  
When the moon slips up, she returns to the orchard, trusting the birds to watch the cliffs instead of haunt them. [691]  
The cursed trees rustle, as if acknowledging a debt paid in amber and resolve. [705]  
Liora pockets the empty nut shells, reminders that even the smallest husk can shelter a map home. [722]  
Tomorrow she will prune again, offhandedly exact, and listen for footsteps that need guidance. [736]  
But tonight the orchard is briefly kind, and that kindness is enough. [748]
