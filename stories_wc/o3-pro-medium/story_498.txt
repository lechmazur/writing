<story>
Ice-laden wind slithered between barbed roofs of the xenophobic enclave, hushing its watchful windows.<words>14</words>
Inside a shadowed loft, Marlo Finch, the nervous kingpin, examined his collection of dried seed pods.<words>30</words>
Their brittle rattling always matched the tremor in his wrists before negotiations with the enclave's gatekeepers.<words>46</words>
Tonight, however, the pods were silent, an unlikely probable omen that unsettled him more than noise.<words>62</words>
His lieutenant, Joana Gleam, burst in reporting a roadblock choking the supply route to their communal gardens.<words>79</words>
Without the harvest, enclave children would again gnaw on plaster, proving indifference more tyrannical than guns.<words>95</words>
Marlo steadied his voice with fragile ferocity, ordering a detour to visit a landmark seen on a sign.<words>113</words>
The landmark, an abandoned astronomical tower, pierced the ashen sky two miles beyond the hostile checkpoint.<words>129</words>
Rumor claimed the tower's base housed forgotten irrigation controls predating the enclave's iron laws.<words>143</words>
If revived, they could flood winter beds with warmth, holding the line against the tyranny of indifference.<words>160</words>
Joana rigged two sleds with hushed engines, and together they slipped through the restless hush of midwinter.<words>177</words>
Checkpoint sentries searched for convicts, not smugglers carrying seeds, so the pair passed as distant silhouettes.<words>193</words>
Yet the tower courtyard shimmered with patrol lights, a new militia rehearsing loyalty under severed banners.<words>209</words>
The sight unsettled Marlo more deeply than any bullet, for he recognized his estranged brother commanding them.<words>226</words>
That brother, Felix, had once mocked communal gardens as sentimental, choosing profits in exile over shared soil.<words>243</words>
Now, paradoxically, Felix protected the same enclave that shunned him, an unlikely probable twist of allegiance.<words>259</words>
Marlo whispered a plan: ignite the seed pods, releasing aromatic smoke that mirrored routine furnace exhaust.<words>275</words>
The haze veiled their approach while pricking Felix's nostalgia for childhood winters spent shelling beans together.<words>291</words>
Felix hesitated, memories unsettling his resolve, and his men glanced around, uncertain whom to follow.<words>306</words>
Marlo stepped from the smoke with fragile ferocity, extending a single pod like a white-flagged truce.<words>322</words>
He spoke of children gnawing plaster, of gardens buried beneath frost, and of irrigation waiting to breathe.<words>339</words>
Felix's eyes mirrored the tower's cold glass, but the seed inside the pod rattled, echoing their mother's lullaby.<words>357</words>
With one curt nod, Felix dismissed his militia, choosing at last to hold the line beside his brother.<words>375</words>
Together they descended into the tower's guts, rebooting rusted pumps that groaned like beasts thawing from sleep.<words>392</words>
Water surged outward through secret conduits, melting snow over the communal gardens and unsettling decades of enforced chill.<words>410</words>
Dawn found the enclave glazed in pearl mist, every rooftop dripping promise instead of fear.<words>425</words>
Marlo cupped a final seed pod, nerves quiet, aware that fragile ferocity had seeded irreversible change.<words>441</words>
