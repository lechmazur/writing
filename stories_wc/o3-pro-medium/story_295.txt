Moonlight soaked the witch's herb garden, coating rosemary and deadly nightshade in silver that hinted at elegant mayhem. <words>18</words>
Into this glimmering patchwork strode Jorlan Skipblade, a jovial sellsword whose grin showed more teeth than caution. <words>35</words>
He was boldly reluctant to accept the errand awaiting him, yet swagger made hesitation look like a practiced dance. <words>54</words>
At the garden's center stood an astronomical telescope, antique brass gleaming beside thorny mint and wormwood. <words>70</words>
The witch, Mistress Elowyn of the Nine Thistles, beckoned him with a ladle dripping violet smoke. <words>86</words>
She spoke of the withering vow that plagued her familyâ€”an oath that slowly drained conviction, leaving heirs paralyzed by self-doubt. <words>106</words>
To break it, she required three acts completed throughout the transformation of night into dawn. <words>121</words>
First, someone unburdened by lineage must treasure the telescope as if it were gold from a dragon's maw. <words>139</words>
Second, that same stranger must embed their laughter inside a time capsule, following Elowyn's family tradition of making such vessels at crises. <words>161</words>
Third, the capsule had to be buried among the feverfew while a storm of self-questioning raged above, to dethrone doubt from the mind. <words>184</words>
Jorlan twirled his mustache and agreed, for coin jingled loudly in Elowyn's purse and his grin adored challenge. <words>202</words>
Yet a shiver prickled beneath his bravado, making his boldly reluctant heart thump like a drum in a kingless parade. <words>222</words>
He hoisted the telescope, surprised by its warmth, as though it remembered every comet it had ever kissed. <words>240</words>
Instantly, vines writhed in delighted chaos, petals popping like champagne corks, and the garden exhaled cinnamon lightning. <words>257</words>
Throughout the transformation, Elowyn narrated ancestral failures, her voice both lullaby and dirge. <words>270</words>
Jorlan, urged by unease masquerading as courage, plucked a joke from his pocket and let it fly across the lenses. <words>290</words>
The telescope chimed, storing the mirth like starlight bottled for winter nights. <words>302</words>
Elowyn offered a copper cylinder, etched with moons and wolves, for the time capsule's shell. <words>317</words>
Jorlan spat another jest inside, corked it with a wink, and sealed generations of defiance into metal. <words>334</words>
Thunder murmured approval as he knelt among feverfew and buried the capsule beneath roots that smelled of hope and brimstone. <words>354</words>
A cold wind rose, carrying the withering vow from Elowyn's shoulders into the trembling stars like a discarded shawl. <words>373</words>
Doubt howled once, then cracked apart, releasing a perfume of certainty that painted Jorlan's grin in earnest colors. <words>391</words>
Elowyn bowed, offering payment, but the sellsword merely leaned on the telescope, suddenly treasuring wisdom more than coin. <words>409</words>
He realized that elegant mayhem had uncloaked purpose, and that purpose asked him to wander, teaching others how to dethrone doubt from the mind. <words>433</words>
With a jaunty salute he departed, moonlight following like a loyal mutt, while the garden hummed a tune only brave fools hear. <words>455</words>
