Storm-pummeled sunsets bled over the city as Iris, a late-blooming hero, inspected the post-apocalyptic rooftop farm she had coaxed from debris. <words>21</words>
The kale clutched soil in warped planters, and each leaf seemed a brave poem recited against the hush of global ruin. <words>42</words>
Iris felt reluctant awe settle in her lungs, thick as the ash that still wandered the autumn air. <words>60</words>
Yet the gravity of loss tugged harder, pulling her gaze toward the mariner’s spyglass lashed to a rooftop beam like a lonely talisman. <words>83</words>
It had belonged to her brother, Arden, whose last words drifted somewhere in the space between the first tear and the final sigh. <words>106</words>
Arden once told stories of cosmic gears clicking, and Iris now farmed clouds and cucumbers to dissect the architecture of cosmic balance he’d sworn existed. <words>131</words>
But she lacked his equations, so she coerced knowledge from the past by scouring dusty attics inside the skeletal towers surrounding her gardened citadel. <words>155</words>
Each expedition armed her softly militant resolve: a rusted spade for defense and a notebook of salvaged lullabies for courage. <words>175</words>
Tonight, thunder murmured, and Iris pressed the spyglass to her brow, remembering how Arden mapped stars through it when the world still had neighbors. <words>199</words>
The lens, cracked but faithful, refracted lightning into lattices that resembled staircases, inviting her to ascend into invisible vaulted mechanisms. <words>219</words>
She understood then that balance was not quiet equilibrium but a choreography of weighted steps, each sorrow counterbalancing some distant birth. <words>240</words>
Tears blurred the stair-light; sighs curled behind them; time thinned, stretching that narrow interval into a cathedral of comprehension. <words>259</words>
If gravity could bend stars, maybe grief could bend harvests, she thought, and the notion felt terrifyingly gentle. <words>277</words>
Tomorrow she would plant seed in gutters, guiding vines over radio antennae so chlorophyll and static might duet and hold the sky together. <words>300</words>
But tonight she needed proof, so she descended the half-collapsed stairwell to coerce one last memory from Arden’s abandoned laboratory apartment. <words>321</words>
Among toppled oscilloscopes she found a spool of negatives depicting auroras twined with crop rows, captions scribbled: 'Life leans toward light because sorrow weighs it backward'. <words>347</words>
Iris returned to the roof and unfurled the film against the lightning, letting green and purple ghosts dance over cucumber leaves like returning ancestors. <words>371</words>
In that luminous overlap, she finally bloomed, neither saint nor soldier, but a softly militant steward who accepted loss as gravity and grew toward its pull. <words>397</words>
Her sigh followed her tear, closing the interval, and balance, like dawn, felt marginally possible again. <words>413</words>
