Rain threaded silver needles through the ravine, where the hanging orchard swayed like lanterns in distress. [16]  
Ilya, the rational truffle forager, surveyed the dripping roots suspended from cliffside trellises. [29]  
After the empathy virus had scourged away most lies, he alone still needed deliberate logic to breathe. [46]  
Truth now spilled from throats like uninvited wine, and his own tongue was involuntarily truthful beyond comfort. [63]  
Psychological safety, he reasoned, required more than honesty; it required room to heal from honesty's cuts. [79]  
So he hunted the rumored cures in discredited textbooks, pages people now mocked as placebo folklore. [95]  
One such volume, Wernicke's Catalog of Somatic Shadows, mentioned a smuggled relic buried where storms could not swallow scent. [114]  
The relic, an antique glass eye, was said to occlude excess empathy when worn against flesh. [130]  
If he placed it under the tongue, the book whispered, honest words would soften into kind ones. [147]  
Kindness, he thought, was the missing brace in their fractured grace of surviving society. [161]  
The ravine orchard, battered by storms, was his last coordinate from the mildew-stained map folded inside the catalog. [179]  
Pear-shaped fruit dangled on braided cables, creaking like pendulums measuring every gust. [191]  
Beneath them, fungal humps hinted at truffles fattened on fallen blossoms. [202]  
Ilya knelt, sliding a copper probe into the mud, letting rational methodology calm his galloping confession reflex. [219]  
He told the ravine aloud, 'I fear touching any mind but my own,' and the wind answered with cider scent. [239]  
Suddenly the probe struck glass instead of root. [247]  
He unearthed a fist-sized sphere, once pristine, now veined by mineral scars yet unmistakably an eye. [263]  
Through its cloudy iris, he saw his reflection fractured into polite shards. [275]  
The catalog had warned that the glass eye demanded a price: you must speak the first memory you fear. [294]  
He pressed the relic beneath his tongue, tasting rust and orchard mold. [306]  
Words surged, unstoppable, yet strangely muffled, like doves wrapped in cloth. [317]  
'I abandoned my sister during the lockdown,' he confessed, 'because her tears amplified inside me until I almost drowned.' [336]  
The eye warmed, and the orchard's swaying settled into a slow, parental rocking. [349]  
Above, storm clouds paused as if listening, giving the distant sun a pinhole to smile through. [365]  
Ilya exhaled, noticing the hiss of panic recede from his veins. [376]  
He realized the eye did not occlude empathy entirely; it filtered despair so that care could pass unharmed. [394]  
That balance was the psychological safety he sought, not anesthetic but scaffolding. [406]  
He gathered truffles, each knob smelling of wet parchment, intending them as offerings for his sister's return. [423]  
The ravine path back to town was slick, but the orchard's cables extended like handrails in farewell. [440]  
Midway up the slope he met Mara, the local rumor-monger, cheeks scarred by too much forced sincerity. [457]  
Her eyes darted to the bulge under his tongue, and her own mouth twitched with questions she could not cage. [477]  
Without being asked, Ilya explained the relic, its price, and its promise, the truth escaping like breath in winter. [496]  
Mara trembled, caught between envy and terror, then whispered, 'Keep it hidden; the council will grind it to shards.' [515]  
Her plea surprised him, because she too was involuntarily truthful, and yet she risked secrecy for his mission. [533]  
He tasted copper as he nodded, recognizing that safety required community, not solitude. [546]  
Together they planned to distill the eye's lesson into recipe, not relic, smuggling only knowledge past the watchmen. [564]  
Ilya would write the process across fungus spores, Mara would scatter them through markets, and healing would grow silently. [583]  
The truffles in his pack knocked softly together, sounding like two hearts agreeing on a safer rhythm. [600]  
Behind them the orchard resumed its restless creak, but now its discord felt woven into a larger, forgiving chord. [619]  
Storms would return, empathy would still bruise, yet some grace had fused with the fracture. [634]
