During the hush after a car backfires in a silent street, I, a weary undertaker named Navid, felt time split open. <words>21</words>
The city dimmed, yet an impossible corridor unfurled, leading me to an ancient Persian palace reimagined in cracked neon and moonlit dust. <words>43</words>
I heard no footsteps, only the tick of an astronomical clock mounted above the jade gate, its constellations leaking silver. <words>63</words>
The clock had been forged generations ago when kingmakers mapped destinies by following sun paths across hammered bronze. <words>81</words>
Their tribal knowledge, memorized in song and scars, insisted that light itself could be shackled if the hours were persuaded to kneel. <words>103</words>
Such ideas were rarely practical, yet despair made pragmatists of us all. <words>115</words>
I had come because the dead of my morgue whispered that hope hid here, and I could not embalm another dream without first trying to rescue my own. <words>143</words>
Inside the throne hall, pillars spiraled like sandstorms paused mid-roar, and on the dais stood a glass oubliette meant to imprison darkness itself. <words>166</words>
The mechanism was simple: align the clock's gnomon with the prisoner's silhouette, seal the chamber, and as the sun marched, the shadow would cinch tighter than iron. <words>193</words>
I wondered who had been worthy of so cruel a mercy. <words>204</words>
Then the clock chimed, a low bullroar of brass, and the palace corridors filled with faces made of wavering midnight. <words>224</words>
They were memories that refused burial, the failures I had sutured behind false smiles, now arriving with placid ferocity to judge their undertaker. <words>247</words>
If I fled, dawn would still come and the world would keep bleeding stories I could neither clean nor contain. <words>267</words>
So I stepped within the oubliette, positioning myself where the kings once caged monsters, and angled the clock hand until my shadow slipped into its crystal grooves. <words>294</words>
By following sun paths etched on the marble floor, I locked the glass and felt night tighten around me like funeral linens. <words>316</words>
Outside, the memories screamed, but their sound bent away, trapped in orbits the clock ordained. <words>331</words>
Inside, utter dark blossomed, yet in that darkness, solitude glimmered, fragile as a widow's ring. <words>346</words>
Hope, I realized, was not a lantern but the decision to remain visible to oneself when no one else could see. <words>367</words>
Moment by moment the clock consumed my outline, until brightness peeked beneath the door and the silver constellations fell silent. <words>387</words>
The door opened, releasing me into morning, and the street where the car had backfired was again only a street, but my shadow carried a new steadiness. <words>414</words>
Though I remained a weary undertaker among the living, I now knew how to bury despair without burying hope. <words>433</words>
And that lesson, carried from a palace no architect remembers, felt less like magic than responsibility. <words>449</words>
I turned west, following the sun again, certain that the day would imprison whatever sorrow tried to follow. <words>467</words>
