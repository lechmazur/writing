At the bell’s echo marking a forgotten recess, Elias Kiernan sprinted into the yawning quantum tunnel beneath City Hospital. <words>19</words>
He was a time-looping paramedic, condemned to repeat this minute of crisis until every pulse found rhythm. <words>36</words>
Excited boredom fizzed in his veins; he knew every spark of fluorescent flicker, yet surprise still nipped. <words>53</words>
Tonight the loop shifted by the sound of a single raindrop striking the tunnel’s rusted rim. <words>69</words>
That droplet nested in his eardrum like a pebble dropped into fate’s gearbox. <words>82</words>
Following the echo, Elias discovered a weathered fishing lure glinting on the antiseptic floor. <words>96</words>
Its chipped red paint resembled dried arterial blood, a souvenir from someone else’s unhealed traumas. <words>111</words>
Elias pocketed it, feeling the barb prick the skin of his palm like an insistent memory. <words>127</words>
On previous loops, no lure had existed; its arrival meant the tunnel’s probability seams were fraying. <words>143</words>
He hurried toward the patient waiting at corridor’s end—a girl choking on time itself. <words>157</words>
Chronal vapors leaked from her mouth, clock-hands fluttering behind her eyelids like caged moths. <words>171</words>
The protocol was privately public: save her quietly, then broadcast success across infinite failure so no one noticed. <words>189</words>
But Elias sensed the lure wanted nesting inside the girl’s throat, a counterweight to her spinning years. <words>206</words>
Defying training, he pressed the treble hook against her sternum and listened for the raindrop’s twin. <words>222</words>
Drip—a second drop landed far above, and the tunnel walls breathed outward like accordion bellows. <words>237</words>
A door of blue equations opened, revealing a lake where children once shouted during that forgotten recess. <words>254</words>
Elias carried the girl through, knee-deep in mirrored water that reflected nightmares begging for baptism. <words>269</words>
He lowered her into the ripples, whispering, 'I will baptize your nightmares in acceptance, and maybe mine too'. <words>287</words>
The lure slid from his palm, dissolved, and re-formed as harmless silver minnows circling her ankles. <words>303</words>
Clock-hands melted into the lake, and the girl inhaled air uncontaminated by loops. <words>316</words>
A sudden boredom, thrilled and electric, told Elias the cycle’s gears had finally lost their grip. <words>332</words>
Yet excitement quivered—without repetition, what anchored a man who had mastered every wrong possibility? <words>346</words>
He listened: no bell, no raindrop, only gulls crying above an endless, ordinary day. <words>360</words>
The absence felt privately public too, shared with the lake’s horizon and hidden inside his chest. <words>376</words>
He smiled, pocketing nothing, ready to walk forward even if forward lacked rehearsal. <words>389</words>
Behind him, the quantum tunnel folded like a closed umbrella, sealing trauma inside remembered kindness. <words>404</words>
