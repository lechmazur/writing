Dust choked the torchlight in the overgrown library hidden in catacombs of lost knowledge. [14]  
I, self-appointed chronicle keeper, stepped carefully between toppled shelves furred with moss and pale mushrooms. [29]  
My oath was simple: to witness change without judgment. [38]  
Yet the air tremored with a crumbling peace that made neutrality feel like treason. [52]  
Above, the city warred with its own forgetting; below, the catacombs remembered everything. [65]  
I hunted a rumor whispered by mildew and rat: a map folded inside a child's origami swan. [82]  
They said the swan could open tunnels older than ink. [92]  
I found it lodged between two stone tiles, its paper soft as dying leaves. [106]  
Handling it, I felt reality slip, for my mind grips reality loosely at the best of times. [123]  
The folds were riddles; each crease hinted at a direction the stone corridors refused to reveal. [139]  
I unfolded, refolded, and the corridors unfolded with me, hallway mouths yawning like patient graves. [154]  
Thus I traveled via cryptic folds in a well-worn origami swan, deeper than any cartographer dared ink. [171]  
Seasons lost their names as passages spiraled, and I lost count of meals, steps, and sighs. [187]  
Across the drift of untold seasons, I emerged on a riverbank lit by strange twilight. [202]  
Black glass walls formed an obsidian refuge along the river, its facets catching memory like fishhooks. [218]  
No door greeted me, only a hush so total I mistook it for roaring water. [233]  
The hush was not emptiness but regenerative silence, a pulse that promised renewal through absence. [248]  
I pressed a palm to the glass, and thought fled my skull like startled pigeons. [263]  
Without thought, neutrality became effortless, and I remembered my oath. [273]  
The wall yielded, soft as mud, inviting me to burrow inside its mirrored dark. [287]  
I slid through, and silence stitched the opening shut behind me. [298]  
Within, corridors of obsidian reflected endless versions of myself, each at a different hour of surrender. [314]  
Some replicas wept, some laughed, some carried torches that became flowers mid-flame. [326]  
All shared one feature: blank eyes open to whatever arrived. [336]  
In that mirrored hall, time shed scales like a molting serpent. [347]  
I understood the refuge was a womb for histories no tongue could name. [360]  
Each visitor left their story, and the silence digested pain, birthing calmer echoes. [373]  
I laid my journals upon the floor, pages crisp with mildew and inkblot regrets. [387]  
The glass drank the words until only blank parchment remained. [397]  
Emptied, I faced the river through a narrow slit of obsidian. [408]  
Floodwater had risen since my arrival, hungry for anything that dared stillness. [420]  
The city above must have cracked, letting sorrow pour downward. [430]  
I could ascend, warn them, perhaps even mend their fractures. [440]  
But the oath tugged harder than conscience; I was here to witness, not to intervene. [455]  
Still, watching the water gnaw the bank, I realized witnessing included recording what would vanish. [470]  
I needed new pages and a vantage unclouded by mirrors. [480]  
The swan, now blank, fluttered in my pocket like a caged heart. [492]  
I refolded it into a boat, intuitive fingers guided by lingering magic. [504]  
When I set it on the rising river, the boat grew, ribs of light stiffening paper. [520]  
I stepped aboard and walls of glass parted like curtains surrendering a stage. [533]  
The regenerative silence followed but did not smother the hush of water. [545]  
It felt now like a promise to keep breathing, even while speaking none. [558]  
The boat drifted downstream, carrying me past ruins overgrown with statues that argued softly with ivy. [574]  
Up ahead, I glimpsed lanterns bobbing among the reeds, survivors perhaps, or ghosts rehearsing dawn. [589]  
Either way, I would watch them, note their passage, and let the river decide their chapter. [605]  
Behind me, the obsidian refuge dimmed until it resembled another shard of night. [618]  
Its silence, swallowed, now thrummed inside my bones like a second pulse. [630]  
Reality felt thinner, yet steadier, as if losing grip allowed better balance. [642]  
Perhaps that is the price of peace that forever crumbles: learning to stand on shards. [657]  
I opened a fresh page in the atlas of my mind and began, 'Water rising, lanterns ahead, heart unspoken'. [676]  
The words flowed soundlessly, yet I could hear their echo return from seasons still unborn. [691]  
And so the chronicle continued, boat and river and witness alike sliding onward beneath a failing sky. [708]
