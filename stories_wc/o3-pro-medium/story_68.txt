Steam coiled from my chipped porcelain mug while the tea leaves surrendered slowly, and the session clock blinked: three minutes left. <words>21</words>
That window, during tea steeping, was all the time I allowed myself to breach the Forum Redux, a neon-rimmed simulation of an ancient Roman marketplace reimagined for data smugglers. <words>50</words>
I, an ethical hacker with a moral code, slipped past marble avatars and algorithmic centurions like a rumor never spoken. <words>70</words>
The target was not gold, not secrets, but a single erased name — the ledger’s ghost line ninety-seven — that history had exiled. <words>93</words>
Why risk prison for a syllable? <words>99</words>
Because deleting someone erases their mistakes and their chances to atone, and I believe redemption is rarely common but always possible. <words>120</words>
To humanize the monster, first you must retrieve its forgotten name. <words>131</words>
The marketplace’s currency was nostalgia, so I carried my prized collection of bottle caps, each printed with extinct sodas, clinking softly in a linen pouch. <words>156</words>
Vendors vied for them the way senators once courted applause, but I offered three caps to an oracle program guarding the archives. <words>178</words>
Its interface manifested as a bronze-masked child, eyes flickering like candle flame in wind. <words>192</words>
Payment accepted, it demanded the access phrase to open the vault hallway. <words>204</words>
I had none, so I adopted an older trick: misdirection through tiny inscriptions carved along a broken rake handle I carried as a walking stick. <words>229</words>
The glyphs, invisible to casual scans, rerouted the oracle’s request to a sandbox echoing the very question back to itself. <words>249</words>
Confident uncertainty shivered across its metal cheeks; while verifying, it unlocked the passage inadvertently. <words>263</words>
I slipped inside the marble atrium where holographic frescoes replayed conquests, and I searched for line ninety-seven. <words>280</words>
There it was: brackets, zeros, silence — as if the universe inhaled and never exhaled that person’s existence. <words>298</words>
I overlaid my decryptor, and letters blossomed like graffiti reversing time, revealing the name 'Varrus the Beast'. <words>315</words>
History had dubbed him a monster for ordering the razing of Ostia, yet forgotten how he later fed its refugees. <words>335</words>
I downloaded testimonies proving his redemption, sealed them in a cap-shaped data shard, and posted them onto the public ledger before the kettle whistled. <words>359</words>
The oracle shrieked as alarms flared, declaring me a criminal, but I walked out with purpose heavier than fear. <words>378</words>
Outside, vendors whispered that the Beast’s portrait now glimmered beside saints, and some began placing flowers under the refreshed mosaic. <words>398</words>
I tipped my mug, tasted cooled rosemary tea, and smiled at the paradox of being both outlaw and witness keeper. <words>418</words>
Some truths need hacking, others simply need someone willing to adopt them before they vanish again. <words>434</words>
Either way, my bottle caps rattled with quiet applause, and the steam finally faded. <words>448</words>
