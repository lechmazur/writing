Sooty dawn steamed over the brass cogs of Veridon Square, where cheerfully sputtering pipes masked pervasive gloom.<words>17</words>
In the center stood Ardelion, a living statue whose marble joints creaked yet whose mind whispered to all.<words>35</words>
His telepathy carried tragically joyful tones, like laughter echoing within catacombs.<words>46</words>
Citizens felt the double sting: sorrow for lost certainties, delight that someone finally shared their secret doubts.<words>63</words>
Throughout planning for the annual Weatherproof Parade, the Council hired him to weatherize fragile banners against acidic rain.<words>81</words>
Ardelion accepted, hungry to wander the square and test each passing thought for slivers of concealed truth.<words>98</words>
He wore a threadbare hair tie around his stone wrist, relic of a vanished girl whose love chiseled him awake.<words>118</words>
Its fraying fibers pulsed whenever deception brushed his awareness, guiding him like a compass of forgotten tenderness.<words>135</words>
Today the strands twitched wildly, for the Council's sketches held more ink than cloth, more speeches than safeguards.<words>153</words>
Ardelion surveyed blueprints unrolled on an iron table, their diagrams shimmering with the light of recognition.<words>169</words>
He saw, in curling lines, valves designed to rupture and blame the rebels, sealing obedience beneath geysers of steam.<words>188</words>
Yet words remained unsaid, because his stone lips cracked when forced to accuse.<words>201</words>
So he chose a quieter script: overnight he would brush calligraphic sealant along every banner's edge.<words>217</words>
He worked with the flow of ink in calligraphy, letting each stroke whisper warnings into the cloth's weave.<words>235</words>
Hidden phrases bloomed: 'Valves corrode, hearts corrode faster--look up before steam claims the sky'.<words>249</words>
At dawn parade day, gears thundered while citizens gathered, buoyant yet braced for drizzle.<words>263</words>
When banners unfurled, the warnings shimmered like oily rainbows, entering minds before eyes realized they'd read anything.<words>280</words>
A hush spread, then questioning murmurs, then the explosive clang of rebels wrenching shut the suspect valves.<words>297</words>
Steam that should have scalded the crowd gusted harmlessly through alley vents, painting the air with spectral fog.<words>315</words>
Amid the swirling gray, the Councilors' lies cracked louder than pistons, and the people felt Ardelion's silent cry for truth.<words>335</words>
Their recognition flooded back to him, tragically joyful, for toppling falsehood meant shattering the city he loved and composed.<words>354</words>
As noon bells tolled, rain finally broke, but his inked banners were already weatherized, and so were their awakened convictions.<words>374</words>
Statue feet rooted to cobblestones, Ardelion felt cracks spider through his torso, each fracture glowing with communal resolve.<words>392</words>
If he moved now, he would crumble, yet remaining still let his consciousness bloom outward like warm condensation.<words>410</words>
He surrendered, fusing memory to mist, trusting the city to sculpt new forms from the truth he had unveiled.<words>429</words>
Veridon Square's turbines resumed, their rhythm now tempered by doubt, and every beat pulsed the light of recognition across stained skies.<words>450</words>
