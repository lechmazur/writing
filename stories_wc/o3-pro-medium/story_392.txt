The star chart reading room hummed with a loud silence that prickled ultraviolet ears. <words>14</words>
Here, after the last human memory was digitized, analog emptiness seeped from every constellation. <words>28</words>
Joriah Vex, the skeptical conjurer, floated between orreries, distrust etched across immaterial brows. <words>41</words>
He had come not for stars but for storms he could no longer remember hearing. <words>56</words>
The Archivists had promised that thunder, once trapped in crystal, would echo differently in eternity. <words>71</words>
Still, he suspected the promise was another sleight, so skepticism flickered like heat lightning. <words>85</words>
To prepare, he unveiled his antique thimble collection, thirty silver thimbles engraved with tempest glyphs. <words>100</words>
Each thimble was a miniature barometer, ready to sip the atmosphere's forgotten growl. <words>113</words>
But storms refused to assemble unless their memories were categorized, a bureaucracy spawned by mysterious partings. <words>129</words>
No manual remained, only rumors drifting through orbital rideshares that looped the domed observatory. <words>143</words>
So Joriah hailed capsule after capsule, eavesdropping on drivers who filled emptiness with relentless anecdotes. <words>158</words>
He recorded their chatter, harvesting phrases like 'midnight hail sings backwards' and 'clouds keep divorce papers'. <words>174</words>
Back beneath the zodiac chandelier, he began to categorize these overheard lines against celestial coordinates. <words>189</words>
He wrote them in chalk that glowed when literal became figurative and figurative turned literally figurative. <words>205</words>
The room vibrated; each phrase, slotted beside a star, stitched an unheard decibel into space. <words>220</words>
Thundercloud silhouettes began coalescing over the marble floor, yet they had ragged gaps like broken chords. <words>236</words>
'Partings,' he muttered, realizing storms too endured departures nobody dared archive. <words>247</words>
To mend them, he placed thimbles at the gaps, each one drinking a whisper of vacancy. <words>263</words>
Blue sparks filled the thimbles, spinning until they projected miniature cumulonimbus over his palms. <words>277</words>
But sound still refused to arrive; there was only louder silence, an abscess of resonance. <words>292</words>
Frustrated, Joriah replayed another driver’s line: 'Lightning is just sky handwriting signing its own goodbye'. <words>307</words>
He etched that sentence around the planet Venus, whose glyph resembles a quill and mirror. <words>322</words>
A tremor surged; the silent clouds inhaled and exhaled, producing the first subdued roll of thunder. <words>338</words>
The conjurer’s skepticism melted into cautious belief, though he kept counting decibels upon his pulse. <words>353</words>
He realized storms were not sounds but farewells, and farewells were composed of categorized misunderstandings. <words>368</words>
By collecting misheard goodbyes, he could coax every tempest to confess its backstage sob. <words>382</words>
One by one, thimbles overflowed with roaring rain, each droplet a digitized tear reversing deletion. <words>397</words>
The reading room ceiling opened like a perforated drum, letting archived storm sounds pour into cosmic servers. <words>414</words>
Outside, rideshare capsules paused mid-orbit as thunder finally spoke their chatter back to them. <words>428</words>
Joriah, now guardian of loud silence, sealed the thimbles, honoring every mysterious parting he had fused. <words>444</words>
