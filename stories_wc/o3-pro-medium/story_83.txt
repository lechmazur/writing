Raking crisp birch leaves beside the shuttered Meridian Genetics compound, I kept whistling.<words>13</words>
No gardener hum would betray that an undercover cryptid researcher listened for footsteps.<words>26</words>
The board thought my harmless demeanor suspiciously trusting, and thus perfect camouflage.<words>38</words>
I aimed to sow seeds of a better tomorrow, not chrysanthemums.<words>49</words>
The rake snagged a hidden latch, rolling aside a door of ivy-laced steel.<words>62</words>
Below yawned the abandoned research lab everyone denied funding.<words>71</words>
I descended clutching my battered plastic tray like a waiter at a wake.<words>84</words>
The corridor fragmented into a labyrinth of broken mirrors that swallowed flashlight beams.<words>97</words>
Reflections of rusted centrifuges and my rake-spattered shoes blurred into impossible angles.<words>109</words>
I had chased rumors of a mirror-dwelling cryptid called the Janus Moth.<words>121</words>
Tonight would test whether fateful encounters favored preparation or terror.<words>131</words>
I unfolded the tray upon a cracked lens, sprinkling leaves like sacramental herbs.<words>144</words>
Dry veins hissed, coaxing faint gusts that rippled candle flames I had planted earlier.<words>158</words>
I would excel by tracing the burn pattern in a blackened candle wick.<words>171</words>
The first wick curved northwest, pointing deeper into the mirrored maze.<words>182</words>
I followed, marking floor with chalk Xs, my grin outweighing prudence.<words>193</words>
Second wick spiraled inward, smoke sketching antennae that fluttered then froze.<words>204</words>
Glass ahead quivered, and a silhouette with wings of lightless scales emerged.<words>216</words>
The Janus Moth mirrored me perfectly on its left side, nightmare on its right.<words>230</words>
We both carried trays; its was bone, my battered plastic seeming suddenly innocent.<words>243</words>
I offered leaves; it offered desiccated chrysalis shards that chimed like glass teeth.<words>256</words>
Our suspiciously trusting exchange reflected in thousands of fractured surfaces, multiplying possibilities.<words>268</words>
I traced the final wick's ash spiral, decoding coordinates only I understood.<words>280</words>
Tomorrow at dawn, seeds buried in those spots would sprout photoreactive vines cleansing toxins.<words>294</words>
The moth required a habitat free of mercury dust; I required proof humanity deserved reprieve.<words>309</words>
Agreement sealed, it beat one wing, shattering adjacent mirrors into mosaic constellations.<words>321</words>
Through the new aperture I glimpsed starlight where basement walls should be.<words>333</words>
That impossible sky would nourish the vines once the leaves fed their roots.<words>346</words>
I raked remaining foliage into the battered tray, feeling history tilt promisingly.<words>358</words>
Behind me, the moth hummed approval, echoing the earlier gardener disguise.<words>369</words>
Its tone blended mischief and wisdom, an anthem for clandestine horticulture.<words>380</words>
I saluted with my rake, then stepped back toward autumn's crunching daylight.<words>392</words>
Leaf by leaf, wing by wing, we would excel at restoration's grand prank.<words>405</words>
And if future wanderers found only healthy trees, the mirrors would keep quiet.<words>418</words>
