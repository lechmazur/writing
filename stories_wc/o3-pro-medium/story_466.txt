Marcellus Crane, a cunning connoisseur of forgotten curiosities, detoured from routine grocery shopping when celery prices bored him.<words>18</words>
A sudden urge to explore a path not taken tugged him toward the disused smoke signal tower behind the market.<words>38</words>
Shoppers hardly glanced as he squeezed past milk crates, because gentle chaos was commonplace on Saturday discounts.<words>55</words>
Inside the soot-smudged tower he discovered wooden drawers stuffed with vintage seed packets, each labeled in faded copperplate.<words>73</words>
Among them were Night-Blooming Maze, Arctic Persimmon, and Oracle Lentil, seeds sounding like riddles rather than agriculture.<words>90</words>
Curiosity blossomed into intent, for Marcellus nursed the morally ambiguous ambition to corner an elusive destiny.<words>106</words>
He believed destiny hid in neglected details, waiting to be decoded the way sommeliers divine histories from dust.<words>124</words>
So he unpacked his portable xerograph machine, ever present for ephemera, and began copying each brittle envelope.<words>141</words>
The copier's blue light flashed against charcoal walls, scattering moths and memories alike.<words>154</words>
On every xerograph he annotated cryptic glyphs found on packet margins, certain they were coordinates, not decoration.<words>171</words>
Decoding the forgotten became his new cartography, mapping possible gardens of impossible futures.<words>184</words>
Yet a puzzle piece was missing--the tower's own ledger, rumored to list successful smoke translations sent to absent farmers.<words>203</words>
Legend said the signals guided seeds toward soil dreaming of them, like invitations floating on air.<words>219</words>
Marcellus climbed the rickety ladder to the crown chamber where ancient soot still scented of pine resin.<words>236</words>
There, tucked in a tin canister, he found the ledger but also a mirror scratched with a single imperative: Plant hope, not profit.<words>259</words>
The message prickled his conscience, challenging the profit-driven scheme that had carried him up the ladder.<words>275</words>
Morally ambiguous he remained, but ambiguity bends, and smoke drifted through cracked vents like questioning spirits.<words>291</words>
He opened the ledger, discovering each smoke pattern corresponded to phases of personal doubt, not weather reports.<words>308</words>
Farmers had signaled themselves, confessing fears to the sky so crops might taste their courage.<words>323</words>
Realizing the packets were heirlooms of vulnerability, he felt a tremor stronger than greed.<words>337</words>
In a gesture both selfish and redemptive, he xerographed the mirror's imperative onto every copied seed label.<words>354</words>
Then he replaced originals, left the copies in grocery carts, and descended to the produce aisle smelling of potential rain.<words>374</words>
Shoppers discovered them between lettuce heads, reading the words and pocketing destinies they never knew were missing.<words>391</words>
Marcellus paid for nothing but walked away heavier, certain he had cornered an elusive destiny by releasing it.<words>409</words>
