A dull radiance smeared the sky as Brother Malachai, a lapsed priest, jogged into the labyrinth orchard of giant bean stalks reaching the clouds. <words>24</words>
He was unapologetically confused, but he carried an abacus with missing beads like a relic of other reckonings. <words>42</words>
Each absent bead mocked prayers he had once repeated automatically, the price of complacency paid in silent gaps. <words>60</words>
Now he ventured through the hush of fate unraveling, listening for threads snapping in the distant wind. <words>77</words>
Somewhere above, pods cracked like bells, showering pale snow that spiraled between the vine pillars. <words>92</words>
Malachai chose his path by following snow patterns, believing chance scripts hid within their drifting calligraphy. <words>108</words>
He sought to step beyond fate's design, to prove destiny could be revised like arithmetic sums. <words>124</words>
Yet the abacus rattled softly, its missing beads refusing to slide, as if warning him that subtraction was irreversible. <words>143</words>
He paused beneath a stalk so thick three men could not encircle it, and he remembered the confessional he had deserted. <words>164</words>
Back then, whispers of comfort had lured him to complacency, promising that nothing ever truly changed. <words>180</words>
The orchard answered differently: every snowflake settled uniquely, sketching secret detours across the loam. <words>194</words>
Resolute, he began to jog again, letting his breath sync with the faint creak of stalks swaying overhead. <words>212</words>
Snow traced a spiral at his feet, guiding him to a clearing where a single altar of woven vines waited. <words>232</words>
On the altar lay another abacus, complete, its beads glimmering like frozen embers, untouched by accounting. <words>248</words>
He placed his broken one beside it, the two frames aligning like parallel verdicts. <words>262</words>
In the dull radiance filtering through leaf and cloud, he compared absence to fullness and understood his unpaid debt. <words>281</words>
Complacency had cost him certainty, but confusion still held a rough honesty he could kneel inside. <words>297</words>
He slid one bead from the perfect abacus to the broken, a minor theft felt across the universe's ledger. <words>316</words>
Instantly, snow burst upward, reversing its fall, and the orchard corridors rearranged, revealing a straight avenue to sunrise. <words>334</words>
Malachai jogged toward that light, not to escape but to measure it, each footfall ticking like a spoken prayer. <words>353</words>
Behind him, the incomplete altar faded, accepting the transaction in silence. <words>364</words>
Ahead, clouds parted, and he glimpsed a vast ledger written in constellations, numbers shifting as he approached. <words>381</words>
Fate still unraveled, but Malachai now stitched his own marginal note between the stars, neither apology nor boast. <words>399</words>
It was simply a reminder that every missing bead could begin a new equation if one dared to account for it. <words>420</words>
