The morose paladin Thalen trudged up the cracked marble ramp toward the solar flare observatory.<words>15</words>
Night cloaked the facility because the city-wide blackout had snuffed every lamp from harbor to spire.<words>31</words>
Thalen felt bored excitement flutter in his chest, a strange twin to his relentless sorrow.<words>46</words>
Such moods were all that remained after the last star was named and cataloged.<words>60</words>
Now, only restoring ancient systems could give purpose to his rusted honor.<words>72</words>
He carried no sword, just a dull sewing needle stolen from a tailor's ashcan.<words>86</words>
The absurd token reminded him that even brittle things could stitch worlds together.<words>99</words>
Inside, lavishly austere corridors stretched like candlelit catacombs, gilt mosaics framing bare concrete.<words>112</words>
Visible changes marked the walls: hairline cracks glowing orange with trapped solar plasma.<words>125</words>
The observatory's failsafes had failed, and the city confided its fate to Thalen's weary footsteps.<words>140</words>
Down a spiral stair he met Vara, a blackout refugee whose lantern had fizzled moments earlier.<words>156</words>
Their chance encounter during the city-wide blackout fulfilled a prophecy neither believed they deserved.<words>170</words>
Vara, an engineer of forgotten dynamos, sought the core chamber to restart the orbital mirrors.<words>185</words>
Thalen offered protection, though his armor was mostly patches and prayer.<words>196</words>
Together they descended into the vacuum-sealed vault where the control console lay confined behind crystal bars.<words>212</words>
A magnetic lock awaited a key long lost to ocean rust.<words>223</words>
Thalen pressed the dull sewing needle into the aperture, feeling ridiculous yet resolved.<words>236</words>
Sparks bit his gauntlet, and visible changes rippled across the bars like dawn through ice.<words>251</words>
The lock disengaged, releasing a sigh older than empires.<words>260</words>
Inside the chamber, lavishly austere machinery gleamed beside coils of dust.<words>271</words>
Vara danced her fingers over glyphs, yet power refused to flow.<words>282</words>
The ancient systems required a sigil of authority, something living, something once sworn.<words>295</words>
Thalen removed his tabard, the faded crest of a kingdom that had confined itself to myth.<words>311</words>
He draped it over the console, and circuitry awakened with a hungry golden roar.<words>325</words>
Solar relays blossomed in orbit, redirecting dormant light into the blackout-stricken streets.<words>337</words>
From the observatory windows they watched towers glow, each filament revealing visible changes in human silhouettes below.<words>354</words>
Bells rang distant but hollow, as if surprised to be useful again.<words>366</words>
Thalen felt the bored excitement ebb, replaced by a quieter contentment that almost frightened him.<words>381</words>
He realized he had restored ancient systems not with steel, but with a needle and a name.<words>398</words>
Vara smiled, recording the event so that, after the next last star is named, someone will remember.<words>415</words>
Outside, the city breathed in electric dawn while two unlikely allies vanished into the hush of renewed night.<words>433</words>
