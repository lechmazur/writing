The recycled spaceship drifted between blue dwarf systems like a bruised swan of steel. <words>14</words>
Inside, Arin Kestrel, a selfless musician, tuned shards of silence into hymns for exiles. <words>28</words>
Arin's heart had been calibrated to compassion by melodies he would never personally hear. <words>42</words>
His cabin held only one relic: a warped vinyl record fused to the wall by stellar heat. <words>59</words>
Its spiraled scars etched the mark of trust that guided every choice he made. <words>73</words>
When doubt coiled, he would trace the grooves until their intangible guidance grew intangibly tangible. <words>88</words>
The crew, descendants of forgotten refugees, sought worlds where migratory leviathans penned stories across ion trails. <words>104</words>
Arin's mandate was to map migration patterns so their future could harmonize with the beasts' journeys. <words>120</words>
Data alone couldn't reveal the long pulse of cosmic desire; music could. <words>132</words>
Thus he composed star-charts as symphonies, each note a coordinate, each rest a warning of silence. <words>148</words>
He broadcast them via the overlapping hum of mismatched wind chimes strung along the outer hull. <words>164</words>
Solar winds struck the chimes, translating melodies into electromagnetic vectors the leviathans could follow. <words>178</words>
Across centuries of longing, Arin waited for an answer that might never arrive. <words>191</words>
Patience carved savage grace into his posture, a stillness sharp enough to sever despair. <words>205</words>
One crimson rotation later, the sensors caught a foreign rhythm clanging against the ship's periphery. <words>220</words>
Unknown pods approached, their exteriors tattooed with the same mark of trust as Arin's record. <words>235</words>
Before alarms could blare, the hull unfurled like petals, welcoming the strangers with mechanical courtesy. <words>250</words>
Figures of translucent sinew floated inside, their forms flickering between flesh and photon. <words>263</words>
They spoke through resonance, plucking vibrations from the chimes the way humans pluck harp strings. <words>278</words>
Though alien, their melody mirrored Arin's unfinished chorus, completing it with aching, mathematical beauty. <words>292</words>
Proof glimmered: his cartographic music had become lingua franca for migratory minds older than suns. <words>307</words>
Arin offered the warped vinyl record, bowing as one offers a blade's hilt to a friend. <words>323</words>
The chief apparition extended a ripple that seemed to lunge yet caress, fusing with the plastic. <words>339</words>
In that touch, memory cascaded: oceans shattered, species uprooted, constellations rearranged to shelter drifting souls. <words>354</words>
Each vision stamped the record brighter, engraving coordinates of refuge beyond Arin's charts. <words>367</words>
The knowledge was intangibly tangible, hovering like breath you can see in cold morning light. <words>382</words>
When dawn of the next system bloomed, the apparitions receded, leaving behind harmonic star-waypoints. <words>396</words>
Arin knelt at the viewing bay as leviathans surfaced from hyperspace, riding those newborn scales of sound. <words>413</words>
Their vast bodies glimmered like living staves, and the recycled spaceship answered with chorded thruster-Light. <words>428</words>
At last, the map sang itself, and Arin, emptied of self, filled the universe with trust. <words>444</words>
