The carnival once rattled with children, but tonight its abandoned ticket booth shivers beneath moth-eaten canvas.<words>16</words>
Inside, Bram the gloomy barkeep polishes an imaginary glass, moonlight streaking his gaunt cheeks like unpaid tabs.<words>33</words>
He is abrasively charming, all rasping wit and splinters, the kind of smile that apologizes after cutting.<words>50</words>
The hush when a truce forms without words descends, so complete even rusted gears forget to squeal.<words>67</words>
Bram waits for the phone to drone, that hollow insect buzz he needs for business tonight.<words>83</words>
Across the midway, a broken payphone booth leans like a drunk prophet, receiver dangling, secrets hemorrhaging into wind.<words>101</words>
Bram listens via overheard confessions at that booth, because reality here rewrites itself through whatever stories leak out.<words>119</words>
Tonight, a tremoring voice murmurs about a stolen light, brighter than dawn, swallowed by midnight's greedy jaw.<words>136</words>
The voice claims the thief left behind a worn wallet packed with shifting photographs of places that never stay put.<words>156</words>
Bram fingers his own pocket, feeling the same wallet he found beneath the bar of his shuttered tavern.<words>174</words>
Inside that leather, cities orbit then dissolve, lovers age backward, trains arrive before tickets are printed—a carousel of transient realities.<words>194</words>
The barkeep once tried to spend those photographs as currency, and the cashier across town forgot he existed.<words>212</words>
That was lesson one: handle illusions and the world misplaces you like a sock lost in static.<words>229</words>
Lesson two arrives now, whispered down the telephone line, shuddering through carnival wires into Bram's marrow.<words>245</words>
Retrieve the light, return it to the sky, and the wallet will finally empty, letting him stay somewhere.<words>263</words>
So he leaves the booth, boots crunching popcorn ghosts, following a stripe of darkness that gleams like oil.<words>281</words>
It slides toward the Ferris wheel, where every gondola hangs upside down, catching stars the way nets catch fireflies.<words>300</words>
At the wheel's hub swirls a violet glow, pulsing heartbeats that don't belong to any present hour.<words>317</words>
Midnight, personified as a tall woman in a coat of falling feathers, cradles the glow like contraband sugar.<words>335</words>
Her eyes are empty clocks; her smile suggests she borrowed time and never paid interest.<words>350</words>
Bram greets her with that abrasively charming humor, offering to trade one last drink for the captive dawn.<words>368</words>
Midnight laughs, and the Ferris wheel creaks, but the hush of truce still holds—no word, no violence.<words>385</words>
Instead, Bram opens the worn wallet, letting photos whirl into raven feathers, each snapshot slicing a feather from her coat.<words>405</words>
Feathers drop like calendar pages, and with them pieces of night tumble, revealing dawn imprisoned in the violet glow.<words>424</words>
When the last photograph flutters away, the glow lifts skyward, spreading blush over clouds, erasing the woman named Midnight.<words>443</words>
Bram watches color flood the carnival, and feels the wallet collapse into ordinary leather, finally, mercifully empty.<words>460</words>
He pockets it anyway, because habits cling, yet as sunlight climbs the Ferris wheel he discovers the world remembers him again.<words>481</words>
The carnival tickets print themselves blank for tomorrow's possibilities, and the gloomy barkeep allows himself a curt, uncut smile.<words>500</words>
