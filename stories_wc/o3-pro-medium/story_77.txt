I flip the brittle page and watch lunar dust drift like sleepy snowflakes across the cramped cabin of the asteroid. <words>20</words>
This is the closing page of the forgotten journal I stole from Captain Half-Grin's bunk after last night's raid. <words>39</words>
Ink still glows faintly, reacting to the station's leaking ultraviolet vents and my own drowsy enthusiasm for secret light. <words>58</words>
I, Liora the introverted empath, hear heartbeats in metal bulkheads yet keep my voice shelved behind shy ribs. <words>76</words>
But the journal throbs louder than any pulse, urging me to champion the outcasts of reason marooned here. <words>94</words>
Its author claimed mountain wisdom could sprout even in zero gravity if one listened to rock the way cliffs listen to clouds. <words>116</words>
I never saw a mountain, yet the metaphor feels obviously hidden, like a lantern under a blanket that still warms a room. <words>138</words>
Captain Half-Grin plans to sell the asteroid's ice veins to the warlords, abandoning the misfit crew to vacuum and broken songs. <words>159</words>
I must marshal a quieter rebellion before daylight from the distant sun peeks over the jagged ore piles outside. <words>178</words>
My tool is neither blaster nor bomb but a dried starfish I wear on a cord, crusted with salt from forgotten seas. <words>200</words>
Its five arms spiral like antennae, amplifying emotions I absorb, letting me weave them into tangible threads that can tug machinery. <words>221</words>
Yet the threads are scattered tonight, brittle as the shattered marionette that lies across my cot from yesterday's drunken juggling contest. <words>242</words>
Through reassembling fragments of the marionette, I can map missing strands of feeling the way surgeons stitch nerves. <words>260</words>
I kneel, matching splinter to splinter, teak to twine, until the puppet stands again, arms lifted in silent applause. <words>279</words>
Emotion flows back, a hush of collective longing from every bunkroom where insomniac pirates pretend to snore. <words>296</words>
The starfish glimmers, catching their dreams, and the marionette's strings snake through ventilation grates toward the command deck. <words>314</words>
Half-Grin, nodding over charts, suddenly feels the ache of every orphaned equation he mocked, every dismissed hypothesis, and his swagger falters. <words>335</words>
I walk in, puppet at my shoulder like a wooden conscience, and offer him the journal's last line: 'He who sells peaks buys his own avalanche'. <words>361</words>
Mountain wisdom, translated for space rogues, lands harder than a meteor; Half-Grin orders engines reversed, profits be damned. <words>379</words>
Crewmates feel the decision ripple and sit up blinking, their inner constellations realigned, their exile from reason suddenly revoked. <words>398</words>
I retreat to my berth, starfish cooling, marionette asleep, letting the new silence settle like soft snowfall over stone peaks I have never seen. <words>422</words>
Somewhere inside the journal, ink dries at last, but its hidden glow lingers behind my eyelids, promising dawn for every reasonable outcast. <words>444</words>
