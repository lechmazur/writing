Flour dust spiraled like ghostly snow as Viora, the frantic cook, burst into the earthquake prediction facility's archive.<words>18</words>
She was not on the menu, yet destiny had ordered her presence with unsettling urgency.<words>33</words>
An alarm stuttered in the corridors, blinking red against seismographs humming in frenzied tranquility.<words>47</words>
Viora clutched a worn pencil eraser like a talisman, its rubber edges chewed by decades of nervous scholars.<words>65</words>
Only the eraser could blot out what she feared to see.<words>76</words>
In a sealed drawer she discovered packets of forgotten letters, each envelope coated in centuries of layered dust.<words>94</words>
They were addressed to nobody and everybody, stamped with symbols older than cooking fire.<words>108</words>
The letters spoke of quakes that had not yet happened and meals that could steady trembling earth.<words>125</words>
Viora sensed an impossibly conceivable pattern linking appetite and tectonics.<words>135</words>
But to trust the prophecy, she first had to subvert the institution guarding it.<words>149</words>
The facility's directors claimed certainty, yet they never tasted their own theories.<words>161</words>
Viora remembered her grandmother stirring broth to calm storms, and faith guided her hands again.<words>176</words>
She lifted a wooden walking stick mounted as decoration beside a Richter chart.<words>189</words>
Tiny notches scarred its shaft like tally marks of unseen beats beneath the crust.<words>203</words>
By analyzing small notches on a wooden walking stick, Viora realized each cut matched a consonant in the forgotten letters.<words>223</words>
The stick was a ciphered recipe predicting quakes through flavor notes instead of Richter numbers.<words>238</words>
Salt foretold thrust faults, pepper hissed of subduction, oregano sang of slow slips.<words>251</words>
She scribbled translations on stainless counters, the worn pencil eraser smudging doubts away.<words>264</words>
Patterns emerged like simmering soup parts joining a single aroma.<words>274</words>
Each predicted quake aligned with eras when the letters went missing, proving the facility suppressed their own evidence.<words>292</words>
Viora's motive crystallized: to expose the root of all illusions and feed the world truth.<words>307</words>
She activated the public address system, voice trembling yet clear like ladle against pot.<words>321</words>
Reading the ciphers aloud, she mixed spices in the air, each syllable a scent undeniable.<words>336</words>
Seismologists paused, nostrils flaring, minds widening beyond calibrated graphs.<words>345</words>
The building quivered, not from tectonics but from collective realization.<words>355</words>
Data screens flashed recipes in place of waveforms, and nobody dared hit reset.<words>368</words>
Illusions fell like overbaked crusts, revealing tender layers of interwoven hunger and stone.<words>381</words>
Through centuries of layered dust, truth finally tasted fresh.<words>390</words>
Viora exhaled, frenzy cooling to tranquility, and the world listened for the next course of the planet's heartbeat.<words>408</words>
