An ancient moon slanted silver over the forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest, where Ira the wistful loom spinner worked alone. [22]  
She sat between crooked pear trunks whose blossoms smelled like distant rain, feeding thread into a loom older than recorded names. [43]  
Each shuttle beat sounded softer than breath, for a raveling silence had settled across the grove after decades without visitors. [63]  
Ira spun not cloth for clothing but stories woven into shimmering bands only patient ears could read. [80]  
Tonight her fingers trembled with a purpose heavier than thread, because she must carry a message across impossible distance. [99]  
Beyond the bamboo, mountains barricaded the world, and beyond the mountains towered citadels of iron that denied all courier birds. [119]  
Yet an amber bead, hardened tree sap glowing warm at her neck, waited stoically sparkling for its story to be sent. [140]  
Within that bead slept the last laugh of her vanished sister, trapped the night soldiers burned their childhood village. [159]  
If Ira could embroider the laugh into cloth and launch it on the wind, the memory might reach the sister's orphaned son. [181]  
But the winds were monitored by hostile ears, so Ira turned to puzzles and patience. [196]  
Weeks earlier she had walked to a nearby ghost hamlet and sifted through a rummage sale box abandoned outside the shuttered chapel. [218]  
There she found jigsaw puzzle edges whose inner pictures were missing, sea-salted cardboard arcs that once framed of sunsets and birthdays. [239]  
Ira saw a code in the teeth of those pieces, the same repeating angles she once used to twist battens on her loom. [262]  
If she could align loom threads to those jagged margins, cloth would form pathways for sound instead of color. [281]  
So she mapped the orchard by moonlight, planting puzzle edges at every tree root until the grove itself became an unseen frame. [303]  
Then she recommenced the weaving, lifting warp threads over weft in patterns echoing that cardboard perimeter. [319]  
The raveling silence responded, pulling itself taut like fresh string across the clearing, waiting to vibrate. [335]  
Through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry, Ira whispered her sister's name as shuttle struck beam. [351]  
The name slid into the threads, bled along the grid of puzzle geometry, and pooled inside the stoically sparkling bead. [371]  
A faint chuckle, recognizable and impossible, fluttered from the bead and perched upon the highest bamboo stalk. [388]  
The stalk bent like a bowstring, launching the sound beyond the orchard with an arc guided by puzzle-edge ley lines. [408]  
Ira closed her eyes and felt the laugh recede farther than echo, traveling valley to valley, bypassing patrols that hunted music. [429]  
She pictured the orphaned boy asleep beneath iron spires, his dreams sour with smoke until the laugh would gild them dawn-gentle. [450]  
Yet the loom spinner understood that every thread carrying memory must pay toll to distance. [465]  
The toll was herself. [469]  
Silence, now tuned, began to devour the ambient sounds of crickets, leaves, and her own heartbeat, weaving them into the departing signal. [491]  
Pear blossoms stopped rustling, bamboo joints ceased creaking, even night air forgot how to sigh, and still Ira wove. [510]  
With every shuttle pass, she aged a season, her hair paling into frost, her spine bending like a puzzle piece left in rain. [533]  
But the amber bead shone brighter, keeping score of sacrifice without complaint. [545]  
At dawn the final thread locked, and the raveling silence snapped free, soaring eastward as a river of unheard gold. [565]  
Sound returned to the orchard like water to drought ground, but Ira's ears caught none of it. [582]  
She lay against a pear trunk, eyes blind with morning sun yet steady, because the message was in motion. [601]  
Somewhere beyond mountain shadows, a boy would wake to hear his mother's laugh rippling inside a stoically sparkling raindrop. [620]  
He would know at once that it traveled through jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box, through bamboo quiet, through sacrifice. [643]  
And he would smile, lightning the iron dawn, while in the orchard the loom spinner expired like a candle finishing its letter. [665]  
The bead dropped from her neck onto soil, but its glow refused to fade, promising that silences, once raveled, can recommence as song. [688]  
In that glow lived a latent sacrifice, quiet yet enduring as bamboo roots. [701]
