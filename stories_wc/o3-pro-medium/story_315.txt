Lark Beaumont, an eloquently clumsy spiritual con artist, tiptoed into the national quantum entanglement lab before sunrise.<words>17</words>
He had promised investors enlightenment at wholesale, and the lab's forbidden instruments would help him fabricate the glow.<words>35</words>
Yet tucked inside his coat pocket was a simple glass jar lid, the only relic of sincerity he owned.<words>54</words>
Its circular scratch reminded him that every promise, once opened, has an edge that can cut back.<words>71</words>
Professor Mireles, overseeing nocturnal experiments, caught Lark fiddling with a laser array and demanded the password of intent.<words>89</words>
Thinking fast, Lark recited a prayer of Schrödinger in flawless Latin, accidentally ejecting his elbow into a fragile capacitor.<words>108</words>
The resulting spark stunned both men long enough for quantum code to misfire and record data backward.<words>125</words>
Frames of reality began rewinding like skittish film, scenes advancing only through reversed moments the corrupted computer insisted were forward.<words>145</words>
Lark, dazzled, saw a business opportunity glittering between imploding seconds.<words>155</words>
If he could harvest dialogue spoken in retreat, he could sell tomorrow’s confessions before people realized they had lied.<words>174</words>
But Professor Mireles, aghast, warned that retrieving truth without consent carries a price that multiplies per paradox.<words>191</words>
The words 'price of truth' echoed inside the jar lid, which vibrated like a tiny gong against Lark's chest.<words>210</words>
Time, still tumbling backward, displayed dawn in negative, blackening the windows where orange should have bloomed.<words>226</words>
Lark remembered his private motivation: to laugh in the face of the inevitable dawn, selling punchlines to the void.<words>245</words>
But how do you laugh when laughter itself is playing backward into a sob?<words>259</words>
Clumsily, yet with rhetorical flourish, he lifted the jar lid like a scholar brandishing a shield of folk wisdom.<words>278</words>
He declared, 'I pay my debt now,' and slammed the lid onto the lab floor, shattering its thin halo.<words>297</words>
The fragments skittered, each shard capturing a microsecond that refused to rewind, anchoring cause and effect like sudden nails.<words>316</words>
The corrupted mainframe tried to eject the new chronology, but the anchored nails pinned software and sunrise alike.<words>334</words>
Colors surged forward, and Professor Mireles saw that his monitors now displayed contracts signed in future tense, profit cancelled.<words>353</words>
Lark, meanwhile, felt every ill-gotten promise slide from his memory, replaced by the honest ache of things never said.<words>372</words>
He laughed anyway, a raw new sound that pushed dawn forward and tilted the lab’s clocks into obedient progression.<words>391</words>
Serious playfulness, he realized, meant risking everything on a joke sturdy enough to survive being told backwards.<words>408</words>
When the sun finally rose in proper direction, he swept the broken lid into his pocket, swore off con artistry, and began crafting truths worthy of the daylight.<words>436</words>
Throughout crafting his new existence, he kept the tiniest shard on his desk, a glittering receipt for the price of truth.<words>457</words>
