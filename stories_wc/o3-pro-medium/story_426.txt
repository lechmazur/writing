I first spotted the secretive pathfinder, Lyra Reed, running laps around the rusted ticket booths of Moonlight Park's haunted ghost train. <words>21</words>
Her maroon windbreaker flapped like angry prayer flags, radiating an oddly angrily peaceful determination that made the night air tense. <words>41</words>
She trained for a marathon no one would watch, pacing herself to the skeletal carousel's creaks and the distant calliope wheeze. <words>62</words>
Every mile marker was a carriage of the ghost train, each still painted with chipped lunar moths that blinked when the wind moaned. <words>85</words>
Between sprints, Lyra unfolded a weather-stained map only she could read, tracing invisible ley lines that threaded beneath abandoned midway stalls. <words>106</words>
People once called her the forgotten prodigy of orienteering, a runaway kid who beat satellites with a compass made from magnetized spoon steel. <words>129</words>
But tonight her mission was medicinal, fueled by aloof passion for elders who whispered that wild feverwort still grew under twisted tracks. <words>151</words>
If she mapped the roots before dawn, folk medicines might survive the corporate demolition scheduled after the holiday lights were unplugged. <words>172</words>
Guidance came from a cracked porcelain teapot she carried in her pack, its lid taped, its belly sloshing faint aromas of wormwood. <words>194</words>
The teapot had belonged to her grandmother, and tiny fractures formed prophetic constellations Lyra read like nocturnal charts. <words>212</words>
Because phones were tracked, she communicated with allies by hacking bizarre music playlists with hidden track info conveying coordinates and soil conditions. <words>234</words>
Followers refreshing mixtapes for midnight jogs unknowingly relayed her breadcrumb symphonies across the city, amplifying her clandestine cartography. <words>252</words>
Yet the amusement park's security AI had begun remixing the files, overlaying childlike laughter loops that threatened to scramble her medicinal atlas. <words>274</words>
During a water break beside the ride's yawning mouth, an animatronic conductor lurched alive, demanding she surrender the teapot. <words>293</words>
Lyra's angrily peaceful gaze cut through flickering LEDs; instead of fighting, she opened her arms and gave the whirring mannequin a hug. <words>315</words>
Pressure sensors misread tenderness as compliance, unlocking a maintenance hatch where she ducked inside, clutching map and teapot like sacred organs. <words>336</words>
Corridors beneath the tracks smelled of ozone and marigolds, the conflicting scents merging until she understood the park itself was her final waypoint. <words>359</words>
She poured wormwood tea onto cracked concrete, and steam traced the exact root pattern of feverwort hiding just beyond the tunnel exit. <words>381</words>
Recording the glowing vapor with her wrist camera, she posted a new playlist titled 'Finish Line,' the metadata spelling instructions for safe harvest. <words>404</words>
Then, as sunrise pinked the haunted midway, she resumed marathon training, each stride etching invisible preserves into the ground she vowed to protect. <words>427</words>
