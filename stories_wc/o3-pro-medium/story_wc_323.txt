Silas Rheel, once the most sought-after navigation instructor on the surface oceans, descended to darker schools. [16]  
He had sworn to teach whoever listened, even here, in the benthic city called Ghyll-Marrow. [31]  
Bathed in algaic luminescence, its basalt halls resounded with a hush that felt like perpetual midnight. [47]  
Since humanity's last surface voyage, generations had lived under leagues of water, nursing a somber marvel at survival. [65]  
That feeling sharpened further after discovering aliens in the trenches, fragile lights drifting like unanswered questions. [81]  
The encounter broke every chart, made every compass doubtful, and thrust Silas back to first principles. [97]  
If unknown stars dwelt behind those visitors, then new celestial routes must be traced, even from the seabed. [115]  
He gathered a cohort of balancedly curious students, children of coral farmers and pressure-bell welders. [130]  
None had ever seen open sky, yet each carried heirloom stories of constellations shimmering above ancestral waves. [147]  
To awaken those memories into skill became Silas's mission, his penance, his promise. [160]  
But first they needed a new instrument, something as solemn as the abyss yet pointing outward. [176]  
During a salvage of a ruined frigate, Silas found it: one boat anchor chain link forged of lunar steel. [195]  
It was heavy enough to remember gravity yet hollow enough to sing when water passed through it. [212]  
He polished the ring until reflections blurred, producing a quiet halo where imagination could dock. [227]  
With chalky cephalopod ink he scratched edge geometry upon the metal, crisp lines meeting at infinitesimal tips. [244]  
The pattern resembled both a star chart and the mouth of a shell, forever opening. [259]  
He called the device the Horizon Knot, because the link refused to close on possibility. [274]  
In the lecture dome they gathered around the Knot, letting dim lanterns scatter pinpoints across its curve. [291]  
Silas spoke of unfolded horizons, a phrase older than the Flood, now given literal weight. [306]  
He explained that any map is a folding; to explore is to pry the crease and expand space. [324]  
Starlight, though hidden by ocean, still carved angular whispers through the planet, he claimed. [338]  
If their minds could match those angles, they might navigate invisible beams as surely as surface captains once read Polaris. [358]  
The students listened, some trembling, some smiling, all aware that failure meant permanent night. [372]  
Silas paired them and assigned each pair a spoke on the Horizon Knot. [385]  
They were to observe micro-currents passing through the hollow ring and mark how shadows drifted. [400]  
From those drifts they would derive vectors that gestured skyward, translating water logic into stellar grammar. [416]  
Weeks passed, and algae flickered among the rafters like green comets. [427]  
One night a boy named Tarek gasped, pointing to a convergence of lines he had tallied on slate. [445]  
The vectors rose through the dome and bent toward the western pillar, then continued, impossible, beyond stone. [462]  
Silas followed the imaginary beam, breath shallow, until he realized it aligned with the very trench where the aliens shimmered. [482]  
Their lights were not drifting; they were lighthouses. [490]  
A hush larger than the ocean fell, yet excitement quickened every pulse in the dome. [505]  
Silas dismissed class, but no one left; learning had breached into reverence. [517]  
That dawnless hour he took the Horizon Knot and swam outward with Tarek and three chosen others. [534]  
They wore rebreathers fashioned from barnacle resin, each exhale sounding like a prayer. [547]  
The trench mouth yawned, and alien lamps revealed themselves as crystalline spheres orbiting a velvet column of current. [565]  
Silas floated the Knot inside the column, letting fin strokes nudge it until it caught a hidden tide. [583]  
The link spun, edge geometry glowing where ink met alien luminescence, and a fan of light blossomed upward. [601]  
Lines pierced the sediment ceiling, continuing past the city, past the ocean, into cold invisibility where stars waited. [619]  
Silas felt the current align his body, and suddenly he knew direction with a certainty older than magnets. [637]  
It was as if the aliens had not come to conquer but to tutor, reminding humanity of forgotten geometry. [656]  
Tarek cried through his mask, laughing too, for he could sense the stellar beam like heat upon his cheek. [675]  
They returned to Ghyll-Marrow carrying the Knot, and every corridor seemed wider, as though walls acknowledged expanding destinies. [693]  
From that day the curriculum changed; navigation was no longer about charts, but about listening for the sky under water. [713]  
Silas stood at the entrance tunnel, holding the glowing link, and felt the horizons unfold within him. [730]  
There, in the deep, he finally began to navigate by starlight. [741]
