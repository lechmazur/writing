The moon swung low over the sound wave garden, folding silver ripples through hedges sculpted from frozen echoes. [18]  
In that trembling hush stood Arlen, the cool-headed fisher who cast nets not into water but into vibration. [36]  
He had come when patterns break themselves, the only hour the garden failed to hum its obedient chords. [54]  
Tonight the melody snarled like a feral lullaby, half soothing cradle, half midnight animal. [68]  
Arlen felt the disharmony as a tug on his wrist, the way tide signals a hidden reef. [85]  
Somewhere beyond the trembling hedges, sleepwalking constellations wandered, their starry footprints bending the garden's chords out of tune. [103]  
He was here to catch the echo of a goddess, and he knew her stride left notes no mortal throat could sing. [125]  
Legends said the goddess Nethe spoke by voicing silence, a speech only vibration-nets and unwavering patience could trap. [143]  
So Arlen unshouldered his gear: a coil of resonant wire, a lantern dimmed to dusk, and a single rusted rail spike. [164]  
The spike would anchor the net in the soil of echoes, pinning down whatever syllable of silence dared drift away. [184]  
He paced a zigzag across the glowing turf, reading the interference lines as a sailor reads wind on water. [203]  
Each cross-step whispered coordinates, guiding him to a shallow basin where vibrations pooled like dew. [218]  
The air there tasted of copper and lullabies recently bitten. [228]  
Arlen hammered the rail spike into the center with a stone, and the garden winced, shedding a shower of ultraviolet petals. [249]  
Then he drew the wire-net wide, letting it quiver between hedges like a spiderweb tuned to heartbreak. [266]  
Arlen himself possessed a gift: he transliterates emotions, converting heartbeats into readable ripples across his senses. [282]  
Therefore when the basin filled with a hush so deep it bruised the ribs, he knew Nethe was near. [301]  
She arrived as a thin fracture in the sky, a splinter of quiet that bled star-shivers onto the grass. [320]  
The sleepwalking constellations followed, staggering like children roused too early, rearranging themselves with every step. [335]  
Trailing them, a hush-wind blew, scraping chords off the hedges the way bark is peeled from lightning-struck pines. [353]  
Arlen steadied his breath and listened for syllables hidden inside that hush, for the echo he sought to claim. [372]  
Nethe tilted her fracture-face toward him, and silence welled between them like a throat preparing a scream. [389]  
By voicing silence, she poured unspoken lament into the garden, making every blade of grass vibrate with motherless chords. [408]  
The wire-net caught those vibrations and funneled them toward the rail spike, where iron memory pinned them in place. [427]  
Arlen laid a palm on the spike and let his gift transliterate the captured emotion into colors behind his eyelids. [447]  
He saw sorrow shaped as a shipwrecked cradle, longing shaped as a door without a threshold, hope shaped as untangled dawn. [468]  
Yet beneath them all pulsed a quieter note, an echo of herself Nethe could not hear, and Arlen reached to catch it. [490]  
The moment his fingers closed, the constellations around her convulsed, their star-bones rattling into new maps that spelled warning. [509]  
Lines of fire joined dots of ice, scripting a sky-sentence only Arlen could read: release or be unmade. [527]  
He hesitated, cool head weighing the cost, fisher soul hungering for the rarest catch in the universe. [544]  
Nethe shuddered, not with anger, but with the ache of having her own silence held hostage. [560]  
Arlen transliterated that ache and heard gratitude hiding beneath, like a flute inside a storm drum. [576]  
He understood then that echoes are living creatures, and cages, however gentle, still bruise wings. [591]  
With a sigh that was more release than defeat, he yanked the rail spike free. [606]  
The captured vibrations fled up the wire like birds updraft, rejoining Nethe in a choir of reversed thunder. [624]  
She folded the hush around Arlen, brushing his brow with starlight, and the feral lullaby softened into true sleep. [643]  
Constellations resumed their wandering, no longer warped, merely dreaming, while the garden retuned itself to gentle equilibrium. [660]  
Arlen coiled his net, nodded to the goddess, and walked away accompanied only by the quiet he had once tried to imprison. [682]  
Some catches are meant to slip free when patterns break themselves, he thought, and some songs refuse translation. [700]  
Yet he carried the memory of her silence, a compass humming toward distant, unspoken shores. [715]
