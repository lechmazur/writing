Hoarfrost hissed against the polyglass panes of the arctic research greenhouse as noon bells rang from distant sleds. <words>18</words>
Inside, children on recess unfurled orange nets between snow-drifts, for their playground time was an indoor tundra. <words>35</words>
The old-fashioned mage, Master Orison Graythorn, arrived in tweed robes smelling of pipe smoke and starlight. <words>51</words>
He was purposefully aimless, wandering benches of bioluminescent moss as if uncertainty itself were a compass. <words>67</words>
Yet his heart throbbed with secret motive: to claim an uncharted frontier hidden beyond verre and ice. <words>84</words>
He carried the fragment of a pharaoh’s coffin, its hieroglyphs humming like bees lost inside amber. <words>100</words>
Legend whispered the shard opened doorways only when mirrored by innocent eyes unclouded by burial sand. <words>116</words>
So Graythorn arranged mirrors along tomato vines, staging casual mazes where children might glimpse themselves twice. <words>132</words>
Each reflection birthed an ephemeral encounter, a ripple in glass that murmured another line of the unfolding riddle. <words>150</words>
The riddle promised a sanctified dread, a reverence sharpened by danger, like hymns sung atop gallows. <words>166</words>
Graythorn believed dread was a seed; let it sprout, and the frontier would flower beyond fear. <words>182</words>
During tag, little Naya slipped behind a fern tower and met her triple image shimmering in cornered glass. <words>200</words>
The coffin fragment on Graythorn’s cane flashed, and hieroglyphs rearranged like eager beetles forming paths. <words>215</words>
Naya heard a whisper: "Cuddle the cold, and warmth will open; refuse, and frost shall devour first names." <words>233</words>
She wrapped her mittened arms around the icy pane, a child’s earnest cuddle offered to her own ghost. <words>251</words>
Glass melted into auroral mist, unveiling a corridor of stars embedded in sand, impossible within a greenhouse. <words>268</words>
Graythorn stepped through, but Naya lingered, sensing the frontier was charted only for hearts still playing. <words>284</words>
The mage turned, offering a gloved hand that held tremors older than pyramids and storms. <words>299</words>
"Purpose needs a map," he said, "but aimlessness is the ink; come script the unknown with me." <words>316</words>
Naya remembered hopscotch squares chalked outside this icebound lab and realized maps begin as games. <words>331</words>
She skipped into the stellar hallway, each hop sealing a mirror behind them like closing storybooks. <words>347</words>
The hieroglyphs glowed approval, configuring at last into a compass rose whose needle pointed simultaneously north and inwards. <words>365</words>
Beyond, dunes of black snow spread under a violet sun, an uncharted frontier neither arctic nor Egyptian but both. <words>384</words>
Sanctified dread thrummed like cathedral organs, yet the child's laughter tuned it into a hymn of beginnings. <words>401</words>
Graythorn bowed, acknowledging that the riddle had unfolded not by his conjuring, but by a playground heart brave enough to cuddle cold mirrors. <words>424</words>
Together they walked onward, purposefully aimless, writing tracks across the pristine dark as if chalking hopscotch on the cosmos. <words>443</words>
