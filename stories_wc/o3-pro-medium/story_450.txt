As a sharp-witted dancer, I always rehearse my pirouettes in the Research Ministry's thought experiment chamber, because movement explains ideas more honestly than chalkboards. <words>24</words>
But words still corner me like spotlight glare, exposing how linguistically inept I am whenever a diplomat demands even a greeting. <words>45</words>
So I answer with ankles, knees, shoulders, letting their rhythms mimic the tongues I cannot pronounce. <words>61</words>
Mother calls it silent blasphemy; Father calls it our legacy, because every ancestor since the first moon landing has danced instead of spoken. <words>84</words>
The legacy crystallizes each autumn when the whole family squeezes into foam-filled tubs for the yearly photo, toes wrinkling while camera drones hover. <words>107</words>
Aunt Liora insists bubble baths dilute vanity, so the snapshots capture only truth, pruned skin and all. <words>124</words>
This year, however, truth weighs heavier than water, because Grandfather brings the scorched mission patch he scavenged from the wreck of Voyager-Theta. <words>146</words>
The patch still smells of burnt ozone, and its embroidered stars blink like bruises beneath suds that try to pretend nothing fell from the sky. <words>171</words>
Grandfather says the crash fulfilled eight of nine clauses in our family's final prophecy, leaving only my performance to seal the twist. <words>193</words>
I feel saturated ambivalence flood the tub: pride bubbles beside dread, joy gurgles with guilt, certainty floats and sinks simultaneously. <words>213</words>
To prepare, we drain the water and summon the thought experiment chamber's holographic orrery, replacing soap with starlight. <words>231</words>
Grandfather orders me to mimic gravity itself, to show denial its own impossible mass. <words>245</words>
I spin, hesitate, leap, and suddenly every movement drags as though shackled to unseen planets, making the weight of denial visible to everyone soaked in cosmos. <words>271</words>
The prophecy dictates that once denial is seen, it must be worn, so Grandfather stitches the mission patch onto my leotard where my heart stammers. <words>296</words>
Its charred threads scorch my skin, yet the pain speaks fluently, translating what my tongue cannot, and diplomats finally nod at my silent speech. <words>320</words>
Still, the twist arrives: the prophecy never promised absolution, only articulation, so the denial I revealed now belongs to me forever. <words>341</words>
Family applause echoes like water against porcelain, half-celebration, half-eulogy, and I cannot discern which half drowns me more. <words>359</words>
When the tub refills, I recline amid lukewarm bubbles, wearing the scorched star against my chest, posing for the camera that documents every unresolved emotion. <words>384</words>
Flash after flash, saturated ambivalence stains the steam, and my dance freezes into familial folklore before the water finally turns cold. <words>405</words>
