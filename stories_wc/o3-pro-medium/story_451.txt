Crystal shadows draped the morning as Oliver Crane navigated the bustling farmers market, feeling the prophecy ticking beneath his ribs. <words>20</words>
He was one half of a separated twin, yet the half without a name, hiring actors to mirror possibilities of identity. <words>41</words>
Each actor performed memories that never happened, and Oliver watched, hoping a gesture would unlock the typically unique truth of his origin. <words>63</words>
What drove him was survival, for an apocalyptic prophecy promised the world would shatter unless he learned who he had been. <words>84</words>
Deep in his coat pocket gleamed a baseball signed by a time traveler, ink glimmering like dusk on frozen glass. <words>104</words>
The traveler had whispered that the ball would point the way, but only atop a mysterious mountain peak unlisted on any map. <words>126</words>
So, amid crates of peaches and shouts of vendors, Oliver scheduled a clandestine meeting in a hidden location beneath the market's canvas awnings. <words>149</words>
There, he recruited Mara and Darius, seasoned stage chameleons, promising payment and passage beyond the predicted cataclysm. <words>166</words>
Their first task was to subdue the ball's secret, because the traveler had warned it defended itself with temporal mirages. <words>186</words>
At twilight they left the valley, caravan of three, following a compass that spun only when nobody watched it. <words>205</words>
The road climbed through cedar forests until snow etched lattices of silence, and crystal shadows lengthened like predictions stretching toward fact. <words>226</words>
On the summit, wind keened around a stone amphitheater older than languages, its center shaped exactly like a pitcher's mound. <words>246</words>
Oliver placed the baseball on the mound, and symbols blazed across the leather, sketching a map inside the whitening air. <words>266</words>
But the forbidden knowledge spoke in twin voices, one coaxing, one condemning, and Oliver felt his skull divide along phantom seams. <words>287</words>
Mara improvised a lullaby from a play about orphans, while Darius projected paternal thunder, performing the parents Oliver never remembered. <words>307</words>
The voices inside the stormy glyphs hesitated, as though applause had interrupted them, and the ball's glow softened to watch. <words>327</words>
Seizing the moment, Oliver uttered his unnamed half's question: "Which twin is destined to survive?" <words>342</words>
The symbols whirled, then arranged into a single line: You both, if you remain typically unique yet inseparably combined. <words>361</words>
Understanding flooded Oliver; he was not missing a brother, he was the amalgam of two timelines cleaved by fear. <words>380</words>
He turned to the actors who had become reflections, thanked them, and rolled the quieted baseball toward dawn, determined to outlive the world's ending by embodying it whole. <words>408</words>
