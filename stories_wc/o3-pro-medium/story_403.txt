The floating library drifted over violet clouds, its balconies creaking like masts above a forgotten sea. <words>16</words>
Inside, a hope-worn knight named Sir Calias limped between shelves that rotated themselves in quiet circles. <words>32</words>
He had wandered across the boundary between real and myth, seeking consistent miracles rather than fickle marvels. <words>49</words>
Every miracle he'd witnessed before dissolved when stared at too long, a tormenting lesson in joyful agony. <words>66</words>
Now he carried only an ordinary seashell, dull gray, polished by thumb and memory. <words>80</words>
Its unremarkable spiral reminded him that surface and depth could conspire to be deeply superficial. <words>95</words>
He intended to seclude himself among the floating volumes until he decoded the shell's silent sermon. <words>111</words>
The librarian, a translucent heron wearing spectacles, pointed him toward an alcove marked "Reference of Impossible Exits." <words>128</words>
There, under a swaying chandelier of ink drops, stood a faded fortune teller's booth salvaged from a carnival storm. <words>147</words>
Faint notations scratched along its warped cedar panels formed a map of questions instead of places. <words>163</words>
Sir Calias followed the method exactly, by reading faint notations on a faded fortune teller's booth while pressing the seashell to his ear. <words>186</words>
Whispers of tidal algebra mingled with wood-grain riddles, guiding him to a clause promising perception without perimeter. <words>203</words>
To unlock it, the knight had to shelve both doubt and certainty in appropriately numbered slots. <words>219</words>
When the last tome thudded home, the library's floor split like a drawbridge, revealing a corridor made of rippling stories rather than stones. <words>242</words>
Sir Calias stepped forward, every scar stinging with delight, every heartbeat aching with the possibility of unfiltered sight. <words>260</words>
The corridor carried him across the boundary between real and myth until the air itself forgot which grammar to speak. <words>280</words>
There, consistent miracles bloomed like clockwork lilies, opening precisely when wonder brushed them, closing when wonder relented. <words>297</words>
He realized their constancy thrived not on belief but on practiced listening, the discipline of hearing silence turn pages. <words>316</words>
Holding the ordinary seashell aloft, he promised to become its echo rather than its owner. <words>331</words>
The vow unstitched his armor into letters, then into wind, leaving only the knight's will hovering, translucent yet undeniable. <words>350</words>
Joy coursed through him like pain wearing a carnival mask, exquisite and razor bright. <words>364</words>
Agony answered, gentle as rain on steel, reminding him that thresholds require pressure to prove they are doors. <words>382</words>
Balanced between contradictions, Sir Calias finally escaped the limitations of perception and entered vision itself. <words>397</words>
From afar, the floating library resumed its wandering, carrying a new legend shelved where the knight had once stood. <words>416</words>
Within the halls, the faded booth softly glowed, its notations now bold, promising other seekers a map to joyful agony. <words>436</words>
