<story>
Neon rain hissed on the plexiglass roof of the cyberpunk city arcade, inventing glowing rivers above the crowd.<words>18</words>
In the lull between acts of a hacked-hologram opera, Radek the wistful blacksmith wiped micro-sparks from his gauntlets.<words>36</words>
Traditional forges were outlawed, yet he still heard phantom anvils ringing like memory implants at the edge of hearing.<words>55</words>
He had set up a clandestine stall disguised as a retro joystick repair booth, selling bracelets forged from salvaged wiring.<words>75</words>
But what customers truly bought were his botanical drawings, each leaf sketched with circuits instead of veins, fluttering like contraband petals.<words>96</words>
They were maps, obviously subtle to corporate scanners, yet blatant to dreamers craving a route out of steel monotony.<words>115</words>
Radek's motive was not profit but to weave fantasy into reality’s cracks, line by luminous line.<words>131</words>
He believed reclaiming the wild must begin as a story sketched small enough to slip past firewalls.<words>148</words>
Tonight, a child in fiberoptic braids approached, eyes reflecting arcade strobes like twin emerald drones.<words>163</words>
She whispered that outside the district, gardeners were being arrested for soil possession, and asked if his leaves could grow.<words>183</words>
Radek answered with drifting arrogance, the kind worn by exiles who secretly doubt themselves.<words>197</words>
He told her growth could be kindled, not purchased, and invited her behind the kiosk’s curtain.<words>213</words>
There, under a single skylight cracked into the mega-plex ceiling, dust motes swirled like galaxies waiting for cartographers.<words>231</words>
Radek knelt and began to kindle a holographic forge by mapping the swirl of dust motes under a single skylight.<words>251</words>
Lines of light followed his gestures, coalescing into an iron sapling whose branches glimmered with dormant code-buds.<words>268</words>
Each bud corresponded to coordinates hidden inside the botanical drawings, reachable through maintenance tunnels and forgotten drainage arteries.<words>286</words>
Only those who observed the forge could decipher them; spectators outside merely saw a glitchy ad for energy drinks.<words>305</words>
The child stared, her fingertips twitching in desperate memorization, absorbing the secret cartography like roots tasting water.<words>322</words>
When the opera’s next act booted, sirens modulated the air, and corporate sentries swept the arcade scanning for unauthorized luminosity.<words>342</words>
Radek collapsed the forge into a harmless screensaver of bouncing anvils, while the child slipped away clutching a copper leaf.<words>362</words>
He felt the familiar ache of wistfulness, knowing his craft lived only moments before vanishing like untaxed smoke.<words>380</words>
Yet every disappearance planted rumors, and rumors were seeds, and seeds were iron promises that pavement would someday crack.<words>399</words>
Reclaiming the wild, he mused, was not a revolution of noise but a slow oxidizing of cages from within.<words>418</words>
Between acts, beneath skylights, amid dust and neon, he would continue mapping, forging, and trusting children to read the stars.<words>438</words>
