The hush after Caleb's confession hung in the abandoned train tunnel like coal dust refusing to settle. [17]  
He had finally admitted that the voices we chased were not echoes but schedules, an invisible factory ghost shift marching beneath the city. [40]  
Drowsy alertness buzzed through my temples, the strange energy that arrives when exhaustion meets sudden purpose. [56]  
I am a reckless abandoned-mill explorer by habit, religiously skeptical by creed, yet I believed Caleb now. [73]  
Belief felt like gravel in my mouth, unwelcome but solid. [83]  
Between us lay the beaded valve wheel we had scavenged from the derelict rayon plant upstream. [99]  
The brass beads threaded around its rim glimmered in flashlight glare, a rosary for machinery. [114]  
Caleb wanted me to appraise it, not for money, but for significance. [126]  
He thought the wheel was a timecard the dead still punched. [137]  
I knelt, letting the tunnel's chill seep through my jeans, and listened for the shift whistle. [153]  
Silence answered, thick enough to dam breath. [160]  
Still, one cannot weigh a swallowed truth without first unclenching the throat, so I opened mine. [176]  
I told Caleb about the after-midnight hobby I had never mentioned: interpreting frantic calls to talk-radio psychics. [193]  
The psychics spouted incense-sweet nonsense, but the callers poured out patterns, and I collected them like train tickets. [211]  
Cross-referenced, the patterns mapped rumors of industrial specters clocking in where walls had fallen. [225]  
That map had led us here tonight, under rusted girders and comet tails of graffiti. [240]  
Caleb exhaled, the hush vibrated, and a drip somewhere timed our heartbeats. [252]  
"Tell me what the callers said about this tunnel," he murmured, fearing words might bruise the quiet. [269]  
I closed my eyes and recited the snippets that had kept me awake on nicotine and static. [286]  
"Steam turns black at 3 a.m.," one caller had hissed; "the floor shines with people you can't see," another sobbed. [306]  
Most chilling was the trucker from Ohio who swore his CB bled Morse that spelled SHIFT OVER SHIFT. [324]  
Caleb pressed the beaded valve wheel to his chest as if matching a heartbeat to calibration marks. [341]  
I watched, my skepticism religious in its rituals: catalog claim, test claim, discard claim. [355]  
Yet every ritual requires a sacrifice, and doubt was already half-flayed. [366]  
We placed the wheel on a crosstie, knelt opposite, palms hovering like incompetent priests. [380]  
Together we breathed in the metal tang left by locomotives long scrapped. [392]  
The tunnel answered with a low thrumming, so soft I wondered if it was my pulse echoing off insomnia. [411]  
Caleb whispered the confession that had started the hush: "I swallowed the logbook." [424]  
Weeks ago, during a storm of layoffs, he had found the foreman's ledger and, panicking, hidden it inside himself with gulps of water. [447]  
Paper dissolved, but ink lingered in dreams, making him taste carbon copy blue whenever he lied. [463]  
He needed to know the weight of that swallowed truth, to measure guilt the way smelters weigh slag. [481]  
Theory said the valve wheel was calibrated to record atmospheric pressure changes caused by spectral labor, a ghost scale. [500]  
If his confession altered the pressure, we would finally quantify remorse. [511]  
So we waited, eyelids heavy, senses sharp, the paradox of fatigue and fear. [524]  
Minutes slid, ungreased gears of time, until the beads around the wheel began a slow, impossible spin. [541]  
Each bead clicked as if punched by an unseen finger clocking out, then in, then out again. [558]  
The pattern matched the trucker's Morse, SHIFT OVER SHIFT, but with a final stutter that read SHIFT SETTLED. [576]  
My chest tightened, somewhere between prayer and audit. [584]  
Caleb touched the spinning beads and sighed as they slowed, an exhalation that sounded lighter than before. [601]  
We had appraised the wheel, and in doing so had weighed him. [613]  
No currency changed hands, but value flickered like a safety lamp finding fresh air. [627]  
From the tunnel mouth far behind, night breeze carried a faint whistle, maybe wind, maybe a lunch break bell. [646]  
Neither of us moved to investigate; we were off the clock. [657]  
I folded the now-stilled wheel into my backpack, resolving to keep it unsold, unshared, a private metric. [674]  
Caleb rubbed his throat as if checking for pages, found none, and smiled with weary clarity. [690]  
Outside, dawn would eventually spill along the rails, but in this measured darkness we understood enough. [706]  
The hush dissolved into ordinary quiet, confession digested, ghost shift logged, truth finally heavier in memory than in gut. [725]  
We rose, drowsy yet alert, and walked toward the waiting day, lighter by the exact weight of what we now knew. [746]
