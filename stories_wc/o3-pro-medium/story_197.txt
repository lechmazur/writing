During the hush after a child's last bedtime story, the sky above the crib opened like a quiet zipper and released Rhys Quillon, high-altitude con artist extraordinaire.<words>27</words>
Weeks of gliding between storm fronts had taught him to land softly, so he threaded through a yggdrasil-like tree whose branches braided the night over the nursery roof.<words>55</words>
He carried a frayed piece of fabric scrap, rumored to have muffled the first scream ever dreamt, and he needed it intact to compose a cosmic lullaby tonight.<words>83</words>
Every lullaby worth selling, he knew, must be harvested where nightmares collide, because harmony grows richer when terror forgets which corner it owned.<words>106</words>
Mapless, Rhys navigated pristine chaos by unscrambling a set of sticky notes rearranged daily by restless winds and little brothers' sighs trapped in the rafters.<words>131</words>
Each note glimmered with graphite arrows pointing further, never back, daring him to outrun dawn before parents returned to tuck blankets tighter.<words>153</words>
The mundanely terrifying part was the silence: no owls, no radiator hiss, only the hush stretching like thin ice while his boots creaked across bark veins.<words>179</words>
He pressed the fabric scrap against a knothole, and the wood exhaled an echo of the child's last yawn, which soaked into the threads like dew.<words>205</words>
The collision arrived suddenly: nightmares slid along two separate dreams—one about losing teeth, one about endless math tests—and slammed together beneath the canopy, sparking purple static.<words>231</words>
Purple became his tempo; static became his rhyme, and he twirled the sticky notes into a spiral staff where each scribble turned into a trembling notehead.<words>257</words>
But nightmares, offended at being orchestrated, snapped their jaws around the tree trunk, trying to sever his stage from the stars.<words>278</words>
Rhys, practiced in lofted swindles, offered them a trade: he would splice a lull in their terror into his chorus, granting them anonymity, if they loosened grip.<words>305</words>
The nightmares, vain despite their fangs, accepted, and their teeth unclenched, leaking hiss that curled like treble clefs around his scrap-wrapped wrist.<words>327</words>
With the hush thickening toward dawn, Rhys stitched yawn, static, and hiss into a cosmic lullaby so delicate that planets might doze and forget to spin.<words>353</words>
He folded the notes into a paper glider, pinned the fabric scrap to its nose, and launched it seaward through a skylight crack, payment for the stars.<words>380</words>
Below, the child sighed in sleep, hearing none of this, yet smiling as the lullaby's first unseen chord drifted down, promising dreams too harmonious for collision.<words>406</words>
