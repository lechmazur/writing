<story>
I arrived at the subterranean studio perched above an underground bioluminescent lake, rehearsing basic waltz steps alone.<words>17</words>
My partner for the evening, a pleasantly troublesome drifter named Rhea, limped in with seaworn boots and an indefatigable grin.<words>37</words>
She called herself a loyal wanderer, forever crossing maps only to honor whispered promises made in vanished ports.<words>55</words>
We bowed, the instructor killed the overhead lamps, and the lake's turquoise glow rose through floor slats like breathing lace.<words>75</words>
Music whispered, illusions fading to memory even as each note trained muscle and mind to stay present.<words>92</words>
During a spin my elbow brushed something hard in Rhea's coat, and a scratched whale surfaced onto the dance between us.<words>113</words>
It was a pirate's whalebone scrimshaw, yellowed by storms, carved with eddies that seemed to move whenever light shifted.<words>132</words>
The instructor clicked his tongue at our pause, but the artifact's spell already choreographed fresher steps inside my skull.<words>151</words>
I study neural rhythms for a living, tracking consciousness patterns the way cartographers once traced untrustworthy coastlines.<words>168</words>
So when the scrimshaw made my heartbeat syncopate with Rhea's, curiosity trumped propriety.<words>181</words>
We barricaded the studio door with folding chairs, locking out the rest of the class and sealing in the glow.<words>201</words>
A hush settled, gentle yet sharp, like a knife polished for peace talks.<words>214</words>
Rhea placed the scrimshaw upon the planks, and the carved whale projected phantom currents across the ceiling.<words>231</words>
Within those drifting lines I perceived flickers of dreams I had recorded from coma patients, but here they breathed blue fire.<words>252</words>
Rhea confessed the art had belonged to Captain Sable, a corsair who believed memory itself could be stolen and sold.<words>272</words>
Sable died, yet his final engraving, this pleasantly troublesome scrimshaw, still sought audiences willing to dance under shifting lanterns.<words>291</words>
Its purpose, Rhea whispered, was not treasure but resonance; whoever matched its rhythm could map the sea of minds.<words>310</words>
I felt both terror and calling, because my research chased the same horizon without such luminous guidance.<words>327</words>
Together we stepped upon the panels, following the whale's currents until footfalls drummed like coordinated electrodes.<words>343</words>
Images burst: sailors remembering mothers, children imagining storms, tyrants rehearsing apologies they would never speak aloud.<words>359</words>
Each vision rose, shimmered, and dissolved, and with every dissolution the lake grew brighter while my longing grew clearer.<words>378</words>
I realized art's greatest impact might be the scaffolding it erases, leaving wanderers courageous enough to cross invisible bridges.<words>397</words>
Rhea smiled, nodded toward the exit, and slipped the scrimshaw back inside her coat like a retiring lighthouse.<words>415</words>
As the overhead lamps relit and illusions faded to memory, she vanished upstream through tunnels, and I began charting the dancing data.<words>437</words>
