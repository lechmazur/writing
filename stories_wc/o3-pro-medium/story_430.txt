I entered Kaleidoscope Park at twilight, when the mirrored swans tilted colors like gossiping prisms.<words>15</words>
They hissed a welcome with mocking affection, as though flattery were bubbles meant to pop on my hardened ears.<words>34</words>
I, a closed-off reaver, pretended not to care, yet my boots still paused beside the carnival's antique bench.<words>52</words>
There lay a child's drawing on crumpled paper, half soaked by dew and haloed by shifting lantern light.<words>70</words>
The sketch showed an open mouth swallowing a night sky, desperate to taste the stars in a single kiss.<words>89</words>
Its charmingly grotesque innocence hooked me deeper than any jeweled blade I'd ever lifted from a fallen rival.<words>107</words>
Generational patterns whispered behind the crayon strokes, tales of children repeating the hungers their elders never fed.<words>124</words>
My own lineage of marauders had chased that same cosmic flavor, stealing kingdoms yet starving for one honest mouthful.<words>143</words>
I pocketed the paper, meaning only to forget it, but memory began to nag me from the torn edges.<words>162</words>
Each hour, invisible ink bled outward, composing scrawled poems in margins no eye could miss.<words>177</words>
The verses accused me of devouring worlds yet leaving kisses unlicked, a crime crueler than arson.<words>193</words>
So, before the first lie is told, I vowed to answer the paper's appetite and mine.<words>209</words>
I returned to Kaleidoscope Park during the next prism dusk, where shadows swirl like gossip caught inside a gem.<words>228</words>
Waiting on the antique bench sat the star-thief child from the drawing, alive, skin pale as spilled milk over coal.<words>248</words>
His eyes glittered shards of constellations, and he addressed me with a smile that sliced and soothed simultaneously.<words>266</words>
You carry my future, he teased, voice lilting with mocking affection that mirrored the park's taunting swans.<words>283</words>
Give me the drawing, and I will give you the kiss that tastes every star and shatters your hunger forever.<words>303</words>
I feared a trap, yet the generational pattern pulsed, promising that denial would only birth another famished era.<words>321</words>
I knelt, unfolded the crumpled moonmouth, and the child pressed his lips to mine, the universe crackling like hard candy.<words>341</words>
Starlight flooded my throat, searing paths that mapped every theft I had committed and every truth I had buried.<words>360</words>
When the radiance dimmed, the bench was empty, the drawing blank, and my chest echoed with impossible fullness.<words>378</words>
I laughed, a sound both charmingly grotesque and newborn, because hunger had finally tasted itself.<words>393</words>
Behind me, the mirrored swans whispered, Another cycle broken, another reaver remade, and the park's prisms brightened in approval.<words>412</words>
I left before the first lie could be told about what occurred, carrying only a sweeter silence than any loot.<words>432</words>
Now, whenever twilight paints my vision, I nag myself no more; the stars still linger on my lips, tender and true.<words>453</words>
