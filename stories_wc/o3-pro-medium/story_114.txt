Silence hummed in the shared dream recording studio as Lio, an apathetic summoner renowned for being enthusiastically lazy, pressed record.<words>20</words>
Outside the booth, the last breath of the dying god still floated like condensation, making every echo taste metallic.<words>39</words>
River wisdom, the sound engineer whispered, is easiest to capture when eternity feels newly emptied.<words>54</words>
Lio shrugged, grinding stale beans in his heirloom rustic coffee grinder, its burrs rasping like distant crickets.<words>71</words>
He swore the bitterness kept ghosts from clearing their throats in the background tracks.<words>85</words>
Tonight's commission sounded ridiculous even to him: gather a melody able to persuade currents to rebuild coral reefs.<words>103</words>
Yet the oceans were bleaching like unwritten pages, and pay was pay.<words>115</words>
He placed two matching empty frames on the studio wall, relics scavenged from a deserted hall in the god's palace.<words>135</words>
Through matching empty frames hanging in a deserted hall, doorways could unfold, the archivists had promised.<words>151</words>
Unfold they did; the glass rippled, revealing a midnight river murmuring beneath constellations shaped like broken harps.<words>168</words>
Lio exhaled a puff of coffee steam and stepped into the scene, microphone cable trailing like a silver root.<words>187</words>
The river spoke first, its voice layered and gentle with sharpness, syllables clinking as stones do underwater.<words>204</words>
It wanted to know why someone who cared so little would ask it to care so much.<words>221</words>
Lio answered honestly: apathy conserved energy, and energy, when redirected, became devotion nobody saw coming.<words>236</words>
The river chuckled, sending ripples that rearranged moonlight into diagrams of branching coral towers.<words>250</words>
Record, it commanded, so the sleeping children of salt will remember their blue cities.<words>264</words>
Back in the studio, waveforms blossomed on the console like slow fireworks, each burst translating aquatic laughter into human frequencies.<words>284</words>
Lio felt a tug of purpose he pretended not to notice, preferring to sip the lukewarm brew from chipped enamel.<words>304</words>
Still, he mixed the track with surgeon precision, layering droughted whale songs and crumbling glacier sighs beneath the river's refrain.<words>324</words>
When the meters finally froze at perfect levels, the empty frames snapped shut, and the midnight river evaporated into dust.<words>344</words>
A single grain landed in the grinder, singing a note bright enough to slice through his practiced boredom.<words>362</words>
He bottled that impossible pitch, labeling it 'reef seed,' and filed it among the studio masters destined for coastal speakers.<words>382</words>
Tomorrow, philanthropists would call him visionary, yet tonight he remained the same enthusiastically lazy summoner, brewing more indifference to spend.<words>402</words>
Only the grinder, warm from cosmic dust, knew his apathy had unfolded into quiet allegiance to the drowned world.<words>421</words>
