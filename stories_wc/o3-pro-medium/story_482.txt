Lorenzo Pinel, an insomniac painter of clandestine reputation, awoke again without sleeping, lulled by chirring moonmoths. <words>16</words>
His arboreal workshop, suspended among giant mushrooms like a wooden chandelier, swayed with a peacefully chaotic rhythm. <words>33</words>
Dawn lingered elsewhere, yet he painted within the hush of an empty classroom at first light surfacing in memory. <words>52</words>
That remembered silence clasped his heartbeat, guiding brushstrokes that smiled brighter than they should. <words>66</words>
He knew behind the painted smiles stalked something hungry, something he had promised to devour before it devoured him. <words>85</words>
The promise was scrawled on a battered parchment tucked inside a tapered wizard's hat with a bullet hole singed gray. <words>105</words>
Whenever the hat dropped ash, Lorenzo smelled gunpowder and regret, though the regret pranced about him with almost frolicsome delight. <words>125</words>
To reveal the lurking hunger, he would scry in puddles after midnight, letting reflected stars rearrange into trembling sigils. <words>144</words>
Tonight the water had shown him the final obstacle--a crooked mask painted with childish cheer, dripping red laughter. <words>162</words>
Outlasting that obstacle meant consuming it, brushstroke by brushstroke, memory by memory. <words>174</words>
So, while the mushrooms hummed sap lullabies, he prepared paints brewed from crushed petals, powdered rust, and echoing silence. <words>193</words>
Each pigment tasted of places he had skipped instead of slept, and their bittersweetness kept his eyelids defiantly open. <words>212</words>
He dabbed the canvas, coaxing the crooked mask to appear, its grin spreading like spilled ink across a ledger. <words>231</words>
But the mask refused absorption; it mocked him with classroom whispers--erasers squeaking, chairs scraping, children hiding tears behind bright crayon arcs. <words>252</words>
Lorenzo donned the wounded wizard hat, feeling the bullet hole align with the swirl in his hairline, releasing gunpowder dreams. <words>272</words>
The studio tilted; he stepped into the canvas as if into a doorway, mushrooms looming outside like patient umbrellas. <words>291</words>
Inside, desks floated through fog, chalk dust snowed upward, and that loudly merry mask drifted nearer, begging to be eaten. <words>311</words>
He extended his brush like a forked tongue and began to devour the mask's colors, swallowing cerulean giggles and vermilion squeals. <words>332</words>
With every gulp, the emptiness behind the painted smiles filled, until only a quiet, undecorated oval hovered where the face had gloated. <words>354</words>
Emerging back in the workshop, Lorenzo exhaled a peacefully chaotic laugh, knowing he had outlasted the final obstacle and could finally rest. <words>376</words>
Yet sleep still eluded him, fluttering just beyond reach like those moonmoths; he suspected rest was another canvas requiring patient, hungry consumption. <words>398</words>
So he primed a new puddle beneath the hat and waited. <words>409</words>
