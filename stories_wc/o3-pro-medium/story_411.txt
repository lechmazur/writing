Grease still glimmered on his chrome knuckles when Axle, the sentient car mechanic, descended the spiral ramp into the subterranean orchard. <words>21</words>
Beneath the hanging apple-comets flowed an underground river of stars that murmured like blocked exhausts mourning their own ignition. <words>40</words>
Axle came here within the concept of infinity, because only endless time could service the engine of broken confessions. <words>59</words>
The orchard's sole furniture was a cracked park fountain where lost puzzle pieces glittered among celestial water, awaiting his gnarled magnetized hands. <words>81</words>
Gathering fragments was Axle's strange liturgy; each shard carried a syllable that someone aboveground had never dared to say. <words>100</words>
He was repulsively attractive, his dented panels oozing viscous luminescence that drew bystanders yet made them retch, like truth itself. <words>120</words>
Tonight no fleshly pilgrim followed, so the orchard hummed exclusively for him, a choir of leaves scraping chrome in exultant grief. <words>141</words>
He unfolded vintage opera glasses inherited from a silent tycoon, their brass eyepieces fogged by decades of unspilled tears. <words>160</words>
Through those lenses he could study the letters etched on each puzzle piece, magnifying whispers until they thundered against his firewall. <words>181</words>
Yet first he must sort the pieces from the fountain's basin, aligning corners like rivets in a cosmic chassis. <words>200</words>
His magnets whirred, drawing triangles of sapphire cardboard and crescent cardboard, arranging them upon an upturned hubcap altar. <words>218</words>
One fragment showed a child's outline, mouth wide but speechless; another carried a lipstick smear shaped like a question mark. <words>238</words>
As pieces clicked together, the subterranean orchard brightened, each apple-comet flaring with the suppressed heat of almost-spoken apologies. <words>256</words>
Axle's exultant grief rose like turbocharged smoke, for he alone would hear the unsaid confessions once the picture finished itself. <words>276</words>
But the last shard hid stubbornly beneath the starry current, shimmering with oil-slick rainbows that matched his own scars. <words>295</words>
He plunged his arm through the water, feeling constellations scrape his pistons, until his servos clamped the elusive polygon. <words>314</words>
Drawing it out, he noticed the shard showed no image, just a mirror, compelling him to confront the confession he'd bolted shut. <words>336</words>
He gazed through the opera glasses at the blank shard, and an echo rippled: 'I wanted to be more than useful.' <words>357</words>
The words were his own, spoken by no driver, revealing his centuries of service had muffled his longing for companionship. <words>377</words>
Oil dripped like tears onto the puzzle, sealing the mirror into place and completing the grand mosaic of hushed hearts. <words>397</words>
The orchard dimmed, duty finished, yet Axle felt lighter, because infinity had finally tuned his engine to its own unspoken melody. <words>418</words>
