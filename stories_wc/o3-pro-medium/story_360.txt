<story>
The meek necromancer named Eluard shuffled through the basalt corridors of the underground city of the goblins. <words>17</words>
His peculiarly sincere eyes avoided the torchlight, fearing that even kindness could startle the skittish citizens he served. <words>35</words>
Eluard carried only a fountain pen with a broken nib, its uselessness a quiet reminder of humility. <words>52</words>
Above the vaulted stone, distant playground sounds from goblin hatcheries echoed like muffled bells, marking another dawn of mischief. <words>71</words>
Yet Eluard had no time for games; he sought to decode a universal riddle whispered within every heartbeat. <words>89</words>
Legend claimed answers lay woven inside the Tangled Tapestry, an impossible knot of colored roots beneath the city. <words>107</words>
Only those who could read light itself might make sense of its twisting threads. <words>121</words>
So the meek necromancer searched for a dew drop untouched by smoke, believing reflection would become scripture. <words>138</words>
Through the way light reflects off a dew drop, Eluard hoped to regain the alphabet of creation. <words>155</words>
Finding such purity underground required permission from Old Mother Gob, matriarch of tunnels and ruthless gatekeeper of water. <words>173</words>
Eluard bowed before her throne of stalagmites, offering the broken pen as pledge of harmless intent. <words>189</words>
Mother Gob laughed, believing no story could be written with so maimed a nib, and thus granted passage. <words>207</words>
Accompanied by faint squeaks of goblin see-saws above, he descended to the tapestry chamber where roots glimmered. <words>224</words>
Each filament held flecks of mica, weaving night and dawn together in patterns older than moonlight. <words>240</words>
Eluard raised the dew drop he had guarded in a corked vial, letting a single lantern beam kiss it. <words>259</words>
Prismatic shards danced across the Tangled Tapestry, and in those hues he saw sentences no mortal tongue could pronounce. <words>278</words>
They spoke of harmonies, of sorrow, and of a question that stitches galaxies to grains of sand. <words>295</words>
The universal riddle asked simply, 'What returns when every name is forgotten?' <words>307</words>
Eluard's answer arose as naturally as a sigh, because meekness itself had taught him the secret of relinquishment. <words>325</words>
'Silence,' he whispered, and the tapestry loosened, unraveling a single silver thread that snaked toward his trembling hands. <words>343</words>
Mother Gob, watching through a crack, gasped as the thread coiled around the broken pen, mending its nib with starlight. <words>363</words>
Ink flowed where none had been, and Eluard felt knowledge settle like dew upon his patient soul. <words>380</words>
With playground sounds still echoing overhead, he penned the riddle's answer onto basalt, gifting the city its first quiet hymn. <words>400</words>
And in that mystic simplicity, goblins paused, listened, and for one crystalline moment, understood why silence sings. <words>417</words>
