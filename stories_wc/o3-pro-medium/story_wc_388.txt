Mara Baines trudged toward the orchard that shimmered like a hallucination inside the ochre swirl of the dust storm. [19]  
The Geiger meter on her hip chirped, yet the apple trees before her bowed heavy with fruit, impossible after the liquidation. [40]  
As a renowned conspiracy debunker, she had unraveled doomsday hoaxes and miracle myths alike, but this orchard felt like both at once. [62]  
Her sharply observant eyes cataloged every detail: the coppery dust that never settled on leaves, the faint hum under the cracked soil. [84]  
Rumor claimed the trees were nourished by a flawed diamond rumored to be cursed, buried somewhere among the roots. [103]  
Curses made for easy headlines, comfortable lies the desperate clung to while drinking irradiated water from rusted cans. [121]  
Mara had not walked two hundred kilometers to repeat gossip; she had come to excavate truth from comfortable lies. [140]  
The orchard's caretaker, a gaunt man named Hollis, met her at the broken gate and offered a spotless apple. [159]  
"No fee," he said, "only believe what you taste." [168]  
Mara bit; sweetness flooded her tongue, and radiation meters stayed silent, a paradox crisp as the fruit's snap. [186]  
She asked about the diamond, but Hollis only gestured toward a shack half buried in drifting grit. [203]  
Inside, torn papers fluttered like startled moths, the remnants of correspondence shredded during the last corporate audit before liquidation. [222]  
Mara knelt, gathered the scraps, and began reassembling shredded letters on the plank floor. [236]  
Her fingers, steadied by years of picking apart fraudulent documents, formed mosaics of inked confession. [251]  
From sentence fragments, she intuited a covert research project named Stillpoint, funded to locate a spatial anomaly where radiation paused. [271]  
The anomaly had apparently been pinpointed beneath this orchard, its epicenter marked by a defective industrial diamond discarded during drilling. [291]  
Because the gem's carbon lattice was fractured, energy diffused into silence—the hidden stillpoint that calmed the angry world above. [310]  
Corporate executives had planned to sell sanctuary rights, but protests, sabotage, and finally the planetary markets' collapse led to liquidation. [330]  
Panicked, they shredded proof and spread the easier story of a cursed jewel, diverting looters and journalists alike. [348]  
Mara looked from the reassembled letters to the orchard and recognized how well the lie had flourished. [365]  
People preferred curses; curses required no maintenance, no ethical accounting, only dread. [377]  
Truth, by contrast, demanded stewardship of a miracle that was merely physics wearing a fragile disguise. [393]  
She pocketed the smallest scrap, the one mentioning coordinates, and followed her meter through rows of luminous pears. [411]  
At the center stood a busted irrigation pump; beneath it, half buried, glinted the flawed diamond, no bigger than a thumbnail. [432]  
Dust eddied around her boots, yet inside a two-meter circle the air fell quiet, as though the planet exhaled and held its breath. [455]  
Here was the hidden stillpoint, humming through flawed carbon, proof against apocalypse and rumor alike. [470]  
Mara considered publishing a report, but the orchard whispered a harder assignment: protect what you verify. [486]  
If she shouted the truth, scavengers would swarm, politicians would monetize sanctity, and science would dissect the living heart of stillness. [507]  
She remembered the drought towns she had passed, their children curling under leaden skies, and knew secrecy was not cowardice but mercy. [529]  
That night, she burned the letters again, this time wholly, until they drifted away as harmless ash. [546]  
Then she reset the broken gate, posted an unreadable radiation warning, and resumed the lonely watch Hollis had quietly begun years before. [568]  
In the seasons ahead, travelers would still whisper of a cursed diamond amid radioactive storms, and Mara would smile behind her respirator. [590]  
Let them cling to fear, she thought; sometimes a lie is the flimsy shelter protecting a stillpoint where life relearns how to bloom. [613]  
Above the orchard the storm raged, but under the quiet diamond a seed of future truth waited, patient as stone, radiant as hope. [636]
