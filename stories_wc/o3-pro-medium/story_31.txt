Neon drizzle hissed against the greenhouse glass crowning the cyberpunk city rooftop garden.<words>13</words>
Among the citrus trees wired to nutrient pumps stood Renn, a solemn orchardist with soil under chrome fingernails.<words>31</words>
He guarded this sky-borne grove the way monks guard a final candle, yet his heart thumped with excited restraint.<words>50</words>
Tonight the hush between two heartbeats stretched long enough to let possibilities root.<words>63</words>
Through the open hatch clambered Jax, the overlooked child who delivered mail nobody read.<words>77</words>
His chatter was endearingly irritating, like sparrows nesting in circuitry.<words>87</words>
'They x-out my name on every registry,' he blurted, jiggling a plain key on a frayed lanyard.<words>104</words>
Renn sensed the clang of that rejection echoing his own.<words>114</words>
Trees thrive via interconnected lives--root to root, leaf to hidden microbe--so why not people?<words>128</words>
He invited Jax to prune the kumquat cluster singing faint data-tones beside the vent.<words>142</words>
The child's eyes widened as augmented shears mirrored starlight from drowned constellations.<words>154</words>
Guided by Renn's patient gestures, Jax clipped, sorted, and replanted slivers of living code disguised as bark.<words>171</words>
With every cut, the rooftop garden's holographic canopy brightened, mapping neural pathways between them.<words>185</words>
Renn felt the garden recognize the boy, refusing to x-out his presence from its luminous ledger.<words>201</words>
'The key fits a door I've never found,' Jax whispered, holding it like a fragile sprout.<words>217</words>
Renn took the plain key, pressed it into moist soil, and coded a lock around its silhouette.<words>234</words>
Biolights flared, revealing a hatch shaped exactly like the child's absence in the world below.<words>249</words>
Together they descended into a sublayer where abandoned data and forgotten dreams composted into possibility.<words>264</words>
Networks pulsed around them, hungry vines awaiting grafts, and Renn understood his motivation crystallized here--to find connection in a disconnected world.<words>285</words>
He offered the boy his wrist-jack, letting Jax splice his forgotten identity into the system's rootstock.<words>301</words>
User after user flashed awake on distant screens, feeling an inexplicable warmth during the hush between two heartbeats.<words>319</words>
Their lives, now gently entangled with the rooftop garden, would keep the candle of belonging from guttering out.<words>337</words>
Above, drones filmed only the neon horizon, overlooking the quiet revolution sprouting beneath their rotors.<words>352</words>
Renn smiled--a small, asymmetric glitch in his normally unreadable face--and felt sap rise through forgotten capillaries of hope.<words>370</words>
Jax laughed, an endearingly irritating squeak that nonetheless pollinated the silence with promise.<words>383</words>
They returned to the surface, where artificial dawn painted the orchard in prismatic static, and they watched connections bloom like algorithmic blossoms.<words>405</words>
For the first time, Renn did not feel like a curator of relics but a gardener of futures, and Jax was no longer overlooked.<words>429</words>
In the crystalline pause that followed, city noise recommenced, yet the two hearts kept sharing the hush between, beating in synchrony.<words>450</words>
Somewhere deep in the network, the registry flashed green where Jax's name had once been x-ed out, a seedling unfurling toward light.<words>472</words>
