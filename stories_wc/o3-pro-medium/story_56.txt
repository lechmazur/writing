Rook Delacroix lounged beneath a pear tree growing through the shattered fifteenth floor, displaying his trademark energetically lethargic grin.<words>19</words>
The reclaimed orchard farmland inside the toppled skyscraper smelled of ozone and cider, a paradox he adored.<words>36</words>
A blank price tag dangled from his coat, magnetized onto the fabric so no one could name his cost.<words>55</words>
He waited for the frozen community terminal to restart, because the very moment its blue screen faded he intended to bare a truth no one dared to handle.<words>83</words>
Yet time slouched, and even his invisible allies--gusts slipping between cracked windows, whispers of vagrant code--could only hum impatiently.<words>102</words>
Beneath the tree, a wanderer in dusty coveralls dropped a book of lost plantation ledgers, and pages scattered like startled doves.<words>123</words>
Rook dove after a fluttering sheet, their fingers colliding against its brittle spine, and the meet-cute cracked open both their afternoons.<words>144</words>
The stranger, Viola Kern, blushed, mumbling that gravity liked to magnetize embarrassment directly to her palms.<words>160</words>
Rook flashed a card-shark smile, bluffing sympathy while secretly appraising how the fallen ledgers could expose corporate lies about the orchard's yield.<words>182</words>
Viola's own motive, he soon learned, was identical: she wished to publish the numbers and topple the board who salted the soil for insurance.<words>206</words>
Invisible allies rustled branches overhead, approving the alliance with gentle harshness, and a pear bonked Rook's skull in blessing.<words>225</words>
Together they perched by the glitching terminal, its frozen cursor blinking like a lighthouse through fog.<words>241</words>
While they waited, Rook scribbled a confession on the blank price tag: 'I charged the world nothing, yet stole everything'.<words>261</words>
He pressed it into Viola's book, the adhesive now servant to a vow rather than a scam.<words>278</words>
Viola read the line and met his eyes with the quiet candor of someone who collects broken promises like seeds, intending to sprout them anew.<words>303</words>
She answered by tearing a ledger page, writing, 'Plant the theft, harvest the proof,' and sliding it into his pocket.<words>323</words>
The building groaned, wind playing organ pipes through its steel ribs, as though their invisible allies tuned the atmosphere for revelation.<words>344</words>
Suddenly the terminal rebooted, icons blooming, and at that instant the frozen computer finally restarted, broadcasting system logs onto the communal holo-wall.<words>366</words>
Numbers cascaded--yield totals, pesticide orders, bribes--naked truths clawing free of silicon silence.<words>378</words>
Rook felt his nerves magnetize toward flight, but Viola's steady voice anchored him: 'Stay; thieves must witness the orchard they return'.<words>399</words>
Gentle harshness cut through him, and the swindler bowed, accepting that baring the truth was his last and truest bluff.<words>419</words>
Outside, reclaimed soil shimmered under indoor suns, promising pears for anyone brave enough to label their worth.<words>436</words>
