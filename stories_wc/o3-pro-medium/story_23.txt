At the solar wind collection point, twilight shimmered like bottled auroras waiting for a mischievous hand to shake them loose.<words>20</words>
That hand belonged to Lorcan, a traditionally creative wandering bard who had swapped lute for barometer yet kept the grin of a traveling troublemaker.<words>44</words>
He roamed the lattice of solar sails seeking the faint whirs that rattled like skeleton tambourines when cosmic gusts slipped through microfractures.<words>66</words>
Each rattle answered a secret map inked in his skull, a chart that could be read only by following wind patterns etched across emptiness.<words>90</words>
Tonight's route ended in the orchard’s keeper’s domain, a floating grove of photovoltaic boughs whose fruit was pure ion stream.<words>110</words>
When the orchard’s keeper finishes the day’s final chore, station protocol dims the lights and ghosts of past engineers start their nightly poker, cackling through the vents.<words>137</words>
Lorcan loved arriving just then, because spectral audiences laugh cheapest and clap loudest.<words>150</words>
He unpacked a folio of pressed leaves, each leaf stamped with equations and jokes in equal measure, relics from extinct forests he had wooed in other star lanes.<words>178</words>
The leaves formed a portable deck, and he flicked them into the air so they spun like sarcastic snowflakes, orbiting golden panels.<words>200</words>
Where each leaf settled, damaged circuits hummed awake, hungry for his punchline powered photosynthesis.<words>214</words>
The keeper, hearing the commotion, stomped down the catwalk with a wrench still dripping cider lubricant, ready to evict this wind-drunk minstrel.<words>236</words>
Yet the ghosts shushed her, for they sensed what the living rarely recall: the age of renewal begins with a good joke and a better rhythm.<words>262</words>
Lorcan struck a panel, producing a metallic rattle that resonated through the orchard like laughter squeezed through a tin clarinet.<words>282</words>
The sound unlocked dormant nanobees, which zipped from cracked sockets, pollinating solar petals with coded light so old constellations blinked new algorithms.<words>304</words>
Power rippled along transmission vines, riding straight into the planetless grid that governed weather, tides, and even the sentimental gravity binding love letters to memory.<words>329</words>
Systems long rumored dead coughed, belched pixels, then sighed an operatic startup chime that made everyone, corporeal or otherwise, spit out imaginary tea.<words>352</words>
Seeing her orchard thrum with impossible vigor, the keeper pocketed the wrench and asked the bard his price.<words>370</words>
Lorcan bowed, hair floating in low gravity like a comet’s tail, and answered that he sought nothing less than to restore universal systems, beginning with hers.<words>396</words>
She laughed, the ghosts cheered, and the nanobees formed a halo above them, spelling consent in Morse-code pollen.<words>414</words>
Together they recorded the new protocol: creativity before maintenance, humor before hubris, leaves before manuals, and always listen for the wind’s next punchline.<words>437</words>
With that, Lorcan walked onward, pressed leaves rustling in his satchel as though eager for the encore, while the orchard blossomed steady power into the widowed night.<words>464</words>
