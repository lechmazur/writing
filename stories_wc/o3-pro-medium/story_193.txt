<story>
The exiled prince trudged through the borderlands, searching for anything that might improve the hollow ache inside his heart. <words>19</words>
His physicians had offered tonics, poets had offered praise, but none found the cure for loneliness he secretly sought. <words>38</words>
That winter afternoon, a sudden snowstorm created a chance encounter when swirling white erased the road and revealed a dark silhouette. <words>59</words>
Guided by unseen forces he could not name, the prince followed the figure to an abandoned customs office crouching beside a frozen river. <words>82</words>
Inside, dust motes drifted like captive stars, and a single lantern illuminated an antique mortar and pestle resting upon a cracked counter. <words>104</words>
The silhouette resolved into a gray-haired apothecary whose patchwork cloak made him unintentionally iconic, as if stitched from half-remembered legends. <words>124</words>
He spoke in a tone of familiar unknown warmth, saying the key to solace must turn before words freeze on the tongue. <words>146</words>
With trembling hands the prince produced a brass key engraved with his kingdom's seal, symbol of everything that had banished him. <words>167</words>
The apothecary nodded, inserted it into a heavy ledger chest, and during the turn of a key that locks away the past, silence deepened. <words>191</words>
In that pause, snow breathlessly pressed against boarded windows, as though eavesdropping on the transaction of forgotten memories. <words>209</words>
The apothecary lifted the antique mortar and pestle, placed a shard of ice inside, and asked what the prince most wished to improve. <words>232</words>
"My capacity to be alone without feeling alone," the prince whispered, the confession fogging the rim like tender frost. <words>251</words>
The pestle ground gently, releasing a note like distant bells, and unseen forces seemed to coil in the lantern's flame. <words>271</words>
Powdered ice mixed with a droplet of lantern oil, forming a glimmering paste the color of first dawn over exile. <words>291</words>
The apothecary smeared the paste across the prince's wrist, where a pulse lonely as a vacant throne beat. <words>309</words>
Memories flooded--fireside lessons with his sister, the last garden walk with his father--yet they floated without the usual ache. <words>328</words>
He realized loneliness was absence distorted, and presence, even of bygone moments, could be invited to sit rather than expelled. <words>348</words>
Tears warmed his cheeks, making small steamy halos on the mortar's rim; the apothecary simply watched, approving without a word. <words>368</words>
Outside, the storm cleared as quickly as it had gathered, revealing stars arranged like new coordinates on an uncharted map. <words>388</words>
The prince stepped beyond the customs office, feeling accompanied by the entire night sky, his exile unchanged yet his solitude quietly cured. <words>410</words>
