The day the sea turned mirror-still, Eren the graceful dock worker balanced on a bollard and watched the horizon glow like tempered steel. [23]  
It had been seven months since the Quietening, that sudden shift in breath and blood when violence became impossible, and yet unrest coiled inside him. [48]  
The harbor, set in the sublittoral fringe where barnacles ruled every piling, now thrummed with a softer breed of tension. [68]  
People could no longer strike or even shove, so their angers leaked as muttered myths about a disappearing island that accepted the exiled. [91]  
Eren did not trust myths, but he trusted the lonely throb in his chest that said freedom lay offshore. [110]  
Each dusk he unloaded cargo, muscles flowing like rope, and each dusk he felt himself detach a little further from the landlocked life assigned him. [135]  
His only keepsake was a pirate's whalebone scrimshaw he had found wedged between bollards, its surface etched with spiraling knots and quiet faces. [158]  
When the moonlight struck the ivory, the faces seemed to open like shutters, and strangers near him spoke secrets without knowing why. [180]  
He realized the scrimshaw unlocked guarded hearts, yet his own remained sealed by habit and duty. [196]  
What would it take, he wondered, to carve himself wide as those etched spirals and let the tide write inside him? [217]  
The answer arrived in a sound older than harbors, a whale calling from the deep, notes vast enough to tip lanterns on the pier. [241]  
Everyone froze, palms to chests, feelings flaring like sudden sails, but Eren felt the call as marching orders stitched in kindness. [262]  
He slipped the scrimshaw into his pocket, unmoored a skiff, and pushed toward the silver trail the whale song painted across the bay. [285]  
Behind him, dock guards shouted policies they were powerless to enforce, for even pursuit felt like a kind of bruising now forbidden. [307]  
The water thickened with kelp ribbons, sublittoral gardens brushing the hull as if urging him onward with vegetal applause. [326]  
Midchannel, the whale breached, its dark bulk rimmed with starlight, and the note it released shook loose a fog hiding the legendary island. [349]  
He saw cliffs rise, then blur, then fade again, as though the land inhaled hope and exhaled absence. [367]  
The island was disappearing even while it appeared, existing only in surrender to the call that had summoned it. [386]  
Eren understood he must match that surrender or be left rowing circles until dawn. [400]  
He set the oars across the gunwales, closed his eyes, and allowed every chore, every quota shouted by foremen, to peel away. [422]  
In that quiet he felt himself detach from the person who ladled patience to angry captains, and attach instead to the tidal animal beneath his ribs. [448]  
A final chord from the whale rang, gentle yet unrelenting, combative tenderness distilled into sound, and the island solidified like a promise kept. [471]  
Black-sand shoals greeted the skiff, grinding softly against the hull before parting to reveal a channel only his slim craft could navigate. [493]  
Eren stepped onto shore, scrimshaw in hand, and the carved faces glowed, projecting silhouettes of corsairs dancing without swords. [512]  
They capered in mock battle, proving that even piracy, once born in blood, could mutate into theater when steel no longer bit. [534]  
The island itself responded, cliffs unfurling into terraces of pearl sand and freshwater springs, as though stories of cruelty now nourished something gentler. [557]  
Yet gentleness was not weakness; breakers slammed the outer rocks with disciplined fury, reminding him that tenderness could fight by refusing to wound. [580]  
He climbed to a ledge overlooking the moonstruck sea and raised the scrimshaw, feeling it resonate with the killer turned cantor below. [602]  
A warmth traveled up his arms, neither pain nor bliss, but the sense of a door long jammed sliding free on salt hinges. [625]  
Memories of reprimands, dockside brawls he defused, and dreams he delayed spilled out, then were carried away like bilge poured overboard. [646]  
What remained was raw and exact: he was water shaped to a man, and to stay fluid he must keep moving beyond schedules and walls. [671]  
He resolved to make the disappearing island his harbor and his vessel, knowing it would vanish whenever he anchored complacency and return when he sought. [696]  
The whale sang approval, deep as continents, and the cliffs echoed, unlocking his guarded heart at last with a shiver that felt like flight. [720]  
In that combative tenderness between leaving and arriving, Eren smiled a smile sharp enough to cut ropes and gentle enough to sew them into nets. [745]  
Then the island breathed once more, turned translucent, and together they slipped beneath the bright skin of the ocean, following the call toward unmeasured freedom. [770]
