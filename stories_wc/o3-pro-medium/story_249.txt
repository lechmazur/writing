The pause between raindrops made the cobblestones shimmer, like breath held by the entire city of forgotten fountains.<words>18</words>
On that fragile stillness strode Pica Marrow, an unmasked vigilante whose lazily ambitious grin disguised encyclopedic patience.<words>35</words>
Pica held no wish to punish villains; instead, their singular motivation was to collect traditional games before memory evaporated.<words>54</words>
Board squares, ivory dice, flickering card decks, even chalk hopscotch diagrams reclaimed from alleys filled their brassbound satchel.<words>72</words>
Yet one rare pastime eluded them: Mirage Mandala, a rotating kaleidoscope board rumored hidden in the derelict Fountain of Exiles.<words>92</words>
To lure its elusive keeper into daylight, Pica practiced the art of resilience, a discipline learned from weathered street performers.<words>112</words>
Resilience, Pica believed, meant bending like wet willow while appearing idle, an approach perfectly suiting their lazily ambitious legend.<words>131</words>
They began by analyzing gossip from barbershop quartet rehearsals echoing nightly beneath the arcade arches of Plaza Stipple.<words>149</words>
Between doo-wops and shaved harmonies, the singers whispered about a collector rival named Dr. Gull, once a carnival dentist.<words>168</words>
Dr. Gull allegedly guarded the Mirage Mandala with an antique dentist's drill converted into a music box of unsettling whines.<words>188</words>
The drill's dissonant lullaby supposedly compelled listeners to reveal secret stashes, a threat to any hoarder of playful relics.<words>207</words>
Pica attended the next quartet practice, humming tenor to mask note-taking, until gossip pinpointed Gull's lair beneath Dry Well Square.<words>227</words>
When the rain stuttered again, Pica slipped into the tunnels, timing every footfall for the pause between raindrops overhead.<words>246</words>
Hidden whimsy guided them: chalk arrows shaped like grinning fish pointed toward a door carved with domino dots.<words>264</words>
Inside, Dr. Gull cranked the drill, its rusty gears singing a cracked lullaby that scraped memory like plaque.<words>282</words>
Pica countered by flipping a battered jacks ball through the air, letting its bounce syncopate with the drill's shriek.<words>301</words>
Intrigued by the rhythmic duel, Gull paused, revealing exhaustion husked beneath menace, for even villains deserve old playgrounds.<words>319</words>
Pica offered a trade: share the Mirage Mandala, and they would teach Gull resilience through idle-seeming strategy sessions of Go.<words>339</words>
The offer, lazily ambitious yet earnest, lured Gull because surrender felt like rest, and rest felt like victory unfound.<words>358</words>
As rain resumed, Mandala in hand, Pica exited, hearing fountains gurgle awake, proof that games saved cities from forgetting themselves.<words>378</words>
Behind them, Gull sat cross-legged, eyes closed, listening to raindrops striking the drill, already contemplating his first quiet game of Go.<words>399</words>
Somewhere, a new childhood was starting, because resilience always deals the next hand.<words>412</words>
