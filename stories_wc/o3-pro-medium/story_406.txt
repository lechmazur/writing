When the morning paper lands on an empty porch, Selene the coy spy adjusts her collar and listens to the world exhale.<words>22</words>
She has borrowed valor stitched across her trench coat, medals won by strangers whose exploits she recites in mirrors to rehearse aliases.<words>44</words>
Yet a loose button dangles near her heart, threatening to betray the counterfeit glories with a single clink on the stone floor.<words>66</words>
She pockets the button, vowing to sew it back only after today's mission mends fences others have burned while she watched behind tinted glasses.<words>90</words>
Her destination is a witch's potion brewery disguised as an abandoned greenhouse that glows whenever roosters crow backward in the dark.<words>111</words>
Inside, cauldrons bubble with syllables, each brew a sentence waiting to be spoken into existence, but entry wards reject common footsteps.<words>132</words>
Selene must bypass the protective runes through reversed time, stepping where she will have stepped, vanishing from herself the moment before detection.<words>154</words>
She clicks a pocket watch wound counterclockwise, and the second hand drags the room into yesterday; dried puddles splash upward, whispers un-said.<words>176</words>
Through this drip of untime, she slips between cauldrons, reading recipes before they are written, selecting one labeled "Faces Unnumbered."<words>196</words>
The witch, diabolically benevolent, plans to donate shapeshifting draughts to war orphans, but only if a worthy courier proves motives purer than profit.<words>219</words>
Selene craves the elixir to become a master of disguise, yet knows the witch's test will expose every borrowed ribbon on her conscience.<words>242</words>
She kneels and returns the loose button to her coat, stitching with hair drawn from the past minute, binding truth and deception into one loop.<words>267</words>
When time snaps forward, the witch stands beside her, yellow eyes approving the handmade honesty gleaming where false medals hang.<words>287</words>
"Borrowed valor tastes rotten," the witch rasps, "but mended fences sweeten broth," and she tilts a vial so vapor paints silver mustaches on moonbeams.<words>311</words>
Selene sips; her skin ripples like newsprint, stories of braver people scrolling across her cheeks until they settle into quiet, original texture.<words>333</words>
With borrowed valor transmuted into earned possibility, she promises to deliver the remaining draughts to children whose futures, like her coat, need fastening.<words>356</words>
The witch nods and unbolts the door just as the porch outside becomes vacant again, the morning paper still fluttering unread in earlier wind.<words>380</words>
Selene steps out, bypassing the threshold both forward and back, carrying bottles and a coat finally hers, while the sun rises twice in salute.<words>404</words>
