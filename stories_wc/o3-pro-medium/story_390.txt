Dawn dripped peach light over the ancient Chinese palace, but inside the lacquered corridors silence practiced martial arts. <words>18</words>
Lin the calm assassin glided along, so relaxed she barely cast a ripple in the air's tea. <words>35</words>
Her reputation for being figuratively literal meant she never said she would 'take someone out' without bringing a picnic. <words>54</words>
Tonight, however, her basket carried neither blanket nor sandwiches, but a botanical press polished to a scholar's shine. <words>72</words>
It was rumoured the press could amalgamate petals into prophecies, squeezing future from flora the way poets juice heartbreak. <words>91</words>
Lin wanted not death tonight, but to spin a prophecy into raw possibility before the first question is asked. <words>110</words>
In the throne room, Emperor Xu awaited dawn court, while courtiers rehearsed compliments like nervous pigeons practicing opera. <words>128</words>
None saw the butterfly that fluttered ahead of Lin, tracing an erratic script invisible to ordinary hope. <words>145</words>
She followed its wingspan the way monks follow gongs, for her entire method was by the pattern of a butterfly's wings. <words>166</words>
Where it dipped, she stepped; where it twirled, she pirouetted, appearing ridiculous yet eerily exact. <words>181</words>
A guard coughed in alarm, then decided any assassin dancing ballet at dawn was probably a hallucination caused by rice. <words>201</words>
Humorous unease settled on the marble like dew that didn't know if it should giggle or evaporate. <words>218</words>
Reaching the jade dais, Lin swung open the botanical press, revealing pages layered with rose, chrysanthemum, and something unnamed. <words>237</words>
The unnamed petals trembled, releasing whispers of longing that sounded like lovers writing letters inside each other's throats. <words>255</words>
Those whispers seeped into Emperor Xu, bypassing his ears, planting a yearning to question everything, starting with his own certainty. <words>275</words>
But remember, this was before the first question is asked, so time itself held its breath, cheeks puffed comically. <words>294</words>
Lin pressed the petals together, and destiny, privacy-loving trickster, felt the squeeze and squeaked like a toy in court. <words>313</words>
Possibility leaked out, glittering, amalgamated from color, scent, and palace gossip, forming shapes only future historians would pretend they predicted. <words>333</words>
Lin bowed, apologizing to no one in particular for the mess, then packed the press as neatly as folding sky. <words>353</words>
With comic timing, the Emperor finally opened his mouth, but the first question tripped over the butterfly and arrived second. <words>373</words>
By then Lin had vanished into corridor shadows, leaving only a single pressed petal that whispered, 'Ask, and you may dance, too.' <words>395</words>
The courtiers, unsure whether to fear or waltz, shuffled aimlessly, inventing polite choreography for the birth of uncertain tomorrows. <words>414</words>
