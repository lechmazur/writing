Lord Peregrine Voss, hereditary Marquess of Thistledown and habitual doormat, trimmed hedges behind Headquarters Seven's camouflage greenhouse.<words>17</words>
The yard work was real enough, yet it doubled as his entry pass to the covert secret agent workshop humming below.<words>38</words>
Even stooped among rose clippings, Peregrine's unusually perceptive eyes mapped every bolt, wire, and whispered gesture.<words>54</words>
His noble tutors had insisted a gentleman lead, yet he found obedience far safer than spearheading rebellions.<words>71</words>
So he quietly served Queen and country by letting louder people underestimate him.<words>84</words>
Today, that humility would need backbone.<words>90</words>
He had overheard, through unplanned eavesdropping in echo chambers of ductwork, Technician Grohl's plan to liquify something alive.<words>108</words>
The something, according to the vibration of Grohl's smug chuckle, was Aster, the laboratory pangolin rescued from poachers.<words>126</words>
Peregrine felt a thunderbolt of silent empathy crack across his chest, as if the shy creature shared his timid soul.<words>146</words>
Defiance twitched like an undiscovered muscle.<words>152</words>
He needed a weapon, but security wands had confiscated everything sharper than a compliment.<words>166</words>
All he possessed was the dull letter opener tucked beside his monogrammed pruning shears.<words>180</words>
It had never opened a letter without additional encouragement, but perhaps it could pry open fate.<words>196</words>
Under earnest flippancy, he rehearsed aloud, 'Terribly sorry, old chap, mind if I borrow your centrifuge for a tick?'<words>215</words>
The nearby gardeners only shrugged, assuming aristocrats talked to shrubs for sport.<words>227</words>
Below, Grohl calibrated vats designed to reduce organic tissue to smoothie consistency, giggling about bonus funding.<words>243</words>
Peregrine descended the service ladder, shoes squeaking diplomatic apologies with every rung.<words>255</words>
'Baron Voss,' Grohl sneered, 'shouldn't you be fertilising petunias instead of snooping?'<words>267</words>
Peregrine bowed, then flicked the dull letter opener toward a panel he had earlier loosened with pruning oil.<words>285</words>
The opener lacked an edge, but its humility held momentum, and the panel clanged open like a cymbal.<words>303</words>
Echoes cannoned around the chamber, triggering the automatic emergency flush meant to prevent cross-contamination.<words>317</words>
Instead of slurry, icy water flooded the floor, sweeping tubes, papers, and one startled technician into disarray.<words>334</words>
Peregrine waded to the cage, cradled trembling Aster beneath his coat, and whispered an apology for the mess.<words>352</words>
Grohl scrambled up, but the aristocrat's earlier wordless reading of door labels had revealed the correct lever for lockdown.<words>371</words>
He pulled it with the meek gravitas of a butler announcing tea, sealing Grohl inside the improvised aquarium.<words>389</words>
The villain sputtered threats, yet the water diluted his bravado until even his curses seemed beige.<words>405</words>
Upstairs, sprinklers still hissed over the roses, masking the escape while Peregrine carried the pangolin to moonlit hedges.<words>423</words>
Freedom smelled like wet soil and faint engine grease.<words>432</words>
'I shall petition Parliament for your knighthood, Sir Scales,' he quipped, though his voice trembled with reverence rather than jest.<words>452</words>
Aster blinked bead-bright eyes, and in that silent empathy Peregrine finally felt like something sharper than a compliment.<words>470</words>
