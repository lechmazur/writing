Fog hung above the cobalt observatory in autumn, turning every footstep into muffled echo. [14]  
Inside, Selis, the renowned galaxy-chart embroiderer, unrolled midnight silk across a brass frame. [27]  
She worked alone, yet the vaulted dome answered her needle with an echoed silence. [41]  
That hush was why she had come: to listen for unheard stories woven between stars. [56]  
Each prick of silver thread mapped constellations no telescope could catch before the coup. [70]  
Rumors said generals would seize the capital at first frost, extinguishing research they deemed heretical. [85]  
Selis planned to preserve knowledge the way sailors preserve currents, by stitching reliable charts. [99]  
But charts were only portals; the true aim was unraveling conspiracies that blurred the sky. [114]  
She suspected those same generals bent light with misinformation, hiding orbital weapons within fabricated nebulae. [129]  
To expose them, she needed more than fabric and thread. [139]  
She reached for the flame from eternal candle that burned beside the astrolabe. [152]  
Its smokeless light revealed dyes invisible to ordinary vision, guiding her needle into hidden lattices. [167]  
When the flame touched silk, galaxies bloomed like secrets admitting they wished to be found. [182]  
Selis smiled foolishly, exactly as court informants expected of a mere artisan. [194]  
Disguises of wisdom as foolishness had kept her alive through three regimes. [206]  
Let them think she counted needles while they counted battalions. [216]  
Tonight she synchronized the rotating roof with the slow spin of the planet. [229]  
Gear teeth clicked, shutters parted, and autumn constellations flooded down like confessions uttered in sleep. [244]  
She listened not with ears but with the trembling threads between her fingers. [257]  
Every shimmer told a fragmentary rumor: troop movements measured in eclipses, shortages masked as meteor showers. [273]  
Yet fragments alone were useless unless matched to ground truths. [283]  
So she opened the ledger of adjacent possibilities, a conceptual tool her mentor invented. [297]  
By tracing plausible links rather than certain ones, she could leap where evidence had gaps. [312]  
Through adjacent possibilities, rumors synchronized into coherent orbits, forming a hidden map of intentions. [326]  
The pattern pointed her toward the royal archive, where telegraphs intersected like tangled constellations. [340]  
If she could add those wires to her cloth, the conspiracies would unravel themselves. [354]  
The notion felt absurdly grand for one labeled eccentric, and she laughed aloud at the hubris. [370]  
Laughter echoed against the dome, then faded, leaving thicker silence than before. [382]  
Someone else breathed inside that silence. [388]  
Marshal Voren emerged from shadowed stairwell, boots shining like overturned moons. [399]  
He had long suspected the observatory housed dissent under the guise of artistry. [412]  
Now he surveyed the embroidered sky, the eternal candle, the foolish smile. [424]  
Selis feigned clumsiness, dropping a spool that rattled across the tiles. [435]  
Voren chuckled, mistaking uncertainty for stupidity, and moved nearer to inspect her work. [448]  
The map on silk glimmered with shifting light, impossible for him to interpret. [461]  
He asked what childish fantasy she sewed. [468]  
She replied it was merely a winter curtain for the library mice, nothing more. [482]  
Her voice fluttered like dust motes, and Voren lost interest. [492]  
Before leaving, he confiscated only her daybook, ignoring the candle as decorative clutter. [505]  
Selis waited until his footsteps vanished, then touched the candle flame to the daybook's absence. [520]  
Ink remnant on her fingertips responded, lines rising in smoky blue above the table. [534]  
Through adjacent possibilities again, she synchronized the lifted lines with her stellar embroidery. [547]  
A composite message appeared: supply trains would divert at dawn, leaving the palace unguarded for two hours. [564]  
That sliver of time was the last chance to warn the archivists and rescue the letters. [580]  
Selis packed her silk, the eternal candle, and a pocketful of needles, still laughing softly. [595]  
Foolishness would be her cloak while wisdom traveled unseen through corridor and street. [608]  
Before dawn she would move, guided by the quiet flame and by a sky no conspiracy could fully obscure. [627]  
The observatory closed its shutters behind her, preserving the echoed silence until she returned victorious. [642]
