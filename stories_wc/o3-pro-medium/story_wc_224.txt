<story>The mountain looked like an overgrown spine of slate, but everyone in the valley knew it was a bookstore. [19]  
Shelves carved into the living rock spiraled inward, crossing and recrossing until even echoes became lost among the pages. [38]  
Here, after remembering becomes painful, hurting like ground glass behind the eyes, wanderers arrive seeking distraction. [54]  
I came for something else: to understand the shape of home, which had long since blurred in my mind. [73]  
The mercury-glass seer at the reception arch recognized that motive without my speaking a word. [88]  
Her mirror eyes tilted, catching torchlight in quicksilver swirls that showed stormclouds hiding within silence. [103]  
She whispered that the store reorganized itself every night, substituting reality nightly, because some truths could be read only in dreams. [124]  
Then she pressed a map of feather against my palm, urging me to feel its directions via the texture of a feather rather than sight. [149]  
That softness pulsed like distant thunder muffled by snow, promising guidance deeper than printed ink. [164]  
I followed the map into corridors where titles glimmered and vanished, seeding doubt and curiosity in equal measure. [182]  
Each turn burrowed downward, past genres, past centuries, until my lantern guttered and only phosphorescent margins lit my feet. [201]  
There, under a vault of biographies that breathed like sleeping whales, I encountered the first door made of words alone. [221]  
The sentences arranged themselves into hinges when touched, and the map-feather urged me through. [235]  
Beyond lay a room of quiet thunder where air trembled though sound stayed caged. [249]  
A table of volcanic glass held the object I had not known I sought: the lost language stone. [267]  
It was small as a child's tooth yet heavier than regret, inscribed with sigils half swallowed by erosion. [285]  
When I lifted it, memories surged, but the seer's earlier warning shielded me; instead of pain, I heard buried talents stirring. [306]  
These were gifts my childhood had hidden under rubble of departures, abilities to sense doorway angles and attic winds, talents I once feared. [329]  
The stone pulsed, and I saw corridors connecting provinces I had lived in, all bending toward the place I first spoke my name. [352]  
But the vision was unfinished, as though punctuation had been stolen. [363]  
A tremor rolled through the room, hidden thunder becoming open menace, and the words of the doorway clattered like teeth. [383]  
The mountain-bookstore was reorganizing again, substituting reality nightly, and I risked being sealed inside a chapter forever. [400]  
I needed to seed the rediscovered talents quickly, plant them in a living page before the shuffle ended. [418]  
The map-feather quivered, pointing toward a stairway of blank journals stacked like petals of obsidian lotus. [434]  
I climbed, etching each step with the stone, letting symbols fall like seeds into the paper spines. [451]  
Pages sprouted faint light, roots of sentences drilling down to anchor the staircase in the shaking architecture. [468]  
As I wrote, talents long buried unfurled: I could hear rooms deciding where to turn, could taste directions in dust. [488]  
I realized the bookstore was not a maze but a heart, and every patron a blood cell searching for an exit shaped like belonging. [512]  
To find home I must complete its silhouette, give the heart a rhythm it recognized. [527]  
So I pressed the lost language stone to the highest blank cover and breathed the word my mother once sung as lullaby. [549]  
The word meant hearth, horizon, and returning footstep simultaneously, a syllable impossible in any surviving tongue. [565]  
Light burst neither bright nor loud, more like silent sheet lightning behind eyelids, yet it shook dust from every shelf. [585]  
One by one, corridors straightened, aligning themselves with the pulse of that syllable, revealing a linear path to a sunlit entrance. [606]  
I felt the mountain exhale, grateful, as though my seeding had given it permission to remember without pain. [624]  
The mercury-glass seer awaited me there, reflections now calm, and she asked what shape I had found. [641]  
I told her home was not a place I reentered but a direction I could carry, seeded and growing wherever I stood. [663]  
She nodded, the hidden thunder in her eyes settling into gentle rain, and the map-feather dissolved into ordinary quill in my pocket. [685]  
The lost language stone stayed warm inside my palm, no longer crushing, merely reminding me to keep planting verses along the road. [707]  
Behind, the bookstore folded its passages back into labyrinth, waiting for the next pilgrim whose memories had started to sting. [727]  
Ahead, the valley opened like a fresh page, and my footsteps wrote the first line of returning. [744]</story>
