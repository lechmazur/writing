I arrived alone at the frost giant's lair, carrying my battered satchel of curiosities and a reckless grin.<words>18</words>
The invitation had come suddenly, disguised as a blank domino slid across my doorstep during last night's tempest.<words>36</words>
That cryptic gesture perfectly suited my reputation as a focused collector who is, according to rumors, seldom odd.<words>54</words>
I chronicle each acquisition beside a black rose pinned in a journal older than the giant whose fortress I breached.<words>74</words>
The rose never wilts, somehow absorbing the chill, and its ink-dark petals remind me why I embrace solitude.<words>92</words>
Crowds dull focus, but silence hones it like frost grinding stone into mirrors.<words>105</words>
Still, a party had been promised, and the lair echoed with distant laughter that kept time like chattering dice.<words>124</words>
I navigated corridors sculpted from glacier-blue quartz until a circular hall revealed tables set for infinite board game rounds.<words>143</words>
Players fashioned of starlight and graveyard moss waved me over with earnest flippancy, as though cosmic tournaments were casual picnics.<words>163</words>
Despair, the rumored alpha predator, lounged at the head table, its grin a horizon of broken crowns and moonless promises.<words>183</words>
To triumph over it, I had to wager my most guarded possession: the narrative threading my collected fragments into identity.<words>203</words>
The first round unfolded on a board carved from frozen thunder, each move demanding I unravel a memory I'd kept knotted.<words>224</words>
I sacrificed the afternoon my mother left, trading abandonment for three luminous pawns that crawled toward Despair's throne.<words>242</words>
Despair swallowed the pawns, yet its grin flickered, as though the taste recalled sunlight it pretends never existed.<words>260</words>
Throughout subsequent rounds, constellations shifted across the ceiling, counting our gambits better than any clock.<words>275</words>
I yielded my childhood bicycle, my first half-written poem, even the echo of my own laughter, and each concession thinned Despair's shadow.<words>297</words>
At last only the black rose remained, petals breathing midnight, pin quivering like the second hand of a shy watch.<words>317</words>
The star-moss players hushed, performing a toast with empty goblets, their theatrics an ironic cheer for solitude's final proof.<words>336</words>
I pressed the rose onto the icy board, and ink bled from its veins, staining the thunder squares with silent sonnets.<words>357</words>
Despair reached, but the petals unfurled into mirrors, forcing the predator to face countless reflections of its hollow appetite.<words>376</words>
With each reflection it consumed, another mirror replaced it, until the beast choked on relentless versions of itself and vanished.<words>396</words>
The hall erupted in muffled applause, like snow applauding a sunrise it can't quite survive.<words>411</words>
I retrieved the now silver rose, pinned it back into my journal, and felt solitude greet me not as exile but anthem.<words>433</words>
Outside, the frost giant smiled approval, for even titans respect a collector who beats despair without misplacing their own quirky calm.<words>454</words>
I declined the after-party, tucked the domino into my pocket, and walked home beneath auroras that spelled, 'Game over, begin again'.<words>475</words>
