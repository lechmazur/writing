Eridian kept his name tucked behind silence, for a secretive conjurer could not perform miracles if everyone watched the stitches. [20]  
He lived beneath the southern karst, in a cavern orchard nourished by dripping stalactites that watered silverleafed pomegranates. [38]  
The fruit pulsed quietly, like pocket hearths, and their glow painted equations across his robe each time he paced between trunks. [59]  
Eridian's latest study searched for the mathematics of emotion, a lattice that could carry sorrow without letting it leak despair. [79]  
His notebooks showed parabolas resembling smiles and integrals descending like sighs, yet one element refused to resolve: ambiguous loss. [98]  
An apprentice named Lio had vanished years before, not alive enough to greet, not dead enough to mourn, occupying phantom coordinates. [119]  
Eridian measured that ache nightly, finding its numbers blurred like ink under rain, yet he refused to abandon the problem. [139]  
He was gently inventive, preferring subtle adjustments over grand gestures, and so he sought guidance in overlooked corners of the cavern. [160]  
One such corner held a mosaic stepping stone half buried in moss and pomegranate roots. [175]  
Colored tesserae formed swirling constellations, but chips interrupted the picture like missing beats in a lullaby. [191]  
Eridian suspected a cipher; via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone, forgotten equations sometimes whispered to those who dared kneel. [213]  
After the orchard grows silent beneath the moon, when stalactite droplets echo like patient metronomes, he knelt beside the stone. [233]  
He placed near it a taxidermist's glass eye pair, scavenged from an abandoned studio in the hills, setting them where the design lacked color. [257]  
Moonlight refracted through the domed lenses, dovetailing fractured lines into sudden coherence, as though the eyes themselves longed to complete what was broken. [280]  
Symbols emerged: discs, arcs, and a sigil shaped like two hands almost touching yet unable to clasp. [297]  
He translated the arrangement into numbers, then into notes on his lute, then back into numbers, looping representation until patterns stabilized. [318]  
The resulting sequence predicted drip intervals of the stalactites and, astonishingly, the bloom cycle of each pomegranate tree. [336]  
Eridian saw in it a conversation: grief speaking with growth, pauses letting fruit answer what tears had asked. [354]  
If ambiguous loss lacked resolution, perhaps it required rhythm instead of closure. [366]  
He tested the theory by plucking his lute to match each dripping note; the orchard lights brightened, then softened, echoing the melody. [388]  
Within that glow he felt Lio's absence contract from a yawning wound to a measurable curve, still painful yet describable. [408]  
The conjurer realized the equation of emotion needed not a sum but a continuing function, one that trembled yet never terminated. [429]  
He adjusted the orchard's irrigation, letting drips fall in nested intervals he named Hope Fractions, ensuring the fruit would pulse like patient hearts. [452]  
The cavern warmed, and fragrant mist curled upward, carrying seeds that might someday find cracks in the ceiling and greet daylight. [473]  
Still, optimism remained buried, like a lamp under soil, seen only by roots; Eridian was content with that limited sunrise. [493]  
He documented the process in charcoal diagrams, noting how the mosaic, the glass eyes, and the dripping time signatures dovetailed into a living proof. [517]  
The proof stated, in symbols only partially decipherable, that loss does not subtract; it hovers, influencing every subsequent calculation. [536]  
Understanding this, the conjurer slipped the taxidermist's glass eyes into a niche beside the stepping stone, offering them permanent vantage. [556]  
Their lenses caught first light from the orchards' embers, broadcasting faint halos onto the walls like patient sentinels. [574]  
Eridian paused before leaving, whispering a theorem toward the shadowed passage where Lio had once practiced beginner spells. [592]  
He did not ask for the apprentice's return; instead he thanked the silence for articulating distances no voice could bridge. [612]  
Behind him, the orchard resumed its rhythm, neither loud nor still, proving that equations can sound like lullabies when solved by listening. [634]
