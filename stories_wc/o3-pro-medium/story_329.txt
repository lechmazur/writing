Amid leaf blowing that rattled the plastic roofing, the wandering chess grandmaster Pavel drifted into the hydroponic noodle farm on the edge of the valley. <words>25</words>
Every gust carried a scent of cilantro and ionized water, an aroma that filled him with agonizing bliss he could neither refuse nor define. <words>49</words>
He had come not for soup nor shelter but to find hidden passages whispered about in forgotten endgames. <words>67</words>
In his pocket clicked a lonely puzzle piece, a curiously blank cardboard shard he had carried across six countries like a talisman. <words>89</words>
Whenever he touched its smooth edge, he felt the pulse of mystery accelerate beneath his calloused fingertips, urging him onward. <words>109</words>
The rows of glass gutters overflowed with translucent noodles spiraling around lettuce roots, their delightfully dull sheen reflecting the violet grow-lamps. <words>130</words>
A caretaker in a lime jumpsuit noticed Pavel's foreign insignia and unleashed a xenophobic tirade, refusing him entry to the core greenhouse. <words>152</words>
Pavel retreated through the swirl of dusk-lit confetti released by a malfunctioning celebratory drone, using the shimmering chaos as strategic cover. <words>173</words>
The puzzle piece vibrated like a tuning fork, steering his steps toward a shadowed maintenance hatch behind crates of nutrient gel. <words>194</words>
He jimmied it open with a bishop-shaped hairpin, slipping inside a shaft where fans roared like oceanic storms. <words>212</words>
Within the metallic labyrinth, chess diagrams were scrawled in grease pencil on ductwork, each position missing the same vital corner square. <words>233</words>
Realization blossomed as he pressed the lonely puzzle piece against one diagram, and a panel clicked back, revealing a staircase descending into aqua light. <words>257</words>
Agonizing bliss surged through him, half ecstasy, half pain, the sensation of solving and being solved simultaneously. <words>274</words>
He followed the steps into a cavern where roots dangled like chandeliers, their noodles warping into letters that spelled cryptic openings. <words>295</words>
At the center stood a bio-reactor pulsing in rhythm with his heartbeat, the very engine that locals called the pulse of mystery. <words>317</words>
Guided by instinct, he slotted the cardboard shard into a slot on the reactor, absurdly low-tech yet perfectly shaped. <words>336</words>
The machinery thrummed; above, vents opened, and leaf blowing winds from the surface spiraled down, stirring glittering noodle shreds like prophetic snow. <words>358</words>
The xenophobic caretaker burst in too late, his rage silenced by the sudden checkmate of lights mapping passages only Pavel could now perceive. <words>381</words>
Pavel chose the narrowest corridor, the one marked by a knight's L, carrying his blissful agony like a lantern against the void. <words>403</words>
He vanished beyond sight, but the reactor kept whispering its softly delightfully dull hum, promising that every solved puzzle births another wandering question. <words>426</words>
