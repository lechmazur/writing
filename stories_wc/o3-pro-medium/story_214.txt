The floating observatory creaked like a drunk gull as dawn's thin rim scraped the jarred horizon. <words>16</words>
Inside, Arno Vex, the lone trapper licensed to harvest stray comets, emptied pockets of stardust onto iron grates. <words>34</words>
He worked between shifts, the hours nobody claimed, when silence became so dense it was silently audible. <words>51</words>
Yet today that paradoxical hush was broken by a glinting piece of sea glass skittering across the deck. <words>69</words>
Glass was impossible this high, five thousand meters above any credible wave, so the shard felt like prophecy. <words>87</words>
Arno tucked it near his breast map where failed constellations were penciled, tremoring with half-remembered trajectories. <words>103</words>
Loss, he mused, drew maps clearer than achievement, because absence leaves outlines obligation can finally color. <words>119</words>
He needed that upside of loss tonight; the Board demanded renewed captures after last week's catastrophic spill. <words>136</words>
To recommence the hunt, Arno first had to siphon radiance from a black hole of doubt gnawing his gut. <words>155</words>
He believed the glass knew the way. <words>162</words>
Its surface shimmered with encrypted whorls like tidal codes, so he consulted the observatory's microfilm reader, rusty yet obedient. <words>181</words>
From shady archives he once stole, Arno fed reels labeled FORSAKEN CURRENTS and began decoding microfilm by flickering lamplight. <words>200</words>
Numbers emerged: spectral coordinates, tidal equations, and a marginalia question, 'who traps the trapper?' <words>214</words>
The question cracked something tender, but also charted a wormhole through his uncertainty straight into the black hole's corona. <words>233</words>
He aligned the observatory's periscope with those illicit coordinates, each lever squealing like gulls strangled by wind. <words>250</words>
A violet beam poured, not outward, but inward, flooding the chamber with stardust he had once spilled in despair. <words>269</words>
The radiance gathered around the sea glass, now pulsing like a miniature lighthouse trying to recall its ocean. <words>287</words>
Arno extended a copper siphon tube, and the light obediently funneled, swirling with every doubt he'd bottled for years. <words>306</words>
As the tube filled, his ledgers of failure dimmed, their ink evaporating until only blank promise remained. <words>323</words>
The upside of loss finally manifested: when what you drop breaks, shards reflect unimagined constellations. <words>338</words>
Rejuvenated, Arno paged the night supervisor, reporting a fresh payload, though he left unsaid the secret cartography of doubt. <words>357</words>
Between shifts, while alarms tallied credits, he pocketed the sea glass, resolved to map oceans the sky had forgotten. <words>376</words>
Somewhere below, waves would be missing that shard, but their loss spun new guidance for a man adrift above. <words>395</words>
He smiled, hearing the silently audible hush recommence, this time humming with possibility rather than fear. <words>411</words>
