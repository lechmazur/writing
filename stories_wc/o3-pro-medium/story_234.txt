When the orchard dog finally stopped barking at night, Corin let himself into the dinosaur skeleton museum.<words>17</words>
He was a gentle swordsman, though no one believed the adjective once the duels began.<words>32</words>
Tonight his blade stayed sheathed, as his quest required softer cuts and brusque affection instead.<words>47</words>
He flicked open an empty matchbox, checking it like a compass that had swallowed the stars.<words>63</words>
The box rattled with absence, reminding him why late bloomers hide patience inside seeming hollows.<words>78</words>
Corin had been one; his skill erupted only after every tournament banner was already faded.<words>93</words>
That tardy blossoming forged his peculiar vow: to cradle the universe in a cupped hand.<words>108</words>
Tonight was another petal opening.<words>113</words>
From exhibit shadows, resin eyes of mounted raptors glimmered like delegates of prehistoric constellations.<words>127</words>
Corin greeted them, the xenophile in him bowing to anything once considered foreign, even epochs.<words>142</words>
He searched for the old stegosaur display whose plates formed a crude half-painted sundial.<words>156</words>
Museum planners had abandoned repainting after funding cuts, but the negligence suited occult geometry.<words>170</words>
Corin crouched, reading time via the coded angles in the half-painted sundial's morning layer.<words>184</words>
Midnight translated as a vector toward the Tyrannosaurus skull and a promise of contradiction.<words>198</words>
He advanced, footsteps echoing like sparring partners who refuse to sleep.<words>209</words>
Beneath the carnivore's ribs, a woman waited, back against bone, eyes lit by a phone.<words>224</words>
Mira was the faithfully unfaithful curator, loyal to truth but cheating every cataloging rule.<words>238</words>
She loved Corin precisely because he broke worlds gently, then apologized with bandages of poetry.<words>253</words>
Their brusque affection sparked arguments quicker than kisses, but each quarrel sharpened shared purpose.<words>267</words>
"The plates directed me here," Corin said, offering the matchbox like a silent flowerpot.<words>281</words>
Mira opened it, found emptiness, and smiled as if given a seed yet to sprout.<words>296</words>
Late bloomers recognize gifts that still look like absence.<words>305</words>
She tipped the box toward the skull's vast maw, and a gust of nothing shimmered.<words>320</words>
The dinosaur bones drank vacancy the way deserts drink first rain, rattling with newborn heaviness.<words>335</words>
Corin sensed the universe drawing closer, small enough now to cradle if they dared.<words>349</words>
But mass requires motion, and motion requires farewell.<words>357</words>
He unsheathed the sword, edge glinting like a crescent moon sharpened by insomnia.<words>370</words>
With one swift line he cut the air around the bones, sealing vacancy into shape.<words>385</words>
An unseen infant cosmos settled between the ribs, pulsing like a lantern in reversed thunder.<words>400</words>
Mira slipped her hand through the cage of ribs, and Corin placed his palm beneath hers.<words>416</words>
Together they felt its heartbeat, as fragile and immense as forgiveness arriving late.<words>429</words>
"Now," she whispered, "we keep it safe, faithfully unfaithful to every ordinary future."<words>442</words>
Outside, the orchard dog slept on, unaware the night had bloomed again inside old bones.<words>457</words>
