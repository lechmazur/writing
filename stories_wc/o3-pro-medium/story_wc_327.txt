Mist hung like unspoken syllables over the canyon of endless echoes, where towers of bone rose tier upon tier against a bruised dawn. [23]  
Into that reverberant maze walked Ioreth, the copper-veined storyteller, his skin threaded with metallic filaments that glimmered whenever memory touched sunlight. [44]  
He was quietly articulate, speaking in measured pulses that seemed crafted to disturb as little air as possible, yet still command it. [66]  
People hired him to translate texture into sound, for his ears felt the grain of stone the way fingers read braille. [87]  
The Council of Ossuaries had summoned him now because a new seam opened beneath the tallest bone spire, revealing a tunnel of echoes none dared map. [113]  
Rumor claimed the passage whispered in a tongue so old it died before script existed, and its syllables drove previous listeners mad. [135]  
Ioreth believed madness was merely music misheard, and thus accepted the charge. [147]  
Before descending, he visited the market square where merchants displayed relics chipped from the canyon walls, each bearing vibration lines like fingerprints. [169]  
Among the wares he noticed a flawed diamond rumored to be cursed, its heart clouded by a spiral fracture that caught light then scattered it sideways. [195]  
The pattern of that spiral mirrored acoustics he had once heard inside a collapsed amphitheater, so he purchased the stone despite the seller's hissed warnings. [220]  
In the afternoon, storm swifts wheeled over the canyon, their black wings slicing the sky into glyphs visible only to patient watchers. [242]  
Ioreth set camp on a balcony of fossilized ribs and began to harness meaning through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight. [266]  
Every banked turn became a verb, every sudden climb an exclamation, until the aerial script spelled directions into the tunnel's throat at dusk. [289]  
He entered with only a bone torch, the cursed diamond, and a notebook of blank vellum awaiting vibration-imprints. [307]  
Inside, walls throbbed with echoed shards of extinct consonants, each rebound slightly softer, as though the language itself were bleeding out across centuries. [330]  
He pressed the diamond against the limestone and felt it shiver, its flaw aligning with microfractures in the rock the way wounds recognize one another. [355]  
A low resonance bloomed, not quite voice, not quite drum, giving shape to syllables that had died before the canyon learned to mimic them. [379]  
He recorded each pulse by letting the torchlight flicker over the vellum, the shadows scripting oscillograms that only he could later parse. [401]  
Deeper, the tunnel constricted, and the echoes no longer repeated but argued, overlapping until meaning tangled like vines choking a ruin. [422]  
He realized the language was dying in real time, vowels collapsing into dust at the moment his steps stirred them, forcing him to hurry. [446]  
The birds outside had warned him: their sunset spiral formed a siphon glyph, a promise that what descended must soon be drawn upward or perish. [471]  
Ioreth planted the diamond at the narrowing terminus, embedding it in a knot of calcite so its flaw faced the womb of dark. [494]  
Then he spoke, quietly articulate, reciting textures he had memorized from sandstone, feather, silk, and winter bark, letting their tactile ghosts glow in consonants. [518]  
Each description vibrated the diamond, which in turn forced the tunnel to respond, like a shell obliged to echo its sea even when dry. [542]  
The dying language caught those textures, wove them into new joints, and for one trembling moment stood whole, breathing through his ribs and the bone towers above. [569]  
In that instant Ioreth understood why curse and cure share almost the same letters: both are leashes on possibility. [588]  
He lifted the notebook, now heavy with shadow-ink, and retreated as the diamond cracked, releasing a final chord that sealed the passage behind him. [612]  
Outside, night swifts replaced storm swifts, writing calmer glyphs that told him the canyon would keep its secrets, but the language would live inside his pages. [638]  
Across the death of a language he had carried a heartbeat, and that was enough to break neither silence nor sanity but to bridge them. [663]  
When dawn returned, the towers of bone sang only wind, yet his notebook rustled with newborn phonemes eager to find throats beyond the canyon. [687]  
Ioreth smiled, copper veins gleaming, and began the long climb out, determined to teach the world how texture becomes sound when story becomes skin. [711]
