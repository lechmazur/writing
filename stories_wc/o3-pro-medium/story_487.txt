Thunderous paradiddles ricocheted off the glass panes, filling the greenhouse labyrinth with relentless drum solos.<words>15</words>
Gerda, a docile bruiser with hands like uprooted stumps, inhaled the mossy air and remained disturbingly calm.<words>32</words>
She was here to mold a myth from the mud of reality, and myths dislike trembling.<words>48</words>
Somewhere among the carnivorous blossoms lay a conductor's baton rumored to raise the dead, and rumors fed her hunger.<words>67</words>
Yet she spoke only Bashnan, a language the plants could not parse, while the map that guided her screamed in Latin.<words>88</words>
Language barriers, she knew, were just walls begging for a confident shoulder.<words>100</words>
Gerda had found the shredded treasure map beneath the boardinghouse floorboards, piecing it together while cymbals hissed upstairs.<words>118</words>
Each segment matched a greenhouse corridor, but every tear also concealed a warning.<words>131</words>
Now the warnings breathed, petaled, and snapped their thorned jaws as she passed.<words>144</words>
A crimson pitcher plant lunged, but she countered with a gentle twist that dislocated its neck without spilling sap.<words>163</words>
She apologized in Bashnan, patting the stunned vine like a chastised puppy.<words>175</words>
Tenderness, even brash tenderness, confuses predators.<words>181</words>
Drums thundered harder, the unseen percussionist testing the greenhouse's acoustics and her resolve.<words>194</words>
She followed the beat, because every map is secretly rhythmic.<words>204</words>
Left on the downstroke, right on the roll, pause on the flam--those notes aligned with torn arrows.<words>221</words>
At the labyrinth's heart stood a dais of damp loam supporting a velvet-lined case.<words>235</words>
The plants circled like ushers, hushed by expectancy rather than fear.<words>246</words>
Gerda lifted the lid and found the conductor's baton, black as new soil and warm as breath.<words>263</words>
Legends claimed a single downbeat could summon ancestors through root and bone.<words>275</words>
But legends never mention translation.<words>280</words>
Would the dead understand Bashnan, Latin, or the unhinged percussion echoing overhead?<words>292</words>
She weighed the baton, disturbingly calm even as a Venus jaw brushed her ankle for attention.<words>308</words>
Then she struck the dais once, a crisp attack that silenced every drum as if thunder swallowed its own echo.<words>328</words>
The loam convulsed, and silhouettes of previous gardeners climbed through the mud, their mouths full of forgotten dialects.<words>346</words>
Gerda understood none of them, yet her tenderness was louder than grammar.<words>358</words>
She offered the baton like a peace pipe, and the dead nodded, recognizing her motive even without words.<words>376</words>
Together they beat an invisible measure, teaching the man-eating plants a lullaby that asked nothing but patience.<words>393</words>
Petals folded like careful applause, and the labyrinth straightened into a hallway back to dawn.<words>408</words>
Gerda left the baton planted upright in the soil, a stake pinning myth to the earth where anyone could see it.<words>429</words>
The drums resumed outside, softer now, echoing her exit like a thank-you note scrawled in rhythm.<words>445</words>
Behind her, myths sprouted, already twisting into tomorrow's rumors.<words>454</words>
