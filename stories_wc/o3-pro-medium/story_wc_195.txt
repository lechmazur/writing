Sir Caron, once heralded across dawnlit kingdoms, now walked alone beneath glass that never saw sunrise. [16]  
The alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night whispered with sap-slowed leaves reflecting distant constellations. [31]  
He had found the place on a map burned into his armor by dream-lightning. [45]  
Its braziers glowed with factually mystical oils that converted moon-darkness into trembling pearls of heat. [60]  
Yet Sir Caron felt colder than the iron of his unsnapped visor hinges. [73]  
He carried under his cloak an abandoned marionette theater program, edges frayed like history's eyelids. [88]  
The booklet listed roles for kings, serpents, and voyages that never reached port, all portrayed by strings. [105]  
Caron had once played every part on battlefields where no audience clapped. [117]  
Now, he sought a script larger than war, to capture the shape of possibility. [131]  
The greenhouse vines arranged themselves into labyrinth aisles as reality shifts, petals folding like secret syllables. [147]  
Every step he took provoked a tiny chime, as though unseen bells approved a rehearsed entrance. [163]  
Caron halted before a tree whose bark resembled stacked theater curtains. [174]  
From between the folds emerged a murmured allegiance, voiced by saplings still unborn. [187]  
It pledged loyalty not to throne or church, but to whatever mind could imagine truer horizons. [203]  
The withdrawn knight inclined his helmed head, accepting without ceremony. [213]  
The tree responded by opening a door of leaves that unsnapped like latches of green glass. [229]  
Caron stepped through, guided through forgotten patterns his childhood tutor once called courtly footwork. [243]  
Beyond lay a stage of soil illuminated by floating seeds glowing amber. [255]  
Rows of silent scarecrows waited like uncarved marionettes craving breath. [265]  
Instinctively, Caron unfolded the theater program, its pages rustling louder than wind. [277]  
He recited the opening scene, voice trembling into shivering bliss he barely recognized as hope. [292]  
The scarecrows lifted their straw heads, strings of moonlight attaching to their wooden wrists. [306]  
Through forgotten patterns of puppeteering drilled into muscle and scar, Caron raised his gloved hands. [321]  
The orchard responded; fruits of crystal chimed harmonic cues, and the living marionettes took formation. [336]  
In the script, Scene Two required a duel between dawn and dusk, but night here was eternal. [353]  
Caron improvised, letting the duel play inside his chest instead, heartbeats drumming tempo. [366]  
The puppets mirrored the rhythm, each thrust of straw-limb painting lines of silver in the dark. [382]  
As the choreography peaked, reality shifted; glass above dissolved into swirling script, letters bigger than planets. [398]  
Caron sensed he was writing the cosmos by mere gesture, unsnapping one universal hinge at a time. [415]  
The murmured allegiance grew louder, becoming chorus, promising protection if he finished the forgotten play. [430]  
But the final page of the program was missing, torn out by some earlier coward. [445]  
Caron hesitated, the void in the script echoing the void that had hollowed him during wars. [461]  
The scarecrows drooped, celestial strings slackening as uncertainty spread like mildew. [472]  
A single apple of living mercury rolled from a branch and stopped at Caron's sabaton. [487]  
He unsnapped his gauntlet entirely and picked up the fruit barehanded, feeling futures ripple over skin. [503]  
In its mirrored surface he saw the missing page handwritten by himself, but in a tomorrow unmade. [520]  
The instructions were simple: surrender fear, then speak the orchard's true name. [532]  
Caron exhaled, letting wars, titles, and loneliness unsnap from him like surplus buckles. [545]  
He named the place Possibility, voice steady despite tears he had long forgotten how to shed. [561]  
Shivering bliss surged; vines blossomed into corridors of dawn, and stars condensed into audience applause. [576]  
The scarecrows bowed, strings dissolving, no longer needing guidance. [585]  
Caron limped forward, now more poet than knight, to gather the pages settling like snow. [600]
