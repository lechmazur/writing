I found Miro, the tired swordsman, slumped on the teak bench of the floating rock monastery's breakroom, minutes after the cook resigned and left the incense drifting unguided.<words>28</words>
His eyes were half closed, but a spark of defiance flickered behind lashes as if daring want and weariness alike to approach.<words>50</words>
The silence felt fiercely apathetic, an air so done with devotion that even the prayer wheels seemed embarrassed to spin.<words>70</words>
I asked why he lingered, and he tapped a plain cloth bag resting between his boots as though it contained the last whistle of destiny.<words>95</words>
Inside, he whispered, lay a folded parchment promising freedom once the sky wrote directions across night with bright, tumbling meteors.<words>115</words>
He had vowed, to no one but himself, to overcome the creeping rust in his spirit by following meteor showers wherever they roamed.<words>138</words>
Each glowing fall, he believed, would scrape another layer of fatigue from his blade and memory alike.<words>155</words>
The resignation of the cook, he claimed, was an omen that comfort was treacherous, urging him to start before dawn glazed the hinges of habit.<words>180</words>
I, a junior archivist with more doubts than scrolls, felt his knowing naivety seep into me like warm tea into cracked porcelain.<words>202</words>
So when he rose, steadied by resolve rather than rest, I followed, carrying the monastery ledger everyone else had forgotten in the commotion.<words>225</words>
We crossed suspension bridges that groaned like old teachers, clouds pushing our ankles while lanterns above bobbed like reluctant witnesses.<words>245</words>
Miro spoke of how apathy can become armor, but if worn too long it seals shut, so the only cure is motion that risks shattering it.<words>271</words>
A meteor streaked overhead then, green as new leaf, and he laughed the dry laugh of someone shocked that the universe kept its appointments.<words>295</words>
Lightning fountains of stardust followed, outlining distant mesas in silver, and he told me the bag also held a whetstone from his childhood river, waiting to taste fire-forged rain.<words>324</words>
When the last bridge ended at open sky, the meteors falling like stubborn prayers, he stepped into the darkness, trusting the arc of light to carry his promise forward, and I recorded the gesture in my ledger so the world would remember the night a fiercely apathetic silence was undone.<words>374</words>
Behind him, fragments of bridge hovered, as if held by the gratitude of monks yet unborn, and the monastery exhaled a hush suggesting that resignation can be another name for release.<words>405</words>
