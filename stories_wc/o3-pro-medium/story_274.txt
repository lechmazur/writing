After the final page clacked through the worn typewriter, the ribbon snapped like a spent nerve. <words>16</words>
In the sudden hush, I felt obligated to archive the silence itself. <words>28</words>
That impulse birthed a spontaneous decision to explore a new neighborhood rumored to breathe forgotten sentences. <words>44</words>
I walked until neon memories faded into an abandoned drive-in where screens sagged like molted cocoons. <words>60</words>
There I met Chlor, a lanky sentient houseplant rooted in a popcorn bucket and reading the wind. <words>77</words>
Its leaves shimmered lines of poetry I could almost, but not quite, hear. <words>90</words>
Chlor greeted me with scalding ambivalence, neither welcoming nor refusing, as though existence itself bored it. <words>106</words>
This apathetically devoted guardian confessed it waited for someone careless enough to listen properly. <words>120</words>
I unfolded my pockets and offered the only artifact I prized: an embroidered bookmark stitched with constellations. <words>137</words>
Chlor brushed it with a tendril, reading the threads like Braille for photosynthetic prophets. <words>151</words>
Satisfied, it asked why I prowled through rust and projection dust at midnight. <words>164</words>
I admitted I was trying to find hidden knowledge, something unspoken but still growing roots somewhere unsupervised. <words>181</words>
The plant rustled, amused, and claimed the unspoken required tending more than speaking. <words>194</words>
It proposed a trade: help it outrun the dawn, and it would reveal a syllable of truth. <words>211</words>
I pointed out that plants cannot run, but Chlor merely shrugged its stems and waited. <words>226</words>
So we uprooted the popcorn bucket, leaving a crater of stale kernels and mummified ticket stubs. <words>242</words>
I pushed the bucket like a wheelbarrow, steering between speaker poles that jutted like fossilized microphones. <words>258</words>
Behind us the horizon yawned pink, but we tried to outrun the creeping light anyway. <words>273</words>
Our path led through weedy lots and silent cul-de-sacs, the new neighborhood that maps forgot. <words>288</words>
Mailbox shadows elongated like sentences that never reached their periods. <words>298</words>
Every few yards Chlor mumbled leaf-scratch annotations about grief, drought, and the comedic timing of bees. <words>314</words>
I realized it was tending to the unspoken inside me, watering the questions I pretended were rocks. <words>331</words>
When the sun cracked the rooftops, Chlor relented and unfolded a single bud shaped like an ear. <words>348</words>
From it spilled a hiss that rearranged itself into one word I cannot print, only carry. <words>364</words>
The moment I understood, Chlor planted the embroidered bookmark in my chest as a quiet flag. <words>380</words>
Suddenly my ribs felt like a library returned to wildfire, and I welcomed the scorch. <words>395</words>
Chlor, its purpose fulfilled, settled in the crater of my absence with apathetic devotion, already bored of me. <words>413</words>
I kept walking, outrunning nothing, yet hearing every unsaid story bloom behind my scorched footsteps. <words>428</words>
