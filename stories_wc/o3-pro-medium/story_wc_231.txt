Gulls wheeled overhead while the sea whispered like torn silk. [10]  
It was nautical twilight, when blue is deepest yet still forgives direction. [22]  
On the opal dock in mist, Keeper Oswald leaned upon his crooked telescope. [35]  
Visitors called him eccentric, but only because they never stayed long enough to listen. [49]  
He spoke to prisms in lighthouse glass and answered them with pewter songs. [62]  
Tonight, a riddle tensed his shoulders. [68]  
Two nights before, a stranger had arrived by skiff, coughing wind into lanterns. [81]  
The man offered no name, only a dried Edelweiss boutonniere pinned above his heart. [95]  
After docking, he gave Oswald a curt nod and performed a peculiar gesture, palm up then folding fingers inward like closing horizons. [117]  
Without a word, he vanished into the fog and has not returned. [129]  
Oswald's softly persistent curiosity would not allow the night to rest. [140]  
He felt summoned to investigate the unknown man's final gesture. [150]  
Isolated watchers learn that silence is never empty, only coded. [160]  
Oswald resolved to decode it by observing gaps, not motions. [170]  
Gaps between lighthouse rotations, gaps between gull calls, gaps inside his own memory. [183]  
For years he had entertained a theory that memories could be borrowed like library charts if one stood very still. [203]  
Storm refugees, passing sailors, even clouds lent him fragments he stored within amber shards of thought. [219]  
Now he sought the stranger's borrowed memories, hoping they had snagged on the dock planks. [234]  
He lifted the dried Edelweiss boutonniere from his coat hook, believing flowers remember altitude. [248]  
Its petals were crisp moons, crackling softly like snow under boots. [259]  
He pinned it to his own lapel, hoping to mimic the stranger's heart rhythm. [273]  
Then he stepped onto the opal dock, boards gleaming milky beneath lantern glaze. [286]  
Mist curled around his ankles the way cats request company without admitting need. [299]  
He shut his eyes and listened not to sounds but to interruptions between them. [313]  
First came the gap under a gull's delayed screech, bright as broken glass. [326]  
Through that fissure flowed an image not his own. [335]  
He stood atop alpine cliffs, lungs burning from thin song, a lover laughing beside him. [350]  
The lover handed him Edelweiss, whispering promise against inevitable parting. [360]  
The vision cracked, replaced by bitter salt air. [368]  
Another gap emerged between twin waves slapping pylons like out-of-step metronomes. [379]  
He now wore the stranger's soaked boots, trudging toward Oswald's lighthouse, clutching chest as though slowing time. [396]  
In that borrowed memory, the final gesture formed not farewell but delivery. [408]  
Fingers closed to conceal, palm opened to release, a code of simultaneity. [420]  
What had been given? [424]  
Oswald opened his real eyes and studied the dock by moonblur. [435]  
Between the planks, he saw a faint pale knot, almost luminous. [446]  
He pried the board with his penknife, careful not to wake wood spirits he revered. [461]  
Inside lay a corked glass ampoule, no larger than a raindrop, swirling with opalescent smoke. [476]  
He understood at once, as if the smoke spoke German mountains into his ear. [490]  
The stranger had stored the memory of that lover's laughter for safekeeping, away from forgetful war. [506]  
Oswald clutched the ampoule, feeling distance implode like folded maps. [516]  
But a question pressed with the hush of tide on shale. [527]  
Why entrust such intimacy to a hermit lighthouse keeper? [536]  
He considered his reputation: eccentric yet faithful, living among beams that cross without touching. [550]  
Perhaps the stranger had recognized in Oswald the same witnessed isolation that drives light toward darkness. [566]  
Perhaps someone alone can best guard company. [573]  
The softly persistent wind agreed, nudging mist across his boots like approving hands. [586]  
Oswald returned to the lighthouse, climbing spiral steps that echoed like coaxed bells. [599]  
At the lens room he set the ampoule beside nautical charts, aligning it with the star Deneb. [616]  
The swirling smoke brightened as the first rotation passed, then settled like a sigh finally answered. [632]  
Oswald bowed, acknowledging both burden and privilege. [639]  
Outside, foghorns sounded, but he listened instead for the fresh gap newly born. [652]  
Through it he felt the lover's laugh echo, safe, perpetual, and far less alone than before. [668]  
He smiled into darkness, keeping watch for every fragile memory seeking harbor. [680]  
Nautical twilight deepened to night, yet the lighthouse remained awake, softly persistent as always. [694]  
Its beam swept the sea like a hand promising that isolation, though witnessed, is never final. [710]
