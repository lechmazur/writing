Mirren Faye drifted through the chromed atriums of Aurora Galleria like a ghost whose map was never meant for shoppers. <words>20</words>
She was the mall's aloof cartographer, hired to sketch shifting boutiques that rebuilt themselves after every transaction. <words>37</words>
Her motivation was strangers' gossip: to learn the language of the soul encoded in their purchases and returns. <words>55</words>
Yet eagerness tangled with resignation whenever the corridors forked beneath holographic sky-lights, promising paths she would never personally walk. <words>74</words>
Today, the polished floor glitch-flickered, revealing one ceramic tile cracked clean through, a blatant flaw made inconspicuously artful by code. <words>94</words>
Mirren knelt, tracing the fracture like a coastline begging to be surveyed, when a paddle brushed her elbow. <words>112</words>
Its owner, Dax Hale, wore a collapsible kayak slung over one shoulder, water still dripping onto neon escalators. <words>130</words>
Dax grinned with the sort of inconspicuously blatant sincerity that startles cynics and comforts children. <words>145</words>
"The river exhibit expanded again," he announced, gesturing toward a distant torrent flowing where the perfume district had stood yesterday. <words>165</words>
Mirren, intrigued, followed, her map-tablet recalibrating as virtual rapids roared beside storefronts broadcasting lullabies. <words>179</words>
They discovered the river terminated at a circular plaza called the Crossroads, where two destinies were rumored to exchange places at midnight. <words>201</words>
Mirren plotted the currents while Dax sketched eddies, their shared love for kayaking synchronizing strokes of stylus and breath. <words>220</words>
Ties of memory tightened between them as they compared childhood rivers, discovering both had once mapped the same forgotten tributary in dreams. <words>242</words>
The plaza lights dimmed, and a voice from nowhere declared the crossroads open, demanding a cartographer and a voyager trade courses. <words>263</words>
Eager resignation settled over Mirren: her charts were complete only when walked, and she never walked them-all expansion, no arrival. <words>283</words>
Dax, conversely, paddled through life without maps, craving the soulful grammar hidden in every bend he survived. <words>300</words>
They understood the bargain as naturally as tide meets shore; to learn the language of the soul, each must inhabit the other's silence. <words>323</words>
Mirren pressed her fingertip to the cracked tile like signing a treaty, and data rippled outward, swapping her biometric key with Dax's. <words>345</words>
Moments later, the mall's topology rerouted: her maps implanted themselves in his wrist-compass, while her own screen became an empty horizon. <words>366</words>
Dax clasped the compass, eyes shining with directions he could finally articulate, while Mirren exhaled, unburdened, ready to walk uncharted corridors. <words>387</words>
The river exhibit receded, but a real breeze swept the plaza, smelling of cedar and current, whispering an inconspicuously blatant farewell. <words>408</words>
At the crossroads where two destinies exchanged places, an aloof cartographer and an itinerant kayaker expanded into the memories they once only mapped. <words>431</words>
