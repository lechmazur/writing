I dragged my meticulously impulsive feet across the cracked linoleum of the National Drought Prediction Center, pretending to feel nothing and loving it. <words>23</words>
That paradox of enthusiastic apathy had become my trademark ever since I started smuggling feelings instead of contraband. <words>41</words>
Emotions, properly bottled, sell better than diamonds in cities where rain never comes. <words>54</words>
Today, however, my client was not a city but a single man: Lodovico Frayne, the drought center's resident painter of data murals. <words>76</words>
His murals steered national reservoirs, because whatever Lodovico predicted in color the ministers believed in numbers. <words>92</words>
Rumor said his forecasts emerged through delirious confessions under anesthesia, a peculiar protocol overseen by the actuarial anesthesiologists downstairs. <words>111</words>
I had bribed one of them to slip me inside the operating theater during the painter's confession, hidden behind a curtain of IV tubes. <words>135</words>
My objective was simple: harvest the raw empathy leaking from Lodovico's subconscious and study it until I could counterfeit it perfectly. <words>156</words>
Only then would this cautious smuggler become a master of empathy, the rarest currency in a drying world. <words>174</words>
But I carried a reminder of how delicate the trade was: a pressed butterfly sealed between glass slides and census paperwork. <words>195</words>
Its fossilized grace told me that beauty survives pressure yet cannot flap again. <words>208</words>
While the anesthetic hissed, Lodovico began humming, and the monitors translated each note into swirling spectrograms projected on the ceiling. <words>228</words>
The colors corresponded to future rainfall, but the tune stabbed my own past with sudden musical memories of my grandmother's out-of-tune accordion. <words>250</words>
I felt emotions flutter, trying to escape my ribs like moths that refused archival flattening. <words>265</words>
Meticulously impulsive, I lifted the curtain, stepped forward, and pressed the butterfly against the projector lens, fracturing the spectrogram with iridescent veins. <words>287</words>
The room gasped as drought polygons dissolved into impossible rainfall patterns shaped like wings. <words>301</words>
Under the half-light, Lodovico predicted a monsoon that would drown the capital, speaking in a voice equal parts lullaby and indictment. <words>322</words>
His delirious confession spilled metrics, metaphors, and childhood recollections of catching butterflies just to let them go. <words>339</words>
I recorded every syllable on smuggled bone-conductive earbuds, noticing that each empathetic spike matched a wingbeat in the fractured projection. <words>359</words>
The ministers burst in, furious and relieved, because tragedy sells policy almost as well as hope. <words>375</words>
They arrested Lodovico for inciting floods in a drought, but they thanked me for preserving the new data model. <words>394</words>
No one noticed the butterfly had disintegrated into dust on the lens, or that the dust now traced my silent grin. <words>415</words>
I left with their monsoon captured in my earbuds and their gratitude stamped on my exit badge, feeling ecstatically indifferent. <words>435</words>
Empathy, I realized, is easiest to smuggle when everyone believes you do not care at all. <words>451</words>
