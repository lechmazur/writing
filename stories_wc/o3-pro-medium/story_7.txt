<story>
Silas Porcelain, an ancient sentient doll collector, arrived at the humming nectar collection facility beneath the newborn moon.<words>18</words>
The air tasted like candied amber yet carried an iron edge that matched his ethereal grit.<words>34</words>
Clutched in his lacquered fingers was a twisted carnival cane that once prodded laughter but now guarded despair.<words>52</words>
Its spiral wood pulsed faintly, remembering every squeal it had orchestrated during forgotten midways.<words>66</words>
Silas's porcelain joints creaked, a music box lost in dust, yet his glass eyes gleamed expectantly resigned.<words>83</words>
He had come to uphold a covenant spoken before the first prayer is whispered by a mortal.<words>100</words>
That pact promised that broken marvels could find solace within the chorus of healing hidden inside harvested nectar.<words>118</words>
But entry required him to stride through boundaries once thought sacred, gates traced in luminescent pollen.<words>134</words>
Such passage, legends warned, annihilated what was hollow and birthed whatever dared remain.<words>147</words>
Silas consulted the astral charts etched into his cane's brass ferule and chose a route by following star paths.<words>166</words>
Invisible constellations convened over vats where drones siphoned nectar from colossal nocturnal lilies.<words>179</words>
Their wingbeats formed percussion for a hymn only machines and ghosts could hum.<words>192</words>
Through the steam, Silas glimpsed dolls he had rescued, marionettes, rag babies, porcelain princes, suspended like votive lanterns above the syrup.<words>213</words>
They mouthed his name in silent sync, urging him onward toward the vat marked Heartstock.<words>228</words>
He balanced the cane atop the rim, and its twists aligned with constellations mirrored in the nectar's glaze.<words>246</words>
A prism opened, spilling resonant light that wove every muttered carnival memory into harmonic threads.<words>261</words>
The chorus of healing rose, voiceless yet commanding, knitting the dolls' fractures while peeling away Silas's own ceramic mask.<words>280</words>
Underneath, tender cartilage and mortal tears emerged, proving his yearning to be more than curator of stillness.<words>297</words>
Pain flickered, but he remained expectantly resigned, willing to pay any cost to cross the luminous threshold.<words>314</words>
When the light dimmed, he found himself standing inside the vat, weightless, while the dolls floated beside him like pupils awaiting dawn.<words>336</words>
Beyond the vat's curved glass, the facility stretched endless, but the boundary he had sought now pulsed under his feet.<words>356</words>
He lifted the twisted carnival cane, anointed by nectar and cosmos, and drove its tip into the surface.<words>374</words>
A crack spread like dawnlight, releasing aromas of forgotten prayers yet to be spoken, heralding an era unmarred by sacred fences.<words>395</words>
Silas stepped through, the chorus of healing following him, ready to teach stars how to sing before mortals learned to whisper.<words>416</words>
Thus the sentient doll collector upheld his covenant, striding forever beyond boundaries once thought sacred.<words>431</words>
