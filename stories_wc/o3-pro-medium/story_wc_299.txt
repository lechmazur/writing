The wind crooned through the busted screens of the quarry office trailer, sounding like distant fans begging an encore. [19]  
Gideon Marks, ex-band roadie turned antiques appraiser, stepped inside and shut the door on the metallic echo. [36]  
The place smelled of limestone dust and hopeless ambition. [45]  
He told himself the odor was merely mineral, insulating emotionally with facts the way he always did. [62]  
Gideon was confidently uncertain about everything today, a paradox he wore like the patched denim vest of his past tours. [82]  
Three months earlier he had failed publicly, misidentifying a Victorian forgery on live-streamed auction, and the internet's roar still rang. [102]  
After the applause of ridicule faded, sponsors dropped him, leaving a silence louder than any concert speaker he once hauled. [122]  
Now he was here, chasing a rumor of purpose among boxes the late sound engineer Ellis Beck left behind. [141]  
Ellis had died of cancer; Gideon of relevance, or so the tabloids joked. [154]  
The estate lawyer promised pay, but Gideon really came to wrest something intangible from the rubble of both careers. [173]  
He flicked on a desk lamp, its beam catching dust motes that spun like glitter remembered by aging eyes. [192]  
Crates labeled 'Stage Cloth' and 'Grilles' lined one plywood wall. [202]  
He slit the nearest box and lifted a tattered speaker grille cloth scrap, charcoal weave rimmed with silver thread. [221]  
Memories struck, harsh as feedback: nights when he draped identical cloth over blown monitors while the singer vamped for time. [241]  
That singer, Mara Lake, had been love and lighthouse until her overdose last winter stole the shoreline. [258]  
The cloth trembled between Gideon's fingers, and he talked to the dust, recounting thread count, period dye, touring provenance. [277]  
Facts formed a moat; feelings stayed outside, shivering. [285]  
Yet the moat cracked when he found Ellis's notebook beneath the grilles. [297]  
Entries dated two weeks before Mara's death described a secret concert recorded inside this very quarry at midnight. [315]  
Ellis wrote of echoes that returned music hollowed, a natural delay chamber he called 'Echo Valley Longing'. [332]  
Gideon inhaled, hearing phantom notes swirl between limestone walls beyond the trailer. [344]  
There was also a line: 'After the applause, truth still rings; capture that and the song lives again.' [362]  
Gideon realized Ellis had hidden reels of that session somewhere on site, maybe inside the abandoned stage cavity down in the pit. [384]  
If Mara's final unfiltered performance survived, Gideon might redeem his own error, maybe even resolve her unfinished melody. [402]  
Purpose flickered, fragile but lit. [407]  
He pocketed the cloth scrap like a relic and stepped outside, quarry gravel crunching beneath boots still bruised by load-ins. [427]  
Night had settled, but a half moon silvered the chasm, revealing ladders descending to the hollow stage platform. [445]  
Gideon felt the old roadie limbs complain, yet they obeyed, remembering union rules of leverage and timing. [462]  
Halfway down, he saw a rusted locker wedged in sediment, padlock scabbed with corrosion. [476]  
He wedged the grille cloth between latch and rock for grip, then used a tire iron to wrest the lock free. [497]  
Inside lay two metal reels, a harmonica, and a Polaroid of Mara laughing mid-chorus, eyes charged with fearless ache. [516]  
Gideon's throat tightened, but he recited tape width specifications aloud, insulating emotionally with facts as moonlight glazed the moment. [535]  
Yet numbers could not mute the tremor rising when wind funneled through the quarry, echoing Mara's signature sustained note. [554]  
He understood then that discovering the reels mattered less than relaying what they carried: proof that failure is not finale. [574]  
Purpose, at last, was not appraisal but reverberation, the carrying onward of sound that refused burial. [590]  
He would restore the tapes, premiere them properly, and let Mara's voice answer the silence that heckled him. [608]  
After that, whatever applause came or didn't, he would walk away lighter, respectfully folding the cloth into his archive. [627]  
Far above, the trailer lamp glimmered like a lone house light awaiting the encore only earnest hearts can hear. [646]  
Gideon smiled, confidently uncertain of tomorrow, but certain the valley would carry tonight's resolve across the quarry walls. [664]  
The wind answered with a fading chord, quiet but true, after the applause, after the loss, after everything. [682]
