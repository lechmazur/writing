<story>
Moonlight poured like spilled mercury through cathedral windows that a wandering giant had fashioned into his study, and the air tasted of inked dust. <words>24</words>
There an unlikely prophet named Vela perched atop a ladder-sized quill, rehearsing messages she was never sure belonged to her voice. <words>45</words>
Vela's reputation was conventionally rebellious, yet tonight her defiance crumbled beneath a haunting delight she could neither welcome nor refuse. <words>65</words>
She clutched a wilted paper flower, its creases glowing faintly, the last relic of a run-in at a late-night laundromat weeks earlier. <words>87</words>
Back then, suds had swirled like small galaxies, and from their froth a whisper rose, promising glimmering transitions if only she listened. <words>109</words>
The whisper urged her to unify scattered minds under a single vision, to braid disparate dreams into one resonant chord. <words>129</words>
But each rehearsal risked estranging her from herself, as though every borrowed prophecy stole another strand from her own memory. <words>149</words>
Tonight, between scenes of the plays the giant copied for royal patrons, Vela decided she would speak at last. <words>168</words>
She descended the ridged spine of a dictionary, landing beside the immense desk where ink wells were large enough to drown in. <words>190</words>
The paper flower unfurled despite its wilt, revealing hidden glyphs that shimmered, flickered, and then stabilized, like film frames finding focus. <words>211</words>
Glimmering transitions rippled across the study: inkwells became reflecting pools, shelves bent into horizon lines, and dust motes orbited as tiny moons. <words>233</words>
The giant, returning with an armload of comets for lamps, paused, his enormous brow folding like thunderclouds at dawn. <words>252</words>
He heard Vela, smaller than one letter in his ledgers, proclaim that unity was not constriction but consonance, not empire but choir. <words>274</words>
Her words spiraled upward, entering the giant's ear like luminous insects, stitching together his scattered, sleepy thoughts, and he smiled with impossible gentleness. <words>297</words>
From that smile sprouted corridors of shared imagination, corridors that threaded back through laundromats, alleys, bedrooms, anywhere a restless mind awaited nightwash revelation. <words>320</words>
Everywhere, listeners felt the tug, a soft yet certain summons, and they followed, shedding private static for the melody Vela had unleashed. <words>342</words>
As they converged, Vela sensed herself thinning, a wick burning for a brighter room, but the haunting delight insisted this was the price. <words>365</words>
When the chorus finally harmonized, the flower browned into silence, the giant's study faded, and Vela, estranged from solitude, evaporated gladly into collective dawn. <words>389</words>
No single mind remembered her name, yet every dream bowed where moonlight met the morning. <words>404</words>
