I adjusted the airship captain's goggles that never left my forehead, a keepsake far grander than my livery. [18]  
They smelled faintly of brine and burnt ether, reminding me where joy once hovered above anguish. [34]  
Now I was merely an ascending servant, sent to deliver breakfast to the astronomer locked in the spire. [52]  
The icebound spire above the clouds groaned whenever the wind changed direction, like a whale turning in frozen sleep. [71]  
I pretended the groan was greeting rather than warning, for my heart was set to seek out the joy beneath anguish. [92]  
The brass-barred elevator lurched upward; I would have ten floors to reassure myself before knocking. [107]  
Its cage shook, each rattle scattering shards of dawn through the frost-coated mesh. [120]  
I watched the shards dance, studying the world through scattered light the way children divine pictures in embers. [138]  
Curiosity warmed me more than my wool coat, and I felt oddly inquisitive, even warmly inquisitive, toward the recluse above. [158]  
The first floor slipped away, then the second, and the cogs purred like distant cats. [173]  
I remembered tea conversations we never had, rehearsed compliments he would brush aside with mathematical indifference. [189]  
Some say he carries anguish in his pockets the way others carry keys, unable to unlock anything at all. [208]  
The third floor marker chimed, and cold steam spiraled upward like a herald. [221]  
Suddenly the cage halted, gears whining as though reluctant to unfold some hidden page of the morning. [238]  
I tapped the panel, and a sliver of metal popped loose, revealing a narrow recess. [253]  
Inside lay a palm-sized book wrapped in oilcloth, its lockwork filigree catching the scattered light like fidgeting fireflies. [271]  
The elevator shuddered, resumed climbing, and I cradled the find against my chest, goggles fogging from sudden breath. [289]  
Brass letters on the cover spelled the astronomer's initials, yet every page within was lines of absurd symbols. [307]  
An encrypted diary, I realized, pulsing with secret footsteps denied the corridor of speech. [321]  
Why hide thoughts twelve stories above sea kisses if not to keep them from drowning in sorrow? [338]  
I longed to pry the lock, but longing without consent felt like mixing medicine in someone's tea. [355]  
Instead, I pressed the diary against the frosted mesh, letting scattered light seep through glyphs until one symbol glimmered blue. [375]  
The book vibrated, tiny clasps unclenching as though responding to gentle interrogation rather than brute intrusion. [391]  
Pages unfolded like concertinas, and diagrams of constellations merged with phrases of startling tenderness. [405]  
He wrote of a childhood balloon lost above stormclouds, of laughter echoing between crash and sky, of love still rescueable. [425]  
Each confession felt like warm water trickling over bruises, and my inquisitiveness gained a hush of reverence. [442]  
The sixth floor rushed past; I was halfway to his door and already inside his heart's vestibule. [459]  
Affectionate detachment washed over me, the way gardeners admire blooming roses while accepting future thorns. [474]  
If I were caught reading, he might exile me to the lower decks forever, yet my motive held firm. [493]  
I wanted to seek out the joy beneath anguish, then hand it back to him gleaming. [509]  
Thus I memorized a single line before the elevator neared the ninth floor: 'Pain is a lantern; joy is the oil'. [530]  
The diary folded itself shut, almost politely, and the lock clicked home like an approving tutor. [546]  
I slid it back into the recess moments before the cage opened onto the frostbitten landing. [562]  
Dr. Alabaster Auden awaited me, thin as a compass needle, eyes brighter than the dawn beyond the windows. [580]  
He noted the steam around my goggles and asked, warmly inquisitive, whether I had enjoyed the ride. [597]  
I answered with affectionate detachment, that the elevator, like life, sometimes groans only to deliver unexpected gifts. [614]  
His eyebrow folded skyward, curious, and the corner of his mouth hinted at a simmering smile. [630]  
I set the breakfast tray down, unfolding linen napkins so meticulously that scattered light scattered further, engraving silence. [648]  
Between us hovered a hush neither cold nor warm, like glass protecting a candle's quiver. [663]  
I bowed, then paused, repeating the memorized line in a whisper I pretended was an idle proverb. [680]  
'Pain is a lantern; joy is the oil,' I said, folding the last napkin into a swan. [697]  
Auden's eyes widened at the quotation, and I saw anguish retreat one cautious step, as though granted parole. [715]  
Neither of us mentioned a diary, or gears, or secrets; we merely shared the sunrise pooling on the silver teapot. [735]  
Through scattered light we found a quiet alliance, not of master and servant, but of travelers aloft in wounded air. [755]  
The elevator bell chimed for its descent, yet I lingered, sensing that ten floors were sometimes enough to change an orbit. [776]
