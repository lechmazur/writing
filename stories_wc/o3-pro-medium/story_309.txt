The hush that follows the final siren slides over the Vanishing Point Gallery like dust settling on forgotten statues. <words>19</words>
Detective Mara Quill, overworked enough to make caffeine nervous, arrives late, trench coat fraying like her patience. <words>36</words>
She is confidently unsure about everything except the migraine tap-dancing behind her eyes. <words>49</words>
Still, any chance to outdance a looming inevitability is worth lacing up sarcasm like red-hot roller skates. <words>66</words>
A curator claims memory itself is bleeding from the canvases, and a murder threatens to mop the spill. <words>84</words>
Mara pretends boredom while her eyes rummage through the crowd, scavenging expressions the way gulls attack chip bags. <words>102</words>
Nothing obvious—just twitchy patrons orbiting the centerpiece: a single playing card nailed to a blank canvas, fluttering slightly. <words>120</words>
The card is the Nine of Hearts, its red pips faded as if embarrassed by the attention. <words>137</words>
According to legend, anyone staring too long recalls what they’ve tried hardest to erase, and sometimes eraser dust bites back. <words>157</words>
Mara rolls her eyes so violently the room should invoice for earthquake damage, then lifts a half-damaged kaleidoscope from evidence. <words>177</words>
She peers via the fleeting images in a half-damaged kaleidoscope, and they strobe: blood on marble, a siren’s echo, somebody laughing in chords of guilt. <words>202</words>
The kaleidoscope jerks her into memory’s centrifuge, dumping scenes she never filed, including this gallery five minutes from now. <words>221</words>
In that preview, the card ignites, sprinklers fail, and everyone’s terror becomes art critics’ next buzzword. <words>237</words>
Confidently unsure, Mara pockets the kaleidoscope, strides to the canvas, and peels the card free with a sigh of rehearsed disdain. <words>258</words>
Molten sarcasm drips from her voice: 'Relax, folks, I’ll just borrow your nostalgia index before it explodes—standard deductible applies.' <words>277</words>
The crowd chuckles, half-believing it’s performance art, which buys Mara seconds to rummage beneath the pedestal for wiring. <words>295</words>
She finds putty, a detonator, and fingerprints older than yesterday’s alibi, all signed in the oily cursive of inevitability. <words>314</words>
Her own. <words>316</words>
Memories impact like shrapnel; she remembers planting the bomb last night, chasing a serial art thief who was actually herself. <words>336</words>
Burnout had marched her across a cognitive tightrope until identities tangled, and justice became just another file mislabeled in her head. <words>357</words>
Now, future smoke curls in her nostrils while present patrons photograph her like she’s part of the exhibition. <words>375</words>
She could shout for evacuation, but the culprit is supposed to vanish, not the detective, and pride is a stubborn choreographer. <words>396</words>
Instead she rewires the detonator with the playing card, converting countdown into a loop that keeps postponing boom like a bureaucrat’s hold music. <words>419</words>
It will fail eventually, but so will everything, and Mara only needs tonight to recalibrate the mirror she mistakes for a badge. <words>441</words>
She walks out, sirenless, gallery intact, inevitability tripping over its own untied shoelaces while sarcasm cools to a simmering promise. <words>461</words>
Tomorrow, she’ll turn herself in—or perhaps investigate the confession, confidently unsure which dossier will close the case of Detective Mara Quill. <words>482</words>
