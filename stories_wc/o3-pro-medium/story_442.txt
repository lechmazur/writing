Jaro, an edgy tradesman with a comfortingly pessimistic grin, shut the spongey door of the giant mushroom house behind him.<words>20</words>
The interior breathed moist spores that tinted every memory he tried to summon a blurry vividness, as though dreams rubbed against mildew.<words>42</words>
Outside, during the final rotation of a forgotten windmill, its vanes groaned, a dying metronome echoing through the cap's fibrous rafters.<words>63</words>
That rhythm reminded Jaro why he had come: to carry a flickering candle through an endless void no map acknowledged.<words>83</words>
First, however, the candle's journey required directions more exact than charcoal sketches, so he resolved to vectorize the haze twisting across his recollections.<words>106</words>
His method, taught by clockmakers turned mystics, worked via synchronized watches that ticked in opposing pockets, beating coordinates into thought like nails.<words>128</words>
Yet each tick also warped the scenes, and the distortion of memory threatened to erase the path he sought before it even appeared.<words>151</words>
To anchor himself, Jaro unfolded the torn corner of a flyer he had stolen from a tavern bulletin years earlier.<words>171</words>
Only three letters and a jagged arrow remained on the scrap, but they felt immovable, like iron pins on a drifting star chart.<words>194</words>
He pressed the corner against the pulsing wall, and the mushroom flesh absorbed the ink, projecting faint corridors that coiled toward darkness.<words>216</words>
Comfort returned, shaded by his usual pessimism: if the corridors collapsed, at least he could blame himself, a narrative both soothing and sharp.<words>239</words>
He lit the candle, its flame stuttering like a nervous pupil, and aligned the watches' hands so north coincided with the windmill's final sigh.<words>263</words>
Time split: one watch sprinted ahead, the other lagged, and between their disagreement a thin door materialized where spores fell slow as snow.<words>286</words>
Jaro stepped through, feeling his memories vector and raster simultaneously, crisp outlines dissolving into puddles, puddles freezing into unexpected lattices of purpose.<words>308</words>
In the intermediate gloom floated the endless void he had feared, yet it resembled a cellar under the world, stocked with shadows needing light.<words>332</words>
He raised the candle, and its flicker sprayed trembling constellations onto the void's walls, revealing trade routes etched by people history insisted never existed.<words>356</words>
As he walked, the scrim of doubt behind his eyes stayed comfortingly pessimistic, assuring him every correct step could still end in oblivion.<words>379</words>
But the promise of oblivion felt lighter than the weight of forgetting, so he marched on, trusting the synchronized watches to mend what the windmill had shredded.<words>406</words>
When the final vane outside juddered to stillness, the candle steadied, and Jaro realized memory's distortion was simply space begging to be redrawn.<words>429</words>
He smiled, edgy as ever, because redrawing space meant endless work for a tradesman, and endless work meant the void might never go dark again.<words>454</words>
