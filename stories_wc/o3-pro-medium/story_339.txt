Desmond Vale, once a celebrity mime, now a joyless performer, arrived at the prismatic lake just as morning cranes hammered distant scaffolds. <words>22</words>
The city was amid construction of a glass museum that would jut over the water like a dagger of unfinished apologies. <words>43</words>
In his coat pocket he fingered a simple drawer knob, the last intact relic from the childhood dresser he had smashed years ago. <words>66</words>
He carried it everywhere to hush the dissonance of old guilt that still drummed against his ribs like impatient stage lights. <words>87</words>
Yet as sunlight fractured across the lake, he felt torn between truths: the one he performed and the one he concealed. <words>108</words>
His outfit, a modestly extravagant suit of charcoal velvet lined with thrift-store sequins, mirrored that split, glittering and frugal in the same breath. <words>131</words>
He had come to organize his memories via the echo of a squeaking seesaw in an empty playground bordering the site. <words>152</words>
Every creak of the plank mimicked applause that once thrilled him, then cracked into awkward silence when his father was evicted for embezzlement. <words>175</words>
Desmond had shattered the dresser that night, ripping off knobs like trophies, convinced splintering wood could drown his complicity in the theft. <words>197</words>
Now the museum rising beside the playground would display the stolen artifacts his father once curated, polished into civic pride. <words>217</words>
The city had forgiven, but forgiveness amplified the squeak, because Desmond knew the exhibition omitted his own forged provenance reports. <words>237</words>
If he could fix the timeline of lies, maybe the echo would soften to a lullaby instead of a metronome of regret. <words>259</words>
He twisted the drawer knob between thumb and forefinger, pretending it was the dial of a safe that might unlock cleaner air. <words>281</words>
With cautious abandon he stepped onto the seesaw, balancing his weight so the board hovered, neither past nor future touching the gravel. <words>303</words>
The prismatic lake refracted scaffolding shadows into kaleidoscopes, as if the water were auditioning for a role only he could understand. <words>324</words>
In that trembling equilibrium, he realized a performer could confess without words by altering the stage itself. <words>341</words>
He would organize an opening tableau for the museum: him, silent, offering the knob, documents, and a notarized letter of culpability under the new skylight. <words>366</words>
Let the public see how a modestly extravagant lie could calcify, and how a simple gesture might refract like the lake into complicated grace. <words>390</words>
The seesaw groaned its verdict, dipping toward the future, and Desmond stepped off, lighter, because the echo at last sounded like a beginning. <words>413</words>
