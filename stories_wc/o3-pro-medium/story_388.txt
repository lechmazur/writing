Under the soft hush of a distant morning, the melodic sculptor Irin rode her dented van toward the mountains, heart hammering with secret anticipation. <words>24</words>
Only yesterday a sudden road trip leads to an unexpected meeting with an archivist who whispered of a mysterious forest glade at dawn where unheard songs were trapped. <words>52</words>
The archivist, peculiarly reliable despite his quivering hands, had pressed a map between pages of brittle field notes on rare botanical specimens. <words>74</words>
According to local legends, the glade housed an imprisoned muse whose silence stifled artists for leagues around. <words>91</words>
Irin's own melodies had dried to desert cracks, so her motivation was clear: to unchain an imprisoned muse and recover her art. <words>113</words>
She parked where the dirt track gave up, slung chisels shaped like tuning forks across her back, and walked until the trees breathed that shouting silence. <words>139</words>
Mist draped every branch, each droplet catching dawnlight like captive notes yearning for release. <words>153</words>
At the glade's center a stone monolith stood, riddled with grooves that resembled both sheet music and vine lattice. <words>172</words>
Botanical specimens clustered around its base: ghost orchids, singing nettles, and a spiral fern rumored to echo heartbeats. <words>190</words>
Irin traced the grooves, feeling them vibrate faintly, and she understood the stone was the muse's throat grown numb from centuries of restraint. <words>213</words>
To carve open that throat without shattering its memory, she would have to persevere with the patience of moss and the precision of rhyme. <words>237</words>
Hour after blue hour, her tuning-fork chisels chimed, dislodging chips that fell like hushed bells onto the roots. <words>255</words>
With each strike the shouting silence bent, then folded, until a resonant hum seeped through the clearing, stirring petals and memories alike. <words>277</words>
Yet a final knot of stone remained, and doubt coiled around her wrists, whispering that legends sometimes guarded horrors, not salvation. <words>298</words>
Remembering the archivist's peculiarly reliable eyes, she inhaled the fern's rhythm and steadying herself, delivered one last, pure note of a strike. <words>320</words>
The monolith cracked like dawn splitting night, and a figure of translucent aurora rose, music spiraling from her hair, flooding the woods with color. <words>344</words>
Freed, the muse brushed Irin's forehead, weaving new melodies into her veins, and the sculptor wept as the glade echoed a grateful chorus into the waking world. <words>371</words>
Birds that had never sung before burst into experimental arias, testing the newly softened air above shimmering leaves. <words>389</words>
Irin loaded the fallen stone shards into her van, portable hymns for future sculptures. <words>403</words>
