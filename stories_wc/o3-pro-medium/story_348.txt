Between flights, Neriah, an unapologetically humble somnambulist scout, touched down in the misty valley of her forebears.<words>17</words>
Every equinox, she made a yearly pilgrimage to her family's ancestral home buried beneath the gnarled oaks.<words>34</words>
This time, a storm had cracked the forest floor, revealing a staircase spiraling into a sunken laboratory.<words>51</words>
Loaded curiosity thrummed through her veins like the restless drum of bats hiding daylight.<words>65</words>
She uncorked her battered satchel, ensuring her bottled lightning bug collection glowed bright enough to guide her descent.<words>83</words>
The bioluminescent swarm hummed approval, their amber sparks painting glyphs on the crumbling walls.<words>97</words>
Neriah recorded those accidental sigils in her dream journal, determined to map spiritual wisdom wherever it flickered.<words>114</words>
Sleepwalking served her craft; unconscious feet ignored fear while conscious mind perched above, noting subtleties.<words>129</words>
The staircase ended in brackish water that kissed antique tiles etched with constellations of moths.<words>144</words>
She waded until she found the main chamber, its ceiling collapsed beneath roots that drank electricity.<words>160</words>
Archivist jars floated like bobbing moons, each containing a desiccated seed wrapped in copper threads.<words>175</words>
She understood the family legend at lastâ€”the woodland secrets were always seeds, waiting for sleepers to awaken them.<words>193</words>
Tongues of memory whispered that her great-grandmother had planted thoughts inside those husks for future scouts.<words>209</words>
Neriah lifted one jar, letting the bottled lightning bugs circle it like patient midwives.<words>223</words>
The glass warmed, and a seed cracked, emitting a tune that matched her heartbeat's offbeat cadence.<words>239</words>
Sleep overtook her, yet she remained upright, continuing to scout the chamber in somnolent reverence.<words>254</words>
Within the dream, maps unfolded: roots became roads, waterlines became timelines, and moth constellations blinked destinations.<words>270</words>
Each luminous direction pointed to overlapping layers of spirit and soil her ancestors had charted silently.<words>286</words>
By marking coordinates in her journal, she would complete the unfinished atlas spanning generations and graves.<words>302</words>
Still drifting, she replaced the awakened seed with a fresh lightning bug, sealing reciprocity between light and lineage.<words>320</words>
Water suddenly recoiled, revealing iron tracks leading deeper, but her internal compass declared the pilgrimage satisfied.<words>336</words>
She ascended, knowing further descent belonged to next year's dreams when new questions would hatch.<words>351</words>
Outside, dawn filtered through the canopy, igniting dew and coaxing the valley into quiet applause.<words>366</words>
Neriah bowed to the woodland secrets, unapologetically humble despite carrying an orchestra of revelations in her ribs.<words>383</words>
Between flights again, she would gift the atlas to wandering minds, proving that sleep can scout horizons waking eyes ignore.<words>403</words>
