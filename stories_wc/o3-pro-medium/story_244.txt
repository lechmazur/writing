After the final petal drops from the old rosebush, Shura wipes crimson dust from her gauntlets and listens to the humming transformers overhead. <words>23</words>
The neon sign repair shop around her flickers between sickly magenta and hopeful aqua, matching the soft turbulence of her mellow intensity. <words>45</words>
She is a swordswoman of renown, yet the memory of the last duel clings to her shoulders like cold sweat, making her guilty and grateful at once. <words>72</words>
The blade at her hip remains sheathed, its voice silenced until she fulfills a promise carved in midnight: find the door of release. <words>95</words>
To pursue that promise, she has followed rumors through damp archives, gleaning secrets from half-truth historians who spoke more with their eyes than their tongues. <words>120</words>
Each curt interview led her here, to the surging glow of broken letters spelling 'PARADISE' above buzzing glass tubes and unclaimed repairs. <words>142</words>
Behind the counter squats an antique crate, and within it rests a tribal mask with labyrinthine carvings, its spirals twitching whenever circuit sparks leap. <words>166</words>
Shura approaches with reservedly bold steps, balancing caution against the steady pull of destiny. <words>180</words>
The shop's proprietor, an octogenarian once rumored to be a war chronologist, watches her gloved fingers trace the mask's grooves. <words>200</words>
"Every path inside that wood leads outward," he murmurs, offering a half-truth polished by time, "but only if you dare to walk backward first." <words>224</words>
Shura hears the warning, yet guilt over her fallen opponent hardens into resolve; she must open a door to the unknown or forever carry that weight. <words>250</words>
She purchases nothing, for currency here is confession, and she speaks of the rosebush grown from the blood spilt beside the dueling circle. <words>273</words>
When the tale ends, the proprietor lifts the mask, presses it to her face, and the shop's neon gutters into darkness. <words>294</words>
Through the eye-holes she glimpses circuitry unwinding into corridors, a labyrinth alive with pulsing signs that point nowhere and everywhere. <words>314</words>
The voice of her sheathed blade whispers: slice illusion, spare truth, claim release. <words>327</words>
With one fluid draw she cuts the vision, severing neon tendrils that bind the mask, and reality folds like hot glass. <words>348</words>
A hidden panel behind the workbench slides away, revealing a modest wooden arch glowing with the phrase "Door of Release" in trembling cyan filament. <words>372</words>
She bows to the old man, then steps through, carrying her guilt as both compass and payment, pursuing whatever waits where petals never fall. <words>396</words>
In the hush beyond, a horizon of shifting color greets her, and every hue feels like forgiveness slowly learning to sing. <words>417</words>
