Wind moaned between the towers of bone in a canyon of endless echoes. [13]  
On a ledge carved by forgotten floods stood Ithar, the harmonic stone skimmer. [26]  
His cloak of river-shale plates clattered softly, mirroring the crooked rhythm of the wind. [40]  
Ithar had come with only a stone arrowhead and a purpose older than speech. [54]  
He sought to learn to navigate without moving, to turn space upon itself like water. [69]  
That paradox had gnawed at mystics for generations, but Ithar's weathered resolve refused surrender. [83]  
Legends claimed the secret lingered in the canyon, a pulse left wandering after the world cracked. [99]  
To listen, one had to be historically reverent, hearing every era's breath layered inside the stone. [115]  
Ithar knelt and pressed the arrowhead against the dusty terrace, eyes half closed. [128]  
He would appraise the land not by sight but by its trembling memory. [141]  
First came the waiting, a silence weighted with centuries of layered dust. [153]  
Grain by grain, the canyon's hush settled into his ribs like silt in river bends. [168]  
Then a faint throb rippled beneath him, as though the cliff itself remembered a heartbeat. [183]  
It was that wandering pulse, restless yet lost, seeking a voice through stone. [196]  
Ithar answered with a single resonant sweep of the arrowhead across the rock. [209]  
Sound flared, bounded by the canyon walls, multiplying into chords that darted like swallows. [223]  
High above, a real flock took fright, scattering into shifting constellations of wings. [236]  
Ithar studied their flight, reading distance, depth, and direction through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight. [255]  
The birds wheeled whenever an echo struck them, mapping invisible hollows better than any chart. [270]  
Each turn mirrored the subterranean labyrinth he hoped to master without taking a step. [284]  
Wind began to braid the dust into spirals, scripting stories across the sunlit chasm. [298]  
Images formed: caravans, sieges, funerals, all events that had fed the canyon its bones. [312]  
He felt obligated to honor them, so he hummed the ancestral intervals that named the dead. [328]  
The cliff responded, lowering its resonance like a giant exhaling after a long vigil. [342]  
Air thickened; Ithar sensed the canyon testing his devotion. [351]  
He placed the arrowhead upon his tongue, tasting flint, river memory, and distant starlight. [365]  
A cold clarity rushed through him, aligning his heartbeat with the wandering pulse beneath. [379]  
Suddenly he no longer stood on the ledge; the ledge stood within him. [392]  
He beheld the canyon's entire map unfurling in thought, every crevice singing its coordinates. [406]  
To test the revelation, he imagined walking to the opposite wall. [417]  
Instantly the birds veered, tracing his phantom path across the gulf. [428]  
Dust vines twisted behind them, sketching footprints where none existed. [438]  
Ithar laughed, a hoarse sound chipped by years of solitude but bright with triumph. [452]  
He understood now that to navigate without moving was to persuade the world to move instead. [468]  
Yet such power demanded balance, or the canyon would collapse into screaming emptiness. [481]  
He grounded the vision by planting the arrowhead point-down in the ledge. [493]  
Flint bit stone, and the wandering pulse jolted, as if surprised to find a spine. [508]  
The birds settled at once, forming a spiraling crown above his head. [520]  
Their wings beat time like drums, sealing the pact between traveler and terrain. [533]  
Through their rhythm, Ithar felt routes radiate outward, each a silent invitation. [545]  
He could reach any horizon by remaining utterly still, guiding stones and air to fetch him. [561]  
But his vow was to share the art, not rule with it. [573]  
So he etched instructions into the arrowhead, every line a compressed melody of direction. [587]  
When erosion finally loosened the flint, the relic would drift to another seeker. [600]  
Through centuries of layered dust the lesson would travel, carried by echo, bird, and bone. [615]  
Some future pilgrim would appraise the artifact and hear Ithar's humming inside its facets. [629]  
Then the canyon would open once more, welcoming another soul of weathered resolve. [642]
