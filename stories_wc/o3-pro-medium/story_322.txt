The traveling salesman of oddities knocked politely on the iron door guarding the silent abyss, whistling off-key. <words>17</words>
His rationally whimsical mind delighted in contradictions, so he bowed with courtly gravity while grinning like a prankish comet. <words>36</words>
Within, echoing gears paused their grinding; throughout repairs the custodians feared distraction might lengthen eternity's maintenance window. <words>53</words>
Yet they opened, because his ledger listed what infinity lacked: one rustic water pitcher, antique yet unbroken. <words>70</words>
He carried it wrapped in cloud-silk and numbered its every blemish, eager to quantify rarity into gentlemanly proof. <words>88</words>
The custodians, beings of shadow arithmetic, requested demonstration with the rhythm of a pendulum, their language of swing. <words>106</words>
So the salesman suspended the pitcher by a silver filament and let it arc between absence and presence. <words>124</words>
At each apex he recited dwindling catalogues of vanishing arts: glass melody, cloud embroidery, thunder calligraphy. <words>140</words>
The abyss listened, or rather withheld silence, which was praise in that cavernous economy of sound. <words>156</words>
Mocking sincerity colored his voice, like a jester quoting scripture while balancing on the palace rail. <words>172</words>
Still, every syllable measured gravity; he wished to learn the true meaning of interconnectedness, not merely entertain echoes. <words>190</words>
The custodians tasked him to prove the pitcher linked all fading crafts, otherwise it would remain miscellaneous clutter. <words>208</words>
He spun the vessel faster, numbers blooming behind its path like fireflies graphing ephemeral bridges between skills. <words>225</words>
Potters conversed with dancers, smiths hummed with librarians; every vanished artisan flashed across the dark like synchronized memories. <words>243</words>
The salesman quantified connections by clapping once per swing, counting until two separate heartbeats adopted identical tempo. <words>260</words>
When the counts converged at ninety-nine, a prime of quiet majesty, the abyss exhaled a velvet breeze. <words>277</words>
Repairs resumed automatically, gears aligning themselves to the newfound rhythm as if music were lubricant. <words>292</words>
Seeing this, the custodians stamped an invoice of gratitude upon shadow parchment and bowed through their own torsos. <words>310</words>
Payment rendered, they offered him passage deeper, where disconnected ideas drifted like orphaned islands needing bridges. <words>326</words>
He accepted, still mocking in tone yet earnest in purpose, because sales routes thrive on unsolved wonders. <words>343</words>
Carrying the rustic water pitcher, pendulum-marked and glowing, he ventured toward blank horizons promising further vanishings to rescue. <words>361</words>
Behind him, the abyss was no longer entirely silent; faint ticks persisted, counting relationships newly soldered. <words>377</words>
He smiled at the arithmetic echo, rationally whimsical as ever, and plotted his next demonstration with gentle precision. <words>395</words>
After all, to quantify the cosmos with the rhythm of a pendulum is simply good marketing. <words>411</words>
And to sell meaning while pretending to mock it is the oldest, most necessary, never-vanishing art. <words>427</words>
