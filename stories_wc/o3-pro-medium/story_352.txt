<story>
Between vanishing stars, I roamed the upper altitudes like a feral sky nomad, sniffing currents nobody else could name. <words>19</words>
Blithe discontent fluttered in my chest, half hunger for more horizons, half irritation that every direction repeated old refrains. <words>38</words>
I carried a tattered bookmark, its ink long faded, yet smelling faintly of cedar libraries swallowed by storms. <words>56</words>
The scrap was my only heirloom from maestros who taught me to conserve forgotten songs the way glaciers conserve blue lightning. <words>77</words>
Their melodies sometimes leaked from the paper at night, notes so thin they could hide inside a sigh. <words>95</words>
Following those whispers, I flew toward the invisible ink factory perched on a cloudless thermal above the Equatorial Silence. <words>114</words>
Legend claimed its presses printed ideas so shy they chose invisibility, ideas awaiting hands brave enough to re-etch them aloud. <words>134</words>
I found the entrance only by the sound of a leaf falling across iron catwalks that ordinary ears could not perceive. <words>155</words>
Inside, corridors spiraled in effortlessly complicated arabesques, as if the architect had sculpted new paths each time someone blinked. <words>174</words>
Machines hissed stanzas, condensers drummed rhythms, and ultraviolet sprockets flashed syncopations that teased my training. <words>189</words>
I realized the factory was an orchestra missing only breath, begging for a conductor who could read the unwritten score. <words>209</words>
So I anchored my bookmark in the main nozzle, letting its silent chords bleed into the reservoirs of invisible pigment. <words>229</words>
Ink absorbed the music, twitched, and flowed into fresh sheets that glimmered whenever distant galaxies winked out. <words>246</words>
I sang counterpoint to steer the torrent, remembering to conserve breath the way sages conserve candle smoke in cathedrals. <words>265</words>
Pages birthed phrases that mapped winds, tides, and lullabies for children still unborn in cities floating below the stratosphere. <words>284</words>
Each phrase hardened into a compass blade, pointing toward concerts yet to happen between tomorrow's vanishing stars. <words>301</words>
But the factoryâ€™s gears began craving more syllables than my bookmark contained, and metallic hunger rattled through shafts like broken timpani. <words>322</words>
If I stayed, it would chew language into silence, ruining the mission to preserve musical traditions for drifting civilizations. <words>341</words>
Therefore I severed the coolant pipes, sculpting new paths for ink to escape skyward in shimmering jets that spelled fugues. <words>361</words>
The factory collapsed with a melodious sigh, releasing sheets that fluttered around me like silver leaves, each one humming my discontent into hope. <words>384</words>
Riding the inky updraft, I tucked a newborn page behind my ear, a makeshift bookmark until new storms gift me another. <words>405</words>
I soar again, feral yet focused, an effortlessly complicated melody chasing the hush that falls after every leaf finishes its song. <words>426</words>
