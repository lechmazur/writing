All records agreed that the golden age glimmered without shadow, yet Evren the archivist doubted even daylight. <words>17</words>
Tasked with cataloging the giant's workshop, he tiptoed between anvils tall as towers and gears wider than plazas. <words>35</words>
Every ledger he touched felt brittle, as though precedents had broken their own spines to hide uncomfortable truths. <words>53</words>
Such broken precedents whispered like cracked bells, and Evren, unsure yet listening, copied the echoes into cautious annotations. <words>71</words>
Precision, his mentor once insisted, could be playful if you balanced on its edges rather than marched its straight line. <words>91</words>
So Evren adopted a precisely playful script, mixing marginal riddles with measured numerals that only the patient could decode. <words>110</words>
Still, his hands trembled whenever he weighed the empty coin purse chained beside the great register of tributes. <words>128</words>
The purse had once sung with minted gratitude, but now its silence financed suspicion. <words>142</words>
Why would giants labor without pay during an era advertised as unending prosperity? <words>155</words>
To solve that riddle, Evren decided he must unmask the workshop itself. <words>167</words>
Blueprints revealed a labyrinth's path carved onto the floor beneath scattered sawdust, its spirals aligning with forgotten doorways. <words>185</words>
Following the pattern of the labyrinth's path, he stepped in measured curves, letting the giant machinery pivot around him like polite planets. <words>207</words>
Each turn lit previously unlit corners where tiny cobalt flames flickered, sparks awaiting cultivation. <words>221</words>
Evren understood his true motivation: to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners until fractured beauty stitched itself whole. <words>240</words>
He fed the flames with shavings of abandoned blueprints, and the workshop walls shimmered, projecting histories that had been suppressed. <words>260</words>
Gigantic holograms of earlier artisans appeared, their hands blistered, their pockets as hollow as the coin purse he carried. <words>279</words>
They spoke in silent light, showing how the golden age had been wrought by unpaid patience rather than equitable promise. <words>299</words>
Precedents had been broken indeed, not to advance freedom, but to conceal exploitation under layers of gilded propaganda. <words>317</words>
The fractured beauty of that revelation shattered Evren's remaining uncertainty, yet from the shards he shaped resolve. <words>334</words>
He rewrote the archive so each playful annotation carried the weight of testimony, each riddle an accusation. <words>351</words>
Then he sounded the workshop's bronze siren, calling giants and apprentices alike to witness the holographic tribunal. <words>368</words>
Faces, some carved in marble authority and others chiseled by fatigue, watched the unfolding chronicle shimmer across the vaulted ceiling. <words>388</words>
When the final illusion revealed the empty coin purse hovering like a mute indictment, silence rippled through gargantuan lungs. <words>407</words>
Evren unmasked himself next, admitting his former complicity in recording only convenient victories. <words>420</words>
Yet he offered the renewed archive as a lantern, urging the workshop to reforge its age not in gold but in fairness. <words>442</words>
Through that precisely playful candor, sparks swelled into steady light, illuminating corridors once hidden by prosperity's glare. <words>459</words>
And throughout the golden age that followed, no ledger dared forget the day an unsure archivist became curator of truth. <words>479</words>
