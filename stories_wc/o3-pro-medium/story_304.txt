The baroque asteroid of Larkhengh hovered between broken moons, its gilded spires shimmering with borrowed starlight.<words>16</words>
Pilgrims trudged along the unforgiving road etched into its obsidian crust, trading prayers for oxygen.<words>31</words>
Among them drifted Caras Mai, a lurking assassin disguised beneath the saffron robes of penance.<words>46</words>
Her contract dictated a single shot, yet her private vow sought to cradle the dawn in trembling hands.<words>64</words>
Both missions aimed at the same target: Counselor Rhun, oracle of vacuum and tyrant of sunrise tariffs.<words>81</words>
Rhun traveled only at dusk, trusting that night would hide his debts.<words>93</words>
Caras studied him through a paint-splattered camera lens scavenged from a derelict propaganda drone.<words>107</words>
The random droplets of color refracted station lights, rendering every image halved between carnival and autopsy.<words>123</words>
From such fractured visions she mapped his route like reading prophecy via the pattern of a spider's web after rain.<words>143</words>
Each filament of possibility told her he would exit the basilica square precisely when the bus driver completes the final route.<words>164</words>
Predictive arithmetic felt superficially profound, like ornate scripture carved solely to dazzle idle tourists.<words>178</words>
Yet Caras trusted aesthetics more than numbers; beauty seldom lied about where blood would next blossom.<words>194</words>
She mounted the crumbling colonnade overlooking the transit yard, pulse syncing with the planetary hymns piping from gargoyles.<words>212</words>
Rhun emerged below, flanked by accountants who wore armor lacquered in unpaid invoices.<words>225</words>
One of them began to laugh, mocking beggars who polished the curb with their knees.<words>240</words>
The sound ricocheted off cherub-faced domes, giving cruelty a tinkling music-box timbre.<words>252</words>
Caras centered Rhun in the scratched reticule, finger grazing the chilled trigger like a lover's doubt.<words>268</words>
Then she hesitated, remembering dawns she had missed while serving darker suns.<words>280</words>
The pilgrims below unrolled glass blankets to catch the first light they believed Rhun repressed.<words>295</words>
To honor their hope, she needed him gone, yet death alone felt insufficiently radiant.<words>309</words>
She adjusted the aperture, letting the paint-splatter smear Rhun's outline into kaleidoscopic shards.<words>322</words>
The trigger clicked, not to fire, but to capture a final image.<words>334</words>
She transmitted it onto every stained window, turning his living face into stained glass that shattered under collective stones.<words>353</words>
The accountants fled; Rhun bled doubt, not blood, as worshipers closed around him like dawn taking shape.<words>370</words>
Caras slipped into the procession, palms upward, and felt the newborn light settle there, fragile but alive.<words>387</words>
Somewhere behind her, the shattered lens glittered like obsolete prophecy, while pilgrims, assassin, and sky together awaited the bus home.<words>407</words>
