Evening mist coiled through the disused railway station overgrown with ivy, where Lysander Pell, a dreamy poet renowned for being formally rebellious, awaited a summons he could not name.<words>29</words>
The lampless platforms echoed with ghosts of departures, yet the hush felt densely alive, as if utterance here would break an eggshell sky.<words>52</words>
Clutched against his chest was a tarnished brass sundial, warm despite the autumn air, its gnomon pointing unwaveringly eastward like an accusing finger.<words>75</words>
That brass relic had arrived two nights earlier, compelling him via cryptic shapes in the wax seal of an unopened letter he still dared not break.<words>101</words>
Even unbroken, the seal whispered in symbols only a poet who misbehaved with meter could decipher, each curve urging haste and each notch vowing peril.<words>126</words>
Lysander had followed the riddles east through shuttered villages, and now, after the last riddle is solved, the sundial's breathless warmth told him he was on time.<words>153</words>
He set the dial upon the platform's crumbling edge, aligning it with moonlight instead of sun, an inversion that felt like rhyming night with light.<words>178</words>
Stone groaned beneath ivy roots, and a hidden trapdoor parted, exhaling dust thick with the scent of forgotten tickets and lilies laid on lost luggage.<words>203</words>
From below climbed Mara Vale, archivist of memories no one recalls, her grey eyes carrying galaxies of unlived days, her voice a reed trembling in wind.<words>229</words>
He loved her once in childhood, before the town recorded erasures, and now his motive sharpened: to stand by the unremembered, starting with the woman history mislaid.<words>256</words>
Mara produced a slim dossier, its pages blank until moonbeams grazed them, whereupon sentences of pale fire described a delicate undoing that only rebels dressed in protocol could survive.<words>285</words>
She explained that the sundial measured not hours but collective amnesia; when its warmth cooled, every face without a statue would vanish forever from recollection.<words>310</words>
To halt the cooling they must compel the station itself to remember, inscribing verse into its iron pillars so rhythmically bold that rust would echo with identity.<words>337</words>
Lysander, whose formally rebellious stanzas twisted sonnets into spirals, began chiseling syllables: 'We are the silhouettes your lamplight forgot, we are the breath behind broken clocks'.<words>363</words>
Mara traced each fresh letter with ivy sap, sealing the verse into metal the way the unopened letter's wax had sealed instructions, circle within circle, secret within secret.<words>391</words>
When the final couplet rang across the tracks, the sundial cooled, not into forgetfulness but into rest, its brass now mirroring Mara's face and all the nameless behind her.<words>420</words>
Around them the ivy stirred like applause, and the station lights, dead for decades, flickered to life, casting quietly intense halos upon records that began rewriting themselves in silver ink.<words>450</words>
