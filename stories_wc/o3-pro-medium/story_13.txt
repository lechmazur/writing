Dust spiraled around the toppled clock tower where Master Argall kept his eccentric magician's laboratory.<words>15</words>
Inside, a solemn swordsman crossed the crooked threshold with mild fervor guiding his steady breath.<words>30</words>
He had come not to duel but to localize secrets that might chart life's silent mutations.<words>46</words>
Refusing to trust memories while shifting sands erase footprints outside, he relied on recorded clues.<words>61</words>
Argall, functionally dysfunctional after an alchemical accident split his mind into orderly and chaotic halves, awaited him.<words>78</words>
The orderly half spoke first, offering a basic wooden box sealed with four waxen sigils.<words>93</words>
The chaotic half only laughed, scattering curled parchment like petals caught in a storm.<words>107</words>
Each parchment bore a poem, its lines pointing toward hidden coordinates beyond the crumbling tower.<words>122</words>
Together they formed a trail of poems leading to a secret garden Argall called the Genarium.<words>138</words>
There, the swordsman believed, bloomed garden wisdom capable of tracking evolutionary changes in every petal and thorn.<words>155</words>
But first the poems had to be read in sequence, each stanza unlocking a latch on the box.<words>173</words>
Argall's orderly tongue recited the opening verse, yet his chaotic half twisted the meter midline.<words>188</words>
The swordsman interjected, tempering the discord with motions of his blade that sliced dust, not flesh.<words>204</words>
Rhythm restored, the second latch clicked, and faint jasmine fragrances drifted from the wooden seams.<words>219</words>
Outside, desert gusts whispered warnings, but the tower's shattered gears chimed like brass cicadas ignoring the storm.<words>236</words>
Third and fourth verses spoke of chlorophyll dreams and fossil aches, clicking open the remaining sigils.<words>252</words>
Inside the box lay a compass of living vine, its needle bending toward the poem-lined exit.<words>268</words>
The swordsman followed as sheets fluttered ahead, arranging themselves on fallen stairs like luminous stepping-stones.<words>283</words>
Argall stayed, fearing the sands, but handed over a pocketwatch whose hands spun counter to time's flow.<words>300</words>
Beyond the doorway, dunes shifted, erasing footprints almost before they formed, yet the parchment path glowed.<words>316</words>
With every erased step, the compass grew another leaf, marking adaptation in real time.<words>330</words>
He realized he was not merely tracking evolutionary changes; he was catalyzing them through observation.<words>345</words>
Such power sobered even his mild fervor, sharpening it into solemn promise.<words>357</words>
At last, the secret garden arose within a hollow of stone, green despite the devouring desert.<words>373</words>
Vines parted, revealing flowers shaped like ancient gears, each petal inscribed with future genomes waiting to unfold.<words>390</words>
He knelt, planted the living compass at the garden's heart, and felt the world localize around its growing axis.<words>409</words>
Behind him, the parchment trail dissolved into soil, sealing the Genarium until evolution required another solemn seeker.<words>426</words>
The swordsman rose, understanding that wisdom, like footprints in sand, survives only by endlessly transforming.<words>441</words>
