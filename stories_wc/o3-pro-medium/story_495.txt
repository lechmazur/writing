Within the folds of spacetime, I patrol the mechanical bird sanctuary, feathers ticking like tiny clocks.<words>16</words>
The Board hired me as a guardian, yet I guard begrudgingly, resenting every rule that rivets me in place.<words>35</words>
Visitors call me dangerously friendly, because my smile gleams while my eyes search for the nearest exit.<words>52</words>
I once baked bread for festivals, wielding a rustic bread paddle like a conductor's baton, stirring ovens into song.<words>71</words>
But joy burnt away when society praised efficiency over aroma, replacing hearths with sterile nutrient paste dispensers.<words>88</words>
Now I feed clockwork sparrows instead of children, winding them at dawn and listening to gears chirp of lost mornings.<words>108</words>
Last week, twelve postcards arrived, each depicting an unnamed island where horizons melt like watercolor and bread rises without yeast.<words>128</words>
No stamp, no sender—only faint sugar-scented sand embedded in the paper.<words>139</words>
The postcards whispered when heated over the sanctuary’s exhaust vents, so I began analyzing their murmurs, searching for cracks in my cage.<words>161</words>
Each night I illustrate their visions on discarded maintenance blueprints, sketching beaches where mechanical birds molt gears and grow feathers.<words>181</words>
Ink flows like sorrow, yet the shapes sparkle with outlawed hope, and the paper hums beneath my trembling knuckles.<words>200</words>
I notice a pattern: every drawn shoreline aligns with the sanctuary’s ventilation schematics, forming a map only grief can read.<words>220</words>
The revelation startles the birds, whose brass wings clang approval, echoing across gears like bells celebrating forbidden weddings.<words>238</words>
Tomorrow, the inspectors will arrive to audit smiles and oil levels, measuring loyalty in cubic centimeters.<words>254</words>
So tonight I swing the rustic bread paddle once more, prying loose floor grates as if coaxing crust from an old loaf.<words>276</words>
Steam sighs upward, revealing a corridor that glows with postcard colors, impossible blues and wistful oranges.<words>292</words>
The birds line the railings, dangerously friendly, offering beak clicks and cog whirs like cheers for a reluctant hero.<words>311</words>
I tuck the illustrated blueprints beneath my coat, step into the passage, and feel the sanctuary's alarms stall in confusion.<words>331</words>
Time slackens; gears drip seconds like honey, and the corridor lengthens into the very folds of spacetime.<words>348</words>
At its end stands a shoreline identical to my sketches, waves humming the melody of ovens I was told to forget.<words>369</words>
Here, mechanical gulls unclip their rivets, becoming flesh mid-flight, and I unstrap my bitterness like a broken apron.<words>387</words>
I taste salt and phantom sourdough, and for the first time the flavor doesn't apologize for itself.<words>404</words>
Society's grip rusts behind me, each corroded law falling like crumbs for the sanctuary cats to gnaw.<words>421</words>
Joy returns not as a roar but as quiet dough expanding, promising morning loaves shared without permission.<words>438</words>
I walk the beach toward an oven-shaped sunrise, the birds escorting me with metallic lullabies and hopeful sparks.<words>456</words>
Behind us, the corridor seals, illustrating in silence that freedom, once sketched, may finally be lived.<words>472</words>
