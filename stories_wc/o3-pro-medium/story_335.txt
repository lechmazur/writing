Rauan, a shaky mercenary, slid between fractured pews as twilight dripped like candle wax.<words>14</words>
The collapsed cathedral turned street artist’s haven quivered with aerosol ghosts and fluorescent prayer.<words>28</words>
He was here not for murals but for a chunk of amber with a trapped spider.<words>44</words>
Rumor whispered it pulsed like a miniature sun, mapping secret futures in its fossilized thorax.<words>59</words>
Rauan believed such futures could let him finalize the long ledger of people he had broken.<words>75</words>
To make peace with the past, he needed a certifiable omen, not another bullet.<words>89</words>
His gait remained carefully reckless, like a dancer counting cracks before each step.<words>102</words>
Above, shattered stained glass caught the moon and flung kaleidoscopic wounds onto the rubble.<words>116</words>
Somewhere within those color bruises hid the prize and the silence he craved.<words>129</words>
He followed directions gathered through improbable rumor chains that stretched from seaside dive bars to desert caravans.<words>146</words>
Each teller claimed the amber spider sang if the hour was hollow enough.<words>159</words>
Tonight, during the slow fade of an echoing hour, the cathedral seemed emptier than death.<words>174</words>
Rauan inhaled the echo as one might sip sacramental wine, shivering on the swallow.<words>188</words>
Then a can rattled, rolling like a sermon down the nave.<words>199</words>
A teenage muralist emerged, paint smeared as war paint, eyes wide at the armed intruder.<words>214</words>
She guarded a makeshift altar built from spray cans and the coveted amber sat atop it.<words>230</words>
The spider inside glimmered, legs forever poised between escape and eternity.<words>241</words>
Rauan raised his trembling hands, surrender and demand braided in one gesture of improbable longing.<words>256</words>
“I need it,” he whispered, the words wobbling like faulty triggers.<words>267</words>
The girl shrugged, recognizing desperation deeper than graffiti, and struck a bargain inked in spray.<words>282</words>
She would surrender the amber if he promised the cathedral new color at dawn.<words>296</words>
Rauan, once an artist before gunfire rewrote his résumé, agreed.<words>306</words>
He cradled the warm resin, feeling the trapped spider thrum like a captive memory.<words>320</words>
Visions flickered: villages he’d burned, comrades abandoned, a brother left under winter mud.<words>333</words>
Each image hovered, then folded into amber hues, not erased but archived.<words>345</words>
He understood the omen wasn’t absolution; it was a ledger’s final line inviting signature.<words>359</words>
Come dawn, he would repaint these walls, covering wounds with stories, leaving scars visible beneath translucence.<words>375</words>
That was as close to peace as a carefully reckless life could purchase.<words>388</words>
He slipped the amber into his pocket, the echoing hour exhaling its last, and left.<words>403</words>
Outside, sirens painted distant chords, but Rauan felt something finally still within the trembling.<words>417</words>
The spider did not sing, yet the silence sounded like the unknown he had always searched.<words>433</words>
And for the first time, searching for the unknown felt less like running and more like arriving.<words>450</words>
