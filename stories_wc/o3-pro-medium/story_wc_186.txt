Salt winds swept across the ruined coast, moaning through ribs of fallen towers like flutes carved from bone. [18]  
In that salted air stood Lioh, the beacon-tower custodian, last keeper of lights no ships remained to see. [36]  
He lived in the glass humming pavilion crowning the collapsed promontory, its panes singing when the tide punched the cliffs beneath. [57]  
The age was reckoned as after the collapse of civilization, a phrase mouthed with weary irony by survivors who remembered letters. [78]  
Yet Lioh was retrocognitively blessed; memories not his own drifted into him on dreams like gulls returning to unbuilt nests. [98]  
Through those alien recollections he knew the tower once turned night into pathways, and he longed to rekindle that impossible brightness. [119]  
His workshop was cluttered with salvaged lenses, but the heart-piece, a broken crystal prism, lay shattered on a velvet map. [139]  
More troubling still, the longest fragment carried within it a soundlessness so thick it bruised the ears, known among elders as a shard of hush. [164]  
The elders warned such hush might swallow whatever voice tried to pierce it, but Lioh treasured the fragment the way seeds treasure storms. [187]  
He believed coincidences were messages scribbled by lost gods, and he meant to prove that coincidences have meaning before his lamp went out. [210]  
So each dusk he scaled the spiral stairs to the roof, where an antique astrolabe waited beneath gull-feather tarps. [229]  
With patient fingers he unwrapped it, traced tarnished brass lines, and plotted new alignments by tracking star paths invisible to ordinary sight. [251]  
The sky after ruin pulsed with unfamiliar constellations, yet the prism shards glimmered when certain points converged, as if memory itself were luminous dust. [275]  
On the seventy-third evening a pale geometry unfolded, matching exactly a pattern he had dreamed of a drowned library corridor. [295]  
Taking this for coincidence, he set the largest shard of hush within the broken crystal prism, aligning fractures with the sky's new veins. [318]  
Instantly the pavilion hummed a lower harmony, glass walls trembling like chimes in a burial wind, yet the soundless shard drank half the resonance. [342]  
Lioh feared the hush would consume the last notes, but a filament of song remained, delicate as thistle-blown hope. [361]  
He knelt, cupped that tremor with his palms, and felt images flood him, not forward, but backward, histories running like reversed rivers. [383]  
He saw the tower's first ignition when merchant fleets still jeweled the horizon; he saw lovers carve their initials on sun-warmed rails. [405]  
He saw a boy drop a coin that rolled against the prism and tilted its axis just enough to save a stormbound ship. [428]  
There, in that small accident, sat the secret he chased: the world was stitched from errant gestures that later proved deliberate. [449]  
When the vision ebbed, the prism cracked further, splitting the hush into slivers that hovered like dark snow around the room. [470]  
Each sliver recorded a coincidence: a leaf landing on a trigger wire a breath early, a sneeze delaying a firing squad, a laugh quenching despair. [495]  
If he could braid those slivers into the beacon, he believed the sea-folk scattered along the gulf would feel purpose stirring again. [517]  
Exhausted, he descended the staircase carrying the prism's frame, shards orbiting his shoulders like patient satellites. [533]  
In the machinery chamber, corroded gears snarled with salt, but he oiled them with melted candle tallow and sang the filament's faint melody. [556]  
One by one the slivers embedded themselves among the cogs, each aligning when a certain note matched its own frozen moment of chance. [579]  
When the final piece settled, a hush deeper than silence washed through the tower, then reversed, becoming a low dawn-colored hum. [600]  
Light blossomed from the beacon, not blinding but warm, and its pulses traced the same star paths he had charted above. [621]  
Far on the black waves, homemade rafts paused, their ragged crews lifting eyes as the hope colored the foam mauve and silver. [643]  
Some wept without knowing why, feeling only that random currents now described a sentence addressed to them and signed by tomorrow. [664]  
Above, Lioh watched the prism glow, its cracks no longer wounds but windows, and understood at last his longing had been reciprocal. [686]  
He did not know whether civilization would return, yet he felt the world lean slightly toward the rekindled beam, as though grateful. [708]  
And in that lean, in that barely measurable tilt of destiny, he found proof enough that coincidences have meaning, and always did. [730]
