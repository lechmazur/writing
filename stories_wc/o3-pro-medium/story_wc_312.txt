Mist clung to the sapphire viaduct at dawn, painting its stones a patient blue. [14]  
There, a lukewarm mage named Orin waited, palms trembling with brittle devotion. [26]  
Orin was earnestly naive, believing the universe could be mended like cracked pottery. [39]  
Yet he had chosen this arching bridge for a reason no master would mock. [53]  
Below, tides sighed; above, constellations faded, as though the sky withheld its verdict. [66]  
All fishing barges had already docked, and after the last fish is caught, silence rules. [81]  
That hush was the appointed hour for balancing cosmic ledgers. [91]  
Strapped to Orin's belt swung a broken ship's bell, scavenged from a wreck long swallowed by kelp. [108]  
The bell could no longer ring, but its silence was precisely what the imbalance demanded. [123]  
Centuries ago, sailors had begged that bell for mercy during storms, investing it with terrified hope. [139]  
Hope, when fractured, becomes heavy enough to tilt the stars. [149]  
Orin aimed to rebuild the bell's purpose, not its metal, and thus lighten the heavens again. [165]  
His spellbook offered no diagrams, so he turned to water, the oldest metronome. [178]  
By understanding dripping rates, he believed he could translate minutes into harmonics the cosmos might heed. [194]  
He uncorked a clay flask and suspended it above the viaduct's central keystone. [207]  
Droplets fell, each splash marking a beat that echoed inside the cracked bell below. [221]  
At first, nothing more than puddles formed. [228]  
Then the impossible began showing its plausible edges. [236]  
The broken rim shimmered, hinting at seams that could remember how to resonate. [249]  
Orin knelt, whispering apologies to every drowned sailor whose prayers had cracked the bronze. [263]  
His voice shook, because brittle devotion vibrates strangely when close to fulfillment. [275]  
Somewhere beyond dawn's pale light, a gull screamed, as if to test the coming chord. [290]  
According to legend, only a perfect drop sequence would awaken the bell without shattering it completely. [306]  
Orin counted aloud, letting numbers steady his shaking fingers. [315]  
One, the bell quivered; two, the viaduct hummed; three, the tides below reversed for a breath. [331]  
Those ripples warned him the universe was listening now. [340]  
He dared not be lukewarm anymore, yet his magic answered only in tepid waves. [354]  
So he poured the last of the flask, abandoning calculation for trust. [366]  
Water roared through hairline cracks, filling the bell with a mirror of the dawn sky. [381]  
For an aching heartbeat, Orin feared he had merely drowned another relic. [393]  
Then the bell rang, not with sound, but with absence of weight. [405]  
His knees lifted off the stones as gravity forgot its manners. [416]  
Below, fish rose out of the sea, hovering like silver lanterns that realized nets were nightmares. [432]  
Orin understood the spectacle signaled a cosmic ledger shifting back toward zero. [444]  
Yet equilibrium is fragile, especially when maintained by one mage's earnest mistake. [456]  
The waters he had borrowed from the flask now began to search for somewhere to belong. [472]  
Droplets seeped from the hovering fish, from Orin's boots, even from the stones themselves. [486]  
They converged toward the bell, threatening to drown its newfound levity. [497]  
Understanding dripping rates had guided him here; now he needed to reverse the arithmetic. [511]  
He raised his sleeve and let sweat fall into the bell, offering something of himself. [526]  
The bell accepted the gift, glowing warmer, until lukewarm matched Orin, mage and metal in accord. [542]  
Fish drifted downward, splashing safely into their tides, none the wiser about mathematics. [555]  
The viaduct sighed as gravity remembered its post, though a playful lightness lingered in the arches. [571]  
Orin unclasped the bell and set it beside the keystone, no longer broken, merely open-ended. [586]  
Its mouth faced east, waiting to sip the next dawn rather than swallow prayers. [600]  
Tired but bright, Orin realized that rebuilding sometimes means teaching things how to break more gently. [616]  
That gentle breaking, he sensed, was the safest form of devotion the cosmos would ever permit. [632]  
Breath held, he listened for imbalance, but heard only the slow dripping of a perfect morning. [648]  
He smiled, earnestly naive still, yet wiser about what lukewarm hearts can do after the last fish is caught. [667]  
Somehow, that seemed a fair bargain between plausible and impossible. [677]
