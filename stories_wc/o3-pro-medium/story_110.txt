<story>
Between chapters of his own life, Marcel swept sawdust from the water clock repair shop.<words>15</words>
Customers presumed him an amiable tinkerer, never suspecting the hidden assassin polishing gears behind the counter.<words>31</words>
He cultivated a quietly flamboyant aura, bright scarves fluttering yet voices always whispering around him.<words>46</words>
Mystery, like sawdust, settled into domestic corners where cuckoos struck noon and sorrow ticked on brass.<words>62</words>
Marcel adored such corners; they held the pinprick shadows necessary for immaculate murder.<words>75</words>
Nevertheless, he had postponed contracts because grief currently occupied his trigger finger.<words>87</words>
Last week his sister, the only soul he dared adore, had died of unsolved causes.<words>102</words>
Police called it natural; Marcel heard gears grinding in that lie.<words>113</words>
Now he planned to transmute pain into a masterpiece of revelation, blade, and whirring timepieces.<words>128</words>
Blueprints fluttered over the counter like tragic origami birds, each fold identifying a suspect household gesture.<words>144</words>
He would investigate through bleak eulogies that mention hidden truths, delivered at neighborly dinners.<words>158</words>
Grief-struck spouses invited him to speak because his sorrow wore polite velvet gloves.<words>171</words>
Inside each speech he buried clockmaker metaphors, ticking clues that clinked like dropped screws.<words>185</words>
The audience laughed at his despairing humor, mistaking confession for comedy.<words>196</words>
Afterward, Marcel lingered beside a moss-covered lantern in every kitchen garden, recording which chuckles felt forced.<words>212</words>
Rust and moss masked fingerprints when he finally lifted the lantern to examine its base for poison residue.<words>230</words>
Clue by clue, domestic mysteries converged upon Monsieur Valette, a perfumer with inexplicably dead orchids.<words>245</words>
Marcel scheduled Valette's water clock for servicing, a courtesy nobody dared refuse.<words>257</words>
Between chapters of the day, while gears soaked in vinegar, assassin and perfumer sipped anemone tea.<words>273</words>
Their conversation dripped with floral puns until Marcel offered a bleak eulogy for his sister.<words>288</words>
He spoke of gears that stop midturn, of hearts that require clandestine lubrication, and of orchids weeping rust.<words>306</words>
Valette's cup rattled, spilling confession: the perfumer had harvested rare molds, accidentally brewing a lethal household vapor.<words>323</words>
He begged Marcel to keep the secret, offering barrels of scent worth kingdoms.<words>336</words>
Marcel, quietly flamboyant even in judgment, bowed like a tragic court jester and agreed.<words>350</words>
Then he redirected the shop's sluice, letting water clock weights drop a second earlier than designed.<words>366</words>
A hidden gear snapped, launching a spring-loaded camphor needle into Valette's throat, perfuming the final gasp.<words>382</words>
Marcel whispered another eulogy, this one bleak yet oddly grateful, unveiling the truth only the dead could appreciate.<words>400</words>
Pain had been transmuted into a masterpiece, its ticking punchline echoing through lantern light and leaking water.<words>417</words>
