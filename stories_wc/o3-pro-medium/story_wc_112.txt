Frost glazed the aluminum walkways of Research Station Auriga, the isolated xenobiology research station, painting the night with an icy warmth that stung yet soothed. [25]
Inside the geodesic dome, archived snowflakes hovered in suspension chambers, their fractal secrets hungry for someone who would listen. [44]
That someone was Maren Kestrel, the station's obliging sky mechanic, called down from upper struts whenever instruments shivered. [62]
Maren's hands were calloused and mechanically warm, as though wrench and circuit had replaced blood but left kindness intact. [81]
She maintained weather sails, solar orchids, and the great avian enclosures where exotic winged leviathans slept in centrifuged gravity. [100]
Within the hush of beating wings at rest, Maren felt the station breathe like a dormant lung awaiting dawn. [119]
Tonight, though, dawn would come sideways, if her calculations held. [129]
In the data garden, holographic star-lichens projected lattice shadows across her goggles, revealing the anomaly she chased for years. [148]
Temporal drift lines curved not forward but laterally, suggesting that time itself might move sideways, brushing adjacent presents like shelves. [168]
Maren's motivation was simple and incandescent: to prove that time moves sideways before official clocks erased her funding. [186]
Yet theory needed a lever, something that could pry reality open without shattering the sleeping creatures overhead. [203]
She found it in the archived maps of migrating magnosaurs, whose electromagnetic wakes converged at a magnetic nexus at twilight. [223]
If she could align that nexus above the dome, its twilight pulse might tilt the chronal lattice sideways enough to witness slip. [245]
Station protocol forbade manual alignment, but Maren was more heart than protocol. [257]
She signed the risk forms in disappearing ink and climbed the central spar where cryo-mist glittered like broken glass. [276]
Around her, specimen aviaries hummed with subdued awakenings, talons twitching in dream cycles nudged by the approaching field. [294]
The engineer opened a maintenance iris and entered the sky foundry, a cavity between outer hull and stars. [312]
There, turbines spun cold fire while holograms of pressure curves flickered; she navigated through holographic principles the way poets navigate silence. [333]
At the zenith platform, a bronze lever jutted beside the azimuth gyroscope, iced over from months of neglect. [351]
One decisive pull would swivel the station's dorsal fins, reorienting the atmospheric vents to match the nexus's magnetic vector. [370]
Maren wrapped her gloved fingers around the metal; it felt colder than frost yet throbbed with an undercurrent of entrusted warmth. [391]
She whispered apologies to the creatures below and to any future selves unsettled by what she was about to learn. [411]
Then she pulled the lever, and reality, obliging as she was, tilted. [423]
The dorsal fins groaned, aligning like tuning forks; outside, twilight draped the dome in violet sheets that rippled sideways. [442]
A resonant hum poured through the station, both chill and comforting, an icy warmth that threaded marrow and metal alike. [462]
Maren's visor filled with cascading timestamps: 02:15, 02:15, 02:15, each occupying a separate pane yet occurring together. [479]
She gasped as copies of her breath crystallized in staggered positions, silhouettes stacking like translucent pages of a flipbook. [498]
Time was not a river but a deck of cards fanned sideways, and she now stood between two barely separated moments. [519]
Below, the subdued awakenings intensified; leviathan wings twitched in overlapping rhythms, sensing multiple midnights brushing their pinions. [536]
Maren realized she had proven her thesis, but in doing so had unzipped the creatures' sense of rest, an ethical tear. [557]
She needed to stitch the deck closed before displaced instants lacerated the fragile biome they both occupied. [574]
Guided by holographic principles, she inverted the lever's polarity, rotating the fins and letting the nexus drift back toward the horizon. [595]
The timestamps merged; crystal breaths reabsorbed; the violet sheets folded neatly into a single dawn still waiting to arrive. [614]
A long exhale from every enclosure signaled that beating wings were again at rest, this time unshaken by temporal drafts. [634]
Maren locked the lever and downloaded the sidewise metric, a slender data plume that glowed with mechanically warm promise. [653]
Proof would survive even as the moment resumed its forward crawl, and no funding board could frost over that truth. [673]
Still, a shiver coursed through her as she contemplated the deck of cards, now closed, but forever aware of her fingerprints. [694]
She promised the sleeping leviathans that any future sideways journey would begin with their consent, not their unwitting heartbeat. [713]
Then, satisfied yet humbled, the obliging sky mechanic descended the spar, carrying icy warmth in her pockets like twin suns. [733]
Behind her, the research station glimmered beneath the magnetic stars, awaiting the next hush when beating wings might dream aloud. [753]
