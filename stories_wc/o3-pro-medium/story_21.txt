Cobwebs clung to the cracked pillars of the forgotten city hall, yet tonight its marble rotunda trembled amid drum circles that echoed like stubborn hearts refusing silence. <words>27</words>
Oro Bane, a measured diplomat known for abrasive calm, stepped inside with a single purpose stitched behind his tired eyes. <words>47</words>
He carried a fox tail tassel from a bandit who had murdered his sister, its burnt-orange strands still smelling of ash and old laughter. <words>71</words>
The trinket was both totem and warrant, a reminder of the price of revenge he had promised to pay only in truth. <words>93</words>
Yet rumors claimed the killer had become something impossibly new, an organically synthetic chimera encoded with stolen genes. <words>111</words>
Oro needed to decode genetic patterns left on that tassel, not for vengeance alone but to halt replication of the monster in other bodies. <words>135</words>
Guided by informants, he followed a breadcrumb trail of spilled reagents through the faint scent of must in a shuttered children's theater buried beneath city hall. <words>161</words>
There, amid sagging puppets, he found the drum circle's heartâ€”a glimmering bioreactor timed to each percussion strike, laughing in rhythmic jest at mortal limits. <words>185</words>
A holographic visage of the bandit flickered above, half flesh, half circuitry, greeting him with a bow that dripped mock courtesy. <words>206</words>
The murderer explained that he had transcribed his consciousness into recombinant code, financing the project by peddling organs harvested from protest singers. <words>228</words>
He invited Oro to join the venture, offering the diplomat a share of immortality in exchange for diplomatic immunity. <words>247</words>
Oro, schooled in treaties where every pen stroke weighed lives, recognized another contract inked with screams, and his voice surfaced like steel in velvet. <words>271</words>
He proposed a counteroffer: a parley inside the bioreactor's feedback loop, pretending eagerness while secretly uploading the tassel's lingering DNA to corrupt the system. <words>295</words>
The bandit agreed, pride blinding him, and their avatars merged within swirling code scented with childhood dust and carousel paint. <words>315</words>
Oro released a silent algorithm that inverted the recombinant matrix, making every strand reference the bandit's original mortality, not his stolen improvements. <words>337</words>
The drums outside quickened, sensing catastrophe, while the hologram spasmed, aging decades with each digital heartbeat. <words>353</words>
Before dissolution, the bandit gasped that revenge always collects double interest, and his collapse scattered voxels across the puppets like confetti of failure. <words>376</words>
Oro felt neither triumph nor sorrow, only the measured diplomat's calculus; he had paid the price of revenge, and now owed his own receipt. <words>400</words>
The bioreactor died, but its final data shard glowed with insight that might decode genetic patterns for diseases, should Oro dare lift it. <words>423</words>
He pocketed the shard beside the fox tail tassel, and walked into the drum circles holding vengeance in one hand and future medicine in the other. <words>449</words>
