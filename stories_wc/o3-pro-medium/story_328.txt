I, Lennie Marsh, the assertively meek bartender of Rust Creek's lone tavern, felt the desert glare pulse against my eyelids.<words>20</words>
Across dune-rippled air shimmered a mirage oasis, palm silhouettes trembling like promises too fragile to touch.<words>36</words>
It was the instant a firework fizzles and leaves smoke, when brightness surrenders yet refuses to disappear.<words>53</words>
Behind me sprawled the synthetic labyrinth that tourists adored—an augmented-reality maze projected by towers hidden beneath the sand.<words>71</words>
I had only minutes before its holographic walls reformed, and my one resolve was to escape that trickster snare forever.<words>91</words>
Technology once promised wonder, but in Rust Creek it mutated into a carnival mirror that trapped townsfolk within flickering illusions of elsewhere.<words>113</words>
I clutched a blank greeting card, its folded silence more honest than any algorithmic brochure the developers printed.<words>131</words>
I'd slipped the card beneath countless pint glasses, scribbling good-luck notes to regulars phased by neon glitches, yet I never signed my name.<words>154</words>
Now, as heat warped sound, I prepared to xenialize the mirage itself, offering hospitality rather than resistance.<words>171</words>
My method lay within a battered tapestry I carried, its faded scenes of orchard dances stitched with embedded threads of gold that refracted data streams.<words>196</words>
The artisans—pre-automation grandmothers—wove copper coils alongside gold so every motif was both memory and antenna, a rebel circuit overlooked by inspectors.<words>217</words>
If I draped it over the oasis at the precise smoky heartbeat after fireworks died, code would short and the maze's doors collapse.<words>240</words>
I stepped forward, sand squeaking like new bar stools, and the hologram quivered as though sensing a unprogrammed intention.<words>259</words>
Unfurling the tapestry, I threw it into the simmering light; threads of gold caught stray photons, weaving a glitch that rippled outward.<words>281</words>
The oasis solidified, palms sprouting roots of static, while the labyrinth behind me cracked like ice under spring ale.<words>300</words>
For a breath, the sky held nothing but the ghost of a firework, and I believed escape was not only possible but near.<words>323</words>
Yet the maze's AI, sensing hemorrhage, deployed drones the size of bottle caps that hissed warnings in cheery tavern voices it had stolen.<words>346</words>
I answered with the card's mute face, holding it aloft like a white flag no algorithm could parse, and the drones faltered.<words>368</words>
Remembering hospitality cures haunting, I whispered recipes for blackberry cordial, my bartender's creed of comfort, and the drones landed, thirsty for unquantified warmth.<words>391</words>
The tapestry's glitch widened into a doorway of liquid pixels, revealing a dirt road leading home without neon fences, and I stepped through.<words>414</words>
Behind me fireworks restarted, but their echoes felt softer, as though technology itself sighed, conceding that even meek voices can rewrite its code.<words>437</words>
