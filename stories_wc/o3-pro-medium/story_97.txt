In the cradle of a whispered minute, an unstable dimension fluttered like a candle in cosmic wind.<words>17</words>
Within its flicker lived Talyra, a fact-minded oracle who recorded quanta as calmly as others breathe.<words>33</words>
Her tone was always optimistic desperation, the voice of someone measuring doom only so hope could be graphed.<words>51</words>
She owned one relic: a brass compass whose needle spun according to sorrow rather than magnetism.<words>67</words>
Whenever heartbreak rippled somewhere, the compass clicked, and Talyra saw paths unfolding via heartbreak-induced visions.<words>82</words>
These visions demanded she recompose reality like torn music, assembling notes until they sang of empathy.<words>98</words>
Yet each repaired melody revealed another silent ruin, urging her to wander further to find forgotten places.<words>115</words>
So she wandered, desperately casual in appearance, coat unbuttoned, data tablets dangling beside wildflowers she catalogued.<words>131</words>
Casual, yes, but desperation pooled behind her eyes, where every statistic corresponded to a broken heartbeat.<words>147</words>
One day the compass spun so violently that metallic shrieks braided with light, cleaving the dimension open.<words>164</words>
A corridor of blue ash stretched before her, mapping a route only pain could have remembered.<words>180</words>
Talyra stepped through, the doorway sealing behind like a sigh unfinished.<words>191</words>
Inside, time looped erratically, seconds repeating, then leaping centuries, until measurement itself begged for mercy.<words>206</words>
She anchored her mind by reciting prime numbers, the oracle's lullaby, and watched memories rain upward.<words>222</words>
The rain coalesced into children forgotten by history, each carrying a fragment of the same shattered lullaby.<words>239</words>
Their silence was heavier than planets, but their eyes pointed along the path to empathy she sought.<words>256</words>
Following their gaze, she found a fault-line where grief vibrated like harp strings, half-tuned, half-waiting.<words>271</words>
If she could recompose those trembling notes, the corridor might become a bridge instead of a wound.<words>288</words>
She laid the brass compass on the dimension's fault and whispered the statistical average of all goodbyes recorded.<words>306</words>
The needle stilled, pointing not north but inward, toward a single heartbeat echoing inside every forgotten child.<words>323</words>
Light spilled, shaping corridors into gardens where memories could rest instead of roam.<words>336</words>
Talyra realized the children were not travelers but seeds, waiting for terrain soft enough to dream.<words>352</words>
She knelt, touched the ground, and felt her own heartbreak recur, a necessary chord completing the soil.<words>369</words>
With that chord the dimension stabilized, locking its flutter into a gentle hum synchronous with her pulse.<words>386</words>
Garden paths branched outward, leading to every place memory had misplaced, inviting wanderers as instructors of compassion.<words>403</words>
The children burst into laughter, each note a coordinate only the newly empathetic could interpret.<words>418</words>
Talyra smiled, her desperately casual coat now embroidered with constellations charting destinations she no longer feared.<words>434</words>
For the first time, the brass compass rested quiet, because the path to empathy had become obvious.<words>451</words>
And in that whispered minute, Talyra finally paused, not to measure, but to marvel.<words>465</words>
