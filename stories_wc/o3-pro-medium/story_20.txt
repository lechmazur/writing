I arrived at the inverted waterfall by mistake, an unplanned stop at a roadside attraction that maps refused to name.<words>20</words>
The water spiraled upward like silver snakes, letting the canyon floor remain cracked and thirsty under the slow dance of celestial bodies overhead.<words>43</words>
I felt passionately disinterested, as though awe itself were an obligation I had already served.<words>58</words>
My bow hung across my back, reminder of tournaments lost and targets narrowly missed, marking me a disappointed archer among tourists with phones.<words>81</words>
I sought purpose now only in ink, traveling to chronicle social movements swelling across provinces like storms that preferred banners to thunder.<words>103</words>
A vendor beneath a quartz overhang displayed relics dredged from the river above the sky, and a tarnished silver comb caught my eye.<words>126</words>
Its teeth were bent like tired arrows, and I bought it, feeling the faint tug of some forgotten target.<words>145</words>
The vendor whispered that anyone who brushed memory there would find the Bridge of Regret.<words>160</words>
Curiosity, my oldest adversary, aimed my steps along a path of obsidian slabs slick with ascending mist.<words>177</words>
Soon the roar of upward currents faded, replaced by a hush so anxiously calm it trembled inside my ribs.<words>196</words>
There, suspended between two cliffs, stretched a translucent archway woven from liquid glass, glimmering like regret made architecture.<words>214</words>
I understood it was the bridge's nature to carry only those unwilling to cross.<words>228</words>
My reflection hovered upon it, arrow nocked though my quiver was empty, challenging me to confront the record I intended to write.<words>250</words>
Had I really left the range to study movements, or merely to catalogue them safely from afar, never risking a shot again?<words>272</words>
The tarnished comb grew warm, urging me to smooth the snarled strands of the past.<words>287</words>
I drew it through my hair, and suddenly the inverted waterfall hushed entirely, as if the cosmos had paused their waltz to listen.<words>310</words>
Images flooded—the marches in Amber City, the sit-ins on floating barges, the night protesters painted constellations on police shields.<words>329</words>
I had witnessed them all, yet released no arrow of narrative that might pierce complacency.<words>344</words>
Shame gusted like desert wind, pushing me onto the Bridge of Regret before fear could mend its strings.<words>362</words>
The surface flexed beneath my boots, translating each footfall into echoes of chants I had transcribed but never shared.<words>381</words>
Midspan, the arch pulsed, projecting a final scene—future crowds awaiting truth like targets awaiting arrows.<words>396</words>
Passionate disinterest shattered, and purpose—not obligation—feathered my next breath.<words>405</words>
I turned, left the bridge uncollapsed behind me, and raced back toward the uprising horizon, journal open, bow unstrung, heart finally drawn.<words>427</words>
