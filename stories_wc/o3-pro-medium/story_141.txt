In the space between thunder and lightning, Matias Vega paused at the cave mouth and clutched his copper talisman. <words>19</words>
He was a superstitious submarine engineer whose mentors claimed the sea itself whispered schematics, always strange and never kind. <words>38</words>
Tonight, an urban scavenger hunt had lured him from dry docks into this flooded labyrinth beneath the coastal megacity. <words>57</words>
The final clue promised revelation by chance encounter, a cryptic instruction that wriggled like an eel in his mind. <words>76</words>
He submerged through a pressure hatch, helmet lights raking over stalactites that looked like fangs waiting to pronounce sentence. <words>95</words>
Curious dread fluttered in his lungs as booming surf above synchronized with distant sky fire. <words>110</words>
Suddenly his sonar pinged off a figure crouched on a marble ledge, a woman scribbling in a scarred poet's notebook. <words>130</words>
Water shimmered around her like glass torn from a stormcloud. <words>140</words>
Before he could speak, thunder cracked miles above, freezing the world into that no-time gap he had always worshiped. <words>159</words>
She looked up, eyes reflecting circuitry and tides, and quipped, 'You thought wisdom would be hidden in iron, not ink?' <words>179</words>
The engineer almost dropped his talisman, startled that her quip mirrored a joke his late mother once murmured while debugging ballast pumps. <words>201</words>
Memories surged: his mother teaching apprentices, braiding equations with lullabies, insisting women's wisdom flowed deepest where steel feared to rust. <words>221</words>
Matias stammered that he sought designs to transcend the physical realm, to build vessels sailing between thought and gravity. <words>240</words>
The woman nodded, pages of her battered notebook turning themselves as if wind lived underwater. <words>255</words>
'Every hull cracks,' she said, 'unless it remembers to breathe,' and her words echoed like whales singing reverse lullabies. <words>274</words>
Lightning finally answered the thunder, time jolted forward, and Matias realized the hunt's prize was not metal but meeting her. <words>294</words>
Yet the cave trembled as pressure waves warned the corridor might collapse, so they hurried deeper beside bioluminescent vents. <words>313</words>
She recited verses from the notebook, each scar across its leather binding corresponding to a shipwreck she had survived. <words>332</words>
With every verse, bulkheads of water parted, revealing a vaulted chamber where stalagmites formed an impossible astrolabe of salt. <words>351</words>
In the astrolabe's center floated an air bubble bright as phosphorus, whispering variables that mapped soul-routes rather than longitude. <words>370</words>
Matias touched the bubble and felt rivets, heartbreaks, and tidal charts dissolve into one pulsing equation: trust what refuses measurement. <words>390</words>
Dread shifted to wonder, yet remained curious enough to anchor him, because transcendence, he learned, requires staying partially submerged. <words>409</words>
The woman smiled approval, ceded the scarred poet's notebook, and vanished, leaving only concentric ripples marking the threshold of elsewhere. <words>429</words>
Matias surfaced hours later, thunder distant, notebook dry, quipping to startled scavenger teams that the sea had finally passed inspection. <words>449</words>
No one laughed, but he heard his mother's voice in the pause, approving the oddness that would guide his next descent. <words>470</words>
