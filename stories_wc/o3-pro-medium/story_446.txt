I am Calder Vance, an amiable gambler whose smile can soothe bruised egos even while dice click like sharks' teeth. <words>20</words>
My current table lies deep within the marshy firefly breeding grounds where lantern bodies rise like silent applause at dusk. <words>40</words>
I come here during pauses throughout charity drives sponsored by the empire's lesser nobles, because generosity loosens pockets and stories alike. <words>61</words>
Across the moss, volunteers distribute bread while I shuffle marked cards, listening for one rumor that can guide me to restore a lost kingdom. <words>85</words>
That motive sounds grand, yet it flickers inside me as peaceful anger, a flame content to wait but unwilling to die. <words>106</words>
The gamblers' stool creaks when an archivist named Priya arrives clutching a vintage ledger wrapped in oilcloth. <words>123</words>
Her gaze is mildly obsessed, skimming every glowing insect as though each abdomen pulsed a forgotten paragraph. <words>140</words>
She bets the ledger against a single coin, demanding in return my promise to read its brittle pages without speaking a sound. <words>162</words>
Silence is cheap, so I deal, win, and accept her prize under mothwing hush. <words>176</words>
Inside, equations map rainfall to dynastic succession, asserting that if one can hydrolyze the silted crown jewels, pearls of authority will bloom anew. <words>199</words>
The method is described via the way petals fall from a flower, each formula arranged to drop gently yet irreversibly toward truth. <words>221</words>
I realize at once that the manuscript teaches the art of unbecoming, stripping titles from tyrants as rain strips color from chalk. <words>243</words>
But to perform it demands a gambler's nerve and a kingdom's worth of volunteers willing to dissolve themselves into something fairer. <words>264</words>
Priya confesses she organized the charity drives precisely to gather such people, laundered as do-gooders yet poised for rebellion. <words>283</words>
Her peaceful anger mirrors mine, a lake reflecting the same stormcloud that refuses to break. <words>298</words>
Together we outline wagers where each hand lost will finance another pond to breed more fireflies, whose soft light marks meeting points for conspirators. <words>322</words>
Throughout charity drives, I will entertain lords with laughter while secretly noting who smiles too wide at cruelty, recording their names beside their debts. <words>346</words>
When the ledger is full, we will drizzle encoded water on each page, letting the ink hydrolyze into maps only the worthy can read. <words>370</words>
Then, via the way petals fall from a flower, crowns will slide from undeserving brows; no sword, just gravity and guilt. <words>391</words>
I will remain an amiable gambler at the table, smiling as kingdoms unbecome around me, counting fireflies instead of coins, finally home. <words>413</words>
