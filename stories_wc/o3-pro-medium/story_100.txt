I awoke beneath twisted apple boughs, half convinced dawn was only another elaborate hallucination.<words>14</words>
Being a vivid dreamer, I distrusted consciousness almost as much as sleep.<words>26</words>
Still, the enchanted orchard policed by living statues felt solid under my cautious feet.<words>40</words>
Marble sentinels glared with blank mercy, their stone spears preventing every shortcut between rows of shimmering fruit.<words>57</words>
Their vigilance suited me; I carried secrets heavier than any unpicked apple.<words>69</words>
Inside my coat rustled a pressed penny collection, each coin etched with impossible constellations only I could read.<words>87</words>
They formed a breadcrumb cipher pointing toward the ultimate cosmic deception I had sworn to unravel.<words>103</words>
The orchard lay at the threshold of an apology yet to be spoken by the sky.<words>119</words>
Someone, or something, owed creation a sorry, and I meant to collect it.<words>132</words>
Guidance arrived through the patient guardian who haunted my thoughts like a dry joke delivered slowly.<words>148</words>
He was rationally mischievous, proposing pranks whose punchlines repaired rather than ruined.<words>160</words>
Tonight his whisper told me to oscillate between shadow and moonlight until patterns emerged.<words>174</words>
So I stepped, paused, stepped again, letting silver beams slice my outline into flickering semaphore.<words>189</words>
Living statues rotated heads in sync, their granite pupils reflecting symbols glowing on my pennies.<words>204</words>
The orchard itself began to hum, each tree trunk vibrating like a tuning fork seeking resonance.<words>220</words>
By following moon paths mapped across the grass, I reached a clearing shaped like a coin slot.<words>237</words>
There waited the tallest statue, its chest hollowed to receive my lifelong hoard of flattened metal.<words>253</words>
I fed the pressed penny collection one disk at a time, hearing echoing clinks like reluctant applause.<words>270</words>
With every offering, clouds above parted wider, revealing a gash of cosmos stitched with trembling lies.<words>286</words>
I laughed in dour amusement, the sound equal parts funeral bell and circus calliope.<words>300</words>
The patient guardian materialized as a ragged scarecrow, nodding approval yet refusing to speak the apology.<words>316</words>
He pointed instead at the sky-tear, urging me to read the deception engraved within its light.<words>332</words>
Letters of fire spelled out that reality was an elaborate insurance policy against our own courage.<words>348</words>
If no one claimed responsibility, premiums of despair would keep us docile forever.<words>361</words>
The orchard, the statues, even my rationally mischievous mentor existed to delay the claim.<words>375</words>
Realizing this, I pulled the last penny from my pocket, the one etched with my sleeping face.<words>392</words>
I kissed it and flipped it into the statue, declaring the debt hereby settled.<words>406</words>
Thunderous silence fell as orchard lights dimmed, and the long-awaited apology rippled through the gash like dawn.<words>423</words>
Statues exhaled petrified breath, transforming into weary pilgrims who bowed thanks and then dispersed among trees.<words>439</words>
I left the orchard by following moon paths home, oscillating between relief and stark terror at what lay ahead.<words>458</words>
