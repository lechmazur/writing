Inside the derelict medical bay of the drifting station Elysian Rampart, Lin Mara unpacked her satchel. <words>16</words>
She was a forthright peddler who told truths even smuggled lightyears couldn't hide. <words>29</words>
The bay's flickering monitors painted lonely rainbows across metal cots, yet Lin smiled in joyful loneliness. <words>45</words>
Today she sought not profit but the first steppingstone on redemption's path. <words>57</words>
Years ago she had promised a dying pirate safe passage, then betrayed him for a cargo of synth-spice, sealing the oath in his blood across her palms. <words>84</words>
Guilt had followed her like static on the comms, and only surrendering that oath could quiet the crackle. <words>102</words>
The pirate's sister, a corporate archivist turned ghost columnist, supposedly knew the ritual to divide oath from soul. <words>120</words>
Finding her required sifting through rumor-laden gossip columns broadcast on junk frequencies no algorithm claimed. <words>135</words>
Lin carried the latest printouts, their cheap foil pages fluttering like wounded moths in station drafts. <words>151</words>
Beside the papers lay her trading tribute, a dried flower bouquet preserved in vacuum and hope. <words>167</words>
Its brittle petals retained desert fragrance, stubborn as memory. <words>176</words>
She placed the bouquet on an examination table whose diagnostic field still hummed like a distant choir. <words>193</words>
Then she activated the station's antique projector, letting colorful gossip snippets ripple across cracked ceiling panels. <words>209</words>
Voices argued about celebrity duels, asteroid fashion, secret heirs, until one timid excerpt whispered coordinates. <words>224</words>
Meekly assertive, Lin repeated the figures aloud, daring the cosmos to correct her pronunciation. <words>238</words>
The universe, humming its secret song through loose hull plates, answered only with reverberating silence. <words>253</words>
Lin took the silence as permission. <words>259</words>
She synced her wrist nav to the coordinates, then felt the pirate's blood oath burn like frost along her skin. <words>279</words>
The medical bay lights dimmed, reacting to ancient subroutines keyed to forbidden promises. <words>292</words>
Knowing time was brittle, she opened the compartment containing the station's last functioning shuttle pod. <words>307</words>
Before departure, she returned to the table and carefully divided the bouquet, threading half the stems through her braid. <words>326</words>
The remaining half she left beside the gossip printouts, an aromatic breadcrumb for anyone chasing the same absolution. <words>344</words>
As the pod undocked, Lin watched the bay recede, and her loneliness felt suddenly, impossibly, joyful. <words>360</words>
She knew the archivist might demand penance measured in tears, credits, or chapters of confession. <words>375</words>
Whatever the cost, the peddler would pay, because redemption's path, once chosen, accepts no haggling. <words>390</words>
Ahead lay nebular storms and gossip signals intertwined like veins, and somewhere within them the ritual waited to sever oath from blood. <words>412</words>
Behind her, the abandoned space station drifted on, a quiet ward where forgotten monitors kept singing the universe's secret song for whoever listened next. <words>436</words>
