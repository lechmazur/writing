Neon constellations flickered across the cracked dome as the broken planetarium throbbed with bass, reborn as the clandestine night club called Aster Void. <words>23</words>
Marin, a notoriously fearless underwater welder, slipped through the crowd smelling of brine and ozone, his expression patiently impatient. <words>42</words>
He carried a velvet satchel heavier than it looked, guarding the vintage button box rumored to click open only during moments of unraveling. <words>65</words>
Tonight marked the crossing where two timelines should never meet, and the box’s hinges itched like magnetic scars against his ribs. <words>86</words>
One timeline belonged to the planetarium’s shattered projector, still convinced it was 1979; the other pulsed in Marin’s chest, begging for 2079. <words>108</words>
He had come to wield improbable power, not through fist or flame, but through the tactile grammar of forgotten buttons. <words>128</words>
The DJ, masked by rotating shadows, nodded when Marin approached the cratered stage and laid the satchel on a speaker that wheezed like an old diver’s lung. <words>155</words>
In exchange, the DJ offered a single favor: to pamper the relic with sound frequencies only meteors remember. <words>173</words>
Subwoofers groaned, releasing subaquatic hums that mirrored Marin’s years welding hulls beneath collapsing ice shelves. <words>188</words>
Via glimpses in vintage store mirrors installed as décor, he watched history peel back like silver leaf, reflecting scenes of both eras colliding. <words>211</words>
Dancers froze mid-spin, their outlines stitched to star charts that no longer existed, and Marin felt the box twitch within its velvet cocoon. <words>234</words>
He remembered his grandmother, last caretaker of the planetarium, whispering an inherited mystery: “Buttons decide futures when stories forget themselves.” <words>254</words>
Guided by that riddle, he opened the satchel, revealing the button box, its brass sides etched with tidal equations and temporal cautions. <words>276</words>
He was patiently impatient, fingers trembling yet deliberate as he pressed the first button, labeled simply NOW. <words>293</words>
The projector’s cracked lens flared, stitching 1979’s constellations onto 2079’s skylanes, and every bulb in the club burned turquoise. <words>312</words>
People felt their lives double, memories of cassette mixtapes fusing with orbital elevator playlists, and the dance floor began its gorgeous disassembly. <words>334</words>
In those hypnotic seconds, Marin sensed the planetarium itself pleading for mercy, but power tasted like warm salt and he advanced to the final button. <words>359</words>
It read UNRAVEL, and when he pressed it, timelines unwound like welding cables in zero-gravity, freeing energy that streamed into him and out through the dome. <words>385</words>
The club, the cosmos, and his own heartbeat synchronized to a silent chord, then reset, leaving only Marin, button box empty, and a hush where bass once thundered. <words>413</words>
Outside, dawn from neither timeline glowed violet, and he understood the improbable power he had sought was simply the authority to choose which story survived. <words>438</words>
Cradling that quiet knowledge, he left the planetarium-club behind, stepping into a future that felt exactly one button press wide. <words>458</words>
