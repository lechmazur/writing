Between the lost years, I found myself stalking a maze of billboards that flickered over a neon-lit desert like radioactive dominoes.<words>21</words>
Every advertisement screamed salvation for the planet, yet the generators behind them coughed smoke thick enough to stencil irony across the moon.<words>43</words>
I, a mildly panicked soothsayer, trudged onward with molten sarcasm dripping from my tongue like leaky battery acid.<words>61</words>
Destiny needed reshaping, and I intended to shape destiny with bare hands before the desertâ€™s fluorescent heartbeat quit entirely.<words>80</words>
Stuffed in my vest pocket rattled a puzzle box with thirteen locks, each one promising a different version of tomorrow if I could coax it open.<words>106</words>
The instruction booklet, probably unlikely to have ever been proofread, simply read, "Solve or dissolve" in peeling glow-in-the-dark ink.<words>125</words>
Guidance came not from paper but from the bar at the sole cantina within the billboard labyrinth, its countertop battered and wet with condensation halos.<words>150</words>
By reading the water rings on a battered wooden bar top, I could magnify probabilities the way desert glass concentrates sunlight to fire.<words>173</words>
Each ripple whispered which lock to twist, which billboard to topple, and which corporate mirage to expose as dust.<words>192</words>
I spun the first mechanism, and a distant sign for disposable water bottles fizzed out, plunging the dunes around it into honest starlight.<words>215</words>
Tourists, suddenly denied glimmering distraction, noticed the actual sand beneath their designer shoes and felt betrayed by their own footprints.<words>235</words>
Their confusion fed the box; a second lock clicked, releasing a smell like rain remembered by petrichor-starved soil.<words>253</words>
Holographic cacti sprouting from another billboard withered, revealing a sump of leaking batteries the size of small whales.<words>271</words>
Crowds gasped, their outrage blaring louder than the speakers that once promised eco-friendly miracles for a monthly subscription.<words>289</words>
Sarcasm or not, the spectacle turned stewardship from a billboard slogan into a gut punch, and the desert applauded with a cooling breeze.<words>312</words>
Locks three through nine surrendered in rapid sequence, each failure of neon commerce widening cracks where seeds could eventually stake claims.<words>333</words>
Yet the tenth lock jammed, mocking me with a sapphire glint that pulsed "probably unlikely" in Morse as if statistics were humor.<words>355</words>
I slammed the box against the bar, scattering new water rings, and saw destiny magnify again: the final three locks required sacrifice, not wit.<words>379</words>
So I poured my last canteen over the wood, gifting the desert a drink, and the box sighed open, its mechanisms quiet as dawn.<words>403</words>
In that hush, the billboards died for good, stars swelled awake, and the maze receded into ordinary sand, leaving people alone with sky and consequence.<words>428</words>
I pocketed the now-empty box, my panic cooling to embers, and walked east, eager for other squandered horizons that needed sarcastic midwives.<words>450</words>
