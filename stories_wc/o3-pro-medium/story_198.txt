Mist drifted like torn silk around the floating island cloud gazing platform, where I kept watch as the fervent caretaker of fragments nobody else remembered.<words>25</words>
The platform's railing groaned whenever the world below shifted, a fragile ferocity resonating through warped boards and into my ribs.<words>45</words>
I had fashioned a rustic spinning wheel from meteorwood and cloud-ice, using it to twist memory-silver into threads that anchored this isle to time.<words>69</words>
But the threads were fraying, and the children I protected were beginning to ask why nights lasted centuries while dawns flickered like matches.<words>92</words>
Their questions gnawed until I embraced the core concept of unmasking the truth, even if the revelation might mangle the only reality they knew.<words>116</words>
Legends insisted an exit shimmered at the final step down a worn flight of stairs hidden behind the sun's glare.<words>136</words>
So I vowed to chart those stairs by following sun trails, golden lattices that flared across our sky like migrating rivers.<words>157</words>
My oddly faithful companion, a clockwork kestrel named Vireo, circled ahead, its brass eyes reflecting dawns it pretended to remember.<words>177</words>
Together we left the gazing platform and descended spiral clouds that stiffened beneath each footstep, spinning wheel strapped to my back like a talisman.<words>201</words>
Sun trails shimmered ahead, trembling lines of citrus light, and we walked them as spiders cross dewdrops, never sure whether the next pulse would bear us.<words>227</words>
On the third dayfall, clouds parted to reveal stairs of compacted dusk, each riser etched with the children's forgotten names.<words>247</words>
My heart thudded because every name glowed and then faded, warning that the path erased those who hesitated.<words>265</words>
Vireo screeched, and that fragile ferocity jolted me forward onto the first stair, memory-silver threads unspooling from the wheel to mark the way back.<words>289</words>
Step after step we descended, and each tread convulsed, trying to mangle the spinning wheel so my lineage of caretakers would remain trapped and silent.<words>314</words>
Yet the meteorwood flexed but did not break, its fibers humming with oddly faithful resolve that mirrored my own shaken determination.<words>335</words>
Near the penultimate step, a mirror membrane appeared, showing the island children laughing in sunlight that no longer flickered, a future withheld until truth emerged.<words>360</words>
I understood then that escape from this parallel dimension required surrendering the caretaker's burden and letting the children spin their own stories.<words>382</words>
So at the final step down a worn flight of stairs, I severed the memory-silver, pushed the wheel through the membrane, and followed, Vireo blazing ahead.<words>408</words>
Behind us, the isle's illusions collapsed into harmless mist, and new sun trails arced across a horizon that finally belonged to all of us.<words>432</words>
