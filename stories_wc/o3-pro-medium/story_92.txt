Rowan Pierce walked pedigree hounds for magnates who paid more for collars than some owed in mortgages. <words>17</words>
His reputation was being carefully careless, letting leashes slack exactly enough to suggest freedom without losing control. <words>34</words>
At a charity blood drive outside the city opera, a crimson vanishing point drew him into stranger currents. <words>52</words>
There he met Lenora Vale, heiress, botanist, and rumored owner of the hillside mansion everyone avoided after dusk. <words>70</words>
While nurses swapped bags and chatter, Lenora and Rowan shared the first of several silent agreements in mirrored glances. <words>89</words>
She needed someone unafraid of eccentricities to catalog her deceased father's secret botanical collection trapped in the mansion. <words>107</words>
He accepted without speaking, compelled by a private vow to stand where fear dares not tread. <words>123</words>
The job should have started next morning, yet Lenora insisted on tonight, precisely when color bleeds from day into night. <words>143</words>
A stormless wind escorted them up ivy stairs, its howl a loud silence vibrating against boarded stained-glass windows. <words>161</words>
Inside the dining room ghosts allegedly rattled cutlery, but only dust spiraled under the chandelier's reluctant flicker. <words>178</words>
Lenora handed Rowan leather gloves and a ledger, then unlocked a sideboard carved with vines and serpents. <words>195</words>
Drawer by drawer they removed jars, each holding a flower drained pale as though the house had sucked its hue. <words>215</words>
Rowan listed Latin names while hounds waited outside, their distant barking punctuating the mansion's unnatural hush. <words>231</words>
Midway, a jar cracked from within, emitting an iron scent identical to the blood drive's chilled corridors. <words>248</words>
Lenora paled yet whispered nothing, another silent agreement: keep working, pretend the flower slept peacefully. <words>263</words>
Rowan needed to justify remaining calm, so he summoned the mantra of leashes slack and owners watching. <words>280</words>
What were dogs if not teachers of poise in haunted air? <words>291</words>
When the final specimen emerged—a thornless rose blacker than midnights unrecorded—the dining room shutters banged shut by unseen decree. <words>310</words>
Candle flames inverted, burning downward into wax like hourglasses mourning their own sand. <words>323</words>
Lenora confessed the collection fed on blood, hers insufficient, and tonight she expected the house to demand more. <words>341</words>
Rowan felt leashes tighten in memory, understanding every earlier glance had negotiated this gamble without words. <words>357</words>
To stand where fear dares not tread, he sliced his palm, letting droplets rain upon the rose's void petals. <words>376</words>
The house sighed—a chorus of shutters, vents, and chandeliers exhaling relief—then settled into an almost cozy quiet. <words>393</words>
Lenora bandaged him, promising hounds would have lifelong access to her endless gardens, another carefully careless reward. <words>410</words>
Outside, dusk surrendered completely, yet the world felt brighter for a pact spoken in the loudest silence imaginable. <words>428</words>
