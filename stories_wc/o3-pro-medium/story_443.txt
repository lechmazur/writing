The softly thunderous surf echoed against basalt as Silas, the heartbroken reaper, approached the cave-mouth. <words>15</words>
His scythe, dulled by regret, doubled as a lantern stand guiding him toward the forgotten library inside a cave. <words>34</words>
Dusty shelves arched like ribcages, holding tomes that whispered whenever his cloak brushed them. <words>48</words>
He had come at the quiet intersection of heartbreak and healing, seeking work instead of memory. <words>64</words>
The Council of Streams promised absolution if he could map hidden springs beneath the volcanic coast. <words>80</words>
Cartographers had failed because parchment mildewed, ink ran, and mortality feared subterranean darkness too much. <words>95</words>
A reaper, half-living, could venture deeper, or so the Council gambled. <words>106</words>
Yet Silas remained broken from losing Mirielle, the poet whose soul he once escorted beyond dawnlight. <words>122</words>
Their love had been forbidden, blooming via the scattered seeds dropped by a migrating bird onto graves. <words>139</words>
Those tiny shoots became verses, and those verses became the first draft of a world-famous novel. <words>155</words>
But the draft stayed unfinished when Mirielle died, leaving Silas to ferry the author of his own happiness. <words>173</words>
In the cave library, he smelled her ink on the pages of abandoned journals, and fearful joy trembled inside him. <words>193</words>
He resolved to finish Mirielle's map of springs as an act of atonement, not just obedience. <words>209</words>
The library floor was a mosaic of limestone tiles depicting rivers that no surface traveler had recorded. <words>226</words>
When Silas tapped a tile with his scythe, water seeped through a crack and sang. <words>241</words>
The song unfolded like softly thunderous percussion, revealing conduits beneath the stone. <words>253</words>
Each note etched itself onto the draft, parchment curling as if aligning to invisible hydrographic veins. <words>269</words>
Silas followed the melody through stacked corridors, past skeletons of librarians who had catalogued silence. <words>284</words>
He ventured downward until stalactites kissed stalagmites, forming archways like anxious lovers meeting halfway. <words>298</words>
There, a spring pulsed, reflecting Mirielle's face in ripples that kept resurfacing despite the current. <words>313</words>
Silas kneeled, letting the draft float upon the pool, ink lines drinking the water's memory. <words>328</words>
Images bloomed: tributaries, underground lakes, and at the center, a chamber where reapers might lay down their scythes. <words>346</words>
By completing the map, Silas realized, he could free future harvesters from loneliness, evolving relationships from isolation to kinship. <words>365</words>
Fear constricted him, yet joy urged him to ink the final line, binding Mirielle's legacy to hope. <words>382</words>
The pool brightened, casting auroral patterns on the cave ceiling, and the skeletons above rearranged into benches for readers unborn. <words>402</words>
Satisfied, Silas placed his scythe upon one bench, feeling its weight leave his shoulders like exhaled regret. <words>419</words>
He stepped back into the library, carrying only the softly thunderous map, and the cave entrance glimmered with dawn. <words>438</words>
Outside, gulls traced the same migrating arc as that fateful bird, promising that seeds might fall in kinder soil. <words>457</words>
Silas ventured after them, no longer heartbroken, but heart-beginning. <words>466</words>
