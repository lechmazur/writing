Between borrowed books, I first encountered the solitary painter floating amid an exo-atmospheric garden.<words>14</words>
Silent nebulae blossomed like roses around his easel, yet his eyes held an intimate separation from all color.<words>32</words>
He asked whether I could read the sky as one reads marginalia, for he had forgotten written language.<words>50</words>
I offered my battered notepad, its pages foxed by vacuum breezes and speckled with graphite constellations.<words>66</words>
The painter, fiercely gentle, traced each stain the way a physician might resuscitate a failing pulse of memory.<words>84</words>
He claimed the specks were portals to realms of surprise, reachable only when one risked finishing an unfinished story.<words>103</words>
His own tale paused after a brushstroke that never dried, imprisoning him here between borrowed books of starlight.<words>121</words>
To continue, he needed an audience willing to exchange gravity for hope and dare a final leap of faith.<words>140</words>
Because I had already overstayed every library loan, I volunteered.<words>150</words>
He led me along vines of crystal oxygen until we stood behind invisible stage curtains woven from comet tails.<words>169</words>
There, he said the only doorway appeared through the hushed confessions scrawled behind stage curtains, and I must write them.<words>189</words>
So I wrote of childhood comets I pretended to ride, of lovers left orbiting other moons, of letters never mailed.<words>209</words>
Each line fluttered into the low artificial wind and wrapped around his stagnant canvas like living calligraphy.<words>226</words>
Gradually, the damp brushstroke shimmered, breathing again as though resuscitated by every syllable I surrendered.<words>241</words>
Color seeped outward, sketching a doorway where the realms of surprise waited like patient friends unseen.<words>257</words>
The painter asked if I would enter first, for only a reader could verify the ending his heart feared.<words>276</words>
I stepped, feeling pages tug at my ankles, and suddenly smelled ink, dust, and the breath of every forsaken narrative.<words>296</words>
Behind me, the painter remained, framed by blossoms of nebulae now pulsing with renewed canvas-light.<words>311</words>
His smile held both gratitude and intimate separation, as though he released me yet queued himself for a different exit.<words>331</words>
From the other side, I read his figure in negative, a silhouette forming letters only the notepad could decode.<words>350</words>
It said he would stay until the last confession dried, then leap after me, trusting the doorway to remain faithful.<words>370</words>
I promised to hold the hinge open between borrowed books and keep breathing, so the pigment would never again fall silent.<words>391</words>
Among spiraling chapters of stardust, I sensed his fiercely gentle presence approach, footfalls soft as turning pages.<words>408</words>
Together we crossed into the blooming unknown, painter and witness, our shared tale resuscitated into endless, surprising light.<words>426</words>
