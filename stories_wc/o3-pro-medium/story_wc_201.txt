The first color I saw after the anesthesia wore off was violet that flickered beyond the visible spectrum. [18]  
It sifted through spruce needles like a secret flame, reminding me that this forest lived on ultraviolet penance. [36]  
I lay on damp moss, proprioceptively enhanced from the drugs, feeling every granular tremor beneath my shoulder blades. [54]  
The clinic orderlies thought they'd dumped me far enough away, but orientation is easy when your bones whisper coordinates. [73]  
I braced my elbows against a cedar root and sat up, tasting blood laced with anesthetic on my tongue. [92]  
Memory returned not as images but as jerks of muscle, the body remembering through trauma responses it had cataloged. [111]  
An electrode's spark echoed as a twitch in my calf; a question screamed years ago surfaced as involuntary shivers. [130]  
That is how survivors answer: the flesh speaks after the mouth decides it will never testify again. [147]  
Somewhere to the east, metallic birds from the security drones keened, sweeping for anyone missing a pewter mask strap. [166]  
Mine had snapped when I wrenched free of the interrogation chair, and I still clutched the broken length instinctively. [185]  
Its cool weight reminded me there were equations left unsolved, variables embedded in cruelty, proofs scribbled in screams. [203]  
I had promised myself, during a thousand volts and questions, to discover the mathematics of mercy before dying. [221]  
Numbers, I believed, could offer absolution where words collapsed under ideology. [232]  
But to solve anything I needed data, and the forest glowed like a theorem yearning to be articulated. [250]  
The trunk lichen radiated in ultraviolet bands I could almost taste; each frequency hummed a digit of some vast quotient. [270]  
If mercy existed, it must be hiding in pattern, not sentiment. [281]  
I started walking, setting my proprioceptively enhanced rhythms to the pulsing trees, triangulating toward the brightest convergence of violet. [300]  
Every step fired a recoil of pain that I translated into coefficients, because suffering, too, plots a curve. [318]  
Soon I reached a clearing where the air shimmered like a cathedral window, and the drones hesitated at its edge. [338]  
The forest, it seemed, enforced sanctuary clauses older than their software. [349]  
I knelt and pressed the pewter mask strap into the soil, hoping conductivity would translate pain into measurable resonance. [368]  
Ultraviolet filaments leapt from root to metal, sketching impossible geometry above the ground. [381]  
Angles folded, vertices breathed, and suddenly formulas projected across my retinas, luminous as confessionals. [395]  
Yet every solution terminated in the same remainder: one divided by zero, mercy withheld by infinite intolerance. [412]  
Despair threatened to flood me, but I braced again, palms flat, refusing to accept the proof was complete. [430]  
Something the torturers said returned, not as words, but as the smell of ozone and the clack of shackles. [449]  
Remembering through trauma responses, I let the smell ignite synapses the forest could read. [463]  
The formula recalculated, factoring cruelty as a negative exponent rather than an absolute term. [477]  
Suddenly, one over zero folded into zero over one, a reciprocal conjured by vulnerability, and the remainder vanished. [495]  
The clearing brightened, and even the drones relaxed their wings, caught in an algorithm they could not override. [513]  
I understood then that mercy is not a constant but a transformation, dependent on the willingness to invert power. [532]  
Ultraviolet penance was the forest's way of absorbing authority and reemitting it as healing radiation. [547]  
I, enhanced interrogation survivor, became both variable and witness, displaced from civilization yet rooted in this radiant asylum. [565]  
When I stood, the strap gleamed like a solved equation, and the forest hushed, awaiting the next theorem I might pose. [586]  
I set it around my wrist as a reminder that proofs do not end where fear begins. [603]  
Then I walked toward dawn, carrying the mathematics of mercy in my bloodstream, luminous, recursive, unfinished. [619]  
Behind me the ultraviolet forest whispered its proofs to the wind, a displaced rooted hymn of absolution. [636]
