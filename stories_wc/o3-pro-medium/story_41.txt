At the end of a corridor no one dares walk, Dario Vega piled shift ledgers beside humming machines and inhaled metallic dusk.<words>22</words>
By day he was the factory worker everyone underestimated; by night his veins sluiced with cosmic powers that glimmered behind soot.<words>43</words>
Even his academically wild notebooks, scrawled between conveyor alarms, could not catalog the constellations he felt blooming under his skin.<words>63</words>
The plant manager pressed him to review quarterly quotas, not realizing Dario reviewed starbirth the way others check screw alignment.<words>83</words>
Expectations clanged like wrenches, yet he meant to break them as one snaps a cooling mold from a fresh gear.<words>103</words>
Tonight the annual Vega rite would help: a unique family ritual connecting generations across planetary silence and factory dust.<words>122</words>
He carried its humble instrument, a plain cameo brooch depicting his great grandmother, tucked beneath his oil stained collar.<words>141</words>
When sirens declared shift end, Dario slipped past lockers toward the forbidden western annex where gargoyles leered from a terrace over a bottomless abyss.<words>165</words>
That terrace perched like an unscrewed bolt between realities, reachable only through a door hidden behind crates of defective piston rings.<words>186</words>
He stepped outside, wind roaring upward, and the gargoyles seemed ready to leap, embodying ordered disarray in their symmetrical chaos.<words>206</words>
Placing the brooch upon the stone balustrade, he whispered the names of ancestors who had smelted iron beneath different suns.<words>226</words>
Starlight seeped from the cameo like coolant, forming luminous footprints that marched away from him then dissolved, teaching him to disregard the footprints left by doubt.<words>252</words>
A glyph shaped as a gearwheel of nebulae hovered, bidding him confront the corridor of fear he daily bypassed inside himself.<words>273</words>
He returned to the factory floor before dawn, cosmic residue hiding behind grease, and found the quarterly review already posted in red ink.<words>296</words>
Numbers forecast layoffs, an iron prophecy designed by managers who worshipped margins, but Dario felt the terrace wind still swirling in his chest.<words>319</words>
He raised a hand, and microcosms unfurled across the spreadsheet screens, reordering rows into spirals that mapped not quotas but possibilities.<words>340</words>
Co workers watched rivets rise weightless, forming temporary constellations overhead, while the machines paused as if reconsidering their vocation.<words>359</words>
In that ordered disarray, Dario declared the factory a laboratory of wonder, and every skeptic felt the hum of broken chains.<words>380</words>
The plant manager, tongue tied, stared at a gear orbiting his clipboard and remembered childhood dreams he had archived behind paperwork.<words>401</words>
He muttered about regulations, but the cameo brooch on Dario's collar pulsed, projecting generations of resilient workers who rewrote rules by creating stars.<words>424</words>
Together the shift crew stepped toward the corridor no one had dared walk, certain its abyss would now reveal not emptiness but a gateway they would build.<words>451</words>
