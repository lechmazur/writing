When the clock dares to skip a beat, I swing down a vine toward Verdant Perch, the treehouse city in the Amazon. <words>22</words>
I, Marisol Ventos, proud exorcist and endearingly feisty thorn in bureaucratic sides, am late for a different kind of haunting. <words>42</words>
The Council sent me to outshine a looming shadow said to lurk between the canopy bridges, siphoning color from travelers' faces. <words>63</words>
Bragging rights aside, the weight of responsibility sits on my spine like an uninvited macaw. <words>78</words>
Still, my tone stays playful cynicism, because gloom gives horror all the credit and I refuse supporting roles. <words>96</words>
I land on a rope-planked street just as crowds gasp—the usual vine lift has slammed shut, a sudden closure of a usual path. <words>119</words>
Cut off from ground escape, panic rises like steam from leaf mulch. <words>131</words>
Perfect stage entrance, I think, unclipping the wizard's battered grimoire dangling at my belt. <words>145</words>
Its cracked leather smells of ozone and grandfatherly disappointment, a reliable combination for showy miracles. <words>160</words>
I flip to the page labeled Youthify, an overcaffeinated script promising to rewind age with risky side effects. <words>178</words>
If the shadow drains years like it drains hue, perhaps turning victims briefly into toddlers will make it choke. <words>197</words>
The crowd, amused by my banter about diaper budgets, steadies; endearingly feisty works better than sedatives. <words>213</words>
I chalk runes across a support beam, but the looming shadow manifests early, spilling from a knot hole like reverse starlight. <words>234</words>
It scoffs—a soundless depression of hope—and lunges; the treehouse sways, complaining in wooden groans. <words>248</words>
I leap, slap my palm to the rune, and shout the command; turquoise sparks fountain, youthify misfires, and suddenly the path itself gets younger. <words>272</words>
The sealed vine lift sprouts fresh shoots, reopening like a curious eyelid, while rickety boards revert to springy sapling planks. <words>292</words>
The rejuvenated wood thrums with life, and the shadow recoils, allergic to beginnings it cannot yet corrupt. <words>309</words>
I chase it along the bridges, hurling quips about existential sunscreen, until it corners itself against an infant cypress roof. <words>329</words>
Responsibility, heavier than any grimoire, reminds me bragging alone won't finish the job, so I offer the shadow a deal. <words>349</words>
Return every stolen shade and year, and I will sign you up as my understudy, letting you haunt my quarterly reports. <words>370</words>
The creature, intrigued by bureaucracy's terror, dissolves into a prism drizzle that the planks drink, restoring the citizens' rosy chins. <words>390</words>
Cheers erupt, and I bow, though my knees creak, because the spell spared wood but forgot my joints. <words>408</words>
No matter; in treehouse city immortality is overrated, and playful cynicism ages like the finest unripe fruit. <words>425</words>
As night paints the canopy, I shelve the wizard's battered grimoire and promise the vines to keep skipping beats whenever heroes are bored. <words>448</words>
