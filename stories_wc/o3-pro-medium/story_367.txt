Salt spray drummed against the glass-walled observatory on an ocean cliff, yet inside the air felt arid. <words>17</words>
Carthel, a sapped herbalist, slouched over parchments streaked with algae green. <words>28</words>
He had come here to study tide patterns, believing their rhythm could revive wilted remedies. <words>43</words>
Instead, exhaustion crept under his fingernails like stubborn sand, draining intention into unmixed tinctures. <words>57</words>
Perfection was the cure he chased, and the price of perfection demanded endless wakefulness. <words>71</words>
Still, his tone toward his own suffering remained one of fervent indifference, almost ritualistic. <words>85</words>
He was thoughtfully thoughtless, cataloging each wave crest without noticing the bruises on his wrists. <words>100</words>
The observatory’s skylight clicked, and a lone goose traced a crooked V above the panes. <words>115</words>
Carthel decided to calibrate his next measure by the flight path of a lone goose. <words>130</words>
If the bird banked westward, he would allow himself a sip of rest. <words>143</words>
But sunlight spilled silver, the goose veered east, and duty chained him awake. <words>156</words>
Desperate for wind, he fetched a blacksmith’s bellows from the maintenance chest. <words>168</words>
He pumped until gusts rattled ivy along the frames, pretending the noise was healthy surf. <words>183</words>
The bellows wheezed in sympathy, an aging lung that mirrored his own depleted chest. <words>197</words>
At last, dizziness fogged his lenses, and his forehead met the teak desk. <words>210</words>
During napping, he dreamed of rusted gardens blooming only when no one cared to watch. <words>225</words>
In that dream, villagers cherished weeds because weeds never lied about their limits. <words>238</words>
He woke with the single word cherish echoing, its sweetness stinging like salt on split skin. <words>254</words>
Outside, the tide smashed the cliff, erasing chalk formulas he had scrawled on the balcony. <words>269</words>
The ocean, thoughtfully thoughtless too, offered no apology for wiping years of calculation. <words>282</words>
Carthel laughed, a brittle crack that matched the dried herbs crumbling in their jars. <words>296</words>
Perfection, he realized, was a tax collected only from the exhausted, never from the waves. <words>311</words>
He set the blacksmith’s bellows beside the window and opened every vent to the storm. <words>326</words>
Sea mist rushed in, baptizing scrolls, instruments, and the last crumbs of his ambition. <words>340</words>
He watched ink bleed like dusk, finally accepting that the tide needed no herbalist to be perfect. <words>357</words>
The goose returned, hovering momentarily, as if approving the surrender below. <words>368</words>
Carthel cupped the chill air in his palms and, for once, chose to cherish fatigue. <words>383</words>
By the flight path of a lone goose, he charted not tides but his own imperfect pulse. <words>400</words>
