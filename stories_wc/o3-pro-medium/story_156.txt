The bus rumbled into the eerie salt mine turned subterranean village as Milo Varesh exhaled uncertainty. <words>16</words>
He was the Confederation's newest envoy, a confused diplomat whose briefcase jangled with unfinished treaties. <words>31</words>
Yet clutched in his palm lay only a spare computer key, the letter C rubbed ghostly white. <words>48</words>
Its lonely click had once aborted a speech, and now it felt like his last command. <words>64</words>
Negotiations for the mineral rights above had stalled because neither side understood the counterpoint of hearts beneath. <words>81</words>
Milo believed people pulsed like dueling melodies, resolving only when each phrase acknowledged the other's silence. <words>97</words>
Such theories sounded boldly timid in cabinet chambers; deep underground, they rang almost courageous. <words>111</words>
During bus rides through tunnels salted with history, he rehearsed arguments nobody requested to hear. <words>126</words>
Every time headlamps caught glittering walls, he pictured crusted organs of a planet beating under plaster ribs. <words>143</words>
He sought evolutionary wisdom, the layered knowing that minerals, birds, and exiles accumulate by simply enduring. <words>159</words>
But how to translate patience into policy, or stalactites into statutes, remained opaque. <words>172</words>
An elderly miner, now mayor of the village, offered him tea brewed from dehumidifier drippings. <words>187</words>
Steam curled like question marks, and the miner whispered that the birds would explain everything at dusk. <words>204</words>
When the bus delivered Milo back to the cavern rim that evening, a gauzy parliament of starlings swarmed. <words>222</words>
Their wheeling silhouettes formed spirals, then broke into scattered commas pointing toward tunnels where children sang. <words>238</words>
Milo raised the spare computer key like a tuning fork, and the flock rearranged above him. <words>254</words>
Patterns emerged: four tight loops, one broad arc, three descents, spelling an unspoken verb--liberalize. <words>268</words>
He felt doors inside his chest unlock as though the key had never belonged to a machine. <words>285</words>
Joyfully tragic understanding flooded him, equal parts birth cry and elegy, because freedom always costs its cocoon. <words>302</words>
If the surface companies loosened their grip, the villagers would trade salt sculptures for sunlight fairly. <words>318</words>
If the villagers released mineral patents, the companies would finance elevators, schooling, and safe tunnels. <words>333</words>
Between those conditional rhythms lay the counterpoint of hearts that Milo finally heard in the fluttering dark. <words>350</words>
He drafted a new accord on his ticket stub during the next bus ride, clauses echoing avian choreography. <words>368</words>
The mayor signed beside a salt fingerprint, and Milo forwarded a photo to headquarters before doubt returned. <words>385</words>
Approaching daylight, he watched birds fade into blue, but the pattern persisted like afterimage scripture on his eyelids. <words>403</words>
He realized diplomacy was not persuasion but listening until wings wrote sentences the ground could keep. <words>419</words>
The thought felt softly loud, boldly timid, exactly the amplitude required to reshape nations and nests alike. <words>436</words>
And so, holding the once spare key now sacred, Milo Varesh stepped from the bus toward negotiations reborn. <words>454</words>
