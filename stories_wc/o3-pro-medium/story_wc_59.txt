The chains groaned above the clouds. [6]  
They held the suspended palace anchored to giant stalactites. [15]  
Inside, torches flickered like reluctant stars. [21]  
Prince Oriven shuffled, bedraggled from sleepless circuits of the halls. [31]  
His crown hung sideways, a tin halo gnawed by rust. [41]  
Yet his eyes clung to a quaking reverie none shared. [51]  
Machines ruled every corridor, pistons breathing where gardens once stood. [61]  
Beauty, he feared, had been filed down to gears. [70]  
He yearned to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world. [79]  
So he wandered, hypothesizing about everything that might restore wonder. [89]  
Tonight, his intuition trembled toward the Aviary Tower. [97]  
Long sealed, the tower whispered of feathers never again to flutter. [108]  
The prince pried copper doors apart and stepped into dust. [118]  
There, upon a velvet cushion, rested an extinct bird's egg. [128]  
Its shell shimmered bruised indigo, thin as forgotten lullabies. [137]  
He lifted it with gloved fingers that still shook. [146]  
The egg was warm, impossibly, like a memory refusing death. [156]  
Oriven's heart knocked against ribs of both dread and promise. [166]  
He knew the archives spoke of a flawed genesis. [175]  
The last Phoenixoids had hatched malformed, singing sparks then collapsing. [185]  
Their extinction birthed the iron reign, for craftsmen feared life's caprice. [196]  
But Oriven tasted a bitterly sweet defiance on his tongue. [206]  
If genesis was flawed then, he would assemble a better dawn. [217]  
The palace tremored as though hearing his oath. [225]  
He hurried to the Observatory, egg cradled under cloak. [234]  
Glass orreries mapped clockwork constellations across the ceiling. [242]  
Steam hissed where comets should have hissed with ice. [251]  
He set the egg within the central gyroscope, heart drumming. [261]  
Then he breathed stories into the room. [268]  
He spoke of mornings when dew cut diamonds on petals. [278]  
Of nights when crickets tuned the silence. [285]  
Of living things useless to industry yet necessary to soul. [295]  
Each word vibrated through copper ribs and echoed down chain lines. [306]  
The egg gleaned those vibrations like light. [313]  
Hairline cracks spidered, glowing ember-orange. [318]  
Oriven gasped yet dared not cease his narration. [326]  
He continued, hypothesizing about everything the hatchling might become. [335]  
A singer of rainfall, a painter of rust into roses. [345]  
Possibility coated the gears with mist. [351]  
Below, turbines faltered, confused by dreams. [357]  
The palace listed, chains straining like harps against vertigo. [366]  
Still he spoke, voice cracking but resolute. [373]  
The final shard of shell fell away with a chime. [383]  
A fledgling unfurled molten feathers, each plume refracting lost sunsets. [393]  
Its eyes mirrored sorrowful histories and hopeful algebras at once. [403]  
The prince fell to his knees, weeping for mathematics made tender. [414]  
The fledgling chirped, a note both bitterly and sweetly tuned. [424]  
That ambivalence tasted like truth. [429]  
Outside the window, gears began flowering into bronze blossoms. [438]  
Soot melted into fertile ash that drifted across balconies. [447]  
Clerks, artisans, and clocksmiths paused from their routines. [455]  
They felt beauty reawaken though none could name the spark. [465]  
Oriven knew the moment would not last without guidance. [474]  
He remembered his vow to assemble a dawn. [482]  
Cradling the fledgling, he descended toward the Engine Cathedral. [491]  
Every stair hummed with newborn dissonance. [497]  
At the cathedral heart, colossal cogs ground against anvils. [506]  
The fledgling fluttered from his arms onto the main flywheel. [516]  
Feathers ignited, searing sigils into the metal. [523]  
Gears halted as if listening to an ancient sermon. [532]  
Then the cogs reversed, grinding rust into powder that scented spring. [543]  
Lights dimmed, revealing skylights hidden since the first smelting. [552]  
Moonlight cascaded, silvering the fledgling's silhouette. [558]  
Oriven felt the palace breathe like an animal startled alive. [568]  
Yet tremors deepened; stalactite anchors cracked beneath shifting weight. [577]  
The flawed genesis of the palace resisted redemption. [585]  
Beauty and ruin braided themselves in uncertain equilibrium. [593]  
Through the discovery of this tension, Oriven conceived the next step. [604]  
He must guide both bird and machine into symbiosis. [613]  
Standing amid grinding echoes, he addressed unseen listeners in scaffolds. [623]  
We built this height to escape failure, he cried. [632]  
But escape shackled us to fear; let us descend renewed. [642]  
Open the ground gates and plant these gears in soil. [652]  
The fledgling screeched, scattering sparks that sketched maps downward. [661]  
Workers, spellbound, obeyed, lowering cables toward the valley mist. [670]  
The palace began its first descent since coronation. [678]  
Stone groaned; water dripping from stalactites sang accompaniment. [686]  
Oriven steadied the bird, whose wings now cooled to aureate amber. [697]  
He whispered, We journey from quaking reverie to waking dream. [707]  
The fledgling answered with a rumble like dawn grinding open. [717]  
Below, the valley waited, dark yet fertile for improbable songs. [727]  
Together they descended, carrying both flawed genesis and promised bloom. [737]  
The chains unclasped with jubilant thunder, and night inhaled possibility. [747]  
Beauty, at last, fluttered on clockwork wings toward tomorrow. [756]
