Mara pressed cold cards into the sky-stained journal, hiking toward the midnight glade above clouds. [15]  
She was an onyx-ink cartomancer, reading futures the color of obsidian rain. [27]  
Tonight her own future weighed heavier than any client’s, and every shuffle rasped like prayer. [42]  
She had come after the birth of her sister’s son, whose first cry felt older than history. [59]  
The midwife whispered that seconds slipped away between contractions, vanishing into creases of air. [73]  
Mara, willingly perplexed, decided to pursue those fugitive seconds to their lair. [85]  
Her motive was simple and impossible: to find where lost time accumulates. [97]  
Every ancestor, she believed, waited there, delayed in unspoken sentences. [107]  
Cloudbound repentance hung above the valley like bruised silk, promising answers only to the penitent. [122]  
She carried an heirloom: a dolls’ tea set saucer crack running across its porcelain crescent. [137]  
The fracture had appeared during her own fifth birthday, exactly when her father died mid-laughter. [152]  
Since then, each birthday tablecloth bore the traced outlines of every living hand, a family custom of tracing hands on birthday tablecloths to remember the missing palm. [179]  
Tonight she would add no inked outline until she found her father’s lost minutes. [193]  
The path steepened, moonlight bruising the rocks with choking beauty. [203]  
Mist flooded upward, so the world below seemed drowned and forgiven. [214]  
She reached the glade where black evergreens ringed a clearing that floated like a thought left unfinished. [231]  
Here, legend said, clocks refused to tick because they envied the stars. [243]  
Mara unfolded her traveling cloth and unfastened the leather strap holding her card deck. [257]  
Onyx ink glittered along the edges, ready as venom. [266]  
Yet before she dealt, she placed the cracked saucer in the grass as a listening ear. [282]  
Wind circled the china, sounding like a child spinning until dizziness. [293]  
She spoke: 'I barter memories for direction; take whatever must be surrendered.' [305]  
Cards flew from her grasp, arranging themselves in a spiral that mirrored fingerprints on past tablecloths. [321]  
The pattern formed an hourglass whose upper bulb was empty, the sand below pulsing like a heart. [338]  
A hush fell, and a voice without mouth drifted from the mist. [350]  
'Lost time settles where forgiveness is heavier than guilt,' it said, every syllable damp with rainless thunder. [367]  
Mara felt the glade tilt, revealing terraces of clouds beneath, each layered like sedimentary remorse. [382]  
On the lowest tier walked pale silhouettes carrying clocks whose hands spun backward, digging trenches in the hours. [400]  
She recognized her father among them, his coat sparkling with stitched dates that never came. [415]  
He looked up, willingly perplexed too, as if uncertainty were the only tether left. [429]  
To reach him she would have to pour her own measured days into the hourglass. [444]  
The cracked saucer vibrated, offering its broken rim as courier. [454]  
She remembered her first birthday tracing, the tickle of her father’s calloused finger guiding hers along linen. [471]  
That memory, glowing, loosened from her chest like a firefly and settled on the saucer. [486]  
Another followed—the night he taught her to mix onyx ink by moon-reflection—then another, forming a small constellate pile. [504]  
When the saucer brimmed, the voice urged, 'Drop it through the hourglass mouth; let gravity taste love.' [521]  
She complied, and the china slipped cleanly, not breaking further, but carrying the glowing memories like tea for giants. [540]  
Time inhaled. [542]  
Clouds convulsed, and the terraces rearranged until her father rose to the glade, clocks crumbling to dew behind him. [561]  
Years dripped from his sleeves yet did not touch the grass, as if the past feared to stain this clearing. [581]  
He spoke with wind in his throat: 'Your minutes kept me; your surrender releases us both.' [597]  
They traced their hands on the traveling cloth, inkless, letting the night itself mark the outlines. [613]  
Two silhouettes of absence became presence, merging like pages pressed together before the ink dries. [628]  
The hourglass dissolved, and the debt of lost seconds cascaded upward, reseeding the bruise-colored sky with new stars. [646]  
Mara’s knees softened, but her father steadied her, pointing to dawn igniting beneath the cloud floor. [662]  
'Let us go home before we are late for the day that waits,' he said, laughter uncracked this time. [681]  
They descended, leaving the midnight glade above clouds empty yet ringing, like a bell still feeling the hammer. [699]  
Behind them, the cards settled face-down, no longer needed, their onyx veins drying in peaceful silence. [715]  
Where the saucer had vanished, wildflowers sprouted in the precise shape of two overlapping palms. [730]  
Some said those petals smelled of ink and childhood, a choking beauty no wind would dare scatter. [747]
