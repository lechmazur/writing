In the breath after a child's question was left unanswered, Orion Vance stood beneath the cracked stone archway.<words>18</words>
The archway led into an overgrown library hidden in catacombs of lost knowledge, where vines curled like sentence fragments seeking their missing pieces.<words>41</words>
Orion was a torn visionary, stubbornly optimistic even as doubt gnawed at the blueprints sketched across his mind.<words>59</words>
He had come to track solar cycles carved in forgotten margins, claiming the sun itself had hidden codes.<words>77</words>
The only tool that could parse those codes was a battered cellphone from 1920, its brass antenna humming with improbable futures.<words>98</words>
No one believed the device existed until he placed it on the dust-silted desk and let it ring like a ghostly metronome.<words>120</words>
Ezra Neve, the archivist whose silence answered that unseen child's query, lifted her candle and, despite herself, smiled.<words>138</words>
Their shared love for a certain book—'The Atlas of Unsung Dawns'—had drawn her here whenever rooftop shadows measured noon incorrectly.<words>158</words>
Orion opened that atlas now, pages flowering under moss, and pointed to a margin note: an eclipse predicted yet erased.<words>178</words>
Ezra's candle flickered, yielding just enough light for the brass phone to capture radiance and translate it into coordinates.<words>197</words>
Static poured from the earpiece, and within the hiss they heard a whisper, 'Find what the sun forgot to tell you.'<words>218</words>
Ezra wanted to catalog the sound, but Orion urged haste, reminding her that daylight itself could close like a cautious door.<words>239</words>
Together they crossed aisles where rotted globes bled oceans onto the floor, chasing the coordinates through labyrinthine shelves.<words>257</words>
Every few steps, Orion's optimism faltered, but Ezra would read aloud a line from their beloved atlas, stitching his resolve.<words>277</words>
They reached a collapsed observatory dome swallowed by ivy, its telescope broken, its brass mirrors missing pieces like teeth knocked out in battle.<words>300</words>
Orion placed the 1920 cellphone on the telescope mount, and the device began to tick, each beat syncing with his heartbeat.<words>321</words>
Light seeped through cracks in the dome, refracted by shards, and painted a crude sundial across the atlas's open pages.<words>341</words>
Ezra rotated the book until the shadow aligned with an inked eclipse, and the library around them seemed to inhale.<words>361</words>
Between that inhale and the inevitable exhale, Orion finally yielded to faith rather than calculation and pressed the phone's single ivory button.<words>383</words>
A hidden skylight cracked open, and sunlight cascaded onto the torn mirrors, reassembling them in beams the color of first dawn.<words>404</words>
The telescope whirred to life, projecting onto the ceiling a precise map of future solstices, answering the child's silent question at last.<words>426</words>
As the map spun, Orion and Ezra clasped hands, their careful wildness tempered by wonder, knowing some missing pieces choose when to be found.<words>450</words>
