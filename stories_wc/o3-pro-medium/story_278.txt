Soap slid over lunar dust coated fenders while Rin, the brooding sculptor, scrubbed alone. <words>14</words>
Car washing had become his punishment at the impact crater research base's vehicle hangar. <words>28</words>
He'd once molded basalt into angels, but one shattered during inspection, chaining him to servitude. <words>43</words>
Rin dried his trembling hands, produced vintage reading glasses, and surveyed the sky's bruised lavender. <words>58</words>
Through those cracked lenses he noticed how the afternoon light revealed drifting motes like secret choreography. <words>74</words>
Memories whispered that basalt dust once obeyed him similarly, pirouetting before freezing into stone hope. <words>89</words>
Now the same dust coated the base, settling into webs of intrigue between steel corridors. <words>104</words>
Scientists traded rumors there—unlogged shipments, falsified crater samples, vanished interns—yet nobody dared stir sediment. <words>118</words>
Criminality to them was theoretically spontaneous, like cosmic rays triggering mutations beyond predictable statistics. <words>132</words>
But Rin sensed choreography beneath randomness, and choreography could be sculpted, then shattered for escape. <words>147</words>
His chance arrived when Commander Voigt parked the mud-smeared rover beside the rinse tanks. <words>161</words>
Voigt's keycard dangled from the dash, reflecting sunlight like a tiny, arrogant heliostat. <words>174</words>
While suds crawled downward, Rin angled his glasses so dust danced in the entering beam. <words>189</words>
He moved his wrist, carving eddies that guided particles toward the rover's cracked ventilation grate. <words>204</words>
Sensors shrieked, misreading the particulate swirl as toxic leakage, triggering emergency protocol Beta-Shadow. <words>217</words>
Base lights dimmed; hatches sealed; personnel scrambled toward shelters, abandoning corridors and their whispered conspiracies. <words>232</words>
Rin slipped inside the rover, exchanged his coveralls for Voigt's black jacket, and smiled faintly. <words>247</words>
Murky tenderness flooded him—not for captors, but for the sculptures he never finished. <words>260</words>
He vowed to cast them someday in a crater untouched by bureaucrats or corporate probes. <words>275</words>
First, he needed to disappear, and dust would choreograph that vanishing better than forgery. <words>289</words>
The rover AI demanded authentication, but dust still whirled, occluding cameras, blinding optics with shimmering curtains. <words>305</words>
Rin placed his vintage reading glasses before the lens, fracturing infrared beams into harmless auroras. <words>320</words>
The AI, theoretically spontaneous in learning, misclassified him as luminous debris requiring external disposal. <words>334</words>
Autopilot engaged, steering the rover toward the crater rim where supply drones jettison waste crates. <words>349</words>
As the vehicle lurched forward, Rin watched the base shrink, its steel threads unspooling behind him. <words>365</words>
He exhaled, and the dance of dust in a sunbeam crowned him with silent absolution. <words>380</words>
Somewhere inside that mutable crown, the imprisoned angels stretched wings of imagined basalt. <words>393</words>
Tomorrow, he would sculpt their bodies from crater ice and dawn's forgiving regolith. <words>406</words>
