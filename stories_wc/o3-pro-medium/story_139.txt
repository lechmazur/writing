In the heartbeat after a dream returns, Brother Liao opened his eyes to morning mist. <words>15</words>
The aerial gondola swung above serrated mountains, its cables humming like restrained dragons. <words>28</words>
Liao, a stubborn monk of the Cloud Ash Monastery, clutched a creased shipping label against his chest. <words>45</words>
The label, visually unappealing and stained by rain, bore the only clue to yesterday’s sacrilege. <words>60</words>
Someone had slipped into the reliquary, shattered glass, and stolen the antique flute of Master Heng. <words>76</words>
The elders whispered that avenging the theft was impossible without armies or oracles. <words>89</words>
Yet Liao had sworn to avenge the memory of his teacher through subtler arts. <words>103</words>
He believed in harvesting the past, gathering each shred of time like medicinal petals. <words>117</words>
So he rode the gondola toward the hidden foundry where rumor placed the flute’s echo. <words>132</words>
Wind peeled across the car’s cracked windows, carrying reflections that twitched when he did not move. <words>148</words>
Among them glimmered his own dark reflection, a grin carved wider than possible by nightmare. <words>163</words>
To outsmart that spectral twin, he recited breathing verses and watched until the image steadied. <words>178</words>
The gondola docked at an abandoned survey station wreathed in prayer flags bleached to ghost colors. <words>194</words>
Inside, scrap metal rang beneath his sandals, and dust motes twirled like suspicious courtiers. <words>208</words>
On a workbench lay the flute, mouthpiece gnawed as though by greedy vermin or restless gods. <words>224</words>
Liao unrolled the creased shipping label beside it, matching fiber tears with dents in the bamboo. <words>240</words>
Through analyzing tooth marks on an antique flute, he intended to trace the exact bite pattern. <words>256</words>
Each groove measured betrayal, for the culprit’s dental secrets were unique as fingerprints in wet clay. <words>272</words>
He dusted charcoal across the mouthpiece, blew gently, and lifted a sheet of rice paper. <words>287</words>
A negative appeared, violet ridges plotting a smile identical to the gondola’s corrupted reflection. <words>301</words>
The enemy was not a stranger but the fracture within himself that coveted forbidden melodies. <words>316</words>
Master Heng had warned that practicing alone before mirrors could lure the echoing spirit called Mirrorwolf. <words>332</words>
Mirrorwolf had bitten the flute, stamped the label, and fled into reflection when footsteps approached. <words>347</words>
Now it watched from every pane, waiting for Liao to despair and invite possession. <words>361</words>
Instead, with cautious enchantment twining his breath, Liao placed the flute to his lips. <words>375</words>
He played the sunrise hymn backward, a melody that seals rather than summons. <words>388</words>
Mirrorwolf shrieked within the glass, its tooth pattern unspooling like ink in storm water. <words>402</words>
When the final note faded, the reflection straightened, becoming merely Liao, weary but whole. <words>416</words>
A splinter of mirror dropped onto the bench, more visually unappealing than any mortal scar. <words>431</words>
He wrapped flute and label together, evidence and lesson, and stepped back into the waiting gondola. <words>447</words>
Below, morning sun peeled gold from the peaks, but Liao watched only the glass to ensure silence. <words>464</words>
