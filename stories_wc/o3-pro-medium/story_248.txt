Icosa, the unsteady sentinel, shifted on magnetic ankles in the abandoned space freighter docking bay, where every echo felt like metal breathing. <words>22</words>
Above her trembled a strange automaton bird, gears ticking like distant hail, its obsidian eyes scanning for signals nobody dared send. <words>43</words>
Between worlds colliding, time felt stretched and fragile, as though one careless breath could rip reality along an invisible seam. <words>63</words>
Icosa waited for Thane Omric, the prophet who had doomed her garrison with a promise of inevitable glory that now tasted of rust. <words>86</words>
She meant to clear the fog of a misguided prophecy, and she would start by decoding his intent the only way left to her. <words>110</words>
The automaton bird descended, wings clinking in coyly furious rhythm, and released a rain of shredded letters across the grease stained floorplates. <words>132</words>
These were Omric's communiques, torn apart by saboteurs who feared what truth might slip through the cracks of ideology. <words>151</words>
Icosa kneeled and began her chosen method, by reassembling shredded letters into phrases, then stitching phrases into a map of intentions. <words>172</words>
The bay's flickering emergency lights painted crimson halos on the fragments, giving the work a kind of cheerless ecstasy that steadied her hands. <words>195</words>
She read the first restored line aloud: 'Beware the ambush of fate, for it arrives disguised as the path you begged for.' <words>217</words>
The words struck harder than recoil, because Icosa had recommended the very assault route that led her comrades into cosmic artillery two days earlier. <words>241</words>
Guilt made her gyros quiver, rendering her sentinel frame even more unsteady, yet the automaton bird perched calmly on her shoulder as if forgiving. <words>265</words>
Piece by piece, the prophecy unfolded not as destiny but as warning: Omric had seen two realities vying for the same coordinates, promising collision. <words>289</words>
He had tried to divert the regiment, but military pride transmuted his plea into a rallying cry, and the universe sharpened its teeth. <words>312</words>
Now, between worlds colliding, Icosa realized her role was to become a living erratum, carrying the reconstructed truth to whoever remained alive. <words>334</words>
She loaded the letters into the bird's hollow breast, sealed them with magnetite clamps, and fed new coordinates into its whirring cortex. <words>356</words>
Before launching, she whispered an apology to absent friends, a vow to confront fate's ambush with open eyes, and a final recommendation to herself: survive. <words>381</words>
Propelled by compressed starlight, the strange automaton bird shot into the void, its signal beacon pulsing like a wounded heart that still insisted on beating. <words>406</words>
Icosa watched until the glow vanished, then turned to face the humming bulkheads, her stance trembling yet aligned with a purpose brighter than certainty. <words>430</words>
The docking bay doors yawned open, revealing the silent corridor where fate would surely wait, and Icosa stepped forward, unsteady but no longer afraid. <words>454</words>
