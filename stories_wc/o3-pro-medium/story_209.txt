Tomas Veldt, a seasoned woodsman with an artfully messy beard, felt the hiss of coaxial lilies in the radio wave garden. <words>21</words>
He had come, compass trembling in corrupted magnetic fields, to map abandoned railways no satellite remembered. <words>37</words>
Yet despairing cheer colored his mission, because the hospital had just called to say his brother's monitor would give one last beep tonight. <words>60</words>
Tomas promised to be there, but secrets weighed heavier than blood, and honesty alone could free him enough to face death. <words>81</words>
He carried the antique hairbrush wrapped in oilskin, its silver back engraved with a cartographer's grid his father once hid. <words>101</words>
The grid showed spur lines terminating at a decommissioned water tower where rumors said signals could be weighed like water. <words>121</words>
If Tomas measured echo there, he could triangulate forgotten rails and perhaps short-circuit the self-deception humming inside him. <words>139</words>
So, as dusk fluttered across antenna-petal rows, he pressed onward, boots crunching static-coated gravel. <words>153</words>
The garden's flowers broadcast sighs of storms, and each sigh tugged memories of lies he had told his brother. <words>172</words>
He had claimed their father died peacefully, omitting the scene where the old man broke the brush against Tomas's skull for selling timber rights. <words>196</words>
That lie sprouted into a forest of estrangement, and now the monitor's final beep threatened to fell it in a single echo. <words>218</words>
He reached the rusted tower, a hollow giant whose dripping stairs resembled vertebrae of extinct locomotives. <words>234</words>
Inside, he clapped once, then twice, listening as sound rebounded through iron ribs, measuring distance the way his father had taught. <words>255</words>
The timing aligned with the grid on the hairbrush, revealing a junction directly beneath the tower, untouched by salvage crews. <words>275</words>
As realization bloomed, lightning stitched the horizon, and a surge from a nearby repeater arced down the ladder. <words>293</words>
Instinctively he jammed the silver brush between severed cables, letting it short-circuit the current, sparing his body but melting ancestral lies. <words>314</words>
Smoke spiraled upward, oddly fragrant, and he felt the weight of dishonesty evaporate, as though freed by honesty distilled through heat. <words>335</words>
His phone buzzed; the hospital line opened, carrying only the ragged breathing of machines edging toward silence. <words>352</words>
Tomas knelt inside the tower and spoke the truth aloud, every syllable mapping a rail between his heart and his brother's fading one. <words>375</words>
On the other end came the final beep of the monitor, but he felt a line switch from dead circuit to living track within him. <words>400</words>
Despair and cheer merged like twin headlights in fog, guiding him toward tomorrow's rails, newly sketched on his soul's unburdened map. <words>421</words>
