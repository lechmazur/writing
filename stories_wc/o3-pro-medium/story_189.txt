Moonlit foam clawed at the crumbling pier as I descended into the lighthouse basement, the place everyone still called haunted even after the ghosts had grown bored.<words>27</words>
My master, Professor Halden, kept his brazen calm like a lamp behind frosted glass, and I, his bright-eyed apprentice, matched his stride.<words>49</words>
Outside, the world was rebuilding itself after the last war was fought for water, but inside we hunted older treasure.<words>69</words>
We sought to decode ancient star maps rumored to reveal grand designs for reservoirs hidden off-planet.<words>85</words>
The maps were etched in ultraviolet on cracked mosaic tiles that lined the sub-basement walls like scales of a dark serpent.<words>106</words>
To read them, we needed electricity, yet the council rationed current and overcharged anyone daring to tap the grid.<words>125</words>
That is why the phone booth key, salvaged from a defunct phone company, jingled in my pocket like a secret bell.<words>146</words>
The rusted booth upstairs still drew phantom voltage from forgotten cables that the council's monitors overlooked.<words>162</words>
Halden's plan, uniquely literal as always, was to turn the booth into a lantern and the basement into a lens.<words>182</words>
First, though, we needed the generator codes, and those came only by parsing notes slipped under doors of dead engineers.<words>202</words>
Every dawn, I collected curled scraps laden with smudged glyphs and rain salt, offerings from whatever still lingered in the lighthouse.<words>223</words>
Halden translated, his finger tracing symbols while the storm-light flickered through the grate above.<words>237</words>
At last, the tiles revealed coordinates: a cathedral of ice hidden beyond Mars's shadow.<words>251</words>
Water enough to cool dynasties, if we could reach it.<words>261</words>
We hurried, footsteps scattering dust that smelled of kelp and kerosene.<words>272</words>
I slotted the key, copper teeth biting the kiosk with a small sigh, and dormant bulbs surged alive.<words>290</words>
Green glow spilled down the spiral stairs, painting algae ribbons along the stone.<words>303</words>
Tiles brightened, the ultraviolet script now screaming starlight directly into our eyes.<words>315</words>
I felt the cosmos open like a lung, each inhalation a promise of oceans.<words>329</words>
Halden whispered, 'Chart it,' and I obeyed, sketching vectors on torn ledger paper.<words>342</words>
But the current kept climbing, the meter's needle flailing like a trapped gull.<words>355</words>
I realized the booth was wired to siphon every buried line in the peninsula, a slow overcharge that would catch military auditors by dawn.<words>379</words>
Halden met my stare and nodded, accepting the cost with that same frosted-glass serenity.<words>393</words>
He spoke of sacrifices, of how grand designs required grand debts, and how debts could be paid later among the stars.<words>414</words>
I, ever the uniquely literal apprentice, wondered whether the universe accepted credit.<words>426</words>
Yet I stayed, feeding the booth coins of rust until the final coordinate blazed and the breakers exploded upstairs.<words>445</words>
Somewhere above, alarms began their distant sermon, but below, the star maps now pulsed like a beating heart, and that was enough.<words>467</words>
