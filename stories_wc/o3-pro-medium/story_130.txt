<story>
Within the humming hull of an interstellar orchard ship migrating between galaxies, plums glittered like miniature purple suns.<words>18</words>
Perrin, the lost apprentice of the ship's absent gardener, kicked a fallen bird's nest across the hydroponic aisle.<words>36</words>
His gesture looked cruel, yet the nest was only woven sensor wire, and his mockery tasted like candy.<words>54</words>
He wanted affection, so he disguised it with spit and sparks, a tone of constant teasing self-defence.<words>71</words>
Traveler's wisdom, his absent mentor used to say, begins by admitting you have no map except your heartbeat.<words>89</words>
Perrin replayed that saying nightly via the static-laden confessions on an old cordless phone he kept charging with lemon batteries.<words>109</words>
The gardener had whispered into the phone during shore leave, drunk on cider nebulae, laughing, advising, apologising.<words>126</words>
Those crackled memos were Perrin's only curriculum, privately open to him alone yet loud inside every dream.<words>143</words>
To graduate, he must reverse-engineer the mentor's brilliance from those blurry syllables and from the ship's restless orchards.<words>161</words>
But the more he studied, the more he suspected that the gardener's curriculum was simply: be less afraid.<words>179</words>
Across the promise of changing winds, the orchard ship angled its solar sails, and gravitational peaches trembled in their nets.<words>199</words>
The maneuver jostled the fallen nest until a holographic yolk rolled out, revealing coordinates to a sanctuary asteroid.<words>217</words>
Perrin snorted with mocking affection, calling the discovery "eggstraordinary" while secretly cataloguing every data speck.<words>232</words>
Freedom in self-acceptance, he guessed, might hatch there.<words>240</words>
Yet instructions on the phone warned that the sanctuary accepted only those who arrived without masks or manuals.<words>258</words>
So Perrin planned a prank on himself: he would jettison every schematic he had reverse-engineered before landing.<words>275</words>
The idea amused and terrified him, like kissing a mirror that keeps insulting your haircut.<words>290</words>
He arranged the peaches into a makeshift compass, following their subtle tug toward the asteroid while the ship's AI dozed.<words>310</words>
When proximity alarms sang, Perrin slipped the cordless phone into the fallen nest, then tossed both into the recycling star.<words>330</words>
The act felt sacrilegious, so he laughed twice as loudly, bullying his own tenderness before it could blush.<words>348</words>
Light from the star refracted through orchard glass, sketching rainbow bruises across his cheeks that he decided to keep.<words>367</words>
Docking thrums shivered the deck, and the ship's hatch irised open onto a grove of silent, wind-carved statues.<words>385</words>
Each statue resembled Perrin at a different age, some scowling, some dancing, all privately open like doors without walls.<words>404</words>
Mocking affection rose in his chest, but this time it aimed inward, and the statues smiled as he bowed.<words>423</words>
Across the promise of changing winds, he understood the traveler's wisdom: the map had always been the laughter he feared.<words>443</words>
Accepting that, Perrin stepped forward, and every orchard tree inside his mind blossomed in comfortable, irreverent freedom.<words>460</words>
