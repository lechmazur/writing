The city of forgotten fountains cupped dawn in cracked marble basins, whispering waterless lullabies. [14]  
Aurin, a luminous skeptic whose eyes glowed with questions, stepped through the misting silence. [28]  
He carried a realistically imaginative map drawn on translucent vellum, though he doubted maps altogether. [43]  
Doubt, he reasoned, kept the mind honest even while it invented impossible paths. [56]  
Today those paths would lead him to the stained glass box rumoured to imprison every lost reminiscence of the fountains. [76]  
He had vowed to liberate the trapped memories before winter stilled even the echoes. [90]  
The motivation pulsed in his chest like subterranean springs long sealed by municipal neglect. [104]  
Yet promise alone could not unstick glass from history's glue; he would have to track the maker. [121]  
So he began by following breadcrumbs scattered through city archives, each crumb a clipped fountain ledger or forgotten love letter. [141]  
The city had once catalogued every splash, every coin's wish, and every name washed away. [156]  
From the pause of migrating geese overhead, Aurin measured the seasonal window left to him. [171]  
When the sky's restless chevrons resumed, wind would freeze the fountains forever, sealing the box beyond mortal reach. [189]  
Sidereal patience, the slow timing of constellations, was required, but the stars themselves were impatient for water here. [207]  
They blinked above dry plazas like thirsty witnesses. [215]  
The first breadcrumb pointed to the apartment of Novara, a retired glasswright living beneath a rusted aqueduct. [232]  
Novara answered his knock in a defiant hush, speaking barely above the mutter of distant pigeons. [248]  
"Your skepticism glows brighter than your lantern," she whispered, "but can you bear what the box remembers?" [265]  
Aurin replied that skepticism was only a candle; memory needed sunrise. [276]  
Satisfied, Novara revealed that she had etched a fail-safe into the stained glass--an argent thread only visible when wet. [295]  
To locate the box he must follow moisture through a season that had none. [309]  
She pressed into his palm a shard shaped like a gibbous moon; it glimmered, craving reunion. [325]  
Outside, Aurin noted the geese still idling on the river's black slate, their patience tutored by astral routes. [343]  
He mirrored them, slowing his breath until thoughts orbited like satellites, calm and inevitable. [357]  
The second breadcrumb carried him to the fountainworks under City Hall, where valves corroded into sculptural fossils. [374]  
There he poured a flask of rainwater through the shard, searching for any wink of argent thread. [391]  
A single droplet refracted a path toward the catacomb of pipes, then vanished. [404]  
Aurin crawled after that memory of water, ears filled with the defiant hush of gears unwilling to turn. [422]  
Deep beneath the mayor's dais, he found the stained glass box wedged between two collapsed mains. [438]  
It pulsed with trapped light, as though every coin-flung wish still ricocheted inside. [451]  
But rust had soldered the box to the iron, and time had lacquered rust to stone. [467]  
To unstick the reliquary he would need water enough to rewet the argent fail-safe, yet the mains were dry. [486]  
He remembered the geese above, living compasses that ferried clouds in their wake. [499]  
If he could coax them to rise, their beating wings might shake a drizzle from the trapped sky. [517]  
Aurin climbed back to daylight and climbed further, onto the belfry that overlooked the river. [532]  
He rang the rusted bell in a measured rhythm, realistically imaginative, mimicking northern winds the geese obeyed. [549]  
The flock rose as one muted constellation, their wings drafting sudden rain from condensing autumn air. [565]  
Droplets pattered over the plaza, trickling into the archives of stone and into the catacomb of pipes. [582]  
Aurin followed the water back underground, heart thundering like hidden pumps rekindled. [594]  
The stained glass box now shimmered with the argent thread, lines configuring themselves into a keyhole of light. [612]  
He touched the moon shard to the keyhole, and the glass parted without sound, ungluing centuries. [628]  
Voices unfurled--childhood laughter, protest chants, fountain builders negotiating marble costs, lovers naming stars in spray--each a droplet freed. [646]  
The city above gasped as every forgotten fountain gushed awake, throwing mirrored roses into the air. [662]  
Marble lions roared, penny wishes surfaced like minnows, and dust became mist that kissed balconies. [677]  
Still, the release was not chaotic; it moved in a defiant hush, as if remembering to honor silence. [695]  
Aurin waited with sidereal patience until the fountains found their rhythm and the geese resumed their journey. [712]  
Only then did he allow doubt to blink off, certain that skepticism had served its luminous course. [729]  
He returned the moon shard to Novara, who smiled hearing fountains speak again, and the city listened too. [747]  
Memories now roamed freely with water, and no map could ever doubt their currents. [761]
