Wind hissed through the night air on the eve of a bold discovery, rattling the training facility's steel catwalks. <words>19</words>
Inside, recruits rehearsed standard espionage maneuvers, yet every corridor hummed with a uniformly peculiar anticipation. <words>34</words>
They waited for Rhizome, the hive-mind therapist whose collective consciousness served as both instructor and confessor. <words>50</words>
Rhizome did not walk so much as cascade, voices layering atop voices like overlapping slides in a projector. <words>68</words>
Tonight's session would be different, tinged with merry bitterness, because memory itself had asked for therapy. <words>84</words>
A flickering circle of candles replaced the usual holograms, wax dripping slowly onto parchment in meticulously coded shapes. <words>102</words>
Through the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes, recruits would externalize secrets before they could poison missions. <words>121</words>
Kestrel, a rookie cryptologist, clutched a scuffed phone charger plug like a talisman rescued from mundanity. <words>137</words>
Its frayed metal teeth reminded him how fragile power lines could be when the world decided to cut them. <words>156</words>
Rhizome invited Kestrel into the candlelight first, promising to drain the ache from his memories into communal analysis. <words>174</words>
As wax splattered, the sound of hindsight filled the room, a soft echo like distant applause mixed with thunder. <words>193</words>
Each agent heard it differently, yet all recognized the verdict: every misstep was simultaneously tragedy, joke, and tuition fee. <words>212</words>
Rhizome translated the wax drippings aloud, voices weaving one sentence from dozens of minds, and the charger plug glimmered ominously. <words>232</words>
It spelled a coordinates string leading beneath the training facility, where archived inventions slept like reprimanded children. <words>249</words>
Kestrel realized the scuffed plug fitted one forgotten prototype: a resonance vault designed to capture quantum echoes of decisions. <words>268</words>
Whoever powered it could bottle the moment before regret, selling perfect foresight to the highest bidder or cruelest tyrant. <words>287</words>
That temptation breezed through the night air again, jangling vents like coins, while wax continued its patient punctuation. <words>305</words>
Rhizome asked the class their shared motivation, and every voice, including Kestrel's, replied: to anchor the ephemeral in reality. <words>324</words>
With merry bitterness curling his lips, Kestrel jammed the plug into the vault, not to use it, but to short it forever. <words>346</words>
Sparks bloomed like ironic fireworks while the sound of hindsight howled one last time, then faded into relieved silence. <words>365</words>
Rhizome absorbed the silence, declared the lesson passed, and dozens of agents exhaled, lighter yet wiser within the uniformly peculiar night. <words>386</words>
Outside, dawn sneaked over the horizon, but in the facility's heart the candles kept dripping, preparing new shapes for tomorrow's doubts. <words>407</words>
