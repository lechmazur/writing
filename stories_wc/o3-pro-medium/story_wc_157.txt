I slid between dangling orchid roots and steaming vents toward the heart of Doctor Velasquez's greenhouse. [16]
At midnight the panes pulsed with blue fog, harmless to beetles yet blinding to cameras. [31]
That was my cue. [35]
Officially I was cataloging leafcutter ant dialects for the national Ento-Library, a project nobody ever audits. [51]
Unofficially I served as courier for the secret language club, the last conversational refuge since thoughts became taxable last winter. [71]
They call me a charming rogue scholar, which is kinder than saying professional escape artist. [86]
Charm buys me keycodes; scholarship lets me hide them in footnotes. [97]
Tonight's delivery was a single gourd rattle seed, no bigger than a thumbnail, striped like a fingerprint. [114]
Inside its corklike shell waited a genome reprogrammed to spell recklessness in vines. [127]
Plant the seed in any civic garden and the tendrils would rise in cursive twists that read, 'Not every silence has agreed.' [149]
The phrase was our rallying spark of defiance, designed to remind sleepers they still breathed. [164]
Yet transport alone was meaningless; someone had to plant the message, guard it, interpret the echoes. [180]
That someone was waiting among the cricket terrariums. [188]
I found her pruning a lantern fly, her motions candidly cryptic, like open letters written in code. [205]
Mira Salim spoke first, voice low but unfaltering amid the buzz. [216]
'The taxmen warped the train schedules,' she warned, clipping off a luminous wing for study. [231]
'Roadblocks bloom before dawn.' [235]
Warp was their favorite tactic lately: rearrange infrastructure overnight, confuse memory, bill the confusion as unpaid mental rent. [253]
I slid the seed into her gloved palm. [261]
She didn't close her fingers; instead she raised the kernel to the ghost light and studied its ridges. [279]
'Single shot, high resonance,' she assessed. [285]
Then she smiled—that quicksilver grin that made conspiracies feel like pranks. [296]
I felt the chaos converging, strings pulling every direction yet somehow knotting us together. [310]
The greenhouse trembled as the ventilation reversed, sucking pink mist down to the moss trays. [325]
Security drones hovered outside, their rotors whining like oversized hornets. [335]
Velasquez must have sold our window of invisibility for a tax credit. [347]
Mira tossed me a pair of magnification goggles. [355]
'Time to plant before the crawlspace warps shut,' she said, already striding toward the compost corridor. [371]
We ducked under capillary pipes where mantises nested like green gunmen. [382]
The community gardens lay beyond a single sliding panel guised as a beetle mural, built by the club years ago. [402]
We heaved the panel aside and were greeted by raised beds lit in ultraviolet stripes to coax nocturnal pollinators. [421]
Every bed was a paragraph, every row a verb, every sprout a glyph in our living syntax. [438]
By dawn gardeners would arrive, believing they served civic beautification, never guessing their hoes edited poetry. [454]
Mira knelt in the center bed, her sleeves glowing with bioluminescent spores that mapped longitude. [469]
She pressed the gourd rattle seed into wet mulch and whispered a three-note trill the ants use for emergency exits. [489]
Soil microbes danced, registering the code. [495]
I stood watch, every rustle amplified by the knowledge that curiosity itself accrued interest these days. [511]
To stand guard over my own spark of defiance, I had abandoned tenure, address, even preferred pronouns, but never my notebooks. [532]
Pages of glossed insect stridulations filled my pack, each chirp a receipt proving I still owned my head. [550]
Sudden footsteps clanged along the irrigation rail. [557]
Two drones escorted a lanky auditor wearing neural meters like epaulettes. [568]
His visor flickered, trying to inventory our intentions before we could think them. [581]
Mira touched a vine node; ultraviolet patterns shifted from declarative coils to question marks that made sensors loop indecisively. [600]
The auditor froze, swaying as his meter tried to tax a paradox. [612]
Seizing the moment, I reversed the greenhouse airflow, warping the blue fog inward. [625]
Fog washed over the drones; their optics read only liquid silence. [636]
Mira pulled me through a gap of hanging gourds, laughter rattling like dry seeds. [650]
Behind us the auditor's shouts warped into echoes as if the building refused to remember him. [666]
We emerged onto the service roof, city lights boiling with surveillance blimps and pay-as-you-think kiosks. [681]
From here the community gardens looked like concentric ripples, each plot a syllable soon to sprout revolt. [698]
Mira handed me a second gourd rattle seed, a safety copy, and winked. [711]
'One word isn't enough,' she said; 'tomorrow we plant a sentence.' [722]
Underneath the canopy of drones and debts, her plan sounded impossible, which meant it was necessary. [738]
Chaos converged into a corridor just wide enough for hope. [748]
We followed it into the night, cultivating every unspoken word we hadn't yet been charged for. [764]
