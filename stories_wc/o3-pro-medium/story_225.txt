Rusty portholes rattled as the Oscillating Manta, a steampunk submarine, drifted beneath shattered imperial flags.<words>15</words>
On its observation deck, a wayward apothecary named Silas Thimble poured tinctures into brass telescopic vials.<words>31</words>
His mission, declared during the quiet pause between broken treaties, was to track migratory butterflies glowing with radium dust.<words>50</words>
Negotiators thought the butterflies predicted which empire would next collapse, so Silas sailed neutral depths to chart their luminous swarms.<words>70</words>
Yet his charts kept smudging because his only writing tool was an utterly dry highlighter pen salvaged from a sunken library.<words>91</words>
Despair nipped at him until he noticed another observer watching through a cracked periscope on the opposite balustrade.<words>109</words>
She was Captain Aurelia Gage, commander of a vessel sworn enemy to his sponsors, her expression an unjustly fair balance of caution and wonder.<words>133</words>
Spotting the same butterflies, she tapped on riveted railing in intricate bursts of Morse code signals that echoed like distant bells.<words>154</words>
Silas, fluent in warship clicks, decoded her message: 'Your ink is dead; my heart is not; let us collaborate'.<words>173</words>
He replied by unscrewing a vent, letting steam hiss dots and dashes that confessed his own unconventional love for shared discovery.<words>194</words>
The conversation infected them with reckless courage, spreading through Morse pulses faster than any tincture he had ever brewed.<words>213</words>
Agreeing on a truce of science, they tethered the two submarines side by side, gears gnashing like old sea beasts courting.<words>234</words>
Aurelia produced crystalline ink distilled from coral blood, while Silas offered catalyst powders, and together they revived the dry highlighter pen.<words>255</words>
With newly blazing strokes they mapped butterfly trajectories across parchment, each line humming because the pen now carried microscopic clockwork fireflies.<words>276</words>
Those living lights spelled latent coordinates, revealing where the next treaty would shatter and where refugees might escape.<words>294</words>
Silas and Aurelia realized their data could ransom fortunes, yet the battered marvel of mutual purpose weighed heavier than gold.<words>314</words>
They vowed, again in coded taps, to release findings freely to every faction, hoping knowledge might infect ambition with empathy.<words>334</words>
That night, butterflies swirled against the glass like drifting constellations, and Silas felt treaties inside him mend where fear once tore.<words>355</words>
Aurelia set a gramophone to play cracked waltzes, brass notes dancing amid piston sighs, while the two scribes danced too.<words>375</words>
Their steps traced the same looping paths the butterflies would follow when surface skies healed.<words>390</words>
Outside, silent gunships searched for them, but mist and phosphorescent wings cloaked the allied hulls in shimmering camouflage.<words>408</words>
As dawn gears ticked into motion, Silas signed one last message on Aurelia's palm: 'Love is the fairest sabotage'.<words>427</words>
Her answering smile, unjustly fair and entirely his, confirmed that between broken treaties they had drafted their own binding clause.<words>447</words>
