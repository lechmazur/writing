Bronze skies bruised the horizon as Kavi, a nimble locksmith, rowed toward the impossible orchard.<words>15</words>
It floated on a broad circle of driftwood bobbing in the open seas like an abandoned crown.<words>32</words>
Every branch drooped with apples, yet Kavi focused on the single ancient oak rising amid them.<words>48</words>
Legends claimed that when the final leaf drops from the ancient oak, the orchard would vanish forever.<words>65</words>
Kavi's jaded wonder came not from fruit but from what lay hidden in the rootwork: indigenous dances nearly forgotten.<words>84</words>
He had vowed to preserve them before the sea swallowed their last stage.<words>97</words>
His only clue, a torn map corner, fluttered in his pocket like a nervous moth.<words>112</words>
The scribbled coordinates ended here, but the real directions were rumored to swirl within a storm of secrets.<words>130</words>
That unseen tempest, locals whispered, was physically metaphysical, able to shear memory while leaving clothing unruffled.<words>146</words>
To navigate it, Kavi studied dusty yearbooks with questionable annotations salvaged from shipwrecked schools, noting dancers sketched in margins.<words>165</words>
Each penciled prance across a faded photograph hinted at footfalls matching the orchard's shifting waves.<words>180</words>
Tonight he would test the choreographic compass carved into his bones by ancestors who locked stories inside steps.<words>198</words>
Kavi hopped from the skiff, boots thudding on the driftwood, and apples chimed against each other like wary bells.<words>217</words>
Windless air thickened; nonetheless his limbs began to move, tracing forgotten rhythms that teased salt from his skin.<words>235</words>
With every pivot, the orchard groaned, driftwood creaking as though tuning itself to his pulse.<words>250</words>
Then clouds gathered without sky, an inward cyclone of whispers circling the oak, petitioning him to unlock them.<words>268</words>
He answered by twirling the map corner between fingers, letting its ragged edge slice moonlight into slivers.<words>285</words>
Slivers rained downward, striking the roots like cymbals, and a hatch sprung open beside the trunk.<words>301</words>
Within, bound scrolls described ceremonies extinct on land yet alive in saltwater shadow, awaiting a caretaker.<words>317</words>
But the storm of secrets tightened, jealous of its cargo, and syllables began unraveling from the parchment.<words>334</words>
Kavi clicked open his miniature lockpick kit, flicking tools like tuning forks, aiming to secure language before it dispersed.<words>353</words>
He recognized that every word was a hinge and every breath a latch.<words>366</words>
Lock by lock he sealed the verses into his memory, even as letters dissolved into fragrant apple mist.<words>384</words>
The orchard sighed, relieved, and the invisible cyclone softened into mere wind brushing his cheek.<words>399</words>
At that precise moment the oak's last leaf detached, spiraling upward instead of down, guiding the orchard toward new horizons.<words>419</words>
Driftwood planks rearranged, forming a dance floor where ripples echoed footsteps, promising the tradition would sail on.<words>436</words>
Kavi, exhausted yet triumphant, watched the sea accept its charge as the map corner finally disintegrated in his palm.<words>455</words>
He could not prance another step, but the orchard now remembered the steps for him.<words>470</words>
Somewhere behind the horizon, a new storm brewed, seeking new locks, and he was ready to listen.<words>487</words>
