The chandelier hissed like a dying meteor above the spontaneous combustion lab where I first encountered her. <words>17</words>
She called herself a forgotten noble, yet the dust on her cuffs betrayed centuries of literal neglect. <words>34</words>
That contradiction felt mysteriously obvious, as though paradox were her chosen perfume. <words>46</words>
She offered me tea steeped in risk and a single glance of hollow recklessness. <words>60</words>
Between text messages buzzing in my pocket, she slid an artificial hummingbird drone across the scorched table. <words>77</words>
Its brass wings shivered, releasing sparks like impatient confessions no device should carry. <words>90</words>
She whispered that the drone recorded candor in small moments, distilling truth from sighs and static. <words>106</words>
I recognized a weapon designed to cut through illusions, though she insisted it was only a mirror. <words>123</words>
Still, she begged my help to fortify its memory banks before the next notification chimed. <words>138</words>
Her method, she claimed, lay through the reassembly of old ticket stubs scattered across the concrete floor. <words>155</words>
Each stub was burnt around the edges, a charred autograph of forgotten shows and unsent apologies. <words>171</words>
We knelt among them, arranging dates and torn seat numbers until patterns emerged like reluctant constellations. <words>187</words>
Every placement triggered the drone to flicker, playing back murmurs from strangers who once clutched those stubs. <words>204</words>
Their voices were unguarded, candid shards of laughter caught before theater lights dimmed. <words>217</words>
With each confession, the noble's mask cracked, and I glimpsed a loneliness fierce enough to ignite steel. <words>234</words>
She had curated other people’s sincerity because she feared her own would never be ticketed, never archived. <words>251</words>
The realization arrived while my phone vibrated, reminding me someone elsewhere awaited an answer I could not send. <words>269</words>
Between those messages, time stretched like molten wire, and her desperation radiated enough heat to threaten combustion. <words>286</words>
I saw that fortifying the drone meant cementing her exile behind a wall of other people’s honesty. <words>303</words>
So I reversed the wiring, letting the hummingbird scatter its recordings into the lab’s hungry flames. <words>319</words>
The sparks spelled apologies while rising, yet the noble only watched, expression smoothed into regal ruin. <words>335</words>
Without the burden of borrowed truths, she seemed lighter, though the void in her eyes widened. <words>351</words>
Smoke alarms refused to ring, as if the building conspired to keep her secret. <words>365</words>
I picked up one surviving stub, dated on my birthday, seat A1, show long forgotten. <words>380</words>
Its edges smoldered, offering a mysteriously obvious invitation I accepted with the shrug of someone already burning. <words>397</words>
I slid it into her gloved palm like a final text unsent, and the room breathed out ash. <words>415</words>
She smiled, neither grateful nor cruel, merely present, and that small candor detonated the last illusion between us. <words>433</words>
Somewhere beyond the lab, my phone kept ringing, but I had already stepped into the hush she offered. <words>451</words>
