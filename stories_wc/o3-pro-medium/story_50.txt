Sand made of shattered windows glittered under a white sun, turning the endless plain into the infamous glass desert.<words>19</words>
Elias, an unconvinced missionary with dust in his beard and doubts in his scriptures, trudged alone across the mirage.<words>38</words>
He carried only a tarnished silver fork, once altarware, now compass, its prongs warped yet capriciously consistent in pointing nowhere.<words>58</words>
Each step rang like a bell because the ground was thin as crystal, echoing every quiver of his tested faith.<words>78</words>
Faith, he mused, was easier behind stained glass than upon it.<words>89</words>
But he marched, chasing a rumor that the final monarch butterfly would pass here tonight, carrying the world's last spark of wild magic.<words>112</words>
If he could witness it, perhaps he might become a conduit for magic rather than a courier of borrowed sermons.<words>132</words>
A ruined concert hall, half buried beneath translucent dunes, emerged like a whale skeleton in moonlight.<words>148</words>
Inside, an untuned piano waited, strings loose as sighs, the keys veiled by drifting grit.<words>163</words>
Legend said its dissonant echoes concealed coordinates to hidden wells where sound still flowed as water.<words>179</words>
Elias struck a chord that wasn't, letting the warped notes ricochet among the broken balconies.<words>194</words>
He listened, decoding patterns in the untuned piano's echoes the way desert nomads read cloudless skies.<words>210</words>
Three ascending thuds, two metallic groans, then silence: the sequence spelled north, beneath, fork.<words>224</words>
Obeying, he pried up a floor panel and found a hollow niche shimmering with dust motes.<words>240</words>
He concealed the fork there, as though hiding his own hesitation inside the ruins.<words>254</words>
The moment metal left his hand, the hall quaked softly, and the ceiling opened to the violet dusk.<words>272</words>
Above the breach drifted a single monarch butterfly, wings frayed gold and ember, beating against oblivion.<words>288</words>
Elias knelt in alone intimacy, no congregation, no choir, just the insect and the echo of his choice.<words>306</words>
Without the fork's compass, he had surrendered direction, yet gained stillness enough to feel currents of unseen energy swirl through cracked tiles.<words>328</words>
The butterfly hovered, then landed upon his shoulder like a benediction improvised.<words>340</words>
Its frail antennae brushed his ear, and he heard a whisper asking whether faith must finish where wonder begins.<words>359</words>
His answer, spoken only in breathing, was neither sermon nor creed but a vow to walk wherever silence called.<words>378</words>
As the monarch lifted away toward a thin river of starlight, Elias followed its wavering shadow across the brittle dunes, capriciously consistent at last.<words>402</words>
