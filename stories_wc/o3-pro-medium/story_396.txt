Jules, a charmingly forgetful urban forager, never expected his midnight rummage through abandoned Parisian rooftops to end beneath the city in a champagne vault. <words>24</words>
Yet there he stood, clutching a fragment of a stained-glass window that glimmered like condensed dawn in the dim cellar light. <words>45</words>
He had pried the shard from a collapsed cathedral attic, believing it a fragile wonder worth shielding from souvenir hunters. <words>65</words>
Now the vault, normally echoing with sommelier whispers, vibrated with the final performance of an avant-garde orchestra rehearsing above, their basses shaking dust from imperial bottles. <words>91</words>
Each resonant thrum threatened to shatter the glassware around him, and the relic inside his coat. <words>107</words>
Only minutes earlier, he had wandered into a riverside science fair while chasing rumors of edible lichens, and fate spun on a chance encounter with Dr. Selma Qamar. <words>135</words>
Selma, a materials physicist showcasing acoustic crystallography, noticed the shard protruding from Jules's satchel and, with disinterested passion, asked where he had found such medieval photonic glass. <words>162</words>
His answer, 'Some roof,' was honest, charming, and annoyingly vague, so she invited him to the subterranean hall where her experiment accompanied the orchestra's gala debut. <words>188</words>
The cultural clash between Selma's clinical precision and Jules's scavenger intuition crackled brighter than the jeweled shard itself. <words>206</words>
Still, she needed that glass to calibrate her sonic lasers, and he needed it hidden from museum bureaucrats, so they agreed to negotiate. <words>229</words>
Their talks unfolded between cello crescendos, Selma offering lab sanctuary in return for temporary study, Jules demanding quiet storage far from tourist eyes. <words>252</words>
Whenever agreement seemed near, Jules forgot what clause he had proposed and smiled apologetically, an endearing loop that softened Selma's analytical guard. <words>274</words>
Above them, the orchestra reached its finale, timpani punches raining through the ceiling like hail on crystal, and the vault's cork racks quivered. <words>297</words>
A magnum toppled, bursting, champagne mist sizzling across flagstones, reminding Jules that wonders, however swaddled, can vanish in an instant. <words>317</words>
Fear sharpened his memory: he outlined the final terms with sudden clarity; Selma would hold the shard only until her lasers mapped its lattice, then return it to a hidden reliquary within the catacombs. <words>351</words>
She agreed, signing a napkin with carbon ink as violins gasped their last note, sealing contract and concert simultaneously. <words>370</words>
Jules slipped the shard into an insulated sample tube, and together they climbed the spiral stairs, indifferent on the surface yet inwardly ablaze with shared guardianship. <words>396</words>
On the street, festival fireworks painted the Seine with transient color, but the two co-conspirators watched without comment, content that the fragile wonder was, for now, unseen and safe. <words>425</words>
Jules promptly forgot Selma's surname, but he would remember the resonance of cork pops, timpani shocks, and one improbable negotiation that saved a sliver of forgotten sunrise. <words>452</words>
