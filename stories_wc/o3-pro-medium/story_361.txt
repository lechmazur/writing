Neal Ashen, a mild-mannered trapper from the northern flats, pushed through the neon swing-door of the retro-futuristic diner. <words>18</words>
Chrome jukeboxes hummed beside wood-fired stoves, an organized disorder that felt both yesterday and tomorrow. <words>33</words>
He arrived at the brink of change, pockets rattling with a single dice instead of coins. <words>49</words>
The dice was carved from caribou antler by his grandmother, a reminder of stories waiting rescue. <words>65</words>
Those stories, fragments of indigenous knowledge, flickered like stove flame across his memory. <words>78</words>
To guard that flame, he had sworn to become a guardian of the hearth, whatever form the hearth took. <words>97</words>
Rumor said the boarded-up schoolhouse outside town still whispered its equations to anyone willing to listen. <words>113</words>
Neal was mechanically intuitive, able to hear gears in thoughts, so he decided to listen with chalk. <words>130</words>
First, though, he needed a model to emulate, and the diner's eccentric cook, Rima Coil, offered one. <words>147</words>
Rima emulsified espresso with rendered tallow, claiming the taste revealed time's hidden vectors. <words>160</words>
She slid the antler dice across the counter, eyes reflecting stove fire and fluorescent circuits. <words>175</words>
"Chance is a wheel," she said, "but guidance is a lattice--both belong on your chalkboard." <words>190</words>
Taking her cryptic blessing, Neal trekked to the abandoned school where broken boards banged like metronomes in the wind. <words>209</words>
Moonlight leaked through bullet holes, illuminating scattered chalk equations on every wall, desk, and even ceiling tile. <words>226</words>
Children had once balanced sled-runners and snowdrifts in those formulas, embedding weather lore beneath algebra. <words>241</words>
Neal laid the dice on the teacher's podium, emulating Rima's lattice by mapping each face to an elder's tale. <words>260</words>
Then his mechanically intuitive mind spun, reading the scattered symbols as gears, pistons, and stove flues. <words>276</words>
He chalked new lines, bridging meteorology with migration, metallurgy with myth, until the room thrummed like a locomotive hearth. <words>295</words>
Outside, dawn engines coughed as the town council prepared to replace every stove with synthetic heat panels. <words>312</words>
The brink of change had arrived, and without the rescued equations, the panels would erase cycles the trappers tracked for centuries. <words>333</words>
Neal swept the chalk dust, folded the boards outward, and walked back to the diner carrying a notebook of living algebra. <words>354</words>
Rima stoked her wood-fired stove higher, and the jukeboxes quieted as if paying respect to the unfolding hearth. <words>372</words>
Together they transcribed the equations onto napkins, coasters, and touchscreen menus, seeding knowledge where patrons could taste and read simultaneously. <words>392</words>
The diner became a hearth humming with chrome and cedar, its disorder meticulously organized around song, soup, and symbols. <words>411</words>
When officials arrived brandishing sleek heaters, Neal rolled the dice, and chance clattered against lattice, choosing Rima's stove as demonstration site. <words>432</words>
The antique flames rose precisely with the heater's current, emulating its efficiency while revealing aromatic data encoded in cedar smoke. <words>452</words>
Officials, tasting espresso-tallow and reading napkin calculus, postponed the replacement, granting space for the rescued stories to circulate. <words>470</words>
Neal smiled softly, a mild-mannered trapper still, yet now unquestioned guardian of the hearth at a town reborn. <words>488</words>
