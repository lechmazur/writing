The wandering orchardist, a trustworthy unique soul named Liora, surfaced her scuffed skiff beside the forgotten underwater city hall.<words>19</words>
Rumor said its drowned corridors still breathed politics if you entered at slack tide and listened for bubbles.<words>37</words>
Liora came neither for ghosts nor governance but to reclaim something old that could guide something new.<words>54</words>
Her burlap satchel held a painstakingly curated collection of dried leaves, each tagged with latitude, longitude, and season.<words>72</words>
To map trade routes for orchards scattered across universes, she believed climate stories whispered by dead foliage were indispensable.<words>91</words>
Yet several coordinates were smudged, lost during storms, and only the submerged archives below might verify their ink.<words>109</words>
She secured breathing moss around her mouth, then slipped through a broken council window festooned with barnacles like municipal medals.<words>129</words>
The atrium, flooded emerald by algae, was patrolled by a single phantom hand visible only as ripples disobeying physics.<words>148</words>
Legend promised that whoever approached respectfully could borrow its touch to unlock sealed drawers no living limb could budge.<words>167</words>
Liora laid her leaf collection like an offering upon the cracked marble podium where motions once passed or perished.<words>186</words>
She spoke kitchen table wisdom taught by elders who pruned by moonlight: respect roots, barter fair, remember every seed's story.<words>206</words>
The water around her stilled, and via the touch of a phantom hand she felt forgotten mandates muster at her knuckles.<words>227</words>
Columns groaned while drawers within the mayoral dais popped open, releasing scrolls sealed since the referendum that sank the city.<words>247</words>
Each parchment listed commerce winds, migratory bees, and soil salinities charted across dimensions, exactly the coordinates her smudged labels lacked.<words>267</words>
But the scrolls were bound by rusted rings that would disintegrate if pulled by human haste.<words>283</words>
Again the phantom hand intervened, slipping through metal like silt, freeing the pages with a tenderness bureaucracy never mastered.<words>302</words>
In that moment, Liora sensed other versions of herself across the infinite possibilities of a multiverse bending toward similar desks.<words>322</words>
Some failed, some drowned, yet their collective yearning traveled wave to wave until it gathered in this single gesture.<words>341</words>
She rolled the liberated scrolls into waterproof tubes, slid them among the dried leaves, and bowed toward the unseen clerk.<words>361</words>
A tremor shivered through pillars as though the city, proud even in ruin, approved of new cartographies sprouting from old.<words>381</words>
Liora resurfaced under purple dawn, coughing seawater and resolve, clutching knowledge lighter than air yet heavier than obligation.<words>399</words>
Her mapmaking would redirect caravans of saplings away from drought realms toward moist plateaus, saving orchards she had not yet planted.<words>420</words>
Still, she tasted brine that reminded her every salvation costs a submersion, and some costs echo forever between worlds.<words>439</words>
With bittersweet grit, the trustworthy unique orchardist rowed toward the horizon, planning the next reclamation already rustling inside her satchel.<words>459</words>
