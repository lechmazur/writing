In the leaf classification office overlooking a soaked meadow, Bram the solitary birdwatcher filed leaves instead of birds, anxiously relaxed under flickering fluorescent tubes.<words>24</words>
He was stationed there during a cosmic blink, the infinitesimal pause between universal heartbeats that made the ceiling clock hesitate like a frightened finch.<words>48</words>
Each pause reminded him that silence can outshout artillery, a theorem of the power of nonviolence he guarded more jealously than any field notebook.<words>72</words>
Yet bitterness braided through the quiet like brambles, because his supervisor demanded numerical leaf codes while clouds outside spelled omens nobody else read.<words>95</words>
Bram kept a mask made from shattered porcelain shards hidden in his drawer, fragments from an antique dove he had accidentally dropped when peace first cracked.<words>121</words>
He believed that wearing it at the destined moment would slice certainty, letting cosmic chaos assert itself as rightful heir to all labeled things.<words>145</words>
The moment arrived when a courier wheeled in marble tablets the administration intended to standardize every leaf vein in the hemisphere.<words>166</words>
The polished marble floor mirrored the tablets, and Bram saw ghostlike reflections flutter across the stone like translucent starlings, signaling revolt.<words>187</words>
He lifted the drawer to kilter the office's symmetry, papers avalanching while he pressed the porcelain mask against his face, edges biting gentle reminders.<words>211</words>
Behind the jagged smile he walked to the courier, not striking, only standing so close that the air itself rearranged into unsettled feathers.<words>234</words>
The courier, sensing something older than violence, set the tablets down softly, as though placing hatchlings back in a nest after premature capture.<words>257</words>
Bram spoke, his voice a cracked whistle of winter thrush: 'Catalog nothing; let disorder sprout like wings you forgot you owned.'<words>278</words>
Words ricocheted off the marble into their reflections, multiplying sermons in a hall of ghost glass, until even the ceiling clock resumed its stalled beat.<words>303</words>
Leaves swept by the ventilation ducts spiraled upward, freed from bins, clustering around Bram as a swirling taxonomy of mutiny.<words>323</words>
The supervisor burst in, indignation puffed like a turkey's wattle, but she halted upon seeing the mirrored starlings circling above the courier's bowed head.<words>347</words>
Bram merely removed the mask, revealing a face still bleeding pinpoints of red where porcelain pressed, and offered her the shards to examine gently.<words>371</words>
She looked at her own ghost in the shards, saw how exactness had sliced her spirit dull, and lowered her clipboard without a word.<words>395</words>
In that surrendered hush, during the same cosmic blink that had incubated Bram's resolve, the entire office exhaled disorder, and life reentered kilter.<words>418</words>
