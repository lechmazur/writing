Mist hung over the canal, thick as unspoken promises. [9]  
The rain had stopped minutes ago, leaving the wooden planks slick and cobalt. [22]  
Reflected lampfire trembled like captive moons across the cobalt dock after rain. [34]  
I waited in that stillwater tension, breath shallow but unwavering. [44]  
Somewhere beneath the boards, water sighed the story of arrival and departure. [56]  
He emerged without ripple from the shadows under Archlight Bridge. [66]  
They called him the silent canal guardian, though no call had ever left his lips. [81]  
He carried neither badge nor lantern, only a small dental mirror glinting between fingers. [95]  
Its circle flashed once, as though tasting the damp air for reflections to borrow. [109]  
I had come to trade secrets, and he had come to listen without hearing. [123]  
When he faced me, his gaze was spiralingly calm, drawing thought inward like slow whirlpools. [138]  
No question passed between us, yet I felt the pull of silent empathy shaping conversation. [153]  
A shuttered boathouse loomed behind him, its windows barred, its stories padlocked. [165]  
He gestured toward it, then toward the water, inviting me to move but never to speak. [181]  
I followed, boots sliding, heartbeat weaving threads between raindrops that still clung to ropes. [195]  
Inside the boathouse, dust and dew combined into a perfume of neglect. [207]  
Rows of wooden shutters leaned against the walls like sleeping wings. [218]  
He lifted two and handed one to me, the dented mirror balanced atop them. [232]  
Only then did I understand his craft: creating patterns with shutters, weaving shadow and light across the canal. [250]  
The shutters would open and close in rhythm, directing moonbeams like disciplined dancers. [263]  
The mirror amplified them, catching stray glints, bending them onto the water's face. [276]  
Together, the apparatus painted constellations that drifted with the tide. [286]  
He sought, I realized, to teach darkness the value of stars. [297]  
Night in this quarter was thick, swollen by factory smoke and unresolved quarrels. [310]  
People forgot to look up; he aimed to remind the river first. [322]  
If the water remembered starlight, perhaps the city above would follow its reflection. [335]  
Still, there was cost: every pattern required a memory to power it, a secret unspooled into radiance. [352]  
That was why he had summoned me. [359]  
My pocket held such a memory, trembling like heat in a clenched fist. [372]  
It lay within the edge of a half-spoken secret, one I had never dared finish. [387]  
Years ago, I had watched my brother dive into these waters and not return. [401]  
His echo haunted the canal, humming in iron moorings and broken oars. [413]  
I had spoken of it to nobody, fearing grief would crystallize. [424]  
The guardian's calm spiraled around me, coaxing the words I lacked. [435]  
I nodded, and he lifted the mirror, aligning it with the open doorway. [448]  
Moonlight poured in like a silver river, striking the mirror, rebounding onto aligned shutters. [462]  
He tapped once; the shutters flickered, creating patterns with shutters that resembled my brother's favorite constellation, The Ferryman. [480]  
I felt the secret loosen, weave itself into the moving geometry. [491]  
Warm tears cooled instantly in the night air. [499]  
Outside, the water accepted the light, scattering it across ripples like shards of mirror. [513]  
Small children on distant balconies gasped, seeing stars where none had been before. [526]  
I closed my eyes and heard, for the first time, the guardian's voice, though he spoke not. [543]  
It lived in the hush between shutter beats, saying only that pain is a map, not a cage. [561]  
The patterns brightened, and a second constellation formed, unknown to any chart. [573]  
I recognized it as possibility. [578]  
Breath returned to me whole, and the canal guardian lowered the mirror. [590]  
The shutters settled, but their wood glowed faintly, storing the patterns for another night. [604]  
He returned my gaze, questioning whether the darkness in me had learned its lesson. [618]  
I answered by opening the boathouse door, allowing stray streetlight to mingle with moonlight on the floorboards. [635]  
Some sadness remained, but it floated now, lit from beneath like a lantern boat. [649]  
The guardian inclined his head, approval silent yet audible in my chest. [661]  
He stepped back into the canal, vanishing as ripples reunited above him. [673]  
The dock stood empty, but my world felt newly occupied by patient stars. [686]  
I walked home alongside the water, carrying no mirror yet reflecting everything. [698]  
Behind me, shutters whispered shut, weaving the night closed without erasing its light. [711]  
And so darkness kept its stars, and a half-spoken secret found its sky. [724]
