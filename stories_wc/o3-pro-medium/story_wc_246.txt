Orbiting the silent rift near Epsilon Carinae, I studied the shifting debris of the latest gravitational anomaly. [17]  
Tiny moons corkscrewed like distracted bees, yet their turbulence wrapped me in strange comfort. [31]  
I am a celestial signal interpreter, sworn to translate the pulses that leak from collapsed futures. [47]  
Each pulse hints at what once wished to be, allowing one to edit the universe as an attentive copyeditor might polish a draft. [70]  
But my tools, like my faith, had grown brittle after planting the wrong seeds of probability last cycle. [88]  
In the trembling satchel at my hip rattled a dried-up fountain pen with exotic nib, its reservoir clogged by regret. [108]  
Once the pen drafted amendments across spacetime vellum, but now it refused even a scratch, mocking my purpose. [126]  
I floated toward the largest shard of basalt moon, a jagged platform where gravity curled sideways. [142]  
There, the pulses grew louder, overlapping like pages being shuffled in panic. [154]  
They spoke of civilizations that tried to unbend destiny yet succeeded only in knotting it tighter. [170]  
I understood their ache, because my last intervention had sprouted calamities instead of cures. [184]  
Still, I remained confidently uncertain, a state engineers ridicule but poets trust. [196]  
If uncertainty is confessed with confidence, the cosmos sometimes answers with options. [208]  
My plan was simple: rekindle the pen, listen anew, and through contingent relationships between failing worlds, rewrite only the commas of existence, not the nouns. [233]  
A comma pauses, it does not erase, and pauses are where meaning can be threshed. [248]  
Yes, I sought to thresh meaning from experience, not harvest certainties that rot on arrival. [263]  
First, I needed ink, and the anomaly itself offered a distillate of stretched time. [277]  
I anchored my boots to the basalt, pricked my finger, and let the droplet spiral outward until gravity recognized it as local. [299]  
The drop elongated, forming a ruby filament, then snapped back, drenching the nib with borrowed momentum. [315]  
The pen shivered, clearing its throat like an aging diplomat preparing a necessary apology. [329]  
My wrist twitched as the pulses steered my hand toward the black void between two tumbling satellites. [346]  
There, written in invisible glyphs, hovered the chronicle of what we would call yesterday, if yesterday still referred to something fixed. [367]  
I began editing history carefully, converting catastrophic verbs to subjunctive hopes, all while leaving their roots intact. [384]  
For the civilization of Heliora, I replaced 'collapsed' with 'almost collapsed,' granting them the wiggle room courage requires. [402]  
For the migratory libraries of Ventress, I inserted a single pause before the word 'burned,' enough to let rainfall arrive. [422]  
Through such commas, possibilities inhaled, fluttered, and took tentative root in soil that had once been salt. [439]  
Yet the more I wrote, the colder the basalt felt, as if the moon disapproved of being footnoted. [457]  
I paused, letting ink drip into vacuum, and considered the ethic of commas. [470]  
Was I truly helping, or merely postponing louder collapses that would require semicolons next time? [485]  
The pulses answered with a surge that rattled my bones and flared the anomaly into a glowing iris. [503]  
Within that eye I saw myself earlier, planting the wrong seeds, laughing at gravity like a novice gardener. [521]  
The image flickered, offering a single revision: do not laugh, listen. [532]  
If I accepted this, the chain of edits might tighten into a noose, but if I refused, the garden would remain barren. [554]  
I uncoupled the pen, folded my fingers, and listened, letting the pulses speak without translation. [569]  
They told me history disliked being corrected; it preferred being accompanied, the way a river prefers stones that roll beside it not dams that block it. [595]  
So I unbent my ambitions, deciding to travel alongside events rather than ahead of them. [610]  
The pen, sensing retirement, released a final bead of ink that joined the ruby filament and sealed the edits already made. [631]  
From that seal blossomed a soft chime, neither approval nor censure, simply the audible sigh of narrative continuity. [649]  
I felt no triumph, only a gently weighted peace, the kind that floats yet keeps your boots honest. [667]  
Confidently uncertain, I packed the pen, unclipped my anchor, and drifted into the spiraling moons, ready to read rather than rewrite. [688]  
Through contingent relationships yet unformed, meaning would thresh itself, and I would be present, listening inside the gravity of its unfolding. [709]  
Behind me, the anomaly closed like a well-placed comma, promising nothing, permitting everything. [722]
