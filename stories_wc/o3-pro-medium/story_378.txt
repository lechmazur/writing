The carnival's colored lanterns dimmed as vendors folded tents under the first rays of dawn. <words>15</words>
Beside the muddy road, Bartholomew Crake, accidental mayor of Marshbridge, watched with reluctant awe. <words>29</words>
He was lovably grumpy, scowling even while pressing pastries into passing children's hands. <words>42</words>
No one else had shown up for the recent election, so responsibility glued itself to him like swamp gnats. <words>61</words>
Now fate felt heavier than the brass keys jangling from his belt. <words>73</words>
He turned toward the polluted swamp orchard where the monks cultivated pears fed by sickly water. <words>89</words>
If Marshbridge was to survive, that water had to remember its forgotten wisdom. <words>102</words>
Bartholomew had learned the phrase 'water wisdom' yesterday, overhearing a hushed argument in a crowded cafe. <words>118</words>
Two strangers whispered about a clockwork beetle that could metamorphose poisoned streams into crystal arteries. <words>133</words>
The beetle, they said, slept somewhere among the monks' trees, waiting for one worthy of change. <words>149</words>
Bartholomew neither believed in mechanical miracles nor in his own worthiness. <words>160</words>
Yet the memory clung, as carnival confetti clung to his boots. <words>171</words>
So he trudged past wilted banners toward the orchard, the dawn painting oil-slick rainbows across floodwater puddles. <words>188</words>
The reclusive monks emerged like silhouettes, their robes smelling of peat and fermenting fruit. <words>202</words>
One, a stooped sister named Mirelle, blocked his path with a pruning hook. <words>215</words>
'Mayor by accident, purpose by choice,' she croaked, revealing she too had eavesdropped at the cafe. <words>231</words>
Bartholomew admitted his desire to change the course of fate for their drowning town. <words>245</words>
Mirelle's eyes softened, though her mouth stayed in its permanent, lovably grumpy frown. <words>258</words>
She led him through rows of trees whose leaves glistened with petrol instead of dew. <words>273</words>
At the orchard's heart stood a stone cistern choked by algae the color of rust. <words>288</words>
Perched upon its rim was the clockwork beetle, copper wings folded, gears ticking like distant applause. <words>304</words>
Bartholomew felt ridiculous addressing an insect, but awe, however reluctant, poured from his throat. <words>318</words>
'Water remembers truth,' he whispered, echoing the strangers' phrase as sunrise kissed the beetle's shell. <words>333</words>
The beetle's antennae spun, and its carapace split, releasing a pulse of humming sapphire mist. <words>348</words>
Swamp gas shimmered, metamorphosing into clear vapor that drifted upward like redeemed breath. <words>361</words>
Within seconds the cistern water clarified, revealing coins, bones, and forgotten wishes on its floor. <words>376</words>
Trees inhaled the change; their leaves flushed green, and pears fattened with sweet translucence. <words>390</words>
Mirelle laughed like gravel in a stream, her hook now cutting celebratory ribbons from the air. <words>406</words>
Bartholomew saw reflections of carnival rides in the fresh water and understood balance had returned. <words>421</words>
He also understood his own metamorphosis: from unwilling place-holder to shepherd of second chances. <words>435</words>
The monks bowed, and the sun lifted fully, scattering the last carnival wagons like timid ghosts. <words>451</words>
Bartholomew picked up the ticking beetle, tucked it beside his brass keys, and walked toward town. <words>467</words>
Dawn tasted cleaner on his tongue, and destiny felt lighter in his pocket. <words>480</words>
