Ronan, a naive gambler who still believed probability could be charmed by a smile, arrived at the isolated tidal power monitoring station shortly before dusk.<words>25</words>
He claimed victory on a crooked ferry game had won him the right to dock his borrowed sloop at the service pier for the night.<words>50</words>
The engineer on duty, Dr. Mireille Vox, found him entertaining, for her evenings were rarely predictable among humming turbines and statistical readouts.<words>72</words>
She invited Ronan to share her ritual candlelit dinners, an improvised romance performed beside oscilloscopes while wind howled through broken shutters.<words>93</words>
Instead of candles she poured molten wax into a rustic candle mold her grandmother had traded for sea glass, letting the new taper cool as conversation warmed.<words>120</words>
Ronan, smelling fortune in every flicker, spoke of unspoken bargains he sensed swirling between the moon-pulled tides and the station’s silent turbines.<words>142</words>
Mireille laughed until tears streaked soot down her cheeks, explaining that the only bargains here were maintenance contracts signed by ghosts of drowned investors.<words>166</words>
Yet her laughter carried the tremor of someone determined to capture one last spark before oblivion erased every shoreline equation.<words>186</words>
She confessed the station would be decommissioned at dawn, its research deemed irrelevant now that bureaucrats worshiped solar satellites.<words>205</words>
Still, an unhinged professor from her university would arrive by skiff, planning to give rebellious midnight lectures about tidal consciousness to any gullible ear.<words>229</words>
Ronan tasted opportunity the way gamblers taste whiskey they cannot afford, and he wagered his company for the professor’s secret equations.<words>250</words>
Mireille laid the cooled candle between them like a dealer lays chips, stating the house rule: every bet must burn itself for light.<words>273</words>
They struck a match, and in the wobbly glow made an unspoken bargain to merge luck with science just long enough to fool eternity.<words>297</words>
The professor’s skiff approached, hull slapping chop, and Ronan ran to dock it, heart thundering like dice in a shaken cup.<words>318</words>
From the cockpit the professor hurled pages of formulas that fluttered around the pier like deranged gulls, each equation promising perpetual motion through sheer defiance.<words>343</words>
Lightning forked offshore, the candle sputtered, and everyone burst into laughing tears at the ridiculous hope they shared amid collapsing infrastructure.<words>364</words>
Mireille gathered the scattered sheets, Ronan steadied the professor, and together they fed both parchment and candle to the sea-drenched generator intake.<words>386</words>
For one impossible minute the turbines roared awake, spraying sparks over the black water like newborn constellations, and the monitoring monitors registered infinity before frying.<words>411</words>
In that phosphorescent hush, Ronan realized the real wager had never been money but the chance to witness a miracle no ledger could record.<words>435</words>
The power died, dawn bled gray over the waves, and three conspirators stood quietly, pockets empty yet eyes blazing with memory’s stubborn light.<words>458</words>
Without a word, they pushed the skiff back to sea, content that oblivion would find them later, long after the spark’s laughter finished echoing.<words>482</words>
