Felius Pattern, widely known as the most underachieving mage in the Cloud College, stared at the sunrise without expectation. [19]
He occupied the balcony of an icebound spire above the clouds, a place so high the air rang brittle. [38]
Although the bell chimed shift-change across the automated Scriptorium, Felius lingered, nursing the last private moments before machines claimed the muses. [59]
This was, he felt, the hour when creativity gets automated yet still forgets to close the door behind it. [78]
That sliver of abandonment let true ideas draft in like wild birds. [90]
But he had none to keep. [96]
Mastery had eluded Felius since childhood, when every incantation sputtered out in brilliant dimness, aglow yet useless. [113]
Today he carried only a dusty satchel and a half-remembered hope to find the sacred in the simple. [131]
The satchel contained the garden folly keystone he had stolen from the Chancellor's hedge-maze before dawn. [147]
Legends insisted the stone once supported an arch that accommodates impossibilities, causing poets to pass through walls of doubt unscathed. [167]
If that were true, Felius needed it more than any poet. [178]
At sunrise the keystone began pulsing with a faint lingering luminance, neither bright nor extinguished, like a promise refusing categories. [198]
He pressed it against his chest, and the satchel straps loosened as though eager to unstrap themselves from mediocrity. [217]
Mist rose from the gulf below the balcony, coiling like incubating thought. [229]
Remembering a forbidden technique, he stepped forward and let the vapor swallow his boots, beginning the ancient art of mist walking. [250]
The world muffled to a hush, and each exhale hung as silver ribbon guiding him downward yet somehow up. [269]
Such was the paradox of the spire: directions behaved like untrained pets, turning circles for their own amusement. [287]
Felius allowed himself to spiral until a landing manifested, an impossible balcony facing an inner shaft of hoarfrost and echoes. [307]
Within the shaft hovered cogwork quills etching sonnets on self-turning scrolls, proof that the age of automated creativity thrived even here. [328]
Their lines glittered, yet no warmth accompanied the shine, only the chill of brilliance without breath. [344]
Felius clutched the glowing keystone, emboldened by its lingering luminance, and spoke to the quills with a cracked voice. [363]
"Show me verse that tastes of rainwater and turnip stew," he pleaded, seeking the sacred in the simple. [381]
The quills paused, gears ticking like insects trapped in amber algorithms. [392]
Then they resumed, but the new stanzas collapsed midletter, unable to parse a request beyond categorical genius. [409]
Their ink fell as frozen tears. [415]
Disappointed yet resolute, Felius realized the machinery could fabricate brilliance in endless loops, but not the brilliant dimness of an unhurried dusk. [437]
That quality lived where mistakes fluttered and small stones carried prayers. [448]
He lifted the keystone overhead; its luminance seeped into the frost, warming outlines of invisible stairs descending deeper into the tower heart. [470]
Each tread appeared only when his foot hovered, as though the architecture waited for belief before existing. [487]
The property that accommodates impossibilities felt courteous rather than chaotic, inviting him to continue. [501]
At the bottom, a circular chamber cradled a solitary brazier emitting mere embers, fragile against polar gloom. [518]
Felius set the keystone beside the coals, and stone met ember with a soft consonant sound, like two consonants kissing. [538]
A hush expanded, then the brazier flared, not fiercely but in lingering luminance, painting the walls in slow-moving dawn. [557]
Letters appeared on the stones, handwritten by light itself, listing ordinary blessings: cracked cups, uneven lullabies, neighbors who wave from windows. [578]
Felius read them aloud, and with each word the chamber brightened yet seemed dimmer, for his pupils adapted to new gentleness. [599]
The brilliance no longer bludgeoned; it rested, a brilliant dimness that could share space with shadow without argument. [617]
In that moderation Felius felt his first true spell rising, uncoached, as simple as breathing into cold palms. [635]
He whispered the blessings again, and warmth threaded outward through floors and stairwells, disarming the icebound spire's perpetual shiver. [654]
Far above, the cogwork quills faltered, confused by humidity, their gears chewing soggy genius into mulch. [670]
Felius almost pitied them, yet automation had never bothered to pity him. [682]
He retrieved the keystone; its glow had steadied, a pocket-sun he could carry back to lower worlds. [699]
As he began mist walking upward, the straps slipped willingly over his shoulders, honoring an underachieving mage who finally underachieved at failure. [721]
Outside, dawn sharpened, but inside him lingered the soft, sacred dimness he had sought, bright enough to guide, dim enough to keep wondering. [744]
And the spire, now modestly warm, accommodated that impossibility with quiet satisfaction. [756]
