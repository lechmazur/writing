Liora tried to memorize the texture of voices because faces slipped from her mind like chalk in rain. [18]  
She was a portrait artist who could not recognize a single nose, yet commissions kept arriving, drawn by her uncanny renderings of what people felt, not looked. [45]  
To catch emotions she retreated each dawn into the tree trunk library hollowed by a scholars' guild centuries earlier, its rings still smelling of sap and slow thunder. [73]  
Here, beneath shelves grown directly from living cambium, heightened stillness settled like pollen, and her face blindness felt less a flaw than a tuning fork. [98]  
One fog-heavy morning the guild's warden summoned her to a knotwork alcove and unlatched a secret book safe disguised as a treatise on migratory clouds. [123]  
Inside rested a centuries-old coin so worn its monarch had become a ghost, yet faint indentations still spiraled across the metal like collapsed constellations. [147]  
The warden believed the coin described a blueprint no eye could read, and wanted Liora to decipher it through her alternative senses. [169]  
In return he offered the abandoned Zephyr Observatory, slated for demolition at sundown, as an unlimited canvas for her next mural. [190]  
Liora had long nursed the impossible desire to mirror the sky inside walls, so she accepted before her doubt could report for duty. [213]  
That evening, she sat beneath the library's lantern fungi and studied the coin, letting fingertips rather than pupils travel its microscopic ridges. [235]  
Patterns emerged, fractally precise, each whorl revealing a smaller echo until sense of scale dissolved like salt in tidewater. [254]  
Through those faint indentations on a centuries-old coin she felt the whisper of something testing the edge of being, discovering limits simply to step beyond them. [280]  
The message resolved as one instruction: craft. [287]  
Craft without sight, craft beyond likeness, craft until substance obeys the weather of your intention. [302]  
At dawn she hurried to the observatory, whose dome crouched amid scaffolding like a tired moon pinned with metallic stitches. [322]  
City crews lingered elsewhere signing permits, and the hush just before a condemned building is demolished stretched wide as a held breath. [344]  
Inside, plaster flakes littered the floor like unmapped stars, waiting to be named. [357]  
Liora unpacked jars of mineral pigment, a ladder, and a battered metronome that ticked slower than heartbeats to preserve the chapel stillness. [379]  
She blindfolded herself, letting canvas dropcloth guide her soles, and began to paint solely by temperature, sound bounce, and memory of open skies. [402]  
Strokes rose in concentric bands, ultramarine breathing into indigo, cobalt dissolving into dawn pink, each gradient mapped by the fractally precise rhythm of her fingertips. [427]  
Because she could not picture faces, she painted the sky's innumerable moods: the melancholy held between twin storm fronts, the laughter spilled by sudden sunshafts, the stoicism of winter noon. [457]  
Hours dissolved, and the dome transformed into an inward cosmos where any gaze might forget walls altogether. [474]  
As shadows lengthened, wrecking crews filed in, bringing the vibrating silence that precedes metal jaws closing. [490]  
Their foreman entered first, expecting graffiti, and instead found himself beneath an aurora that seemed to answer his every blink. [510]  
He radioed managers but could describe nothing coherent, because the painting shifted with his voice, mirroring internal weather as faithfully as the external firmament. [534]  
Liora removed her blindfold only when she heard the crew fall silent, recognizing the pause of beings who have just met their own limits. [558]  
The warden arrived breathless, carrying the secret book safe, and placed it at the dome's center as though returning a heart to its chest. [582]  
Some unseen latch clicked, and from the safe rose a cold scent of high altitude, scattering dust motes into constellations, consecrating the hush that now would never be broken by demolition. [613]  
The city rescinded the order, claiming structural historical value, but Liora knew the real reinforcement lay in the unseeable architecture she had crafted beyond the old limits. [640]  
For the first time she looked upon a room and saw no faces, no walls, only sky folding forever into itself, intricately familiar and endlessly new. [666]
