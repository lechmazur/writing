Mayor Elio Voss stood trembling behind the boarded window of his penthouse office. <words>13</words>
Outside, the city square roared like surf he refused to touch. <words>24</words>
His agoraphobia, whispered about by aides, had become public after the last parade fiasco. <words>38</words>
Yet election day loomed, and he sensed the voters smelled weakness. <words>49</words>
On his walnut desk lay the golden snuffbox with a hidden switch, inherited from earlier Vosses who also governed. <words>68</words>
It was said to contain a map, or perhaps absolution; either would suffice. <words>81</words>
Elio considered the family legend of inherited burdens that passed through hinges and bloodlines alike. <words>96</words>
A muffled knock cracked the quiet like a pistol. <words>105</words>
It was Gita, his speechwriter, soaked by rain and carrying a sand-dusted umbrella. <words>118</words>
Storms rarely reached the whispering dunes beyond the ring road, but tonight wind had braided desert and cloud. <words>136</words>
She said music from the festival stage kept stalling, leaving uneasy silences between songs. <words>150</words>
Those pauses, she claimed, were messages for him delivered via the rhythm of the rain on canvas roofs. <words>168</words>
Elio, eager but resigned, wondered if destiny itself had chosen an interval to negotiate. <words>182</words>
He pocketed the snuffbox, its metal warm like a trapped heartbeat. <words>193</words>
Gita unfolded a poncho and insisted the mayor follow her to the roof atrium. <words>207</words>
Glass panels rattled, and city lights shivered beneath the watery veil. <words>218</words>
Elio’s panic rose, but a sudden musical interlude from the festival drifted upward, then cut off. <words>234</words>
Between songs, the rain tapped a simple five-beat pattern on the skylight. <words>246</words>
Crack, pause, tap-tap, pause, tap—it repeated, begging interpretation. <words>254</words>
Gita whispered that the pattern matched the mechanism inside the snuffbox. <words>265</words>
Elio’s fingers traced the filigree until he felt a subtle ridge. <words>276</words>
Synchronizing his presses with the watery percussion, he triggered the hidden switch. <words>288</words>
The lid sprang, revealing a folded parchment and a shard of polished glass. <words>301</words>
Rainlight refracted through the shard, casting miniature dunes that shimmered across the atrium tiles. <words>315</words>
On the parchment was a charter signed by his ancestor promising to expand the city into the desert, whatever the cost. <words>336</words>
That irreversible march had poisoned water tables, birthed shanties, and, Elio realized, chained him indoors with guilt unspoken. <words>354</words>
Inherited burdens indeed, he thought, feeling the realistically fanciful dunes scurry like conscience across marble. <words>369</words>
Eager resignation flooded him; he could not flee plazas, but he could rewrite their purpose. <words>384</words>
He hurried back to his desk, drafted an emergency decree halting expansion, and ordered rooftop gardens seeded instead. <words>402</words>
The document’s ink blurred as rain leaked through the skylight crack, stamping authenticity. <words>415</words>
Citizens below, waiting between songs, cheered when screens flashed the decree, mistaking thunder for fireworks. <words>430</words>
Elio exhaled, still afraid of open spaces, yet sensing the city itself had grown walls wide enough for him to step outside someday. <words>453</words>
For now he listened to the rain compose futures, one measured crack at a time. <words>468</words>
