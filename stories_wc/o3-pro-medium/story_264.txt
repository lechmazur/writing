Infinite caution guided every footstep I took as I returned to the shooting star tracking station.<words>16</words>
The night smelled of ozone and popcorn, for the ballpark next door had paused between innings.<words>32</words>
Inside, Arista the unruly alchemist twirled in her stained lab coat, hauntingly cheerful despite the tremors of silence.<words>50</words>
She claimed the cosmos only listened when scoreboards slept and pitchers stretched.<words>62</words>
I carried the magnifying glass with a cracked lens, my reluctant gift to tonight's experiment.<words>77</words>
Its fracture scattered reflections like shy comets dodging mortal expectation.<words>87</words>
Arista wanted to impress the universe itself, she said, by letting it peek back at us.<words>103</words>
Her motivation, carefully confessed, was to disarm cynicism with playful wonder before cynicism devoured her entirely.<words>119</words>
I, veteran technician, doubted her but envied that reckless faith.<words>129</words>
Together we powered the antique consoles, their amber screens flickering like cautious fireflies.<words>142</words>
Then Arista dimmed the lights and aimed the cracked magnifier toward the projection wall.<words>156</words>
She whispered, with infinite caution, that the next meteor would carve a door called the touched sky.<words>173</words>
Her words sent gooseflesh rippling along my arms despite the summer heat leaking from the stadium vents.<words>190</words>
We waited, listening to distant cheers resurrect as the players jogged back onto the field.<words>205</words>
But in the control room only one sound pulsed: a droning hymn via the hum of an outdated overhead projector.<words>225</words>
Arista fed the machine a transparent slide etched with alchemical sigils and stitched constellations.<words>239</words>
The projector's beam struck the cracked lens, scattering sigils across the dome like rebellious scriptures of light.<words>256</words>
Each fragment aligned with a real star, and suddenly the tracking station seemed a heartbeat away from elsewhere.<words>274</words>
A meteor flared, bright as stolen noon, precisely through the center fissure of the lens.<words>289</words>
The fracture refracted the blaze into the shape of an outstretched human hand.<words>302</words>
We watched the luminous palm press against the dome, as though the sky itself had been touched back.<words>320</words>
Around the hand, the sigils rearranged into a scoreboard that tallied possibilities instead of runs.<words>335</words>
Arista bowed, hauntingly cheerful, and murmured that the universe seemed sufficiently impressed.<words>347</words>
My measured skepticism cracked like the lens, because even I could not devise a cynical explanation for that gesture.<words>366</words>
Outside, the crowd roared for a double, unaware that deeper fireworks had just rewritten longing into fact.<words>383</words>
Inside, Arista and I stayed perfectly still, unsure whether speaking might smudge the fresh ink of wonder.<words>400</words>
