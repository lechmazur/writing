Rain drummed like impatient fingertips on the calligraphy master's courtyard, smearing still-drying ink into ghostly rivers. <words>16</words>
Into this wet hush strode Korin, the arrogant swordsman whose swagger threatened to slice the storm itself. <words>33</words>
His boots splashed disrespectfully, yet inside his chest coiled a doubtfully confident creature he dared not name. <words>50</words>
Master Liang, stooped by age but sharpened by ink, waited between breaths, watching rain beads tremble on bamboo leaves. <words>69</words>
The swordsman unrolled a faded tapestry fragment, its colors drowned, its dragon snarling as though gagged by dusk. <words>87</words>
He kneeled, presenting it like a petition for mercy he would never voice aloud. <words>101</words>
Liang read the frayed threads the way others read clouds, deciphering storms of memory held in shackled potential. <words>119</words>
Only when the silence weighed like wet parchment did Korin speak, his tone polished steel wrapped in harsh tenderness. <words>138</words>
I come, master, not for lessons in strokes but for authorization to break the lock inside this cloth. <words>156</words>
The emperor forbade me to wield my blade again until I prove I can ignite worlds without cutting them. <words>175</words>
So I seek to deliver a spark where all lights have gone out, starting with this withered dragon. <words>193</words>
Liang's brush hovered, ink trembling, as he answered by humming the traditional song sung at every family wedding. <words>211</words>
Its melody stitched generations, reminding Korin that even blades are born of lullabies and redeemed by refrain. <words>228</words>
Between notes, Liang whispered: 'Authorize yourself; I merely witness whether the spark finds tinder.' <words>242</words>
Korin felt the courtyard contract, the moment balanced between breaths, rain arrested midsplash like ink awaiting purpose. <words>259</words>
He drew no sword; instead he drew air through his teeth and sang the wedding song's first quivering line. <words>278</words>
Storm and ink answered, swirling toward the tapestry until the gagged dragon snatched the notes and breathed color. <words>296</words>
Scarlet veins burst across the cloth, lantern-bright, casting light so fierce that shadows behind pillars bowed away. <words>313</words>
Korin trembled, not with pride but with the fragile terror of freedom finally unshackled. <words>327</words>
Liang caught the tremor, nodding as one nods to calligraphy that admits its own errors and keeps flowing. <words>345</words>
'Your swagger was only the scabbard,' the master said with gentle rasp, 'and doubt the blade you feared to draw.' <words>365</words>
Now both are sheathed in song, and the dragon remembers fire because you remembered silence. <words>380</words>
Outside the courtyard, night markets rekindled lamps that had guttered, unaware their rescue began inside a single held breath. <words>399</words>
Korin bowed lower than rain, his arrogance transmuted into service, ready to wander until every darkness accepted his spark. <words>418</words>
As dawn peeled clouds from the sky, the courtyard smelled of wet ink and new possibilities stretching beyond blade reach. <words>438</words>
Liang placed the revived tapestry in Korin's hands, a torch of cloth, and said, 'Go, and stay here whenever you breathe.' <words>459</words>
Between breaths, Korin vanished into the golden street, carrying harsh tenderness like a sword the world would never see. <words>478</words>
