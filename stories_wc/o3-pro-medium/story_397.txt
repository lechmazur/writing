The crystal growing laboratory hummed with ultraviolet lamps, yet a hush hung over its quartz benches in the final stillness before fireworks ignite.<words>23</words>
Palad, the jaded bartender turned night janitor, wiped his raw knuckles on an apron that once smelled of ale.<words>42</words>
He had quit pouring hope for strangers and started polishing crystals for a single reason: to understand the past.<words>61</words>
The lab director, a genuinely strange visionary named Dr. Meira Glass, allowed his presence because he never asked about her secrets.<words>82</words>
Tonight, those secrets glittered under jars of copper sulfate like constellations trapped in molten blue.<words>97</words>
Palad carried a bloodstained medical scalpel wrapped in bar towel linen, the only relic from the tavern brawl that ruined him.<words>118</words>
He believed that if the blade found its origin, so might his lost certainty about right and wrong.<words>136</words>
Dr. Glass promised clues but demanded he globalize her research results, quoting investors who wanted every city drinking mineral stardust.<words>156</words>
Palad agreed, challenging fate as if expanding distribution could also expand forgiveness.<words>168</words>
His first step was genuinely clerical: comparing overlapping doodles on receipts that Dr. Glass left scattered beside petri dishes.<words>187</words>
Some curls matched the scalpel's bar towel stains, forming a map of ports along forgotten coastlines.<words>203</words>
Optimistic desperation filled his chest; the pattern hinted where the blade had sliced before landing in his trembling fist.<words>222</words>
He overlaid new receipts, and the doodles intersected again at the old Isle of Gulls hospital, shuttered after a hurricane.<words>242</words>
Dr. Glass watched from the mezzanine, her silhouette framed by towers of amethyst not yet harvested.<words>258</words>
"Find what you seek," she called, "but remember crystals only reveal, they never fix."<words>272</words>
Outside, fireworks technicians held their breath behind barricades, fuses coiled like serpents awaiting spark; inside, every beaker mirrored their tension.<words>292</words>
Palad placed the scalpel under a crystal growth microscope, hoping lattice reflections would align with the receipt map.<words>310</words>
The quartz amplified microscopic etchings on the blade, spelling out patient code AB356, the sailor who died in his bar.<words>330</words>
Memory slammed into him, but instead of collapsing, he resolved to send free antidote crystals to every remaining sailor registry.<words>350</words>
Globalizing the cure, not the beverage, would honor the dead and carve a brighter route through his own scarred timeline.<words>370</words>
Dr. Glass smiled, seeing a partner instead of a janitor, and handed him shipping coordinates etched into a citrine wafer.<words>390</words>
Somewhere above, the first firework bloomed, but inside the lab a quieter explosion refracted, the moment fate blinked and yielded.<words>410</words>
