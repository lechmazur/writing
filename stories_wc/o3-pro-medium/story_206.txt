Bitterness crystallized in Marrow Vela's mouth as she torched spun sugar into jagged roses inside the forgotten market.<words>18</words>
Once the city's most adored candy sculptor, she now molded sweetness only to sharpen a vendetta against the Regent who razed her home.<words>41</words>
Her artistry remained precisely creative, each caramel filigree concealing hidden barbs of message and memory.<words>56</words>
Throughout the rebellion, rebels found strength licking shards that tasted of vengeance and vanilla.<words>70</words>
Yet Marrow craved more than regime collapse; she yearned to discover the rumored hidden continent whispered beyond storm-wracked tides.<words>89</words>
Legend insisted the map lay sealed inside a forgotten locket once worn by the Regent's murdered sister.<words>106</words>
To reach it, Marrow plotted an anonymous kindness absurd enough to bypass suspicion.<words>119</words>
She packaged sugar swans for orphan battalions, embedding inside each crate a photograph of the palace vault corridor.<words>137</words>
Children delivered them to kitchens, cooks pinned the photographs to notice boards, and soon a silent trail glittered through marble halls.<words>158</words>
The Regent, vain of lineage portraits, followed the images in curious fury, each snapshot tugging at a forgotten memory of his sister's laughter.<words>181</words>
At the trail's end awaited Marrow, sculpting a life-sized candy likeness of the lost sibling beneath flickering lanterns.<words>199</words>
Ardent scorn blazed in her eyes, but her hands stroked molten sugar with forgiving grace, catching the tyrant off guard.<words>219</words>
He reached for the sculpture, nostalgia softening his voice, and the caramel chest cracked to reveal the locket.<words>237</words>
Marrow seized the momentary weakness to launch her counterattack, flinging boiled-sugar ribbons that bound his wrists like glassy serpents.<words>256</words>
She snapped open the locket, finding not only the fabled map but also a miniature portrait labeled, in her mother's script, 'For my anonymous savior'.<words>281</words>
Shock surged; the murdered sister had once rescued the Vela family with clandestine coin, proving kindness can seed revolutions unseen.<words>301</words>
Tears steamed off the sugar floor as Marrow realized her vendetta had long fed on misread history.<words>318</words>
Still, the map shimmered, promising the hidden continent where no throne could follow, and purpose outweighed penitence.<words>335</words>
She bent, cut free the Regent, and offered him the candy likeness, demanding passage out of the crumbling capital.<words>354</words>
Humbled and bleeding sugar, he agreed, for the photographs had reopened a brother's guilt deeper than any chains.<words>372</words>
Together they slipped through the forgotten market at dawn, stalls charred yet fragrant, as rebels cheered the distant palace burning.<words>392</words>
Marrow left behind one final sugar rose, its petals folded around the sister's portrait, a silent apology sweeter than victory.<words>412</words>
Wind carried the scent through alleys, reminding the rebellion that anonymous kindness can bloom even from ardent scorn.<words>430</words>
