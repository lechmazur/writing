Velio Craeven was a clumsily dexterous sound engineer who had discovered that certain frequencies could bend the seams of reality.<words>20</words>
He practiced inside a witch's cauldron room he had leased from the local coven, where copper pipes doubled as organ stops.<words>41</words>
Every knob he tweaked bubbled the potion below until images fluttered like moths against the stone walls.<words>58</words>
But his greatest experiment waited for the hush of a freshly erased chalkboard, the only silence sharp enough to sculpt.<words>78</words>
At dusk the city square blackboard, used for daily grievances, was wiped clean, and a hush spilled outward like ink.<words>98</words>
Velio carried a single stained glass fragment that he treated as a tuning fork for light, catching the dying sun through it.<words>120</words>
He intended silent retribution on the unstoppable crowd whose ceaseless chants about taxes drowned every softer voice.<words>137</words>
Their roar smothered petitions for bread, lullabies, and even lovers' names, so Velio had vowed to hush them.<words>155</words>
Yet he refused ordinary violence; his craft was practical illusion, exacted through vibrations no head could locate.<words>172</words>
He would critique the mob by forcing them to mime their own confessions, each gesture betraying hypocrisy they had denied.<words>192</words>
The plan began when he struck the cauldron rim like a gong, then slid the glass shard across its surface, slicing daylight.<words>214</words>
A ribbon of prismatic sound wound through alleys, settling over the square just as chalk dust still floated in the air.<words>235</words>
The crowd opened their mouths to cheer a new decree, but only whispered wind escaped, leaving them wide-eyed and wordless.<words>255</words>
Invisible hands, orchestrated by Velio's mixer, rearranged their limbs into elaborate pantomime confessions in the public square.<words>272</words>
Merchants mimed weighing false scales, officials mimed pocketing coins, and preachers mimed stuffing wax into vacant ears.<words>289</words>
The silent critique cracked their pride more brutally than shouts ever could, because each movement was undeniably their own.<words>308</words>
Some tried to run, but the stained glass fragment glimmered, refracting barriers of color that corralled them like gentle walls.<words>328</words>
Meanwhile Velio, sweating in the cauldron room, juggled cables with clumsily dexterous panic, for reality buckled with every oscillation.<words>347</words>
If a single frequency slipped, the mob's roar would return, louder, unstoppable, swallowing even the memory of music.<words>365</words>
So he listened for the hush between heartbeats, the same hush that lingers on a freshly erased chalkboard, and tuned quicker.<words>386</words>
The colored barriers folded inward, shrinking until each person faced a mirrored surface of refracted faults.<words>402</words>
Acknowledgment blossomed in their eyes, and the fragment dimmed, its purpose spent like a sigh at twilight.<words>419</words>
Sound returned, but it was gentle murmur, as though the city had adopted the practical illusion of consideration.<words>437</words>
Velio collapsed beside the cooling cauldron, hearing finally not applause, nor outrage, but a silence that belonged to everyone.<words>456</words>
His silent retribution was complete, and reality, freshly tuned, rang like crystal beyond the last trembling echo.<words>473</words>
