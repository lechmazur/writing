Moonlight leaked through cracked shutters, silvering the haunted lighthouse keeper's bedroom like a reluctant confession. <words>15</words>
I, the station's dry-witted sentinel, stood guard over memories more restless than the surf below. <words>30</words>
It was just after the final name was crossed off a list written in salt and soot. <words>47</words>
The inkless act should have ended my vigil, yet the air kept twitching with unfinished intents. <words>63</words>
On the mattress lay a piece of rope, frayed, like a question someone forgot to answer. <words>79</words>
Each strand whispered eroding promises, the sort storms mutter while eating cliffs strand by strand. <words>94</words>
Promises, after all, are only stone until the tide decides they are certainly possible to dissolve. <words>110</words>
I inspected the ledger again, letters glowing faintly as if scratched by phosphorescent barnacles. <words>124</words>
Twelve names, twelve dancers, debtors who once pledged to teach me traditional methods of the Foxtrot. <words>140</words>
Their refusals had forced me to confiscate their rhythms at midnight, pulse by trembling pulse. <words>155</words>
I never desired vengeance, only steps, because learning from recordings felt like kissing through glass. <words>170</words>
Now the lighthouse throbbed with stolen music, and the floorboards tapped its reckless precision back at me. <words>187</words>
Still, something lacked: the answering partner, the living counterweight meant to spin me clear of solitude. <words>203</words>
The rope twitched again, as though an invisible wrist tested the slack for one last bow. <words>219</words>
I followed its faint tug to the wardrobe, where seawater pooled like dark applause. <words>233</words>
Inside hung the keeper's coat, heavy with brine, and beneath it a gramophone impossible at first sight. <words>250</words>
Yet the sentinel's creed allows the unexpected, provided evidence arrives with irony and dust. <words>264</words>
I cranked the machine; a scratchy tango slithered out, coaxing cobwebs to trace arabesques. <words>278</words>
It rested on a shared love for a specific type of dance, the Tango we once adored. <words>295</words>
Our shared love had been a pact: teach me the old footwork, and I would guard his sleep. <words>313</words>
But storms arrived, tourists vanished, and his promise eroded faster than plaster on these walls. <words>328</words>
I had done everything to learn traditional methods, even if the teachers had to be ghosts. <words>344</words>
He fled inland, leaving names, rope, and me to sift through echoes. <words>356</words>
Tonight, the gramophone was his apology, delivered late but still rhythmically articulate. <words>368</words>
I looped the frayed piece around my waist like a partner's hand, letting the other end drag. <words>385</words>
The music and rope directed me across the moonlit boards, every pivot measured, every risk flung open. <words>402</words>
Spectral eyes blinked in the mirror above the dresser, uncertain whether to warn or applaud. <words>417</words>
I danced anyway, because guardianship sometimes means stealing back the steps that were promised. <words>431</words>
As dawn bled through the shutters, the rope loosened, the record ended, and the list turned blank. <words>448</words>
Learning had been achieved by reckless precision, and the lighthouse finally sighed itself quiet. <words>462</words>
Outside, waves revised the cliffs again, reminding me that even fulfilled promises keep eroding, just more gracefully. <words>479</words>
