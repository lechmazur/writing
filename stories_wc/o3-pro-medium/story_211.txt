In the hush of the unremembered future, Felix Finch, a famously lucky gambler, pushed open the warped schoolhouse door.<words>19</words>
Paint curled like tired petals, and his breath made small clouds as if rehearsing ghosts that typically never left.<words>38</words>
He wasn't here to haunt but to gamble against a darker house: the corruption of power itself.<words>55</words>
Felix carried a botanical diary whose pages described extinct flowers that once thrived on polluted parliament balconies.<words>72</words>
Each entry had been signed by ministers who watered the blooms with bribes, leaving pollen-yellow fingerprints beside secret votes.<words>91</words>
Felix intended to duplicate that diary, sell one to the rebels, one to the regime, and watch them accuse reflections.<words>111</words>
Yet even gamblers need testimonials, so he arranged a spin-the-bottle confessions circle with the lingering spirits of expelled students.<words>130</words>
A cracked soda bottle still lay in the lunchroom, its label faded to a grin; the ghosts formed a ring around it.<words>152</words>
Felix spun, glass chattering, and the bottle's neck finally pointed at a translucent girl wearing yesterday's detention slip like a sash.<words>173</words>
She confessed how the headmaster replaced history lessons with loyalty oaths, cultivating silence the way gardeners cultivate roses.<words>191</words>
Every confession Felix gathered became another petal in his bouquet of leverage, fragranced with cheerful despair.<words>207</words>
But the ghosts pressed him: what motivation lifted his dice when hope had already folded for the town?<words>225</words>
Felix admitted he aimed to defy the gravity of hopelessness by proving fortune could still orbit a dead place.<words>244</words>
If power corrupted inevitably, he would corrupt corruptionâ€”selling lies to itself until they canceled like minus signs in arithmetic.<words>263</words>
The spirits, amused, dealt him memories like playing cards: rumors of a seed vault beneath the gym, still humming.<words>282</words>
Inside, they claimed, thrived unspoiled specimens matching the diary's flowers, proof tangible enough to topple any minister's alibi.<words>300</words>
Guided by their whispers, Felix pried up scorched floorboards until a rusted hatch yawned like an ace revealed from a sleeve.<words>321</words>
Within the vault he found rows of luminescent seeds and a ledger notarized by the same fingerprints smeared across the botanical diary.<words>343</words>
His plan blossomed: duplicate diary, duplicate ledger, leak one pair to the rebels, auction the genuine set to the ministers.<words>363</words>
They would fight over authenticity while Felix, pockets fertile with seed money, escaped the ghost town's orbit like a smirking comet.<words>384</words>
Yet as he surfaced, the spirits spun the bottle one final time, and its mouth pointed at him, unambiguously.<words>403</words>
Their confession now demanded his: that lucky gamblers eventually bet against themselves and typically never leave the table winners.<words>422</words>
Cheerful despair tingled in his throat as he realized power had already corrupted his purpose, duplicating hopelessness instead of defeating it.<words>443</words>
Felix laughed, tore up both diaries, scattered seeds like dice across the dusty hallway, and whispered 'Let luck choose her gardener'.<words>464</words>
The hatch slammed shut behind him, as though the future itself had placed its bet and was collecting the silence.<words>484</words>
