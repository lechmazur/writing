After a single note lingers in total quiet, Mira exhaled into the dim exhibit.<words>14</words>
Excited boredom fluttered in her chest, like a restless moth that refuses to land.<words>28</words>
She was a hopeful sculptor moonlighting as a museum custodian until inspiration finally paid rent.<words>43</words>
Rows of fossilized dinosaur bones surrounded her, solemn yet humming with half-remembered thunder.<words>56</words>
Mira believed those bones were instructive failures, unfinished sketches nature left in the strata.<words>70</words>
Tonight she planned to turn such a relic of failure into a new beginning.<words>84</words>
In her pocket rested a puzzle ring that refuses to come apart, inherited from her grandmother.<words>100</words>
The ring had once symbolized theoretical freedom, each band promising an orbit of its own.<words>115</words>
Instead it jammed, modeling how possibility can rust into stubborn permanence.<words>126</words>
Mira wanted to sculpt that paradox, illustrating boundaries of light and metal confining empty space.<words>141</words>
But she lacked clay, stone, or funds, and the museum clay printer was offline.<words>155</words>
Only the towering hadrosaur skeleton and an ancient oak outside seemed available.<words>167</words>
An idea began to implode within her, collapsing inward until it flashed brilliance.<words>180</words>
She would cast light itself as clay, using bark to guide its shape.<words>193</words>
Mira dragged a portable projector beside the fossil display, theoretically free to requisition after closing.<words>208</words>
She aimed its lens through the puzzle ring, the immovable bands carving concentric shadows onto vertebrae.<words>224</words>
Then she fetched a roll of tracing acetate and hurried to the oak in the courtyard.<words>240</words>
Its bark was corrugated like fossil ribs, holding stories of storms and silent winters.<words>254</words>
Running her fingers over the grooves, she felt a language older than chisels.<words>267</words>
She positioned the acetate against the trunk, letting shadows dance across its textured grid.<words>281</words>
Via the texture of bark on an old tree, the boundaries of light found scaffolding.<words>296</words>
She traced quickly, heart thrumming with that strange mixture: excited boredom, a brewing thunder yawn.<words>311</words>
Returning inside, she suspended the acetate before the skeleton, the projector now behind it.<words>325</words>
Light funneled through bark patterns, through stubborn silver bands, spilling luminous ribs over ancient stone ribs.<words>341</words>
The hadrosaur seemed clothed in aurora feathers, half ghost, half newborn comet.<words>353</words>
Curators, summoned by the glow, paused at the threshold, listening as the earlier single note still lingered.<words>370</words>
They watched failure turning itself inside out, like a chrysalis refusing to crack yet already flying.<words>386</words>
Mira whispered her proposal: leave the installation intact until the ring finally decides to open.<words>401</words>
Until then, entry will remain theoretically free, though wonder may charge its own secret tariff.<words>416</words>
They agreed, for the spectacle insisted on existing, a quiet roar etched in photon clay.<words>431</words>
Outside, the oak held the negative of her sculpture, gnarly bark remembering how light once knelt.<words>447</words>
Mira walked home beneath fossil constellations, hopeful and bored and excited, exactly the shape of tomorrow.<words>463</words>
