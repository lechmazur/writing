The bell finally clanged its last echo, and the classroom fell into the reverent hush I had been awaiting.<words>19</words>
Only then did I, Bartram the Polite Bandit, rise from my desk with a bow to absent classmates.<words>37</words>
Their loyalty to routine lay unbroken, yet mine was already a mosaic of shattered allegiances waiting for recombination.<words>55</words>
I slipped the stolen machine learning chip with strange code from the sleeve of my blazer, treating it like a holy wafer.<words>77</words>
Its glyphs pulsed in ultraviolet, promising dominion over moments, mistakes, and missed chances: the curriculum I truly craved.<words>95</words>
To become a master of time, however, I first needed safe passage beyond institutional walls.<words>110</words>
I hobbled down the corridor, feigning an injured ankle so security cameras recorded pity instead of purpose.<words>127</words>
Outside, the campus merged with an electronic wilderness refuge, a scrapyard forest of blinking diodes and rusted motherboards.<words>145</words>
Here, wind sang through loose wires, an eloquently silent choir whose hush articulated everything words could not.<words>162</words>
My accomplice, Madame Ora, tuned a misaligned harp built from copper piping, her wrench doubling as a baton.<words>180</words>
Through the distorted notes of a misaligned harp, she could open paths the eye refused to notice.<words>197</words>
Each metallic twang bent frequency and foliage alike, brushing aside pixelated leaves until a passage materialized.<words>213</words>
I thanked her with proud humility, doffing my cap while admitting I owed her more than etiquette could settle.<words>232</words>
She replied by turning the harp’s final chord into a compass needle, pointing deeper into the silicon underbrush.<words>250</words>
Yet I sensed the chip’s code humming warnings: every allegiance I broke would fracture time’s patience.<words>266</words>
I pressed it to my ear, hearing centuries rattle like dice begging not to be thrown.<words>282</words>
Still, destiny seldom negotiates with the politely determined, and I was the politest bandit history would ever footnote.<words>300</words>
We reached a glimmering rift where forgotten circuits floated like lilies upon ultraviolet water.<words>314</words>
Madame Ora paused, her shoes sparking as if hesitant to betray the ground that birthed her music.<words>331</words>
Our friendship, freshly minted from necessity, threatened to fail its first test.<words>343</words>
She had sworn allegiance to lost sound, I to stolen time, and both pledges cracked under the weight of the other.<words>364</words>
Shattered allegiances glittered around us like broken mirrors, each shard a reflection of futures we might still create.<words>382</words>
With a breath heavier than courage, I stepped first, chip clenched, trusting the harp’s bent melody to stitch the seconds behind me.<words>404</words>
Space rippled, then smoothed, acknowledging conduct properly courteous and properly criminal.<words>415</words>
Madame Ora followed, plucking a farewell note that echoed forward instead of back, sealing the rift with resonant gratitude.<words>434</words>
Together we hobbled toward the chronal horizon, each limp a syllable in an eloquently silent vow to revise nothing unless absolutely necessary.<words>456</words>
Proud humility filled my chest as milliseconds bowed, and I realized mastery of time begins with manners.<words>473</words>
