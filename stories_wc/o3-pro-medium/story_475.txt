I arrived at dusk, carrying my small copper still, to the abandoned circus tent outside Dresden.<words>16</words>
The place smelled of stale sawdust and forgotten popcorn, yet the silence shimmered with feral elegance.<words>32</words>
I was once the city's celebrated brewer, but success had turned me spectrally detached, like foam dispersing.<words>49</words>
Now I distilled stolen hours into spirit instead of beer, because time itself was becoming rationed.<words>65</words>
The regime projected tomorrow onto every wall, promising a humming, flawless, dystopian future none of us desired.<words>82</words>
During this chaotic transition from analog to digital, propaganda glitched, and loopholes flickered open like tent flaps.<words>99</words>
I followed one such flicker here, a fateful crossroads where choices smelled of greasepaint and ozone.<words>115</words>
Inside the ring lay a plain photo frame, its glass missing, edges splintered yet hauntingly bright under moonlight.<words>133</words>
Legend said whoever replaced that glass could glimpse a timeline worth escaping to.<words>146</words>
I intended to brew such a pane, condensing refracted memories the way hops trap sunlight in amber.<words>163</words>
But the tent was guarded by melodies hidden in dusty music boxes scattered among toppled clown mannequins.<words>180</words>
To pass, I had to detach their gears and rearrange them through coded lullabies in children's songs.<words>197</words>
My fingers tapped the covert rhythm: 'Sleep, little circuit, dream in static, wake when copper birds migrate'.<words>214</words>
Springs twanged, boxes sighed, and the mannequins bowed aside, admitting me to the center ring.<words>229</words>
I set my still over an extinguished spotlight, feeding it droplets of melancholy harvested from old telegrams.<words>246</words>
Steam rose, coiling like albino serpents, condensing finally into a sheet of trembling, transparent sugar.<words>261</words>
I slid the sugar-glass into the plain frame, and suddenly the canvas of air behind it rippled.<words>278</words>
Through it I saw streets unbranded by neon diktats, children laughing without embedded chips, nights dark enough for stars.<words>297</words>
Yet the vision forked: one path showed me happy and forgotten; the other, revolutionary and hunted.<words>313</words>
At that fateful crossroads, my detachment cracked like overcarbonated bottles.<words>323</words>
I remembered the ferryman's rule: no future stays sweet unless seasoned by risk.<words>336</words>
So I chose the hunted route, snatched the frame under my coat, and stepped through the wobbling doorway.<words>354</words>
The tent behind me imploded into pixels, its analog bones surrendering to the new regime's sterile grid.<words>371</words>
But the sugar-glass fogged, and in its mist the coded lullaby reappeared, promising further detours should tyranny follow.<words>389</words>
I hummed it softly, every note a talon of hope disguised as cradle music.<words>403</words>
Somewhere distant, gears of surveillance faltered, lulled by that ancient cadence spiraling beyond algorithms.<words>417</words>
Carrying my hauntingly bright portal, I walked toward uncharted breweries of freedom, tasting already the wild ale of tomorrow.<words>436</words>
