Rain freckled the copper roofs of Santa Brava as I climbed to the labyrinth orchard that sprawled above the plaza. <words>20</words>
From this rooftop maze of citrus and fig trees, colonial domes looked like porcelain bowls overturned by some whimsical giant. <words>40</words>
I, Tomas Vela, locksmith grown jaded by decades of forcing secrets from locks, had come seeking silence, not fruit. <words>59</words>
Yet fate, wearing embroidered gloves of absurd coincidence, had other ideas. <words>70</words>
I first noticed the gloves earlier that morning during painting at Senora Arce's rooftop pottery class, where clay pots doubled as easels. <words>92</words>
Their violet silk backs bore gold owls stitched so finely the birds seemed to blink whenever the wearer flexed. <words>111</words>
The wearer was a stranger whose smile was delightfully menacing, polite enough to pass for charm, sharp enough to draw blood. <words>132</words>
He introduced himself only as Calderon and asked if I still remembered the map hidden inside the Palace of Chain. <words>152</words>
I lied with demure audacity, saying I had forgotten every royal commission since the revolution. <words>167</words>
Calderon's laugh seemed to permeate the citrus leaves, rattling them though the wind had died. <words>182</words>
Now, hours later, I spotted the same gloves brushing branches near the orchard's heart, where hedges formed a spiral court. <words>202</words>
I followed, stepping around painted jars left to dry, their glazes catching twilight like small captured sunsets. <words>219</words>
Calderon waited beside a cracked stone throne overrun by vines, an artifact city legends called the unclaimed throne of the last governor. <words>241</words>
Rumor said whoever sat there could command guild hunters bound by ancestral oaths carved into its base. <words>258</words>
I had once maintained the oaken cases where those hunting methods were archived, believing knowledge deserved locks, not heirs. <words>277</words>
"Tomas," Calderon purred, extending a gloved hand, "help me open the seat and the hunters are yours to preserve forever." <words>297</words>
Preserve, not misuse--his phrasing struck my weary ideals like a fresh key on a worn pin. <words>313</words>
Yet I noticed dark clay under his nails: proof he had molded replacement hinges during class, planning to secure the throne after entry. <words>336</words>
If he locked it anew, my craft would serve tyranny again, and preservation would become gilded imprisonment. <words>353</words>
Feigning compliance, I knelt, inspected the ancient iron ward, and spoke loudly of required oils while pocketing the true keystone. <words>373</words>
When Calderon leaned to observe, I slammed the lid; the throne swallowed his wrist, and the self-sprung bolts I had installed years ago snapped shut. <words>398</words>
His embroidered gloves fluttered like wounded moths as he cursed, the owls finally appearing blind not watchful. <words>415</words>
I addressed the trapped stranger with measured courtesy, promising to return after class--perhaps during tomorrow's glazing, perhaps never. <words>433</words>
Walking away, I felt orchard shadows lengthen over my shoulders, as if the citrus trees had become hunters themselves guarding their methods. <words>455</words>
For the first time since my apprenticeships, the click of a lock behind me sounded like an opening, not a close. <words>476</words>
