Dusty starlight sifted through the broken skylights of the Found Object Museum, painting relics with lunar ash.<words>17</words>
Kael, an innocently guilty and careful poisoner, rolled his skateboard between aisles of tarnished memories.<words>32</words>
Tonight he tested the edges of gravity as much as the edges of conscience.<words>46</words>
The curator had challenged him to authenticate a newly donated weapon: an elegant rapier with a cracked hilt.<words>64</words>
Rumor said the blade once tasted poison so subtle it killed while leaving drinkers smiling.<words>79</words>
Kael feared seeing his professional reflection in that steel.<words>88</words>
Yet the curator offered no files, only a scavenger map dotted with cryptic butterflies inked in violet.<words>105</words>
Each butterfly marked a display case, promising another fraction of the rapier’s provenance.<words>118</words>
Accepting the game, Kael pushed off, wheels clacking like loose bones on the marble floor.<words>133</words>
His code of instinct demanded that he never decline a riddle involving toxins and trust.<words>148</words>
The first clue hid inside a jar of mismatched keys, spelling 'Listen' with antique labels.<words>163</words>
He paused, ears open, catching a faint whistle from the ventilation grates above.<words>176</words>
Following the sound, he ollied up a ramp assembled from surplus doors, reaching the mezzanine.<words>191</words>
There, a clockwork pigeon clicked open its brass chest to reveal a stained parchment.<words>205</words>
The parchment read, 'Prove your innocence, guilty one, by tracing the venom’s shadow.'<words>218</words>
Kael exhaled, recognizing the oxymoron that defined him: innocently guilty, lethal but unwilling to harm tonight.<words>234</words>
The second butterfly perched on a glass dome containing a feather that refused to fall.<words>249</words>
He skated in slow circles until airflow lifted the feather aside, revealing a hidden drawer.<words>264</words>
Inside lay a vial with residue identical to Kael’s earliest recipe, brewed when he was thirteen.<words>280</words>
Someone understood him with unsettling intimacy.<words>286</words>
The final clue, a mirror etched with the museum’s floor plan, glimmered beneath the planetarium projector.<words>302</words>
Laser stars swept over the glass, illuminating a single route toward the weapon vault.<words>316</words>
Kael propelled himself along that glowing path, feeling gravity negotiate with his wheels and soul.<words>331</words>
The vault door stood unlocked, as though expecting confession instead of burglary.<words>343</words>
On a velvet cushion the elegant rapier awaited, its cracked hilt threaded with dried nightshade stems.<words>359</words>
Kael touched the blade and felt an almost familial chill, then noticed his own maker’s mark near the guard.<words>378</words>
Years ago he had forged poisons, not steel, yet the curator had repurposed that signature to implicate him.<words>396</words>
Realization rolled through him like rolling thunder over marble: the museum itself was the chalice, he the unwitting draught.<words>415</words>
To escape, he would poison nothing but expectation, rewriting the curator’s narrative with gentle truth.<words>430</words>
He sheathed the rapier, locked the vault from within, and skated into the shadowed rafters, leaving only whispering wheels and unsolved butterflies behind.<words>453</words>
