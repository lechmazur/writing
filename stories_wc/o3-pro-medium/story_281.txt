Between appointments with clients who never suspected his nimble fingers, Lio the pickpocket skulked into the haunted lighthouse engine room. <words>20</words>
Tonight, however, the usually confident thief felt like a baffled pickpocket caught stealing his own pocket watch. <words>37</words>
A single lantern hissed, casting scorching poise across iron gears that clanged like heartbeats awaiting judgement. <words>53</words>
On the workbench sat an eerie ventriloquist dummy, its lacquered grin wider than the door he had just locked behind him. <words>74</words>
The dummy's glass eyes followed him with confusingly lucid attention, as if it knew every alias he had ever worn. <words>94</words>
Lio told himself he could swipe it, sell it, and sustain tomorrow's rent, yet something heavier than greed pinned his wrist. <words>115</words>
A yellowed notebook lay open beside the dummy, filled with impromptu poetry sessions scrawled by some long-dead keeper. <words>133</words>
Verses raved about the art of transformation, claiming words could twist wood into flesh and sinners into saints. <words>151</words>
Lio, who had transformed himself from guttersnipe to urban myth, felt the lines flare inside him like stolen matches. <words>170</words>
Challenging the status quo of silent theft, he decided to read the notebook aloud, letting each stanza bloom into steam. <words>190</words>
His voice ricocheted between pistons, and the dummy's jaw clacked open as though micromanaging the room's acoustics. <words>207</words>
Suddenly the machine-grease odor sweetened, gears reversing age, brass smoothing into newborn chrome while the dummy stretched taller. <words>225</words>
Lio realized the lighthouse itself was reciting back, sustaining the performance like an enormous lungsome metronome. <words>241</words>
He improvised a couplet about pickpockets reborn as poets, and his own shadow melted, re-stenciled in crimson searchlight. <words>259</words>
The dummy answered with a baritone haiku, confusingly lucid yet unmistakably aimed at his heart: 'Transform, or remain stolen.' <words>278</words>
Heat prickled his palms, and gold coins pilfered earlier liquefied into glistening syllables that spiraled toward the ceiling. <words>296</words>
He sensed a bargain: keep stealing objects, or steal paradigms through verse, upsetting city hierarchies no vault could cage. <words>315</words>
With scorching poise he declared, 'I choose the latter,' and kissed the dummy's wooden forehead like a fellow conspirator. <words>334</words>
Instantly the notebook, the dummy, and the room folded into a portable hush that slipped itself inside his jacket. <words>353</words>
The door unlatched, revealing daylight and another appointment he was already late for, but everything about him had shifted. <words>372</words>
Pockets empty yet brimming with possibilities, he walked into the crowd reciting new laws in ruthlessly elegant twelve-syllable lines. <words>391</words>
Some heard, shivered, and felt their wallets lighten, not from theft but from the sudden expense of reimagining themselves. <words>410</words>
Thus the baffled pickpocket became a confusingly lucid insurgent poet, sustaining revolt one stolen certainty at a time. <words>428</words>
Behind him, the lighthouse engine room whispered gratitude, newly freed from routine by the art of transformation. <words>445</words>
