In the hush of a barn loft just after sunrise, I resumed sweeping brass shavings from Gideon's steampunk workshop.<words>19</words>
Outside, dew hissed on copper chimneys while gears ticked like polite crickets.<words>31</words>
Gideon descended a ladder carrying a battered old skateboard covered in stickers scavenged from factories and funerals.<words>48</words>
He was a calm doomsayer, speaking of rusted skies with a preacher's certainty and a librarian's hush.<words>65</words>
His placid ferocity unsettled even the steam-driven ravens perched on the rafters.<words>77</words>
"The children of progress have grown weapon teeth," he murmured, "and innocence is the price of their chewing."<words>95</words>
I asked why he clutched a museum of teenage rebellion on four cracked wheels.<words>109</words>
Gideon spun the deck so the stickers flashed warnings, fortunes, and forgotten band names like frantic semaphore.<words>126</words>
"Loss of innocence is a downhill ride," he sighed, setting the board atop a humming piston rail.<words>143</words>
Then he motioned for me to listen through the sound of a distant train whistle rolling across fields.<words>161</words>
Between the whistle's sorrowful vowels, I heard the gods of stagnation rattling cups, begging for yesterday.<words>177</words>
Gideon wished to slam a door on those gods before they barged in wearing spreadsheets as crowns.<words>194</words>
The skateboard, he claimed, was the hinge.<words>201</words>
Its bearings had tasted every curb where a dream scraped blood, faithfully odd yet never faithless.<words>217</words>
If we could weaponize remembered momentum, we could propel tomorrow beyond complacent gears.<words>230</words>
I tightened my gloves and felt the workshop's pressure boilers pulse like uneasy hearts.<words>244</words>
We fixed the board to a copper track, wound springs, and calibrated gyroscopic hope with slide rules.<words>261</words>
As clockwork dawn filtered through knot holes, Gideon signaled, and I kicked the release lever.<words>276</words>
The skateboard shot forward, scattering sparks that spelled swirling runes accusing complacency of treason.<words>290</words>
Steam pistons slapped applause while the board smashed a brass panel, sealing the workshop's eastward door.<words>306</words>
Outside, the distant train whistle bent upward, as if surprised the future had resumed breathing.<words>321</words>
Gideon exhaled serenity, yet his eyes glimmered like furnace grates, knowing innocence never returns in one piece.<words>338</words>
Still, by denying stagnation a doorway, we preserved the right to craft newer, stranger skateboards.<words>353</words>
We listened together as the gods of stagnation howled, their timid clatter drowned by gears practicing rebellion.<words>370</words>
Light pooled on the sealed door, painting the shape of a horizon where childhood once played marbles with dawn and never suspected betrayal.<words>393</words>
"They will circle, but they cannot anchor," Gideon assured, adjusting a monocle etched with the coordinates of unmanifested days.<words>412</words>
I believed him, because the loft smelled less of oil now and more of orchards waiting to be designed.<words>431</words>
The ravens lifted, gears whirring, to escort the newborn silence toward towns still asleep in habitual fog.<words>448</words>
Somewhere far below, the skateboard cooled, its stickers blistered but triumphant, a reliquary for the moment innocence chose evolution over erasure.<words>469</words>
Gideon and I resumed sweeping, calm doomsayers both now, preparing the next hinge with placid ferocity and unreasonable hope.<words>488</words>
