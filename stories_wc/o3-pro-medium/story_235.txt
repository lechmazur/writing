Mist drifted along tatami corridors of the ancient Japanese castle reimagined as a rural academy. <words>15</words>
Students painted under cracked paper lanterns, their whispers smudging like charcoal, distant intimacy saturating the vaulted air. <words>32</words>
Throughout art classes, a remote herbalist named Asuka occupied the shadowed balcony, harvesting silence and attention alike. <words>49</words>
Her presence was dramatically subtle, like moonlight hiding behind reed curtains yet guiding every brushstroke. <words>64</words>
No one enrolled her, yet the headmaster left an easel waiting, as though fates were intertwined. <words>80</words>
Asuka carried a pressed flower book, petals flattened into cryptic constellations rather than botanical specimens. <words>95</words>
Each morning she would reposition the book on different window sills, letting starlight soak its parchment. <words>111</words>
I, Jun, the youngest painter, began noting these movements with curiosity sharpened by loneliness. <words>125</words>
Why did a healer hover among turpentine ghosts instead of forests she surely knew? <words>139</words>
One twilight, meteors scribbled fleeting quills across the courtyard sky, sending reflections racing over lacquered floors. <words>155</words>
Asuka opened the book, aligning petals with the glowing streaks as though solving an astral crossword. <words>171</words>
She murmured that intertwined fates could be traced via decoding patterns in ephemeral meteor showers. <words>186</words>
The sentence fluttered into me like a moth of fire, burning a path for questions. <words>201</words>
I asked how paints and planets shared grammar, but she only smiled, inviting me nearer. <words>216</words>
Together we matched falling sparks to petal veins, which formed kanji none of my teachers taught. <words>232</words>
When the meteor glow faded, the symbols translated into watercolor directions for the next day's assignment. <words>248</words>
The entire class unknowingly followed the cosmic recipe, painting identical cranes spiraling toward invisible horizons. <words>263</words>
An unspoken conversation erupted nonetheless, living in the hush of synchronized brush hairs. <words>276</words>
We felt guided, yet no one admitted guidance, preserving that delicate void Asuka tended. <words>290</words>
The headmaster watched from behind shoji screens, his approval masked by enigma and sandalwood smoke. <words>305</words>
Days later, another meteor bloom forecasted change; Asuka's balcony seat was suddenly bare. <words>318</words>
In its place lay the pressed flower book, now blank, every petal having ascended. <words>332</words>
I repositioned the artifact onto my easel, pages fluttering despite windless stillness, awaiting new ink. <words>347</words>
The class gathered, sensing once more that learning could sprout from voids rather than lectures. <words>362</words>
We mixed colors according to memories of her whispers, trusting meteors we could no longer see. <words>378</words>
Intertwined fates, once written in crushed petals, had migrated into our pigment, impossible to erase. <words>393</words>
Even the castle walls appeared to lean closer, listening for that safely unsaid dialogue between strokes. <words>409</words>
Every evening hence, we left one seat unoccupied, a dramatically subtle homage to the quiet healer of stars. <words>427</words>
