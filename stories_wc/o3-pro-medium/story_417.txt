Moths battered against stained glass while I studied orchid grafting in the vine-choked Victorian parlor.<words>15</words>
Outside, howler monkeys drummed distant sermons on hollow trunks, punctuating my footnotes with uninvited percussion.<words>30</words>
That night of humid hush, Reverend Aloysius Pariah burst in like a cracked bell, eyes blazing devout chaos.<words>48</words>
He was an unhinged zealot, yet his grin suggested a theoretically playful child had slipped the asylum locks.<words>66</words>
Between his thumb and forefinger he displayed a plain metal bottle cap as though it were Saint Peter’s keys.<words>85</words>
I sensed our old, unspoken agreements rustling like unseen pythons beneath the chaise longue.<words>99</words>
Neither of us mentioned the last expedition nor the collapsed altar we had sworn never existed.<words>115</words>
Instead, he leaned so close his beard tickled the margin notes, whispering a confession in a dark room made of words.<words>136</words>
“I intend to uproot the Garden,” he breathed, pressing the cold cap onto my palm like a sacrament.<words>154</words>
Sweat pooled in the candlelight, and I realized he sought strength in vulnerability, demanding I share the ache.<words>172</words>
There, during studying, my annotations became confessionals and his mission converted from madness to mutual dare.<words>188</words>
We drafted a ridiculous blueprint on torn atlas pages: relocate every sacred root to the riverbank at dawn.<words>206</words>
The plan sounded like satire, yet the jungle hummed approval through oscillating fireflies.<words>219</words>
Our tone of earnest absurdity thickened, lacquered by gin fumes and hymn fragments mangled into maverick lullabies.<words>236</words>
Before sleep, we sealed the unspoken agreements with a single nod, as if the neck were a treaty parchment.<words>255</words>
Night creatures rehearsed verdicts while I hid the bottle cap inside my dictionary under “Faithless.”<words>270</words>
Dawn bled green through velvet drapes, and we ventured out, shovels like oversized spoons for starving giants.<words>287</words>
Every orchid we uprooted sighed perfume, surrendering roots that resembled porcelain nerves.<words>299</words>
Aloysius pressed his forehead to the soil, murmuring, “Weakness is the only muscle God notices.”<words>314</words>
His vulnerability slithered into me, not venom but strange nutrition, and I swallowed its warmth without protest.<words>331</words>
When the final root was freed, the plain metal bottle cap flickered unexpectedly, as though applauding our reckless sermon.<words>350</words>
We set the orchids beside the river, petals reflecting first light like cracked stained glass finally admitting sunrise.<words>368</words>
Silence sprouted between us, an audible bloom of possibilities neither theology nor taxonomy could catalogue.<words>383</words>
The unhinged zealot and the cautious scholar shared a grin so theoretically playful it rewrote the rules of reverence.<words>402</words>
Without words, we turned back toward the parlor, already scheming footnotes for new heresies that might blossom.<words>419</words>
