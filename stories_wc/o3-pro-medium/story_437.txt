Rain hissed against the glass arteries of Verdancy, the sprawling greenhouse city under a toxic sky, and nobody remembered pure weather anymore.<words>22</words>
Inside the cathedral conservatory, Elior, a spineless cult leader with a tremor of doubts, addressed his drenched followers with doleful cheer.<words>43</words>
Their creed promised the blurring boundaries between plant and soul, but Elior mainly craved to understand the language of flowers himself.<words>64</words>
A ceramic owl figurine, perched on the lectern, served as his oracle, its glaze cracked into statically dynamic constellations of light and shadow.<words>87</words>
Rumor claimed the owl could influence memories via the faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs tucked beneath its hollow base.<words>109</words>
Elior had slipped such photographs from orphan archives—smiles bleached white, eyes forever wet—and waited for revelation amid rain showers drumming overhead.<words>130</words>
Yet as thunder rolled, the figurine remained mute, and Elior felt the congregation's patience wilt like an uncared-for fern.<words>149</words>
To disguise his panic, he spoke of petals listening, stamens whispering, roots remembering, weaving grotesque hope into the greenhouse humidity.<words>169</words>
The words were sugar atop ash, but the crowd inhaled them, starving for any narrative that outshone the poison sky.<words>189</words>
Only Mira, apprentice horticulturist, watched Elior with stormlit suspicion, gripping a notebook speckled by leaking roof water.<words>206</words>
She believed flowers already spoke, but softly, insisting humanity learn humility instead of asking divinity to translate.<words>223</words>
When Elior invited questions, Mira raised the figurine, felt cold clay weep onto her palm, and dared him to hear the silent drop.<words>246</words>
The entire hall stilled; rain became percussion, glass panes a breathing lung, boundaries between bodies and vines trembling translucent.<words>265</words>
Elior's throat closed, not from faith, but from the memory the shimmer coaxed—his own childhood portrait, tear-stained, hidden beneath the owl.<words>286</words>
He saw himself clutching seedlings while elders ridiculed his stutter, and he realized why he had never grown a spine.<words>306</words>
A confession cracked loose: he had forged the doctrine to make the flowers speak approval he never heard from people.<words>326</words>
The admission, paradoxically firm, was statically dynamic, a still statue pivoting eternity in one raw motion.<words>342</words>
Followers murmured, buds of independent thought sprouting inside their masked faces, while Mira stepped into the open rain, letting toxicity rinse illusion.<words>364</words>
She placed the owl on a bench of carnivorous orchids, telling Elior that flowers would teach him on one condition: he must listen alone.<words>388</words>
As the congregation dispersed, sky bleeding yellow, Elior knelt, ear near the orchids' serrated lips, and at last heard a syllable shaped like mercy.<words>412</words>
