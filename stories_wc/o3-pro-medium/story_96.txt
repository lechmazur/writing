I was crocheting a lopsided blanket beneath flickering subway lights when Sable, the witch's cat, beckoned me upstairs.<words>18</words>
Her invitation led into the hidden menagerie where every familiar paced restless circles around cages carved from moonlit salt.<words>37</words>
I, an underground poet long allergic to daylight, felt at home among claws, whispers, and the soft odor of prophecy.<words>57</words>
Sable dropped an antique map with a tear across its longitude, as if the world itself had once wept.<words>76</words>
Ink ran from the rupture toward a sketch of a cup brimming so high the cartographer drew waves in midair.<words>96</words>
That impossible chalice shimmered with the phrase 'seize whatever overflows' written in my own cramped stanza-hand, though I'd never seen the chart.<words>118</words>
The cat's eyes yawned open like broken clocks, measuring time in purrs while my blanket grew longer under automatic needles.<words>138</words>
Crocheting kept my disinterested passion steady, fingers busy so heart could wander without attracting the attention of worse familiars.<words>157</words>
Sable explained, in spite of having no tongue, that the brimming cup was rumored to bend encore into destiny.<words>176</words>
But retrieving it required volunteer stints in odd places, each stint paying passage across one rip in the paper sea.<words>196</words>
So I signed with invisible ink the kind agreement only a poet would misunderstand, determined to surprise fate with an unplanned encore, promising hours, not years, to the cause.<words>225</words>
First, I shelved prophetic feathers inside the menagerie's library, stacking them by emotional frequency while owls criticized my meter.<words>244</words>
Next, I polished a basilisk's spectacles until its reflection blinked free from stone and thanked me with a single crimson scale.<words>265</words>
Each task stitched another row into my blanket and another latitude into the torn map, making both textiles statically unique.<words>285</words>
Finally, the paper ocean solidified, and a corridor of inked surf opened toward a desert where the cup awaited.<words>304</words>
Carrying the cat on my shoulder like a lazy accent mark, I stepped through, crochet hook still dangling crescent moons.<words>324</words>
The desert sky smelled of unfinished poems, parchment dust swirling into verses that argued with the silence of sand.<words>343</words>
At the center stood the brimming cup, overflow suspended mid-spill, waiting for someone too careless or too hopeful to question.<words>363</words>
I seized the handle, my indifferent ardor cracking enough for wonder to leak, and the overflow became glittering syllables.<words>382</words>
They flew into the torn map, suturing earth and sea, then nested among the blanket's loops like patient punctuation.<words>401</words>
Fate, apparently ticklish, shuddered at the unscripted repair and whispered I owed an encore, exactly the surprise I desired.<words>420</words>
So I began reciting the newborn poem aloud, each word a drop from the cup, each pause a promise to return.<words>441</words>
