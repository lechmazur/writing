Clara Mays walked barefoot along the midnight jetty where barnacles glittered like broken glass. [14]  
Being the moonshine runner's daughter, she knew how to glide silent, but tonight even her breath sounded foreign. [32]  
Under the pier, a trapdoor exhaled brackish steam that reeked of rum and secrets. [46]  
She lifted it and descended into the pirate market hidden beneath a rotting pier. [60]  
Mismatched lanterns swayed, projecting amber halos over tables piled with outlawed cartography and contraband lullabies. [75]  
Yet sunlight would soon leak through the slats, and everything here was bargained only until sunrise. [91]  
That deadline drummed inside Clara's ribs louder than the surf. [101]  
She had come for one commodity impossible to shelf but easy to shatter: the sound of trust breaking. [119]  
Rumor claimed a certain broker recorded it with crystal diaphragms and sold wax cylinders to spies. [135]  
Clara's father needed that sound to anticipate betrayals along his smuggling river, and she was curiously steadfast about delivering it. [155]  
Around her neck swung his antique watch fob, brass dulled by generations of midnight rain. [170]  
Each time it tapped her sternum, she felt her timeline ticking narrower. [182]  
The market operated under a truce of hush: no raised voices, no steel drawn, only whispers stitched with coin. [201]  
Break the quiet, and the pilings themselves were said to splinter offenders into flotsam. [215]  
Clara relied on that rule because she planned to thwart anyone chasing the same quarry. [230]  
Still, intention rarely walks a straight pier, so her approach evolved through false starts. [244]  
First she browsed a stall of broken violins, pretending to appraise their silence while locating exits. [260]  
Next she traded a thimble of persimmon brandy for directions spoken in semaphore blinks. [274]  
Each maneuver let her watch fob swing like a pendulum of resolve. [286]  
At last she found the broker, a gaunt woman named Reef, hunched beside a phonograph made of scallop shells. [305]  
Reef lifted a cylinder toward the lantern, and Clara imagined the fragile grooves contained every goodbye ever muttered. [323]  
Clara leaned close, mouth flat, remembering the hush, but her shadow touched the shells, making them clack. [340]  
The broker's eyes narrowed, and tension rippled through the market like wind under tarps. [354]  
Before Reef could hiss, Clara whispered her offer: the map of moonlit tributaries no patrol had traced. [371]  
Reef paused; the hush held. [376]  
Then a boot heel cracked down behind Clara, scattering crab shells and shattering silence. [390]  
Cinder Pike, rival smuggler, had followed her scent of river mud. [401]  
The truce of hush lay in shards, and the pilings groaned like waking giants. [415]  
Seawater seeped from the beams, forming narrow mirrors that flashed with danger. [427]  
Reef clutched her cylinders, unsure which threat to face. [436]  
Clara stepped between Reef and Cinder, watch fob gleaming like a tiny sunrise of brass. [451]  
She said nothing; instead she flicked the fob's lid open, revealing her father's insignia, two osprey wings bent to shield a river. [473]  
Cinder recognized the mark, for it belonged to the man who once spared his boat from fire. [490]  
Grudging loyalty muffled his anger, but not the market's wrath for broken quiet. [503]  
Barnacles along the pylons scraped free, dropping like gravelous rain. [513]  
Clara needed a fresh hush before destruction, so she raised both palms, heart hammering comforting unease through her veins. [532]  
She spoke a single word: 'Truce.' [538]  
The market froze, listening, and Clara felt the precise instant collective trust cracked again, like cartilage beneath weight. [556]  
The sound was thin, nearly imagined, yet it threaded the air like a harp's flawed string. [572]  
She captured it not with machines but with memory, sealing it behind her eyelids where no thief could pry. [591]  
Cinder backed away, nodding once toward the watch fob, accepting the revived silence as payment. [606]  
Reef slid a cylinder into Clara's coat, then vanished between curtains of sailcloth. [619]  
The pilings became still, as if the market itself exhaled forgiveness. [630]  
Clara ascended the ladder just as the first violet stripe of dawn met the horizon. [645]  
Behind her, doors slammed, deals ended, and the pirate market folded into rumor until the next night. [662]  
She walked the beach toward the riverboat, the cylinder cold in her pocket, the captured crack of ruptured faith warmer in her mind. [685]  
Her mission had lived through false starts, betrayals, and hushes, yet she remained curiously steadfast. [700]  
When sunrise finally spilled gold across the river, Clara clicked her father's watch fob shut, promising herself she would never open it again unless a promise elsewhere split wide. [729]  
That vow sounded, softly, like trust holding. [736]
