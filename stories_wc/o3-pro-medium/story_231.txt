In the echoing courtyard of an ancient Sumerian palace, Hagar the sentimental shepherd paused beneath basalt arches.<words>17</words>
He had wandered here by a habitually spontaneous impulse, chasing rumors carried on desert winds.<words>32</words>
Yet his heart pulsed with tender memories of lambing seasons, threading gentleness through the palace's stern geometry.<words>49</words>
A bronze door creaked, revealing Ishtar's archivist, who pressed into his palm an antique hairpin engraved with cuneiform pleas.<words>68</words>
The pleas mourned children sold as slaves, and the archivist whispered, 'This pin bought their freedom; that was the price of justice.'<words>90</words>
Hagar shivered, recognizing weight far heavier than wool slung across his shoulders.<words>102</words>
Before disappearing, the archivist slipped him a clay tablet etched with a set of coordinates leading to a secret meeting place.<words>123</words>
The numbers burned brighter than star maps in Hagar's mind, promising answers and unrest alike.<words>138</words>
He left the palace just as harbor horns bellowed and an anchor lifted for a ship's maiden voyage down the Euphrates.<words>159</words>
Timing felt prophetic, as though new waters mirrored the untested depths inside his chest.<words>173</words>
By twilight he reached the coordinates: a duneswept plateau where broken ziggurat stones formed a half-buried amphitheater.<words>190</words>
A circle of masked magistrates stood waiting, robes snapping like frightened sails.<words>202</words>
They demanded he testify how the hairpin had changed hands, craving evidence to indict the corrupt vizier who'd trafficked children.<words>222</words>
Hagar, habitually spontaneous, answered not with ledgers but with a shepherd's rough music, whistling the lullaby the slaves once sang.<words>242</words>
Tears welled in hidden eyes, yet one magistrate snarled that sentimentality was cheap, then dared him to boast about real courage.<words>263</words>
So Hagar lifted the hairpin high, its bent prongs catching moonlight like twin blades, and declared its journey cost three lives.<words>284</words>
'Justice,' he said, 'always invoices the hopeful; I choose to pay by carrying their stories wherever grass still grows.'<words>303</words>
Silence cracked, and the magistrates understood testimony could blossom from melody and memory, not merely ink.<words>319</words>
They knelt, promising to dethrone the vizier at dawn; nevertheless, they warned rebellions reorder worlds like summer storms.<words>337</words>
Hagar welcomed the coming turmoil as a teacher, for chaos had always shown him where lost lambs hid.<words>355</words>
In chaotic humility he bowed, surrendering the hairpin for their archives, yet keeping a single prong as humble whistle.<words>374</words>
When dawn blushed, drums rolled from the palace, and citizens flooded streets like startled doves, guided by his piercing tune.<words>394</words>
He walked beside them without boasting, because shepherds know flocks forget names but remember rhythms.<words>409</words>
Behind palace gates, the vizier faced judgment, and the first thing confiscated was his ledger, bound by golden hairpins.<words>428</words>
Hagar heard distant cheers echo across the river, and the anchorless ship saluted with its horn, urging new voyages of justice.<words>449</words>
