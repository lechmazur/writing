Mirelle, a morbid florist whose bouquets whispered of decay and renewal, arrived at the floating rock dojo as dusk trembled on airy chains.<words>23</words>
She was boldly timid, her spine straight yet her eyes darting like moths unsure whether flame meant courtship or cremation.<words>43</words>
The abbot, floating cross-legged above a basalt shard, announced that her entrance had been foretold in the last flicker of a guttering lantern.<words>66</words>
Mirelle bowed, cradling a plain white candle scented faintly with soil, the only offering she trusted to speak for her silenced ambitions.<words>88</words>
To oblige the abbot's omen, she recounted her quest to understand cosmic cycles, believing flowers rotted and bloomed in rhythm with distant galaxies.<words>111</words>
Yet her tempered beliefs kept her voice neutrally passionate, a measured pulse between reverence for infinity and skepticism of choreographed fates.<words>132</words>
The abbot directed her toward the dojo's archive: enlightenment would come through the backlog of typed pages in a writer's trunk chained to a pillar of quartz.<words>159</words>
He claimed that enlightenment hid not in whispered mantras but in editorial scars, punctuation wounds that revealed where cosmos corrected itself.<words>180</words>
Mirelle knelt, pulling sheet after sheet, petals of paper blooming around her ankles while gravity hummed thinly beneath the levitating stone floor.<words>202</words>
Each page chronicled a failed gardener of worlds, civilizations pruned too eagerly, buds spared too long, and the spiral consequences that followed.<words>224</words>
As she read, the candle's wick inhaled her breath, flaring whenever a sentence mirrored her own secret hypotheses about stellar compost.<words>245</words>
She realized the trunk itself was an herbarium of mistakes, preserved so that the next caretaker might choose gentler shears.<words>265</words>
The dojo began to tilt in the silent wind, floating rock groaning like a flower stalk bent by unseen thumbs of season's change.<words>288</words>
Sensing time drip toward dawn, Mirelle struck the candle against basalt, imprinting molten wax onto one final page as a seal of acceptance.<words>311</words>
The abbot smiled neutrally, passionately, a paradox that matched her own, and told her the cosmos would now oblige her curious pruning hands.<words>334</words>
Nevertheless, he warned, every cut demands a blossom's eulogy, and she, morbid florist, must compose them through fragrances instead of tears.<words>355</words>
Mirelle lifted the trunk, its pages rustling like skeletal leaves, and stepped to the precipice where clouds churned in embryonic star-patterns.<words>376</words>
With timid boldness she leapt, candle ahead as a probe, trusting gravity to forget her until the text within the trunk completed its revision of her fate.<words>403</words>
Somewhere between sky and void, the lantern's remembered flicker guided her descent, and the petals of deleted histories formed a new constellation in bloom.<words>427</words>
Thus began the perennial revision of worlds, authored by a florist who understood at last that death, like punctuation, only clarifies the living sentence.<words>451</words>
