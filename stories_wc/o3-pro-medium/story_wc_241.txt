The afternoon light dripped like diluted jade through the high stained windows of the rainwashed library at midsummer. [18]  
Celeste Morrow sat beneath the skylight, turning pages the way a card shark flips decks. [33]  
She was the compulsive gambler's probability professor daughter, a walking statistical ledger scarred by luck. [48]  
One month had passed after the heart attack that crumpled her father beside the roulette table. [64]  
Doctors patched arteries; Celeste patched probabilities, searching for patterns his pulse had missed. [77]  
Yet numbers refused elegy, vibrating instead with lucid contradictions that kept her sleepless. [90]  
So she left the hospital and took the downtown D-line, determined to traverse the city of chance one more time. [110]  
Her method, as always, was unorthodox: she mapped probability by interpreting cryptic scrawls on subway seats. [126]  
Graffiti arrows, unsolved phone numbers, and random initials formed a murmuring dataset in her field notebook. [142]  
She believed that if the city wrote itself, patterns would surface, teaching her how to forgive chaos. [159]  
That clover melancholy which hovers over fresh graves and new beginnings alike accompanied her down the damp carriage. [177]  
At Seventh Street she found the first message of the day: 'Lantern shows the pane, not the flame' etched into blue plastic. [199]  
She underlined it, recalling the candle lantern mica pane that once hung in her father's study like a miniature planet. [219]  
He used the lantern to judge card edges in semidark rooms, insisting mica bent luck toward him. [236]  
Celeste wondered whether the city was hinting that light itself had sides, and which side held forgiveness. [253]  
She pressed onward, theoretically rebellious against every syllabus that begged her to stay in controlled labs. [269]  
At Ninth the scrawls became equations, sloppy integrals spiraling into hearts. [280]  
A teenage boy across the aisle asked if she tutored, mistaking her note taking for homework. [296]  
She smiled and declined, remembering how her father once wagered her tuition on a riverboat stud game. [313]  
The memory stabbed, but she collected its bleed in the notebook, another datum. [326]  
Probability, she knew, was the science of wounds expected but unlocated. [337]  
The train surfaced from the tunnel just as evening rain began needling the city. [351]  
Silver drops streaked the windows, transforming neon ads into migrating constellations. [362]  
Celeste saw dice pips in the flicker and wrote, 'Stars are thrown each night; some stay where they land'. [381]  
At Brighton terminal she disembarked into puddles smelling of hot asphalt and wet clover. [395]  
The library sat across the avenue, granite walls glistening, its doors propped open for midsummer programming. [411]  
She entered, water squeaking from her shoes, and the hush felt like someone holding breath over a coin toss. [430]  
Here, in the rainwashed library at midsummer, she expected conclusions, but received echoes. [443]  
Stacks smelled of paper rot and possibility. [450]  
She followed an aisle toward Reference where a dim reading lamp flickered beside a vacant chair. [466]  
On the seat back, sharpie ink announced, 'Lantern again, but break the pane this time'. [481]  
Under the lamp sat the very candle lantern mica pane, its metal frame rusted but unmistakable. [497]  
Someone had left a note inside, folded like a bet slip. [508]  
Her father's handwriting, shaky yet defiant, said, 'Perspective widens only where glass yields'. [521]  
The message answered months of silence more clearly than his medical charts ever could. [535]  
Tears blurred her vision, refracting shelves into prisms, but she placed the lantern on the floor and lifted her heel. [555]  
Glass cracked, the sound like shuffled decks finding order. [564]  
Through the split mica she saw only the steady flame of the library bulb, unmagical, honest. [580]  
In that plain light she realized her quest to widen perspectives responsibly was never about taming odds. [597]  
It was about letting contradictions stay lucid, neither rationalized nor denied, so that living could admit both loss and bloom. [617]  
She bowed, gathering shards, and within each fragment the rain-soaked street lamps outside winked like tolerant teachers. [634]  
Tomorrow she would return to the hospital with no formulas, only this broken lantern and a question. [651]  
Could the gambler who raised her learn to see through cracked panes as well as through marked cards? [669]  
She did not know, but uncertainty, once her adversary, now sat beside her like a quiet friend waiting for the next deal. [691]  
Celeste left the library, lantern shards wrapped in a handkerchief, and the midsummer rain began again, rinsing the city's endless arithmetic. [712]  
Somewhere in the downpour a subway car rattled, fresh scrawls already blooming like green clover in concrete seams. [730]
