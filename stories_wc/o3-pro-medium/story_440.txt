Moonlit neon flickered over the Kairos Recycling Nexus, a cathedral of chrome conveyors and whispering motors. <words>16</words>
It was minutes after the last swipe of paint completed a mural on the exterior loading dock. <words>33</words>
That fresh blaze of color signaled my shift to begin. <words>43</words>
I, Kensei Ravel, a lovingly detached swordsman, stepped through the photo-sensing gate. <words>55</words>
I carried no blade tonight, only a lone shard of sea pottery wrapped in velvet. <words>70</words>
The shard's turquoise glaze once dwelt in a tidepool where oaths sound louder than waves. <words>85</words>
I had vowed there never again to draw blood, yet tonight required a different cut. <words>100</words>
Inside the center, polymer bales shimmered like glaciers beneath ultraviolet auditoriums of sorted trash. <words>114</words>
Somewhere within that maze the secret weavers performed their quiet sabotage of destiny. <words>127</words>
They meddle by reassembling collage scraps from a street artistâ€™s bin, redirecting timelines with glue. <words>142</words>
Every scrap chosen, every tear aligned, edits the city's memory like a playful god. <words>156</words>
Tonight, I must consecrate an impossible vow by letting them weave my future, not theirs. <words>171</words>
I approached their improvised studio, an elevated belt where rejected posters fell like autumn leaves. <words>186</words>
The weavers were children hiding behind holo-patch cloaks that flashed emojis and ancient runes. <words>200</words>
They greeted me with scissors raised as though saluting a ceremonial sword I no longer carried. <words>216</words>
I placed the sea pottery on their worktable of backlit cartons. <words>227</words>
Its edges glimmered, hungry to become part of something vaster than a shattered teacup. <words>241</words>
The youngest weaver, Jax, inspected the shard, her cybernetic eye projecting wave equations on air. <words>256</words>
She asked why a swordsman desired collage when he could cleave answers. <words>268</words>
Because cleaving breaks paths, I replied, but assembling may bind them, even one sworn never to hold steel again. <words>287</words>
The children giggled, sensing the playful seriousness humming in my chest like a tuned string. <words>302</words>
They scattered to salvage newspapers, neon tape, and flaking stickers from the sorting troughs. <words>316</words>
Guided by secret algorithms unknown even to them, their hands choreographed a storm of snippets. <words>331</words>
I did not meddle, yet my presence flavored the pattern the way moonlight salts the sea. <words>347</words>
They trimmed the sea pottery into tesserae, embedding it at the collage's heart like an oracle's pupil. <words>364</words>
When the last scrap adhered, a holographic ripple cascaded across the conveyor belts, freezing every servo. <words>380</words>
The mural outside rewrote itself, replacing the swords once painted there with open palms releasing birds. <words>396</words>
A diagnostic alarm blinked, but no guards came; fate, apparently, approved the revision. <words>409</words>
I felt the vow seal: never to harm, always to mend, forever to wander lovingly detached. <words>425</words>
The secret weavers bowed, returning to their play, while I walked into the receding night without a sword but with a future. <words>447</words>
