Dorian Finch kneaded dough long before dawn broke over Whistle Creek. <words>11</words>
The small-town baker wore a cynically gentle smile that fooled tourists. <words>22</words>
Locals knew the smile hid maps of revolutions in soft crumbs. <words>33</words>
In a locked pantry, next to sacks of rye, waited pressed flowers. <words>45</words>
Each petal preserved the scent of a kingdom lost to tyranny. <words>56</words>
Each stem carried rumors, like veins, sharing seeds of contagion against crowns. <words>68</words>
Dorian watered those invisible seeds with gossip folded inside warm cinnamon rolls. <words>80</words>
Yet pastries alone could not exceed the tyrant's iron appetite for obedience. <words>92</words>
What he needed was time, and the moon kept time faithfully. <words>103</words>
So he slipped nightly to the emergency time machine garage behind the mill. <words>116</words>
Rusty engines there hummed like caged comets, craving coordinates written in starlight. <words>128</words>
Dorian fed them charts he drafted by tracking moon patterns on parchment. <words>140</words>
When shadows learn to speak, they whisper schedules, or so the legends claimed. <words>153</words>
During those hushed hours, bakery ovens cooled while the walls uttered directions. <words>165</words>
The directions foretold a night when flour would become constellations of rebellion. <words>177</words>
He recorded every murmured longitude, folding transcripts beneath layers of bread dough. <words>189</words>
Customers tasted prophecy without noticing the crunch of clandestine cartography. <words>199</words>
Among them, Lark the blacksmith's daughter, nursed bruises from the tyrant's guard. <words>211</words>
She recognized pressed flowers baked inside a bun, symbols of her grandmother's coup. <words>224</words>
That recognition bound her to Dorian's quieter, hotter conspiracy. <words>233</words>
Together they tuned the time machine, substituting meteor sugar for diesel. <words>244</words>
Electricity smelled of caramel as circuits awakened like sleepless saints. <words>254</words>
Coordinates locked on the tyrant's coronation, fifteen years earlier. <words>263</words>
They boarded the chrome basket, hearts proofing like dough in summer heat. <words>275</words>
The garage door blinked, stars folding inward, and reality smelted to moonglass. <words>287</words>
They arrived inside the palace kitchens where younger Dorian still washed pans. <words>299</words>
Lark scattered the seeds of contagion across the royal soup cauldron. <words>310</words>
The seeds were not disease, but memories of freedom compressed to pollen. <words>322</words>
Anyone tasting them would dream another possible government until dreaming turned to action. <words>335</words>
The tyrant gulped three spoons, exceeding his allotment, greedy for acclaim. <words>346</words>
At once his shadow stood up and spoke, accusing its owner aloud. <words>358</words>
Courtiers gasped as the shadow narrated every torture the tyrant had hidden. <words>370</words>
Guilt burned hotter than ovens, and the crown slipped like melting icing. <words>382</words>
Rebellion rose quicker than yeast, for whispered schedules guided every frightened servant. <words>394</words>
When dawn arrived, the tyrant was dethroned, his throne repurposed as proofing rack. <words>407</words>
Dorian and Lark returned to Whistle Creek, pastries cooling beneath honest sunlight. <words>419</words>
Their cynically gentle smiles remained, but now they carried actual sorrow's absence. <words>431</words>
Pressed flowers hung in the bakery window, fluttering like small, triumphant constellations. <words>443</words>
Each petal reminded the town that even shadows can be persuaded to speak sweetly. <words>457</words>
