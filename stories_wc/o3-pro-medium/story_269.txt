Steam hissed like caged serpents around the brass girders of the Royal Aetheric Deck, newly silent after the last code was broken.<words>22</words>
Marcellin, a nostalgic tailor in threadbare waistcoat, surveyed the skyline through rain-frosted glass.<words>35</words>
He carried a dusty mirror under one arm, its silvering cracked into lattices that resembled forbidden schematics.<words>52</words>
Lightning bared the horizon, and with each tremor the observation deck creaked, as though remembering other storms in parallel worlds.<words>72</words>
Tonight, he would open a seam between those worlds, stitching destinies as deftly as he once hemmed opera capes.<words>91</words>
But first he needed reassurance, and the only soul available was Lieutenant Arlen, whose polished boots tapped a subtly menacing rhythm.<words>112</words>
Arlen guarded the deck's chronometric turbines, yet rumors said he pursued the same impossible ascent beyond mortal limits.<words>130</words>
Rain hammered the copper roof, granting them privacy for improbable confessions, a tradition they honored whenever thunder drowned the capital.<words>150</words>
Marcellin set the mirror upright, and its mottled surface showed not reflections but flickers of lives adjacent to their own.<words>170</words>
In one flicker, Arlen wore wings of brass and flame; in another, Marcellin's hands glowed with cosmic thread.<words>188</words>
The sights unsettled Arlen, yet Marcellin spoke softly, hoping to reassure the soldier while nudging him toward complicity.<words>206</words>
He confessed that every tailored suit he ever crafted hid sigils designed to resonate with alternate selves, forming a trans-dimensional pattern.<words>227</words>
The storms, he explained, were the shuttle that pulled the pattern taut across realities, awaiting one final decisive stitch.<words>246</words>
Arlen's jaw tightened, the menacing rhythm halting, because he realized the last code broken tonight had been the code of conscience.<words>267</words>
Yet he too yearned for more than medals and night watches; he yearned to soar where thunder was merely applause.<words>287</words>
So he offered his gauntleted hand to the tailor, asking what price the mirror demanded for passage.<words>304</words>
Marcellin turned the mirror toward himself, and the glass displayed a version of him already ascended, but lonely beyond measure.<words>324</words>
The tailor's nostalgia then bled into resolve: he would ascend only if he could sew companionship into the design.<words>343</words>
He asked Arlen to imagine every soldier, every citizen, mirrored in glory, lifted together on wings of communal invention.<words>362</words>
The lieutenant, trembling, whispered acceptance, and the storm outside roared as though ratifying their covenant.<words>377</words>
Needle in hand, Marcellin pricked both their thumbs, dabbing blood onto the mirror, which swallowed the crimson like hungry velvet.<words>397</words>
Gears beneath the deck spun wild, steam screamed, and the mirror blossomed into a portal where twin silhouettes stepped forward, inseparable, hoping desperately, rising.<words>421</words>
