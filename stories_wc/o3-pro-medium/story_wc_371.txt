After the birds fly south, Elias Petron winds along the dismantled colonnades of the old palace, guided by the scent of wet mint. [23]  
His colleagues at the Institute call him the creeping normality noticer, because he catalogues tiny changes that cities stop seeing. [43]  
Today he carries a satchel heavy with soil, seedballs, and a single paper-wrapped slice of bread from a vanished bakery remembered only in rumors. [67]  
The courtyard at the heart of the palace has survived demolition by being forgotten, vines stitching lattices where architects once plotted marble. [89]  
At its center lies a weathered pavilion whose locked doors hide a secret tea house reserved for those willing to listen first, speak later. [113]  
Elias kneels beside a cracked mosaic basin, and, through guerrilla gardening, tucks seedballs into seams where rain collects. [131]  
He is heuristically gentle, testing soil with fingertips before surrendering each seed to darkness, trusting pattern recognition more than manuals. [151]  
Every action sketches a hypothesis: that neglected places, like neglected people, bloom when someone values their quiet potential. [169]  
When the last seedball is buried, the courtyard hushes, and Elias senses that something beneath the routine drizzle wants to uncloak. [190]  
He follows an almost imperceptible warmth to the pavilion door, presses his palm, and the wood sighs open. [208]  
Inside, lantern light flickers across teapots carved with constellations, and an aged woman pours golden steam into two ceramic cups. [228]  
She introduces herself as Madam Ko, caretaker of forgotten rituals, though she admits the rituals often care for her instead. [248]  
Elias offers the bread from the vanished bakery, its crust still carrying the faint sweetness of anise and chimney soot. [268]  
Madam Ko bows, as if the slice were relic and confession, then divides it between them with a bamboo knife older than both. [291]  
They eat in silence while rain taps the vines, and the ordinary act tastes dangerously close to sacrament. [309]  
Elias feels the itch of professional curiosity but waits; he knows tenuous absolution arrives only when questions are postponed. [328]  
Madam Ko finally speaks, her voice low enough to rattle within the teacups. [341]  
"What brings a mapmaker of ordinary horrors to my courtyard after the birds have gone?" [356]  
Elias admits he is there to find the sacred in the ordinary, fearing that each unnoticed shift erodes the human spirit. [377]  
He catalogues vanishings, yet the catalog offers no rescue, only sterile proof of loss. [391]  
Madam Ko nods, retrieving a tin of oolong and sprinkling leaves over the bread crumbs, as if tea and grain deserved reunion. [413]  
She explains that the tea house survives because people like Elias plant small defiances, then leave before applause can spoil them. [434]  
Guerrilla gardeners are the calmest revolutionaries, she says, monitoring soil moisture instead of headlines. [448]  
The words settle into Elias like rain into the seed seams, and a latent gratitude begins to sprout. [466]  
Still, he confesses an unshakable guilt: every map of disappearance reminds him that he also watched without intervening. [484]  
Madam Ko pours more tea, the steam shaping a fleeting dragon that coils around Elias's wrist before vanishing. [502]  
"Absolution is always tenuous," she murmurs, "but roots do not require certainty to push downward." [517]  
Elias closes his eyes, and inside the dark behind his lids he sees the new shoots that will claim the courtyard by spring. [540]  
He understands that noticing creeping normality is only half the task; the other half is planting its alternative before panic has cause. [562]  
Rising, he thanks Madam Ko, leaves the remaining bread crust for the courtyard sparrows that will return next year, and steps outside. [584]  
The rain has stopped, and moonlight uncloaks the wet leafscape, revealing tiny rivulets weaving like silver threads between new mounds of soil. [606]  
Elias departs the courtyard gate, but not the work, already charting which vacant lots will next receive his heuristically gentle insurgency. [627]  
Somewhere behind him, Madam Ko hums, steeping the future in oolong and rainwater. [640]  
Elias smiles at the thought, feeling the first credible taste of absolution on his tongue, light as steam yet impossibly warm. [661]  
He realizes that sacredness is merely the ordinary relieved of its disguise, and he vows to keep pulling at that veil until dawn. [684]  
Some tasks require armies; his need only a trowel, a pocket of seeds, and the conviction that noticing is the first root. [706]  
He disappears into the sleeping city, as unnoticed as moss on stone, already preparing tomorrow's quiet bloom. [723]
