Mila Vink, the city's most diligent orchestra copyist, slipped into the ember alcove in mist before dawn. [17]  
Others came here seeking forgotten warmth, but Mila hunted for the faint shortwave radio dial glow hidden behind cracked bricks. [37]  
The glow pulsed like a firefly holding its breath, secretly luminous in a world still frightened by excess light. [56]  
It was fifteen years after the story famine, when libraries became barns and pages became tinder. [72]  
Language survived only as crooked graffiti, and even songs muttered through masks of ash. [86]  
Mila, stubborn as a metronome, refused that bleak quiet. [95]  
She had copied symphonies once, jotting bowings and breaths for conductors who argued about destiny. [110]  
Now she copied rumors instead, staves replaced by lines of smuggled lyric fragments. [123]  
Those fragments named a pirate broadcast said to float at night across banned frequencies like contraband gulls. [140]  
If she could find it, she believed she could teach dust to tell stories again. [155]  
Dust, after all, was what remained of burned books, and dust was listening. [168]  
She crouched, rosin-scented fingers tracing the masonry until the dial glow warmed her thumbnail. [182]  
Turning the knob released a hush so careful it seemed to cloak the whole alcove. [197]  
Static poured first, then an elusive song lyric drifted through, vowels soft as moss. [211]  
In that lyric hid directions: 'Count the rests where thunder falters, march seven breaths, kneel to the skyless sea.' [230]  
Mila copied the line onto vellum salvaged from an organ score, her script patient and angular. [246]  
The lyric flickered away, replaced by silence pierced by distant hammers. [257]  
She knew the broadcast moved constantly, hiding like a fugitive melody, so she packed fast. [272]  
Outside, the city spires smoldered with dawn fog, everything colored that thistled calm which follows wild burnings. [289]  
Relying on the lyric, she stepped where thunder usually shook the sheet-metal roofs but today hesitated. [305]  
Seven breaths carried her across a market square haunted by hollow instrument cases turned into birdcages. [321]  
She knelt, and beneath broken cobbles met a trickle of seawater older than maps. [335]  
The water mirrored a faint antenna jutting from rubble, also secretly luminous, coated with salt crystals that looked like notes. [355]  
Mila aligned her vellum so the drawn measures overlapped the crystals, completing a score that only sea and static understood. [375]  
The antenna crackled, then spoke through the shortwave again, the pirate voice raspy yet kind. [390]  
'Copyist, your pages survived you; your breath can resurrect them,' it said, syllables wobbling like candleflame over a draught. [409]  
She answered by tuning her throat to the old tuning A, humming until the antenna matched her pitch. [427]  
Static reorganized into an overture built from windchime shards, market hawker cries, and the remembered rush of applause. [445]  
Via those elusive song lyrics, the pirate broadcast taught the dust swirling around her feet how to vibrate. [463]  
Every mote began to flutter like a tiny page, catching notes, holding consonants, rehearsing narratives misplaced during the famine. [482]  
Mila watched, conducting with her pencil, and the dust obeyed, swirling into shapes of wolves, towers, and starboard sails. [501]  
Stories that had slept in carbon ghosts reclaimed their syntax, then flew outward to perch on listening rooftops. [519]  
Children peered from shattered balconies, mouths ajar, as paragraphs hovered like tame swallows above their hair. [535]  
The city, surprised by new grammar, held its breath; thunder resumed, but gentler, beating time for the unfolding saga. [554]  
Yet the pirate signal began to fade, threatened by the regime's hounds of silence prowling the spectrum. [571]  
Mila realized the broadcast needed a permanent cloak, something to hide inside everyday clatter. [585]  
She beckoned the newly literate dust, instructing it to settle within every bell, gutter, and heartbeat. [601]  
Obedient, the particles dispersed, carrying syllables like spores, embedding pirate frequencies in the city's ordinary soundtrack. [617]  
Now any cough, footstep, or market haggle could become an antenna for stories, if a listener leaned correctly. [635]  
The regime would search for transmitters and find only life itself, resonant and ungovernable. [649]  
Exhausted, Mila returned to the ember alcove, where the dial glow dimmed to an ember twin. [665]  
She placed her vellum beside it, the ink still wet, and whispered the names of forgotten authors. [682]  
Dust rustled in reply, arranging itself into the first line of a new epic, already shining. [698]  
Mila smiled, finally hearing a world where silence had learned to hum in perfect tune. [713]  
She closed her eyes, and the thistled calm settled over everything, fertile as dawn after long famine. [730]
