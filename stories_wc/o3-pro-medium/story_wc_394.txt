Liora coaxed her wheeled wings along the trembling catwalk of the floating workshop. [13]  
Below, the acid sea fizzed green, nibbling iron pilings into lace. [24]  
She breathed ozone and mischief in equal parts. [32]  
Irreverent awe kept her spine straighter than any safety rail could. [43]  
People called her a pioneering cart glider, and she did not dispute the title. [57]  
After all, no cart had ever glided before she forced wheels to envy wings. [71]  
But today the glider was only a tool for a quieter experiment. [83]  
On the central table, gears and cogs tremored like nervous teeth awaiting a dentist. [97]  
A single hunter's arrow tip shone among them, catching sulfur light like a forbidden gem. [112]  
It was the heart of her new striker, a secret stinger planned for a silent bell. [128]  
She wanted to ring a bell no one hears yet, and the arrow would supply the note. [145]  
Why summon unheard chimes at all, apprentices asked. [153]  
Liora answered with the shrug of someone steadily curious, unwilling to barricade wonder behind explanations. [168]  
Throughout the evolution of every machine, she said, there comes a moment when it must sing. [184]  
Her moment awaited inside the uncast bell hanging mute above the acid sea. [197]  
The shape existed only as mirrored negatives in vats of electroplated salt, but she heard future echoes. [214]  
To design that impossible bronze, she had built something odder than any mill or forge. [229]  
The device was a yearning algorithm hammered into brass rods and pulley cords. [242]  
It calculated desires instead of numbers, returning vectors of longing instead of sums. [255]  
Feed it a question, and it spat directions toward whatever a soul might crave. [269]  
Liora cranked its flywheel and posed her riddle: What motion rings the bell of tomorrow? [284]  
The rods clattered, the cords thrummed, and a pointer settled on the kaleidoscope chamber. [298]  
Images inside the colored glass rotated, arranging shards into trembling mandalas. [309]  
She had learned to read movement like scripture, transliterate whirling pictures into workable blueprints. [323]  
Through the images in a kaleidoscope, the yearning algorithm spoke with unsteady rainbows. [336]  
This time it pictured the hunter's arrow tip ricocheting between bell walls, sparking resonance. [350]  
She snapped her fingers, delighted by the insolence of the idea. [361]  
Ringing a bell by shooting it felt exactly mischievous enough to be holy. [374]  
Still, metallurgy came before miracles. [379]  
She rolled the glider cart toward the acid edge where vats bubbled like cauldrons of envy. [395]  
Each vat held a wax core that would become void once bronze replaced it. [409]  
Throughout the evolution of her process, she had lost ten prototypes to impatient corrosion. [423]  
She whispered jokes to the acid, promising it tastier offerings later, if it spared this batch. [439]  
Irreverent awe again, bargaining with a sea that could dissolve her bones in minutes. [453]  
Hours passed in a steam of citrus fumes until the bell cooled to dull umber. [468]  
She mounted it on a swivel above the deck, mouth turned outward toward storm horizon. [483]  
Night crept, but her lamps painted copper halos across the cogs. [494]  
She notched the hunter's arrow tip into a spring bow anchored behind the bell. [508]  
The yearning algorithm ticked quietly, recording potential futures like a gossip scribbling prophecy. [521]  
Liora asked it whether anyone would hear, and it shrugged its gears in polite uncertainty. [536]  
She appreciated honesty, even from machines she had tricked into desire. [547]  
With a grin blistered by salt wind, she yanked the release cord. [559]  
The arrow tip blasted forward, ricocheted, and a hum gathered like bees behind glass. [573]  
Vibration thickened until the newborn bell coughed out a low, impossible chord. [585]  
Its tone slipped beneath ordinary hearing and rolled outward, rippling the acid until it calmed. [600]  
Somewhere beyond the fog, rusted buoys answered with sympathetic rings, though no ears guided them. [615]  
The bell had called to things, not people, and things understood. [626]  
Liora laughed, a sound sharp enough to cut the night yet gentle enough to mend it. [642]  
The yearning algorithm spun once more, printing on its ticker tape a single translated verdict. [657]  
Success, it read, transliterated into human from the secret language of wanting. [669]  
Throughout the evolution of anything magnificent, someone must risk sounding ridiculous first, the tape whispered. [684]  
Tonight, that someone rode a cart that dared to glide over an acid dream. [698]
