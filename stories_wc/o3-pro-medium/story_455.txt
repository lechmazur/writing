A spectral fog clung to the valley as Bram, the disgruntled wishing-well attendant, finished another lonely shift. <words>17</words>
He pocketed the day's offerings, a collection of foreign coins whose mismatched faces glittered like mute accusations. <words>34</words>
Their chill reminded him of the weight of scars—both in metal and in memory—pressing against his ribs. <words>51</words>
Yet his posture remained intensely relaxed, a habit learned from waiting years for wishes never granted. <words>67</words>
Tonight, the moon carved cryptic runes over the courtyard, and Bram recognized them as signposts of the secret agent escape route. <words>88</words>
He had once smuggled messages for spies, corroborating their alibis with the casual shrug of a bored laborer. <words>106</words>
The practice continued even after the war, because old codes, like old ghosts, refused to stay buried. <words>123</words>
Bram's current client, however, was himself, driven to out-face the silent judgments of old ghosts etched in his conscience. <words>142</words>
He intended to slip through the route at the crossing of two unwritten paths where destiny rewrites debts. <words>160</words>
First, he scattered the foreign coins along the well's rim, arranging them by following shadow patterns cast by the lantern. <words>180</words>
Each shadowed coin pointed toward a hatch hidden beneath moss-slick stones, a door he had never dared open. <words>198</words>
The hatch groaned like something remembering pain, a perfect echo of Bram's own cartilage and regrets. <words>214</words>
He descended a spiral stairway chalked with forgotten passwords, the air tasting of rusted wishes and damp parchment. <words>232</words>
Midway, a fork split the tunnel: left toward rumored freedom, right toward the ledger of unpaid atonements. <words>249</words>
Bram paused, fingers tracing the fresh seam where a childhood burn still whispered its chronology of cowardice. <words>266</words>
The weight of scars urged him right, but the moonlit memory of coins suggested otherwise. <words>281</words>
He breathed, intensely relaxed despite the thunder in his ears, and flipped a tarnished drachma for judgment. <words>298</words>
It landed edgewise, a precarious balance that corroborated nothing yet mirrored his life of unresolved halves. <words>314</words>
Taking the coin between thumb and scar, he stepped forward on neither path, carving his own corridor through crumbling mortar. <words>334</words>
Stone dust soared like startled doves, revealing an alcove framed by ancestral masks whose hollow eyes radiated inherited mystery. <words>353</words>
Within lay a mirror-smooth pool, black as unvoiced confession, reflecting him only when he dared hold the scars to its surface. <words>374</words>
The reflection aged backwards, showing the boy who once believed in wishes, then the infant unmarked by flame, then nothing at all. <words>396</words>
In that erasure he felt lighter, as if the scars had paid their own ransom, and the corridor brightened. <words>415</words>
He walked onward until sunrise leaked through a grate, emerging beside the well just as villagers arrived with new hopeful coins. <words>436</words>
Bram smiled, intensely relaxed yet hollowed clean, ready to listen without bitterness and let the old ghosts keep their silence. <words>456</words>
