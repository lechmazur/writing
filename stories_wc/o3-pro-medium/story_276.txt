The uneasy emissary arrived at the orbital debris tracking station during the blunt orange dawn over the Pacific. <words>18</words>
He carried nothing except a thin coathanger bent into the shape of a question mark. <words>33</words>
The station's crew, seasoned watchkeepers of tumbling satellites, watched the emblem of ambiguity with consistently surprising smiles. <words>50</words>
They invited him to the control dome, where digital constellations jittered like nervous fireflies across panoramic screens. <words>67</words>
Throughout picnics scheduled to break the monotony of orbital vigilance, they plied him with space-jam sandwiches and cautious questions. <words>86</words>
He said he had come to learn universal patterns, like syllables whispered by comets, before diplomatic language could calcify them into treaties. <words>108</words>
The station commander, a pragmatic woman named Vega, listened while absentmindedly sorting surveillance printouts according to the branches of redemption she imagined for fallen machinery. <words>133</words>
Every beeping fragment on her screen might, she believed, arc toward atonement if guided gently through atmospheric reentry. <words>151</words>
The emissary nodded and tapped his coathanger against a railing, producing a clear chime that made the room lurch with sudden silence. <words>173</words>
Through the rustle of postcards pinned to a fridge door beside the radar console, an old Earth breeze seemed to answer. <words>194</words>
Those postcards showed beaches, deserts, and laughing families, their corners curled like minor satellites reentering memory. <words>210</words>
Vega interpreted the breeze as permission and overrode a longstanding no-contact directive, allowing the emissary to beam an unfiltered pattern-recognition algorithm into the debris cloud. <words>235</words>
Data cascaded back in auroral ribbons, mapping orphaned bolts, paint flecks, and obsolete panels into swirling genealogies. <words>252</words>
To everyone's surprise, the algorithm predicted that two decades hence the fragments would self-organize, sculpted by gravitational murmurs, into a ring shimmering with reflective harmony. <words>277</words>
That vision felt like accidental wisdom, as though the universe had shrugged and revealed its informal notes. <words>294</words>
The crew cheered, but the uneasy emissary merely traced the imaginary ring in midair, reminding them that redemption's branches also twist toward shadows. <words>317</words>
He explained that pattern recognition can bloom into prophecy, and prophecy can harden into expectation, which sometimes calls catastrophe into being to prove itself correct. <words>342</words>
Therefore he relinquished the thin coathanger, hanging it on the fridge door among the postcards, a promise to choose curiosity over control. <words>364</words>
Vega sealed the algorithm in a dormant archive and scheduled future picnics under the simulated sky, each meal a gentle measure against hubris. <words>387</words>
The emissary, lighter now, watched orbital traces glide across the dome and understood that sometimes the clearest patterns are the ones we agree not to chase. <words>413</words>
