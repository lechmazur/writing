The static electricity garden hummed with pale blue sparks, making the air prickle against Mason's scarred knuckles. <words>17</words>
He was an apologetic thug now, practiced at remorse the way old fighters practice pulling punches. <words>33</words>
But something heavier than guilt crackled tonight, a promise that this time he could break free from the past. <words>52</words>
He carried only a plain wooden crate slat, pocketed from the loading docks where he once ruled by fear. <words>71</words>
The splintered strip felt like a confession, light enough to hold, sharp enough to remember. <words>86</words>
Mason's plan was rationally subjective, a contradiction he savored; it would look accidental yet deliver deliberate opportunity. <words>103</words>
He had staged four supposed coincidences in museums across the city, always near the modernist wings she favored. <words>121</words>
Tonight, beneath quivering ion-blooms, he waited for her fifth arrival, certain that repetition would outlast suspicion. <words>137</words>
Calliope Byrne, curator and survivor, approached the hedge of glass rods arching with silent lightning. <words>152</words>
In the second a new silhouette appears on the horizon of the manicured plasma field, their eyes locked. <words>170</words>
To her, he was still the brawler who once shattered a rival's jaw; to him, she was the witness he failed. <words>191</words>
He bowed, apology trembling like the charged air, and offered the crate slat as if it were a peace treaty. <words>211</words>
Calliope accepted the weathered wood, tracing splinters that mirrored the scars half-hidden beneath his sleeve. <words>226</words>
She asked why he had followed her through halls of marble and hologram, through whispers of paint and plasma. <words>245</words>
His answer was a low confession of motive: to learn the true meaning of resilience by watching the woman who embodied it. <words>267</words>
She remembered the night he spared a boy after seeing her tears, the first crack in his armor of menace. <words>287</words>
Perhaps, she said, resilience was not fists surviving walls but hearts surviving themselves. <words>300</words>
Mason felt the garden's static gather on his tongue, tasting like winter pennies, and he let silence answer. <words>318</words>
Then, gently, Calliope planted the slat into conductive soil, anchoring it upright among the glowing stems. <words>334</words>
Sparks leapt along the grain, burning away grime, turning brutal history into a brief, incandescent sculpture. <words>350</words>
They watched the light until it cooled to ash, both understanding that stories can end without erasing, simply outlasting. <words>369</words>
Under the darkening sky, Mason noticed the newest horizon silhouette dissolving, as if the future itself had been waiting for permission. <words>390</words>
He exhaled, shoulders unclenching, and whispered to Calliope that resilience might also be choosing not to chase that receding shape. <words>410</words>
She smiled, quietly intense, and together they stepped beyond the garden, sparks dimming like applause behind closing curtains. <words>428</words>
