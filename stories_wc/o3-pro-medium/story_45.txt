At dawn, the jungle curator in a floating museum watched vines sway beneath the gondola-decks, their leaves reflecting a dull radiance over the salted clouds. <words>25</words>
A directive arrived from the Board of Preservation, ordering him to repopulate extinct orchids inside an ancient Mesopotamian temple reimagined as an airborne greenhouse. <words>49</words>
The curator, named Iraqul, accepted because he sought to hush the roar of guilt that had echoed since he lost the last sky-ibis. <words>72</words>
Packing specimens, he discovered a transparent violin made of ice crystal, forgotten in quarantine, its fragile strings resonating with the touch of wonder whenever breath misted nearby. <words>99</words>
The mission began as an unexpected road trip due to unforeseen circumstances: engine-gulls disabled the heli-rudders, forcing Iraqul onto the continental caravans that skate across stormglass highways. <words>126</words>
Traveling with crates of humming soil, he kept the logically illogical violin close, suspecting its impossible geometry could calm roots during barometric turbulence. <words>149</words>
Night after night, he played frost-notes that dripped blue light, and commuters along the caravan swore they smelled jungles flowering inside their glove compartments. <words>173</words>
Through the silent overture of tomorrow, the caravan finally parked beneath the floating temple, whose basalt ziggurats were wrapped in copper dirigibles like serpents biting their tails. <words>200</words>
Inside, murals depicted rivers of stars irrigating clay tablets, and Iraqul sensed the structure had been designed for music more than prayer. <words>222</words>
He positioned the orchid spores upon altars, but the air remained too still, too repentant, as though mourning earlier failures of caretakers like himself. <words>246</words>
So Iraqul raised the transparent violin made of ice crystal and coaxed a glacial arpeggio that thawed into birdsong, yet left droplets hovering instead of falling. <words>272</words>
Each suspended droplet refracted seedlings multiplying in mirrors of dew, and within minutes emerald filaments crawled up obsidian walls, eager to repopulate the hollowed sanctum. <words>297</words>
Yet every flourishing vine whispered accusation about the sky-ibis, carving fresh wounds into the curator's memory. <words>313</words>
Unable to bear it, he guided the melody toward dissonance, shattering two strings; shards drifted as snowflakes, and guilt hushed, accepting equal harm. <words>336</words>
From that silence sprouted delicate chirps, and the first newborn sky-ibis unfolded within a droplet like a ghost discovering feathers. <words>356</words>
It perched on Iraqul's shoulder, drinking the remaining note that trembled in his throat, forgiving him in a language of luminous hush. <words>378</words>
With dawn returning, the curator sealed the temple's vents, confident the logically illogical cycle of ice, music, and life would persist without him, resonating forever. <words>403</words>
