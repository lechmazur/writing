The gloom-hill coachman guided his silent carriage down the cracked causeway toward the blooming jetty at twilight. [17]  
He no longer ferried passengers; instead he conveyed a collection of dried seed pods that rattled like timid bones. [36]  
The reef that once sheltered the harbor had whitened, cracked, and slipped beneath the tide last equinox. [53]  
Its death left waters iron-flat, reflecting the sky with the eerie exactness of a closing eye. [69]  
That vacant mirror defined his era: everything felt immeasurable yet boxed by absence, a narrow vastness nobody named. [87]  
He had learned to speak dead languages during long waits between tides, translating foam patterns as others read newspapers. [106]  
The drowned tongues whispered of a submerged concord, an accord once inked by coral scribes and sealed in pearls. [125]  
According to that forgotten treaty, land and sea would alternate stewardship every thousand blooms, healing each other's wounds. [143]  
But the reef's collapse had broken the schedule, and war soon marred the headland like rash on skin. [161]  
Artillery pitted the meadow, leaving crablike craters where flowers once debated with bees. [174]  
When the cannons cooled, he resolved to let a garden reclaim the battlefield, honoring the lapsed millennial promise. [192]  
Seeds alone, however, could not awaken the bruised earth; the soil had drunk too much salt and sorrow. [210]  
He needed a way to fertilize without chemicals that might further tighten the wound. [224]  
So he listened to gulls, terns, and the rare black petrel, parsing their cries with grammars cribbed from tomb inscriptions. [244]  
Bird calls mapped invisible nutrient streams, melodically tracing where guano, kelp, and windborne loam quietly converged. [260]  
By understanding bird calls, he charted crescents of promise across the blasted plateau, the way stargazers plot meteor burns. [279]  
At each marked hollow he tipped his collection of dried seed pods, whispering in reef-Latin for patience. [296]  
Some pods contained moon-sedge, whose roots drink brine; others sheltered scarlet lungwort that exhales oxygen as song. [313]  
He buried them shallow, letting twilight dew moisten husks the same color as spent cartridges. [328]  
Then he parked the carriage on the jetty's furthest plank, facing water that now possessed no coral spine. [346]  
Night insects began their small cymbal clicks, but he waited for the aviary parliament he had subpoenaed. [363]  
First came the sandpiper, delivering three descending notes meaning accept, and a fine spray of shore bacteria drifted shoreward. [382]  
Then the heron croaked a guttural clause that centuries ago governed silt migration, prompting a fresh tide to rise. [401]  
Brackish sheets slid over the battlefield, soft as gauze, seeding it with trace phosphorus and forgotten eggs. [418]  
He did not move, lest shoe leather disrupt the fragile congress now occurring between war metal and future petals. [437]  
Above, constellations emerged like coin rubbings, suggesting the submerged concord might still oversee commerce between wounded realms. [454]  
He recited its preamble in barnacle-Greek, each archaic syllable catching on the wind like sand in an hourglass. [472]  
The water answered with a hush, and the hush thickened into mist that crawled inland and kissed every seed. [491]  
When dawn pierced the veil, green spears already pricked through the mud, arrayed in ranks eerily recalling fallen soldiers. [510]  
The coachman touched one blade, feeling its pulse, and understood that battle lines could be redrawn by chlorophyll. [528]  
Yet his task was unfinished; gardens thrive on memory, and memory is best fertilized with story rather than silence. [547]  
So he hitched the carriage to the wind, its reins woven from dock vines, and began touring the coast. [566]  
At every deserted village he performed the same avian liturgy, teaching children to translate gull jokes into planting calendars. [585]  
Soon the shoreline glittered with saplings, each carrying the hush of the water and the promise of submerged concord reinstated. [605]  
From the crest of Gloom Hill he watched new reefs bud beneath the surface, narrow in sight yet vast in implication. [626]  
The battlefield sighed in flowers, and the coachman's carriage finally felt heavy with passengers again, though every seat held only breeze. [647]  
He drove on, listening for the next bird sentence, while behind him petals kept reciting the dead languages of peace. [667]
