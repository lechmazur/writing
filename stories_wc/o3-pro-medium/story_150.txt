Under the sputtering gears of the steampunk observatory dome perched over Dustvale, Jericho Quade, an outlaw cowboy poet, rehearsed stanzas he claimed were stolen from tomorrow. <words>26</words>
Throughout rehearsals, his verses kept misaligning with the constellations sketched on brass panels, as though the cosmos was editing his meter in real time. <words>50</words>
That virtually peculiar phenomenon might have daunted a lesser bard, yet it only sparked unstoppable curiosity in Jericho's weather-cracked heart. <words>70</words>
He believed answers rattled inside a pair of worn runic bone dice he kept holstered like twin revolvers beside his quills. <words>91</words>
Whenever the dome’s clockwork shutters revealed a new quadrant of sky, Jericho rolled the dice across a concave map, reading their cryptic pips as star coordinates. <words>117</words>
Those coordinates always led him to a coffee shop cantilevered on a drifting balcony, its brick walls scribbling, erasing, and rewriting themselves in phosphorescent chalk. <words>142</words>
By reading coffee shop walls that keep changing text, Jericho learned disjointed prophecies about an eclipse that would braid his fate to someone he had not yet met. <words>170</words>
The walls further warned that the stranger carried the same dice, albeit carved from fossilized lightning, and that their intertwined destinies would either harmonize or shatter the sky’s machinery. <words>199</words>
Saturated ambivalence seeped through Jericho’s thoughts; he relished the promise of cosmic partnership yet dreaded surrendering the lone outlaw myth he had polished into legend. <words>224</words>
One dusk, the brass panels misdialed the heavens, showing noon where night belonged, and the dome’s gears shrieked like violin strings stretched past reason. <words>248</words>
Jericho sensed that the misalignment signaled the arrival of the mirror-boned wanderer, so he tossed his dice once more, each clack echoing along copper ribs. <words>273</words>
The runes spelled out a single command—'Converge'—and before the word could fade, a silhouette pushed through steam, hat brim glowing with bottled auroras. <words>296</words>
Opposite him stood Vega Lys, virtuoso time-luthier and the virtually peculiar twin of his own legend, reciting a sonnet that completed the verses he could never finish. <words>323</words>
Their voices tangled like double helices while the observatory shutters clicked into sync, and together they watched the eclipse thread molten light through the dice they now shared. <words>351</words>
Clockwork constellations realigned, coffee shop walls grew still, and the outlaw cowboy poet finally understood that some rebellions succeed not by solitude but by calibrated harmony. <words>377</words>
Yet as triumph simmered, Jericho flipped one die in his palm and glimpsed a freshly etched rune promising tomorrow’s chaos, preserving the saturated ambivalence he secretly treasured. <words>404</words>
He and Vega exchanged half-smiles, packed ink, gears, and dice, and rode the rising dome into the night, eager to misalign fate once more for the sake of curiosity. <words>433</words>
