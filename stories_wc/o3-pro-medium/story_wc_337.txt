Glass moons drifted above the prism sanctuary under starlight, their fractured reflections painting the marble floor in restless colors. [19]
Inside, I, Neris, the broken mask restorer, waited beside my worktable as another job rattled like a trapped ghost in my satchel. [41]
Lucid unrest clung to the air, a metallic taste that only deepened when I recognized the commission: a lacquer mask shattered into petals of white and gold. [68]
Each fragment still hummed with last week's carnival laughter, but beneath that echo lurked something colder, an interlaced hush that accumulates silence like frost on glass. [94]
I knew the hush would keep growing until everything it touched became numb, so I accepted the task without haggling. [114]
To mend a mask is to mend a face, to mend a face is to calm the spirit still hiding behind it. [136]
Yet this time the spirit was not merely hiding; it roamed the sanctuary corridors, rattling prisms and misaligning the starlight until patterns broke like surf. [161]
To ground restless spirits would require more than resin and porcelain dust. [173]
I would have to exhume its buried name from the silence it had amassed. [187]
For that I needed the oldest tool I owned, a tapestry needle forged from collapsed lighthouse iron, thin enough to pierce memory. [209]
I also needed a method the sanctuary elders disliked naming aloud, because each time it was spoken the walls trembled. [229]
It involved guiding the spirit back to the shore of its life by unraveling knots in a centuries-old fisherman's net. [249]
The net hung in the western alcove, brittle yet still smelling faintly of salt and rain. [265]
Legend said it once dragged up stars mistaken for fish, and the stars bled into the twine, making every loop remember drowning skies. [288]
I lifted the net, whispering a promise that tonight its memory would be used for mercy. [304]
Across sharing a secret with the mute prisms, I threaded the tapestry needle through the first knot and pulled. [323]
The loop loosened, releasing a silver bubble of seaside wind that rolled along the floor, hissing gull cries into echoes. [343]
Wherever the bubble touched, the accumulated silence cracked like old varnish, and the roaming spirit snarled from the rafters. [362]
I kept working, knot after knot, each unraveling exhuming another pocket of remembered sea: tar-black waves, rope-burned palms, a lover waiting on a pier. [386]
The sanctuary lights flickered as the spirits of the drowned fishermen gathered, drawn by nostalgia rather than rage. [404]
Still, the mask shards on my table quivered like teeth in sleepless jaws. [417]
I realized the restless one I sought to ground was not a fisherman at all but an actor who once wore the mask to portray the sea-god. [444]
His performance had stolen applause meant for the dead, and the dead had followed him, hungry for returned honor. [463]
When the actor drowned years later on a drunken swim, his spirit fused with the mask shards, refusing the afterlife until applause was properly redirected. [488]
So I rebuilt the mask mid-ritual, aligning each cleaned fragment, and with every stitch spoke the drowned fishermen's names, gifting them the ovation. [511]
The tapestry needle glowed, weaving seawater light through porcelain seams, turning the surface into a mosaic of moonlit tide. [530]
At the final knot I paused, because the sanctuary itself now accumulated silence, not from threat but from awaiting resolution. [550]
I lifted the restored mask toward the rafters where the actor's shadow writhed, and I bowed, offering him the applause of my own heartbeat and the net's sighing stars. [579]
The spirit accepted, descending into the mask like wind into a sail, finally grounded not by weight but by recognition. [599]
An interlaced hush remained, but now it was gentle, a woven lullaby that promised nothing would break the sanctuary's new equilibrium. [620]
I stored the fisherman's net where moonlight could dry its tears, and the prisms resumed their shifting colors as though waking from a patient dream. [645]
Before dawn, I hung the mask in the eastern apse, because some faces heal better when they face the rising day. [666]
In the hush I felt no emptiness, only the vast, quiet sea inside every knot I had undone. [684]
Silence still accumulated, but now it did so like sand building an island, not like dust choking a room. [703]
And somewhere across sharing a secret with dawn, the spirits of fishermen laughed, their applause soft as foam against distant rocks. [724]
