During lunch breaks, Avery Hale left the humming elevator shafts and slipped into the coastal sand castle preservation lab. <words>19</words>
He was the resort's elevator repair technician, elegantly clumsy in gait yet meticulous with gears. <words>34</words>
The lab smelled of salt, ancient seashell resin, and the dissonance of silence where surf should thunder. <words>51</words>
Avery preferred that hush because the ghosts rarely spoke there, though they crowded every other hallway he serviced. <words>69</words>
Today a spectral child in a dried flower crown perched on a sand turret, swinging transparent legs through its ramparts. <words>89</words>
She watched him like a curator evaluating an exhibit, urging him to understand without words. <words>104</words>
Avery set down his toolbox, pretending to inspect the humidity domes that kept the castles from crumbling. <words>121</words>
In truth he was staking out local ghost tours, mapping which apparitions drifted off script when tourists were gone. <words>140</words>
He believed those unscripted wanderers held clues to a release he craved, a private liberation in letting go. <words>158</words>
If he could learn why they lingered, perhaps he could dissect the tether inside himself that kept their echoes tethered to him. <words>180</words>
The child ghost lifted a crystalline finger toward a miniature drawbridge sagging under dry sand, then vanished. <words>197</words>
Silence followed, so complete it rang, and Avery felt the dissonance vibrate like off-key bells pressed against his ribs. <words>216</words>
His elegantly clumsy hand trembled, toppling a calibrating rod into a turret and collapsing days of delicate artistry. <words>234</words>
Sand hissed, and at that soft avalanche every hidden spirit in the lab materialized, wearing their unfinished histories like wet cloaks. <words>255</words>
Some reached toward the broken castle, others toward Avery, yet none made a sound, and the quiet grew deafening. <words>274</words>
He realized the silence was not absence but pressure, a chorus withheld, and only he could hear its missing notes. <words>294</words>
With a breath that tasted of brine and dust, he spoke aloud, promising to repair the castle if they taught him how to let go. <words>319</words>
The ghosts nodded; their approval was noiseless thunder, and knowledge poured into him like wind shaping dunes. <words>336</words>
He saw elevator cables, life memories, and grief strands braid together, then understood where to snip the single thread binding perception to residue. <words>359</words>
Gently, he dissected that inner knot, thinking of gears releasing brakes, and the spirits flickered, free as foam blown from a crest. <words>381</words>
They drifted through skylights, carrying the dried flower crown like a torch until sunlight erased them. <words>397</words>
Avery exhaled, shocked by how loud his single breath sounded now that the dissonance of silence was gone. <words>415</words>
He rebuilt the broken turret, laughing whenever sand spilled, embracing his elegantly clumsy nature as proof he was finally alone in himself. <words>437</words>
Tomorrow, the elevators would creak, tourists would chase rumors, and he would ride the shafts unburdened, content with complex simplicity. <words>457</words>
