Across the lull of a wounded season, the port city breathed like a rusted accordion beneath a towering labyrinth of shipping containers. <words>22</words>
Within this metallic maze served Larken, an aloof page whose predictably odd silence made dockworkers wonder if wind occupied his veins. <words>43</words>
He ferried manifests between cranes, yet his real cargo was unstoppable curiosity, aching to pierce illusions layered over the harbor's everyday grind. <words>65</words>
An unexpected delay arrived when the tide jammed a barge against the quay, halting operations and granting Larken a sliver of unmonitored dusk. <words>88</words>
He wandered deeper among the stacked steel giants, tracing graffiti constellations until a muffled clatter coaxed him toward a narrow corridor of cobalt containers. <words>112</words>
There he met Anja, a retired deep-sea diver whose suit hung from a hook like a shed exoskeleton beside a weather-beaten logbook. <words>134</words>
The chance meeting, born of docking schedules gone awry, felt scripted by barnacles and calendar tears alike. <words>151</words>
Anja guarded the logbook as if it were an oracle, yet she invited Larken to read, sensing the hunger behind his detached posture. <words>174</words>
Salt-streaked pages chronicled abyssal trenches, leviathan silhouettes, and coordinates where corporate cartographers insisted nothing profitable slept. <words>190</words>
Ink sketches resembled ruins of a civilization drowned before memory, structures that, if raised, could reclaim power from surface oligarchs. <words>210</words>
The imagery ignited Larken's resolve to reconstruct the lost city, not for treasure, but to prove reality could stretch wider than sanctioned charts. <words>233</words>
Skeptical cranes groaned overhead like iron gargoyles as the pair plotted beneath sodium lamps, merging her bathymetric notes with his insider knowledge of freight routes. <words>258</words>
Their plan was predictably odd: smuggle exploration gear inside mislabeled containers, ride the manifest glitches that bureaucracy automatically forgave during holiday lulls. <words>280</words>
Yet Anja insisted they first confront the company archivist who had confiscated portions of her original recordings to bury inconvenient truths. <words>301</words>
Stormlight flickered through cargo alleys as they approached the office cube perched absurdly atop a stack, accessible only by rattling ladder. <words>322</words>
Inside, the archivist--a man who perfumed himself with printer ink--dismissed them until Larken's calm recital of logbook passages exposed his forged indexes. <words>344</words>
Cornered by evidence and curiosity's blade, the archivist surrendered microfilm reels revealing that executive board members had already monetized maps to phantom deposits. <words>367</words>
Realizing his compliance fed their illusion, Larken shed aloofness like a moulting gull and announced the reels would be streamed to every dockscreen before dawn. <words>392</words>
The archivist trembled, but Anja only smiled, feeling the slow crank of reclamation begin as cranes outside lifted containers toward a sunrise newly uncertain. <words>416</words>
Across the wounded season's waning hours, two conspirators walked the pier, their footsteps ringing innovative nostalgia for futures finally surfacing. <words>436</words>
