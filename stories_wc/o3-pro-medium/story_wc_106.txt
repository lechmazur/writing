<story>Mara waited on the cracked marble platform, the world washed copper under a fleeting golden sunset. [16]  
It was the hour she worked best, because shadows sharpened and people grew careless with their faces. [33]  
Everyone called her the golden-hour portrait thief, yet no one could explain what she truly stole. [49]  
Pictures were merely wrappers; she lifted the histories shining in eyes and pocketed them like contraband constellations. [66]  
Tonight, however, she carried something heavier than a camera: a chipped jar of captured moonbeams. [81]  
The jar pulsed at her hip, frosting the air with silver promise that felt almost too bright to touch. [100]  
With it, she intended to steal time itself, or at least collect enough illuminated moments to bargain. [117]  
There was only one buyer eccentric enough to pay that price, and he waited beyond the tracks. [134]  
They called him Miratone, a broker of futures who spoke in codes in flower arrangements delivered by night porters. [153]  
A rose tilted left meant caution; violets beneath fern meant run; lilies withered at both ends meant disappear completely. [172]  
Mara, quietly savvy, had deciphered his bouquets since she was twelve and hungry for impossible doors. [188]  
Tonight's arrangement had been a single camellia wrapped in newspaper, its petals inked with the word Listen. [205]  
So she waited, ears ringing with the command, wondering what symphony the city might play if leaned toward correctly. [224]  
The station lights flickered emerald as the sun slipped, turning the place into the fabled emerald station by moonlight. [243]  
Locomotive whistles drifted through the dark like questions nobody dared voice. [254]  
Mara's heart answered each whistle with a throb, equal parts dread and luminous disbelief at her own audacity. [272]  
She almost missed the boy who sat beside the rusty timetable, sketching trains that had never existed. [289]  
His paper glowed green under the station lamps, and as she watched he drew her silhouette uncannily. [306]  
When he finished, he tore the page and offered it without looking up, whispering, 'Hold this against the jar.' [325]  
Startled, she complied, and the graphite lines absorbed the moonlit shimmer, revealing hidden sigils between train windows. [342]  
She recognized Miratone's calligraphy, a command to reinterpret every station announcement as prophecy. [355]  
At once the loudspeaker crackled: 'Delay on Track Seven, arrival unknown,' which her mind twisted into 'Fate stalls until courage boards.' [376]  
Another metallic voice warned of slippery surfaces, and she heard, 'Hearts may slip unless steadied by silver light.' [394]  
She understood: the jar must be opened here, not traded, because the station itself was the buyer. [411]  
Miratone, ever the broker, had arranged the meeting place to press your ear against destiny's door literally. [428]  
Mara inhaled, feeling rails hum beneath her boots like vocal cords of some buried giant. [443]  
She uncorked the jar, and moonbeams spiraled upward, weaving liquid ladders that clinked against the iron rafters. [460]  
Passengers froze, their faces illuminated as though someone had struck a match inside their memories. [475]  
Each remembered an abandoned wish, and those wishes glimmered above them like departure boards rewritten in starlight. [492]  
In that hush, Mara felt the collected illuminated moments pour from the jar back into rightful owners. [509]  
Some wept, some laughed, and one old conductor began dancing with his lantern, inventing new constellations across the floor. [528]  
Mara's own chest hollowed, because the moments she'd hoarded for barter were now gone, and yet she felt lighter. [547]  
Then the ladders of light folded inward, becoming a single door outlined in argent, humming with unimaginable destinations. [565]  
The boy with the sketches tapped her elbow and pointed, his eyes wide with the same luminous disbelief burning in hers. [586]  
She realized he was her younger self, a memory she once stole and forgot to lock away. [603]  
Together they stepped forward, ears pressed against the glowing seam, listening not for trains but for possibility. [620]  
The door opened with a sound like distant surf interpreted by violins, and the station cheered without words. [638]  
Mara did not look back at the jar, now empty, because gifts given freely no longer require accounting. [656]  
She carried only the boy's sketch, still alive with shy graphite, as they stepped into whatever awaited beyond. [674]  
Outside, the golden-hour light finally died, and yet inside that door the sunset would never be fleeting again. [692]</story>
