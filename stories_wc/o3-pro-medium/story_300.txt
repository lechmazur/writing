Pliny the Younger might have called the hubbub civilized, but Cassia the outlaw saw opportunity. <words>15</words>
She strode through the ancient Roman marketplace with dust on her boots and a grin sharper than denarii. <words>33</words>
Earnest mockery twinkled in her eyes, as if every merchant's boast was a personal comedy routine. <words>49</words>
Yet the humor masked determination, for rumors spoke of a hidden power source buried beneath cracked marble. <words>66</words>
Such energy could unshackle provinces, and an outlaw with ideals is merely a statesman awaiting titles. <words>82</words>
To track it, she carried a simple cloth pouch full of pigments stolen from retired muralists. <words>98</words>
Her plan was wistfully pragmatic, like carving poetry into a sword's blade for balance. <words>112</words>
She would browse the stalls, pretending to shop for olives, while her pigments searched for kin. <words>128</words>
The method, absurd yet brilliant, relied on matching paint smudges left on disused canvases sold as wrapping. <words>145</words>
She reasoned that the same mineral trace empowering the canvases would halo the hidden engine's chamber. <words>161</words>
Find the sibling glow, find the source. <words>168</words>
At the threshold of discovery, Cassia felt the shimmer of possibility prickle like static along her knuckles. <words>185</words>
A vendor hawked cheap landscapes, colors bruised by time, perfect for her improbable spectroscopy. <words>199</words>
She bought two with counterfeit coins and retreated to a fountain, dabbing each smear against her pouch. <words>216</words>
One smear flared coral, harmless; the other flickered silver, then echoed the pouch's mute violet flame. <words>232</words>
That echo sang like distant anvils, telling her the engine slept beneath the basilica steps. <words>247</words>
She marched, disguising urgency with a yawn, while street jugglers mocked patrician accents for spare coppers. <words>263</words>
Their earnest mockery mirrored her own philosophy: ridicule the throne so you may someday occupy it wisely. <words>280</words>
Inside the basilica, mosaics of gods raised brows at the intrusion of a mud spattered fugitive. <words>296</words>
Cassia knelt, feeling for hollow resonance, until her ring struck a seam between cracked tesserae. <words>311</words>
She pried it open, revealing a staircase spiraling into darkness that smelled of lightning preserved in jars. <words>328</words>
Below, an orb pulsed, each wave rearranging dust into fleeting constellations, a cosmic joke with serious punch. <words>345</words>
She tipped the silver smeared canvas toward the orb, and the pigments leapt like homesick swallows returning. <words>362</words>
Power coursed into the cloth, its once humble threads glowing imperial purple, yet the pouch did not burn. <words>380</words>
Holding it aloft, Cassia laughed softly, a sound equal parts prayer and taunt, promising change to whichever senator listened. <words>399</words>
History, ever vain, would credit emperors, but the marketplace knew the outlaw who browsed for destiny and found it. <words>418</words>
