Silver puddles mirrored the sky where the storm had passed, and the glowing viaduct after rain hummed like a living conduit beneath the clouds. [24]  
At its center stood Ira, called the Gravity Defier, whose boots barely kissed the stone as if allegiance to weight were optional. [46]  
She had come during the impossible sliver of chronology locals named 'between the drop and the ripple,' when causes warmed yet effects slept. [69]  
In her gloved hands lay an ancient clay tablet with runes that shifted under rainlight, reordering themselves whenever her pulse sped. [90]  
The runes promised passage through fractured timelines, but only if she could retrace the branching of her own memory without flinching. [111]  
Ira's motivation was blunt: to conquer the labyrinth of self, because every corridor she ignored returned as a nightmare wearing her face. [133]  
The tablet's shifting glyphs formed nightly in her dreams, whispering that identity could be rebuilt through procedural generation if she supplied honest seed data. [157]  
So she arrived at the viaduct, where dripping arches cast prismatic shadows, each arch an algorithm waiting for a value no equation dared define. [181]  
The first step lifted her ankle high above the rail, and gravity simply forgot her, recognising a compatriot in rebellion. [201]  
Brightness gleamed off the wet stone, but a darkening brightness, as though luminescence itself knew the coming cost and trembled. [221]  
The tablet pulsed, and the archway before her unfolded like a menu, offering three corridors labelled Regret, Conceit, and Silence. [241]  
Through procedural generation the choices would respawn until one was entered, so indecision merely multiplied the maze, stretching it across invisible centuries. [263]  
Ira picked Silence, hearing already the hush of withheld confessions, and the viaduct bricks rearranged into a descending helix. [282]  
She floated downward, shoes skimming air currents that smelled of ozone and childhood. [295]  
Whispers leaked from the walls, each syllable a memory she had denied: a broken promise to her sister, laughter faked at a funeral. [318]  
To retrace, she repeated the moments aloud, acknowledging sequence and consequence, until the corridor straightened and brightened, then dimmed again, darker than before. [341]  
That oscillation of glow was the first hint she was periodically eternal, a being who cycles not through days but through recognitions. [363]  
Every time she accepted a truth, the timeline splintered, creating one future where she advanced and another where she fled. [383]  
Somewhere behind the brickwork, countless Iras howled as their corridors collapsed, victims of possibilities she no longer required. [401]  
She felt the guilt of mass extinction, yet also a crystalline clarity: survival meant choosing which fragment of herself would earn sunrise. [423]  
The helix ended at a rainlake's surface suspended midair, its skin trembling but unrippled. [437]  
The tablet warned, in reformed runes, that entering would place her precisely between the drop and the ripple, a hinge no exit follows. [460]  
Ira inhaled, tasted petrichor and static, and stepped onto the surface, which accepted her weightless form as a parchment accepts ink. [481]  
Time arrested; droplets hung around her like planets on pause, and she realized she had entered the editors' room of reality. [502]  
Each droplet contained a sketch of her life, some happy, some grotesque, but all awaiting the ripple that would render them permanent. [524]  
The darkening brightness peaked, colors so vivid they scorched, and she understood brightness could wound when the dark was banished too fast. [546]  
She touched a droplet showing her hugging her sister years hence, honest laughter spilling, and the clay tablet vibrated, approving the branch. [568]  
Another droplet displayed her ascending city towers, worshiped as a savior for teaching gravity to forget others, and a shiver of revulsion passed. [591]  
She wiped that droplet away, and across unknown timelines a million tyrant-Iras evaporated before taking their first cruel step. [610]  
Choice by choice, she composed a life pattern that left power diffused and love concentrated, a map impossible to draw yet easy to walk. [634]  
When she finished, the rainlake rippled outward, each circle baptizing a timeline, and gravity remembered her again, tugging gently, almost fond. [655]  
She rode the pull upward, emerging onto the viaduct as dawn cracked the storm's shell, the world subtly but decisively reorganized. [676]  
The arches no longer glowed; they breathed, inhaling gloom, exhaling promise, like lungs installed in architecture. [692]  
Ira touched the tablet, now blank as dry clay, and understood its runes lived on in her veins, ready for their next cycle. [715]  
She walked back across the viaduct, almost but not quite touching the ground, carrying a darkening brightness meant to light others without burning them. [739]
