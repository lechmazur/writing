Silver dust drifted like idle snow outside the lunar greenhouse perched on the crater's jagged edge. <words>16</words>
Inside, Milo Vance stood guard, shoulders locked so tight the hydroponic pipes seemed looser. <words>30</words>
He was the colony's tense bodyguard, assigned to protect Director Holm and, paradoxically, suppress his own spirit. <words>47</words>
A faded photograph of Earth's old lakes peeked from his breast pocket, reminding him of parks he had never visited. <words>67</words>
Director Holm's commands echoed through the intercom, soft as lullabies yet shackling as chains; Milo felt serene anger blossom. <words>86</words>
Holm planned to ratify a new security charter that would seal the habitat, outlawing any unsupervised stroll under starlight. <words>105</words>
Milo's motivation to break free from that controlling influence crystallized the moment he heard children hum an old Earth anthem. <words>125</words>
They were passing the greenhouse amid park visits, tiny legs bouncing in simulated gravity, gossiping about secret alcoves near airlocks. <words>145</words>
Milo, serendipitously stubborn, began collecting fragments of their overheard stories the way farmers collect dew. <words>160</words>
Each fragment formed a map: disused maintenance shafts, cracked bulkheads, a forgotten window where Earthrise painted silver bars gold. <words>179</words>
While pruning tomato vines that glowed like rubies, he rehearsed departure paths and the speech he would deliver to Holm. <words>199</words>
The speech was no plea but a declaration of a timely rebirth, an oath to live unguarded. <words>216</words>
Night cycles later, Holm summoned him beneath hanging cucumber lanterns, intent on swearing him into the new charter. <words>234</words>
Milo presented the faded photograph with shaking gloves, letting the cracked image of azure water speak of unattained freedom. <words>253</words>
He whispered, "Director, this charter kills lakes we have not yet grown," and Holm's lips thinned like wilted leaves. <words>272</words>
Holm reached for the document, but Milo stepped back, posture rigid, voice calm, eyes burning with lunar reflection. <words>290</words>
"Today I ratify my own autonomy," he said, and the greenhouse's recycled air trembled. <words>304</words>
Alarms did not shriek; instead, the cucumbers swayed gently, as if blessing the decision with chlorophyll prayers. <words>321</words>
Milo walked away, serene anger guiding him through corridors where children's chalk arrows pointed toward rumored skylights. <words>338</words>
He followed, collecting final murmurs--"the hatch sticks, but push twice"--until the colony's heartbeat faded behind bulkhead after bulkhead. <words>356</words>
The maintenance shaft yielded to the crater's rim, where stars pooled like spilled diamonds above unfiltered silence. <words>373</words>
For the first time, Milo released the safety on his own breath, tasting frost rather than policy. <words>390</words>
He tore the photograph into drifting confetti, letting the past decompose into fertilizer for tomorrow's unregulated gardens. <words>407</words>
Somewhere below, Holm would search, but among stellar winds Milo Vance experienced his timely rebirth, stubborn even against destiny. <words>426</words>
