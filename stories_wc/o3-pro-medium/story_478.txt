Under a waxing moon's glow, the orchard island drifted within a swirling maelstrom like a cradle of trembling fruit.<words>19</words>
Branches bent but did not break, singing a dissonant calm that hushed the roaring water.<words>34</words>
Mirla, the critical midwife, rowed toward the pebbled shore, eyes narrowed as if grading the island itself.<words>51</words>
She had delivered empires and infants with equal rigor, and now she sought to recover stolen memories of her own birth.<words>72</words>
Those memories, legend whispered, were hidden here by the jealous River, pressed flat between pages of half-burned diaries left smoldering in a stone fireplace.<words>96</words>
Mirla stepped onto land carrying a pouch of pressed herbs whose scent reminded her body to breathe and her mind to question.<words>118</words>
The orchard trees parted, openly secretive, showing paths then covering them, as if encouraging her pursuit yet guarding their own ripening wisdom.<words>140</words>
At the island’s heart she found the ruined cottage whose fireplace still coughed sparks beneath the ash of unspoken lives.<words>160</words>
Within the grate, half-burned diaries fluttered like wounded birds, pages curled but ink unscorched where the River feared to lick.<words>180</words>
Mirla arranged her pressed herbs in a ring, each leaf an astringent question, and sat cross-legged before the glow.<words>199</words>
She inhaled until the maelstrom’s thunder thinned to fetal heartbeats, then opened the nearest diary and felt herself split along forgotten seams.<words>221</words>
Words blurred, reformed, and spoke directly: your first cry was taken, midwife, so your judgment could never soften.<words>239</words>
Recover it, and you will grow wisdom instead of merely delivering it.<words>251</words>
Tears salted her lips, yet her voice remained steel because critique was her lullaby and scalpel.<words>267</words>
She realized the diaries were not parchment but layers of river-water memory petrified into story, awaiting incision.<words>284</words>
Using the unbiased sharpness of a midwife’s tone, she read each line aloud, slicing silence from sound.<words>301</words>
The maelstrom above echoed her cadence, waves lifting like lungs, and the moon waxed brighter, gravid with possibility.<words>319</words>
Suddenly a current of silver letters rose from the pages, spiraled through the chimney, and struck her chest like gentle lightning.<words>340</words>
Mirla felt her stolen cry return, small yet thunderous, vibrating her ribs as though summoning every infant she had ever scolded into breathing.<words>363</words>
She understood that critique without compassion aborts growth, and compassion without critique drowns in sentiment; the new cry harmonized both.<words>383</words>
With that realization, she could transcend the island’s looping storm, but first she owed a delivery to the orchard itself.<words>403</words>
She scattered remaining herbs at every trunk, blessing seeds, limbs, and lingering secrets, then whispered judgment and comfort into the wind until dawn threatened.<words>427</words>
The island sighed, roots drinking her released wisdom, and in the ebb of the maelstrom Mirla rowed away carrying both child and elder within her lungs.<words>453</words>
Behind her, the waxing moon reclined, its calm now consonant, knowing a midwife had just delivered her own beginning.<words>472</words>
