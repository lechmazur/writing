In the hush where hope takes root, the floating island spa drifted through a lavender sky like a bemused teacup. <words>20</words>
Guests soaked while minnows delivered cucumber slices, yet an air of humorous unease shimmered beneath the eucalyptus steam. <words>38</words>
Into this spa stalked Havel the contrite swordsman, his posture hypnotically rigid despite the complimentary robe swaddling his remorse. <words>57</words>
Years ago he had swung too freely, leaving both a kingdom wounded and his conscience scabbed like an unloved pear. <words>77</words>
Now he sought redemption and a plan to unmask a pretender to the throne who lounged somewhere among the mud baths. <words>98</words>
Clutched in his calloused hand was a cracked monocle, the sole clue whispered by a dying librarian with suspiciously twirled mustaches. <words>119</words>
The librarian had babbled that the real sovereign bore tattoos written backward in royal ink, readable only when their yarn unraveled. <words>140</words>
Havel, skilled more with steel than semantics, puzzled over whether the dying man meant thread, tale, or both. <words>158</words>
He decided to investigate every patron by politely offering to yarn about his adventures, hoping loosened tongues would tangle into confession. <words>179</words>
The first suspect, a baroness with giraffe tattoos, listened, giggled, then fell asleep, leaving him only a complimentary pumice stone. <words>199</words>
The second, a bald monk, was so hypnotically rigid that even Havel's most outrageous swashbuckling anecdote bounced off his silence. <words>219</words>
At twilight the swordsman spotted a dandy wearing a silk towel like a royal sash and peering through an uncracked monocle twin. <words>241</words>
The symmetry with Havel's damaged lens tingled his instincts, so he followed the dandy into the carbonated waterfall chamber. <words>260</words>
There, mosaic lights refracted through steam, revealing cryptic tattoos spiraling around the dandy's shoulders like rebellious grammar marks. <words>278</words>
Remembering the librarian's riddle, Havel tugged a loose thread of towel, and the tattoos began unraveling sentence by sentence across damp skin. <words>300</words>
Each vanished word loosened the dandy's posture until the man, formerly hypnotically rigid, wilted like overcooked asparagus and confessed he was Prince Fraudrick. <words>323</words>
He had schemed to seize the throne using spa vouchers and forged genealogies, but now the unraveling script bound him to truth. <words>345</words>
Strangely, with each admission, the cracked monocle in Havel's knuckles mended itself, glass growing clear as though kindness were solder. <words>365</words>
Freed by kindness rather than steel, Fraudrick collapsed, thanked Havel, and offered restitution coupons for bottomless hibiscus smoothies. <words>383</words>
Havel accepted, but only after binding the prince with yarn spun from towel threads, promising to escort him to rightful judgment at dawn. <words>406</words>
He lingered on the balcony where clouds drifted like sheepish courtiers, feeling the hush where hope takes root settle into his breathing. <words>428</words>
Contrition, he realized, is a floating island spa too, and sometimes the only entrance fee is the courage to be gentle. <words>449</words>
