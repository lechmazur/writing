Ash dripped like grease from red iron eaves of the infernal kitchen, sizzling on eternity. <words>15</words>
Within this scalded corridor, a distracted guard tapped his spear against pans that howled. <words>29</words>
He was assigned to mind sauces, yet his thoughts orbited farther, almost radical in drift. <words>44</words>
Every bubble popping in brimstone broth reminded him of the price of forgiveness he could not pay. <words>61</words>
Because he had none, he guarded someone else's regret, hoping proximity might displace his own debts. <words>77</words>
That someone else boiled inside a cauldron shaped like a clogged heart, murmuring apologies too late. <words>93</words>
In the space where an apology waits unspoken, silence grows claws. <words>104</words>
The guard feared those claws would reach through steam and tear open his quiet pretense. <words>119</words>
To outmaneuver cosmic silence, he studied an hourglass confiscated from a doomed chronomancer. <words>132</words>
Its sand was not sand but embers swirling like luminous quarrels seeking a mouth. <words>146</words>
He learned the device spoke only by clarifying the swirling patterns inside a dreamlike hourglass. <words>161</words>
If he read them right, he'd know who deserved release and who merely begged. <words>175</words>
Tonight, the embers arranged themselves into a partial spool of ribbon, frayed yet defiantly bright. <words>190</words>
The image tugged at him, echoing a childhood gift he ruined then never replaced. <words>204</words>
Memory sharpened, and the guard felt abrasive calm settle like salt on raw conscience. <words>218</words>
He realized the ribbon was meant for the boiling soul, whose crime was cutting trust too soon. <words>235</words>
Delivering it might cost the guard his post, maybe his skin, yet balance demanded payment. <words>250</words>
He tore linen from his sleeve, twisting until it resembled the pictured spool, then dipped it in starlit vinegar. <words>269</words>
Vinegar, the only cool liquid allowed here, hissed like doubt against his fingertips. <words>282</words>
With this surrogate ribbon he approached the cauldron, steam arranging demons into skeptical jurors. <words>296</words>
Each juror demanded to know the price of forgiveness, but the guard answered by opening his palm. <words>313</words>
The linen smoldered, yet held shape, and the boiling soul ceased thrashing long enough to see. <words>329</words>
A hush displaced the kitchen's clatter; even pans paused midpoint in their metallic arguments. <words>343</words>
At that moment, in the space where an apology waits unspoken, both men inhaled the same blistering air. <words>361</words>
The guard placed ribbon on bubbling surface, and it did not burn but blossomed into purple smoke. <words>378</words>
Smoke swirled, then shaped words that only the guilty could read, granting release without permission from authority. <words>395</words>
Chains unlatched, the cauldron cracked, and the liberated soul stepped through silence, taking the guard's place as penance. <words>413</words>
Thus forgiveness demanded substitution, and the guard fell upward into quiet beyond noise, finally deaf to cosmic silence. <words>431</words>
He vanished, but the kitchen kept sizzling, abrasive calm restored, the ribbon's lesson coiled in every ladle. <words>448</words>
