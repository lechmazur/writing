The cathedral's bronze bell stilled mid-swing, and silence settled like dust between its echoes. <words>14</words>
That was the moment the indifferent blacksmith Arin begrudgingly accepted the lantern from the abbot. <words>29</words>
Work waited below, somewhere beneath the choir stalls and the centuries of whispered prayers. <words>43</words>
Between bells, Arin was to descend the maze-like catacombs and fulfill a forgotten covenant. <words>57</words>
He cared little; hammers rang louder than prophecies in his mind. <words>68</words>
Still, he followed the spiral stair where stone breath felt uniquely natural against calloused palms. <words>83</words>
At the landing, a mule waited with his portable forge strapped awkwardly across its back. <words>98</words>
"Haw," Arin muttered, and the beast obeyed, clopping into halls painted by trembling candlelight. <words>112</words>
The path forked endlessly, yet the abbot's map instructed him to gather relics scattered like crumbs. <words>128</words>
Each relic would speak in silence, composing a collection of objects that tell a story. <words>143</words>
First, he pried a cracked censer from rubble left by the great quake two winters prior. <words>159</words>
Its chains shimmered faintly, smelling of soot and absolution. <words>168</words>
Next came a brass nail, twisted into a spiral by unimaginable heat, lodged inside a saint's skull. <words>185</words>
Last, half-buried beneath bones, he discovered a faded ribbon knotted around nothing at all. <words>199</words>
Its color once crimson now hovered between dawn and dust, refusing to choose. <words>212</words>
The mule brayed, unsettled, as though the ribbon whispered of roads without sunlight. <words>225</words>
Bell metal thundered far above, marking the midpoint between bells, urging haste. <words>237</words>
Arin set his anvil on a slab shaped like an open book, fire breathing from coals. <words>253</words>
He arranged the censer, nail, and ribbon in a crescent, the collection's grammar deliberate. <words>267</words>
Sparks rose; he hammered the air itself, forging nothing visible yet bending intention like iron. <words>282</words>
From the rubble's memory, vision flared: a city shattered, then towers rising from rubble anew. <words>297</words>
The objects glowed, speaking in pulses of heat that only a blacksmith could read. <words>311</words>
They promised strength if someone indifferent enough to wield it struck the final blow. <words>325</words>
So Arin lifted the faded ribbon, its softness mocking anvils, and sliced his palm. <words>339</words>
Blood soaked the threads, turning them vividly alive, and the catacombs inhaled. <words>351</words>
In that breath, stone grew roots, arches flowered, and every collapse rewound like patient ivy. <words>366</words>
The unknown accepted the covenant, satisfied by a sacrifice both mundane and uniquely natural. <words>380</words>
Arin felt nothing except the usual fatigue that follows any long shift at the forge. <words>395</words>
He pocketed the brass nail, wiped his hand on the mule, and began the ascent. <words>410</words>
Behind him, the ribbon fluttered free, tying itself around the rebuilt arch like dawn's signature. <words>425</words>
Above, the second bell rang; below, silence sealed a future no prophecy could fully name. <words>440</words>
