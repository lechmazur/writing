The lonesome minstrel tuned his cracked guitar beside the rooftop horse stables overlooking the chromium spires of Neo-Capitol.<words>18</words>
Morning commuters queued for synthetic cappuccinos in the plazas below, their chatter floating up like steam.<words>34</words>
Amid those coffee lines, the minstrel felt both audience and exile, a paradox he carried like spare change.<words>52</words>
He had come with a motivation stranger than song: to read the silent cosmos hidden in daylight.<words>69</words>
His method, bizarrely typical for rooftop prophets, was to forecast fate by tracking cloud patterns drifting above the monorails.<words>88</words>
Each cumulus swirl carried echoes of inherited rivalries that ran through his blood like unresolved chords.<words>104</words>
Generations ago, two minstrel houses had bickered over which constellation blessed their melodies, and the feud never really ended.<words>123</words>
He bore the rubber stamp of that quarrel on his passport cover, its image unclear after so many rainstorms.<words>142</words>
Officials always squinted at the smudged emblem, unsure whether it approved or condemned him, which felt poetically correct.<words>160</words>
Now, standing among straw bales and solar panels, he raised his gaze to the clouds marching like silent bands.<words>179</words>
A mare with chrome-braided mane snorted beside him, as if impatient for the reading to begin.<words>195</words>
He whispered verses while the city drones hummed below, weaving mundane enchantment through every syllable.<words>210</words>
Then a peculiar cirrus split like a tuning fork, pointing east toward the rival enclave where his cousins played neon lutes.<words>231</words>
The omen suggested reconciliation, or possibly surrender, depending on where the next breeze bent the filaments.<words>247</words>
He hesitated, remembering how elders labeled peace agreements 'bizarrely typical' before tearing them up in tavern backrooms.<words>264</words>
The mare stamped, jostling a feed bucket and scattering oat holograms that flickered like constellations underfoot.<words>280</words>
Inspired, he pressed the faded rubber stamp onto his guitarâ€™s soundboard, sealing whatever verdict the skies would offer.<words>298</words>
Ink seeped into wood, and the image remained unclear, but the gesture felt louder than any chord he knew.<words>317</words>
He began to play, not toward the queueing multitudes nor toward his distant cousins, but straight at the indifferent clouds.<words>337</words>
Melody rose with manure scent and roasting espresso, an accidental anthem for citizens waiting on caffeine and destiny.<words>355</words>
Below, two baristas started to bicker about whose shift would restock syrups, their quarrel fading as notes drifted down.<words>374</words>
In that small cessation of argument, he perceived the cosmos answer, not with thunder, but with a gap of precious silence.<words>395</words>
The minstrel smiled, realizing peace could be as bizarrely typical as ordering coffee if one just listened upward first.<words>414</words>
He packed his guitar, bowed to the mare, and descended the ladder, carrying the silence like a new refrain.<words>433</words>
