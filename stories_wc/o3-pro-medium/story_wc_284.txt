Mist blew across Zephyr Bluff like breath drawn and held, muffling the world in a silver hush. [17]  
Mara Grey, once the agency's brightest ghost and now its burned spy, climbed the shale path with deliberate, prudently daring steps. [38]  
At the tilt of the earth toward spring, everything smelled of thawing secrets and half-melted danger. [54]  
She carried an engraved pillbox inside her glove, its silver lid patterned with circling swifts and the initials of a man presumed dead. [77]  
The pillbox was light, but to Mara it weighed exactly as much as everything broken she meant to fix. [96]  
A gust coiled from the valley, worrying her coat like a critic tugging at a frayed script. [113]  
She paused under a weather-twisted pine and surveyed the snowfield spread across the bluff. [127]  
This was the stage where she would speak again in the language of spies: codes in accumulated snow. [145]  
Seven years ago she had taught that language to Elias, whose initials adorned the pillbox, whose betrayal had burned them both. [166]  
Now she had come to discover whether unused courage still waited in either of them, and if it did, to vouchsafe it. [188]  
Mara crouched and dragged her gloved finger across the crusted snow, inscribing the first barbed glyph of their agreed cipher. [208]  
Shadow pooled between the grains, and the mark gleamed darker than ink against the pale. [223]  
She added two more signs, then straightened, feeling the old tension stitch itself into her shoulders like sutures. [241]  
From the fog downstream a figure emerged, coat silvered with rime, walking as though each step required permission from regret. [261]  
Elias stopped ten paces away, and the mist acceptingly folded around them, sealing the bluff in quiet conspiracy. [279]  
His face bore the pallor of half-healed burns; hers mirrored the same, a matched set of cauterized choices. [297]  
Neither spoke first, because precision mattered more than comfort, and both had unlearned extravagance. [311]  
Elias knelt beside the glyphs and completed the sequence with a single looping curve that meant, simply, I remember. [330]  
The letters, temporary and silent, bridged what years of exile had left smashed. [343]  
Mara opened the pillbox and revealed not poison or microfilm, but a single brass gear no larger than a thumbnail. [363]  
It came from the town clock Elias had wrecked by hiding a detonator within, the day their covers collapsed. [382]  
The gear was the tooth he had broken from time itself, and she had spent the intervening winters learning to mend its wound. [405]  
She placed the gear on the snow between them, the metal glinting like a gold seed in barren soil. [424]  
Fixing what's broken, she said, is not the same as pretending it never shattered. [438]  
Her voice steadied the bluff, and the silver hush seemed to lean closer, listening. [452]  
Elias answered with an engineer's gaze, measuring, calculating, daring, yet prudently aware that some errors lived beyond recall. [470]  
Still, he removed a tiny screwdriver from his coat and angled his knee to cradle the pillbox as though it were a patient heart. [494]  
They worked side by side, fingers red with cold, easing the gear into a spindle she'd reconstructed from scavenged pocket-watches. [514]  
Nothing ticked yet, but possibility vibrated beneath their hands, a faint tremor keeping time with two cautious hopes. [532]  
When the mechanism finally clicked, the sound was soft as thawing ice, and both of them felt a hinge inside their ribs align. [555]  
Mara closed the pillbox, returned it to her glove, and drew a fresh line in the snow that translated to go west, together. [578]  
Unused courage waits where we decide to carry it, she murmured, and for once she was not delivering a code but a promise. [601]  
Elias stood, snow brushing from his knees like pages he no longer needed to redact. [616]  
A pale sun pried through the mist, gilding their breath, and the silver hush brightened toward something almost melodic. [635]  
Behind them, the snow-written codes would melt by noon, releasing their secrecy back into water, but what they carried would not dissolve. [657]  
Together they descended the bluff, leaving the repaired pillbox ticking against her pulse, the repaired trust ticking against his. [676]  
Their prudently daring silhouettes dwindled into the valley, where thaw met earth and the future sounded like a clock newly wound. [697]
