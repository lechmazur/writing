It had been three lunar circuits since time became visible, swirling like bronze smoke through the arcades of the baroque asteroid. [21]  
The inhabitants of Aureole Rococo walked carefully, afraid to bruise the delicate eddies that showed yesterday brushing against tomorrow. [40]  
Among them drifted Velen Kaya, a defunct revolutionary whose slogans once rang across ten moons yet now tasted of rust. [60]  
He survived on cataloging relics for the Institute, though his poetically inclined heart kept scribbling lines in the asteroid's plaster dust. [81]  
An archaeological dispute had recently ignited, and its embers glowed in every council chamber like quiet lightning. [98]  
Two factions claimed the right to interpret a single crystal vase shard recovered from the Mirror Grotto at the asteroid's core. [119]  
Scholars from the Metron School insisted it was ornamental debris, proof the vanished builders valued opulence above philosophy. [137]  
Velen opposed them, arguing the fragment was a coded manifesto, a breath still exhaling from the buried hearts of an uprising. [158]  
Winning the debate mattered less for prestige than for possibility; he wanted to reimagine an entire civilization with new, emancipatory contours. [179]  
Yet the council demanded empirical proof, and Velen had nothing but verses and longing. [193]  
That changed when the first chronostorm of the season roared through the ventilation spires, hurling hours and minutes like razor sleet. [214]  
Old caretakers whispered an antique precaution: covering mirrors during storms kept the loose seconds from multiplying reflections into madness. [233]  
To Velen, the practice sounded like a stanza waiting for its rhyme. [245]  
He devised an experiment that night, guided by burnished sorrow and a revolutionary's stubbornness polished by defeat. [262]  
If the shard truly carried the builders' last intent, the storm's visible cascades of time might unlock it. [280]  
He borrowed the Mirror Grotto for a single rotation, promising the Institute a demonstration rather than a speech. [298]  
Assistants draped velvet over every reflective surface, turning the hall into a velvet-lined cavity where nothing shone except the circulating hours. [319]  
The chronostorm hit, and visible time seeped through cracks like molten amber, coiling around Velen's boots. [335]  
He placed the crystal vase shard atop a plinth, its edges catching the swirling seconds the way dry roots drink rain. [356]  
For a breathless beat the shard remained opaque, then script flared inside it, written in tangled ribbons of temporally folded light. [377]  
Mirrored by the eddies, the script projected across the velvet like a choir of ghosts reciting their own eulogies. [396]  
Velen translated aloud, each syllable cracking through his throat like ice under a torch. [410]  
"We failed to free ourselves," the builders had carved, "so we freed the future; let whoever follows shatter and begin anew." [431]  
The declaration undermined the Metron thesis entirely, yet it also pierced Velen with remembered defeats. [446]  
He watched the words drift around him like rusted banners, knowing the ancient rebels had died unfinished, just as his comrades had. [468]  
Still, their unfinished act was instruction, not lament, and the shard glimmered with that stern, bittersweet permission. [485]  
The storm subsided, the visible minutes streaming back into hidden channels, and mirrors were uncovered to reveal ordinary reflections once more. [506]  
Councilors filed in, their shoes crunching on spent seconds like brittle leaves, and they beheld the flowing inscription still pulsing inside the shard. [529]  
Reluctantly, the Metron delegation conceded; the fragment was no bauble but testament, a political scar preserved in crystal for the patient eye. [551]  
Victory should have tasted electric, yet Velen's mouth filled with that same bronze smoke drifting through the corridors of exposed time. [572]  
He realized his real work began only now: to honor the ancient confession by constructing a future that would not need confessions at all. [596]  
In the days that followed, he roamed the baroque asteroid, gathering students, drafting plans, and authoring poems that served as blueprints. [617]  
Each evening he returned to the Mirror Grotto, covering mirrors during storms, not for safety but to listen to the silent comradeship of time. [641]  
From the shard's glow he would devise new verses, and from the verses new engines, until the asteroid itself hummed with postponed revolutions. [664]  
The future, once merely visible, began to feel slightly reachable, though a varnish of burnished sorrow would always border its frame. [685]  
Velen accepted that lustered ache, for it reminded him why the builders shattered a vase instead of their resolve. [704]  
He vowed the next civilization imagined here would break neither. [714]
