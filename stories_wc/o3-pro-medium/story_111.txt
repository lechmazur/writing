When the city still slept, the deserted alchemist Fariel unlocked a rusted grate in the plaza floor. <words>17</words>
Down the ladder waited a secret dog park, mute with dawn mist and rumors of forgotten experiments. <words>34</words>
He once brewed elixirs for kings, yet abandonment had left his genius fermenting like unbottled thunder under skin. <words>52</words>
Today, during brewing of his final draught, he sought something stronger than gold: a reason to keep believing. <words>70</words>
Faith had become a cracked crucible, and the dilemma of faith was whether to patch it or fashion dawn anew. <words>90</words>
Around his neck swayed a golden typewriter ribbon, salvaged from a poet's wrecked machine, shimmering like coiled sunlight. <words>108</words>
It was inkless yet theoretically intuitive, promising to transcribe ideas directly into the nervous hush of reality. <words>125</words>
But the ribbon demanded proof of longing before revealing letters, and longing is hard currency for the despairing. <words>143</words>
Fariel carried a smooth river stone, the size of hope compressed, to pay the toll. <words>158</words>
At the park's center lay a shallow training pond where dogs once learned silent retrieval, now mirroring subway lights. <words>177</words>
He knelt, breathed the bittersweet air of fur and chlorine, and cast the stone upon the glassy surface. <words>195</words>
Through the patterns in the rings of a pond after a stone is thrown, he would savor the universe's hidden syntax. <words>216</words>
Concentric circles flickered like celestial braille, spelling memories the world wanted to forget yet he refused to release. <words>234</words>
They showed his apprentice laughing beneath alembics, the moment before plague guards sealed the laboratory and exiled him. <words>252</words>
Exultant grief rose in his throat, a choir of jubilant ghosts weeping into the vaulted kennel shadows. <words>269</words>
The golden ribbon warmed, absorbing his trembling reflection from the water and unspooling letters no mortal clerk had seen. <words>288</words>
WRITE WHAT YOU WOULD REMAKE, pulsed the script, and each glowing word hovered over the ripples like radiant leashes. <words>307</words>
Fariel answered not with speech but by tipping a vial of his brewing draught into the pond, surrendering its destiny. <words>327</words>
Clouds of emerald vapor rose, and every dog skeleton buried beneath the turf assembled, fur knitting itself from mist and memory. <words>348</words>
They bounded around him, guardians of impossible loyalty, and their joyous howls cracked the crust of his silence. <words>366</words>
Tears diluted the vapor as he bound the ribbon around his wrists, pledging to wrestle a dream from oblivion. <words>385</words>
Faith, he realized, was neither belief nor doubt but the feral act of standing when only echoes offer applause. <words>404</words>
With the resurrected pack pacing beside him, he climbed back toward daylight, carrying grief that sang and hope that burned. <words>424</words>
