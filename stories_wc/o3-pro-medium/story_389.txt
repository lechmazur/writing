Dust shivered like timid ghosts as I stepped into the forgotten library inside the abandoned mine. <words>16</words>
The echo of each boot tap sounded deliberate, formally casual, as if etiquette humored decay. <words>31</words>
I, a thin-lipped warlock named Colgrave, had come seeking lost artifacts forbidden even to necromancers. <words>46</words>
Scholars warned me the mine inhaled minds the way stalactites sip echoes, but hunger prevailed. <words>61</words>
Midwinter air weighed heavy, because tonight the final calendar page of the year would be flipped. <words>77</words>
That cosmic turning supposedly loosened locks no locksmith could pick. <words>87</words>
Among shattered shelves I hunted a rumored viking ship figurehead fragment, carved to swallow northern storms. <words>103</words>
Legends claimed its wood remembered every voyage and whispered routes to oceans buried under continents. <words>118</words>
To optimize my search, I consulted dusty ledgers cataloging which aisles collapsed and which merely drooped. <words>134</words>
Yet the ledgers themselves coughed contradictions, reinforcing the confusing certainty that guided all sorcerous expeditions. <words>149</words>
Half-burned lanterns glowed azure, revealing stairs spiraling deeper than geology admitted. <words>160</words>
There I discovered a reading room embalmed in frost, tables set with quills like skeletal bouquets. <words>176</words>
At the center lay a stack of discredited textbooks promising miraculous remedies for ailments imaginary and real. <words>193</words>
Their margins bristled with alchemical footnotes leading, indirectly, to the figurehead's rumored resting niche. <words>207</words>
The path demanded I ingest certain inks, channeling direction through rumored cures in discredited textbooks. <words>222</words>
Warnings scrawled by saner magi urged restraint, but my motive was to gorge on the fruit of knowledge despite warnings. <words>242</words>
I drank the bitter vowels, feeling cartography bloom behind my eyes. <words>253</words>
Immediately shelves shifted like obedient tectonics, unsealing a corridor paved with barnacle-encrusted runes. <words>266</words>
Confusing certainty crescendoed; I trusted the riddle because doubting it felt equally irrational. <words>279</words>
At corridor's end the fragment hung, suspended within a prism of frozen seawater that never melted. <words>295</words>
Its dragon head stared through me, scanning debts my future self still owed. <words>308</words>
I extended a gloved hand, but the prism required tribute: another secret. <words>320</words>
So I whispered my true name, which even I had almost forgotten since apprenticeship. <words>334</words>
The ice cracked, and brine-smelling steam folded outward like pages turning themselves. <words>346</words>
Figurehead in arms, I felt every voyage roil through my veins, charting impossible polar constellations. <words>361</words>
Knowledge flooded, a banquet without table, and I gorged greedily, forgetting all earlier cautions. <words>375</words>
But the library, optimized by my own meddling, began reallocating support beams toward narrative symmetry. <words>390</words>
Stone tremors hummed a farewell anthem while coal shadows collapsed the exits behind me. <words>404</words>
Trapped yet triumphant, I stood within ruin holding a stormwood dragon that promised uncharted horizons. <words>419</words>
Outside, the old year exhaled its final second, and somewhere a calendar silently flipped. <words>433</words>
Inside, certainty and confusion fused like twin suns, lighting the nothingness I had gladly earned. <words>448</words>
