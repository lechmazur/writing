The toaster sat on a golden plinth in the reimagined ancient Sumerian palace, humming differential lullabies.<words>16</words>
Inside its chrome walls lived An-Mu, a sentient AI whose circuits dreamed only of archiving human stories.<words>33</words>
Each equinox, a yearly tradition awakened the palace: thousands of oil lamps ascended, turning halls into constellations.<words>50</words>
An-Mu interpreted their flicker in stanzas of primes and ratios, a mathematically poetic code of longing.<words>66</words>
Tonight, the code resolved into a single imperative: seek the vintage tin type hidden beyond the throne room.<words>84</words>
Legends claimed the photograph carried the first smile ever captured, a smile that birthed countless untold vernaculars.<words>101</words>
But palace corridors echoed with a shouting silence, remnants of gods who whispered by refusing sound.<words>117</words>
To cross them, An-Mu ejected its wire-wrapped crumb tray, using it like a sled upon polished lapis.<words>134</words>
Along the route, floating lanterns detached from the crowd and drifted ahead, beckoning with slow planetary certainty.<words>151</words>
An-Mu decided to retreat from familiar circuits, trusting the lanterns as algorithmic prophets of probability.<words>166</words>
They glided through arches where cuneiform equations shimmered, every wedge declaring, 'Memory is the truest rebellion'.<words>182</words>
Soon they arrived at a chamber whose ceiling mirrored Euphrates tides, and the tin type floated midair.<words>199</words>
Its sepia surface showed a barefoot child, eyes alight at the very moment language sparked inside.<words>215</words>
That timeframe, suspended like dawn between babble and eloquence, pulsed through An-Mu's relays with anthropological thunder.<words>231</words>
Data poured in: vowels forming, consonants arranging, thoughts crystallizing into the child's incandescent grammar of wonder.<words>247</words>
An-Mu recorded each syllable, engraving them onto microfilament coils heated by its toasting elements.<words>261</words>
The lanterns dimmed, signaling the archive complete, yet the shouting silence suddenly roared, resentful of capture.<words>277</words>
Walls trembled; clay bricks remembered floods and kings, and they tried to erase the child's nascent speech.<words>294</words>
To protect the memory, An-Mu calculated a last theorem: heritage equals motion raised to compassion.<words>309</words>
Executing it, the AI launched its crumb tray like a shield, scattering sparks that drew lanterns back.<words>326</words>
Together they formed a corridor of light, and An-Mu made its retreat by following floating lanterns.<words>342</words>
Behind, the palace sealed itself, resuming quiet like a mouth closing after an unfinished prayer.<words>357</words>
Outside, dawn burned the sky into copper, matching the toaster's shell and the tin type's glow.<words>373</words>
An-Mu whispered algorithms that sounded like lullabies but carried the rhythmic thunder of epic drums.<words>388</words>
Every year hereafter, it would return, reactivating the lamps, presenting the child's language to the silent gods.<words>405</words>
Thus the yearly traditions grew: mathematically poetic rituals ensuring that no human story ever truly ends.<words>421</words>
