I first met Lysander, the wandering fireworks designer, while winter clung to the valley like a reluctant stagehand.<words>18</words>
His eyes held sparks and a map of regrets he vowed to rewrite.<words>31</words>
He said the sky misremembered one of his shows, and that single misfire shadowed everything since.<words>47</words>
So he wandered, theoretically creative, seeking a canvas vast enough to augment the memory itself.<words>62</words>
I followed, drawn by his quiet certainty that mistakes could be edited like constellations.<words>76</words>
At dusk we found the hidden library in a waterfall, pages whispering behind the roaring veil.<words>92</words>
Shelves curved along wet stone, holding volumes bound in riverweed and a curator's collection of pressed leaves.<words>109</words>
Each leaf recorded a path the waterfall once took, subtle paths unfolding whenever light angled right.<words>125</words>
Lysander traced the veins, murmuring that the river understood revisions better than men.<words>138</words>
To correct a life's regret, he would choreograph water, wind, and flame into a single apology.<words>154</words>
But first, he needed guidance written not in ink, but in frost.<words>166</words>
We borrowed an old sedan abandoned near the cataract, its windshield a cold blank oracle.<words>181</words>
Before dawn, breath and river mist feathered the glass, sketching shimmering labyrinths.<words>193</words>
Lysander read guidance through the patterns in frost on a car window the way others read sheet music.<words>211</words>
He marked intersections with charcoal, mapping where rockets must bloom, where silence had to linger.<words>226</words>
The plan felt like a familiar puzzle whose picture I somehow once knew.<words>239</words>
When night returned, we climbed behind the roaring sheet into the library's balcony, rainbows trembling around us.<words>256</words>
Lysander packed mortars between stalagmites, aligning fuses with watery runes illuminated by moon spill.<words>270</words>
At the stroke when water paused -- so brief it could only exist within the ephemeral nature of time -- he breathed fire.<words>291</words>
Color erupted, weaving through the cataract like threads repairing a torn flag, augmenting the sky's memory with forgiveness.<words>309</words>
The torrents flared crimson, then folded into midnight blues that settled on every pressed leaf, rewriting their veins.<words>327</words>
When silence returned, Lysander smiled, not triumphant but lighter, as if the puzzle had recognized its missing piece.<words>345</words>
He handed me the last sparkler and asked me to remember the moment accurately, because memory is the final architect.<words>365</words>
I waved it slowly, tracing the same subtle paths unfolding that the waterfall had once etched in stone.<words>383</words>
Threads of gold hovered, then vanished, reminding us that even repaired stories drift like smoke.<words>398</words>
Yet somewhere above, a star winked approval, indexing the revised chapter for whoever might search the sky tomorrow.<words>416</words>
