In the suspended palace anchored to giant stalactites, Wren Tibbits, a whimsical tinkerer, tightened another humming gear.<words>17</words>
He worked within a fraction of eternity, measured across the moment an artist's brush first meets canvas.<words>34</words>
Time, there, bent like soft wire before a forge.<words>43</words>
Wren's mission was practical illusion: to chronicle environmental changes for archivists who refused dull data.<words>58</words>
So he sculpted living dioramas powered by capricious mechanisms instead of inked graphs.<words>71</words>
Each diorama arrived in distant towns through pop-up carnival fortune-tellers who blinked into being overnight.<words>86</words>
Patrons pulled velvet curtains, expecting deceitful mysticism, but met oddly truthful automatons announcing barometric sagas.<words>101</words>
A brass thermometer, polished to sunset sheen, protruded from every automaton's chest like a candid heart.<words>117</words>
Its mercury rose or fell with the true outside air, refusing the comfortable lies of stage heat.<words>134</words>
Thus the audience encountered weather itself as oracle, confronting mortality not through doom but thermodynamic honesty.<words>150</words>
Yet Wren's palace laboratory grew colder with every truth dispatched.<words>160</words>
Sensors embedded in stalactites reported dwindling geothermal exhalations from the planet's core.<words>172</words>
If the heat died, the crystal anchors would brittle, and the suspended palace would tumble into abyssal mist.<words>190</words>
Wren stared at a fresh slab of kinetic clay, fingers trembling with private awareness of impermanence.<words>206</words>
He decided to sculpt his final diorama before gravity claimed the rafters.<words>218</words>
The piece would portray the exact second a child first understands breath is borrowed.<words>232</words>
To cast that second, Wren harvested vapor from his own sighs, freezing it into filigree pillars.<words>248</words>
He inserted the brass thermometer at the sculpture's heart, sealing its bulb with a hair of his beard.<words>266</words>
The reading would forever reflect his final body temperature once the palace fell.<words>279</words>
He packed the diorama inside a new pop-up booth painted midnight blue and lowered it to the surface by rope balloon.<words>300</words>
Below, villagers gathered, their faces silvered by moonlit frost that yesterday had been autumn drizzle.<words>315</words>
The oddly truthful automaton opened, voice crackling like cloudbreak: "Observe the warm breath turning glass to mirror, for mirrors melt."<words>335</words>
Children leaned in, seeing their foggy reflections dissipate seconds after forming, and shrank back, wide-eyed.<words>350</words>
Somewhere high above, the stalactite seams emitted a mournful crack.<words>360</words>
Wren, hearing it, smiled with relieved certainty and pressed a hidden lever releasing the palace's journals on parachutes.<words>378</words>
Pages fluttered earthward like migrating snow, ensuring the chronicle endured even if he did not.<words>393</words>
Lights dimmed; gears hushed; he seated himself beside the cooling sculpture and watched the thermometer fall.<words>409</words>
Within that single brushstroke of time, Wren confronted mortality, sculpted truth, and accepted the practical illusion of survival through story.<words>429</words>
