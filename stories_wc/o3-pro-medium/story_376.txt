Ember Sigrun, a rogue fortune teller, arrived alone at the reimagined ancient Viking longhouse.<words>14</words>
The timbered hall loomed like memory, torchlight glinting off carved ravens and steel-lipped drinking horns.<words>29</words>
Guests murmured, their breaths weaving through the hush of an overlooked era resurrected tonight.<words>43</words>
Ember's cloak, stitched with modestly flashy beadwork, shimmered but never shouted against the shadowed walls.<words>58</words>
She sought no profit this evening; she sought patterns, emotions caught before they evaporated.<words>72</words>
Archiving emotional patterns had become her clandestine scripture, scribbled where future augurs feared to peer.<words>87</words>
For that scripture, she carried an amber inkwell warm as frozen suns, sealed under braided twine.<words>103</words>
Only blood, tears, and wine ever touched its lip, giving color to feelings otherwise invisible.<words>118</words>
Tonight, the unspoken offer pulsed beneath conversations: share your vintage, receive a glimpse of destiny.<words>133</words>
The nobles believed Ember bartered futures for coin, yet she traded only taste for truth.<words>148</words>
A connoisseur earl approached, goblet swirling ruby strands that zigzagged like storm-tossed runes.<words>161</words>
They clinked their cups, the shared love for wine tasting disguising Ember’s deeper thirst.<words>175</words>
Sipping, she listened to the note of candied smoke he tried to hide behind laughter.<words>190</words>
That note mapped a sorrow of sons dead at sea, rippling beneath his jeweled bravado.<words>205</words>
Quietly, she unstoppered the amber inkwell and dipped a raven-feather quill into his wine.<words>219</words>
The liquid darkened, accepting grief’s hue, and words formed where none had been spoken aloud.<words>234</words>
She wrote: “Your sorrow beats steady; let it guide ships home instead of sinking them.”<words>249</words>
The earl read, eyes watering, yet his spine straightened as though battle horns had sounded.<words>264</words>
He bowed, offered no payment, but Ember felt the pattern safely stored within the ink.<words>279</words>
Patrons noticed, curiosity fermenting, and ambled toward her table like moths courting a silent flame.<words>294</words>
Each brought a cup, a memory, and an unspoken offer to trade vulnerability for vision.<words>309</words>
The hall’s air thickened with oak, berries, sweat, and possibilities, yet Ember sat in fierce repose.<words>325</words>
Her quill danced a zigzag across parchment, looping sorrow beside triumph, jealousy beside devotion.<words>339</words>
Outside, snow drifted, muffling midnight drums, ensuring the archive grew unheard by conquering futures.<words>353</words>
When moonlight finally withdrew, her inkwell glowed like amber dawn, heavy with borrowed heartbeats.<words>367</words>
She corked it, knowing history would misplace this night, yet its emotions would survive inside resin.<words>383</words>
Ember slipped away before sunrise, cloak paling against ash clouds, satisfied by stories preserved without a scream.<words>400</words>
Some future scholar will uncork that fierce repose and taste our forgotten fervor, sip after iridescent sip.<words>417</words>
