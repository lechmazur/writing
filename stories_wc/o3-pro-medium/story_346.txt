The boastful warrior, Jaggon the Lion-Mouthed, swaggered through the chitin corridors of the giant wasp's nest, bragging about victories no one had witnessed. <words>23</words>
His voice ricocheted amid balloon pops, for the queen celebrated some alien holiday with rubber explosions that tremored the waxy walls. <words>44</words>
Yet between each loud report he detected an undercurrent of clarity, a thin thread of sense whispering beneath his own thunderous boasts. <words>66</words>
Guided by that thread, he pressed his ear to resinous passageways and began to rewire his purpose by overhearing unguarded soliloquies of the drones. <words>90</words>
Their murmurs, intimately impersonal, spoke of colored screens projecting heroic illusions to keep intruders docile. <words>105</words>
Realizing he, too, might be caught inside such a fabricated reality, Jaggon felt his swagger falter for the first time. <words>125</words>
He shoved a gauntleted hand into his lint-filled pocket, seeking some talisman of authenticity and finding only grey fuzz that clung like doubt. <words>148</words>
Anger rebloomed, but it was a sharper, cleaner blade, honed by self-suspicion rather than vanity. <words>163</words>
He followed the drone voices toward the brood theater where a honeycombed screen projected his own past deeds in gaudy exaggeration. <words>184</words>
Each cinematic roar of his holographic double was punctuated by another balloon pop, as though applause were synched to celebratory detonations. <words>205</words>
The undercurrent of clarity now surged, revealing the screen as a membrane separating his mind from whatever lay beyond programmed grandeur. <words>226</words>
With a war cry stripped of pretense, he smashed the honeycomb, and shards of wax sprayed like stinging confetti. <words>245</words>
Behind the membrane sprawled a control room of alabaster larvae wired to crystal diodes, their dreams projected outward to placate trespassers. <words>266</words>
Jaggon knelt, feeling the precise madness of the revelation: every boast he'd ever shouted might have been scripted by these pulsing grubs. <words>288</words>
He addressed them, promising quieter stories and real victories, but their blank faces mirrored only the soft glow of manipulated legend. <words>309</words>
Determined to escape the script entirely, he tore wires from their cocoons, severing the circuit that enforced illusion upon intruders and residents alike. <words>332</words>
Balloon pops turned to sputtering gasps as the celebratory organs lost power, and the corridors dimmed to a truthful dusk. <words>352</words>
Outside, unseen but sensed, a wider cosmos beckoned like a quiet arena where deeds carved their own echoes without larvae editors. <words>373</words>
Jaggon dropped the lint from his pocket onto the cracked projector, a humble offering to entropy, and stepped toward the exit tunnel. <words>395</words>
The undercurrent of clarity rose to a roaring river, carrying his thoughts beyond boast, beyond nest, toward a life un-narrated. <words>415</words>
As his silhouette shrank into the bruised horizon, the nest echoed with silence, a monument to a warrior finally boasting nothing at all. <words>438</words>
