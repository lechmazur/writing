Lightning severed the last electric vein feeding the mountaintop retreat, hushing the generators into uneasy sleep. <words>16</words>
In the sudden dark, a weathered poet named Arlen felt the familiar mixtape of joyful dread begin. <words>33</words>
Power outages were his secret metronome, forcing pauses so he could hear verses rustle like bats. <words>49</words>
Outside, the blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests glimmered under storm flashes, miniature canopies casting knotty shadows across winding gravel. <words>68</words>
Arlen’s purpose tonight was not poetry alone but to map sacred flows whispered of by hermit cartographers. <words>85</words>
They claimed the mountain breathed through the bonsai roots, sketching invisible rivers of intention across the stone. <words>102</words>
To locate those currents, Arlen carried an unmarked makeup compact that once belonged to his theatre-loving mother. <words>119</words>
When opened, the mirror reflected only what the holder needed to inhale, an enigmatic invitation to breathe. <words>136</words>
Arlen flipped the compact, saw nothing but swirling mist, and exhaled until the glass cleared to directions. <words>153</words>
Yet he still needed coordinates, and tradition said they could be grasped by reading confessions on coffee cup sleeves. <words>172</words>
So he descended to the ideally messy lounge where guests abandoned mugs like half-written diaries beside flickering candles. <words>190</words>
He lifted one earthen cup, its cardboard sleeve inked with smudged pen: 'I fear sprouts more than storms.' <words>208</words>
Grasp the sprout, the compact whispered inside his mind, and the bonsai gate will acknowledge you. <words>224</words>
He pocketed the sleeve like parchment and hurried back outside, where the storm had quieted into rain freckles. <words>242</words>
The labyrinth entrance, once ordinary, now held a single bonsai whose newest leaf gleamed phosphorescent green. <words>258</words>
Arlen knelt, grasped the tiny leaf between finger and thumbnail, and felt a subtle pulse push back. <words>275</words>
The labyrinth reshuffled, branches bowing aside to open a corridor scented with petrichor and iron memories. <words>291</words>
Breathing deeply, Arlen followed, each step scribbling stanzas across soaked soil, each inhale syncing with hidden waterways. <words>308</words>
He realized the map would not be drawn on paper but on his lungs, expanding and contracting along the trail. <words>328</words>
With every breath guided by the compact’s mirror, sacred flows glowed faintly, traces of turquoise weaving through darkness. <words>346</words>
Some currents rose like joyous song, others coiled with dread, yet together they composed the mountain’s trembling symphony. <words>364</words>
At the labyrinth’s heart stood a stone basin, empty save for reflected lightning twisting in its surface. <words>381</words>
Arlen opened the compact above the basin, allowing the mirror to catch rain and moonless sky together. <words>398</words>
Mist rose, spun into letters that matched the coffee sleeve’s confession, then redrew themselves into flowing topography. <words>415</words>
He traced the luminous map on the water with trembling finger, memorizing pathways toward unknown springs of language. <words>433</words>
When the power finally surged back, neon hallway lights banished the forest’s glow, and the map vanished. <words>450</words>
But Arlen’s lungs still carried the sacred flows, and each future poem would unfold their living cartography. <words>467</words>
