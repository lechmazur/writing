<story>
Before the universe begins, fog already clings to the nameless primordial swamp. <words>12</words>
In its heart stands a fortress of plank and shale, afloat like stubborn bark. <words>26</words>
The only approach is by gondola that slithers between sour lily channels. <words>38</words>
No kings yet exist, yet rumors of authority ripple like proto-stars across black water. <words>52</words>
Here resides an incognito aristocrat named Callix, exiled before title could snare him. <words>65</words>
His bearing is refined, yet his spirit, strangely honest, rejects unborn empires. <words>77</words>
Callix has vowed to chronicle every whispered village story sprouting on the swampy rim. <words>91</words>
He believes narratives can challenge whatever power eventually tries to name the stars. <words>104</words>
Yet he refuses courts, scribes, or gilded parchment lest they betray the teller. <words>117</words>
Instead, he writes on oak shingles, winds them around a rustic yarn swift, then corks the contraption into vintage wine bottles scavenged from future ruins he imagines. <words>144</words>
These bottled reels drift along the canals, carried by moonless tides toward listening settlements. <words>158</words>
Each message urges villages to remember themselves before officials arrive to rename their mud. <words>172</words>
The tone is humble defiance, suggesting anthem, refusing anthem, inviting only stubborn memory. <words>185</words>
Soon the bottles return, buoyed by grateful hands, brimming with myths of reed-weavers and fireflies. <words>200</words>
Callix catalogs them on the fortress walls, a mural of words glowing in torch-sap. <words>214</words>
Daybreak, if such exists before time, paints the script with unripened photons. <words>226</words>
From distant marshes, proto-officials emerge, armored in potential laws, seeking to subjugate emerging hamlets. <words>240</words>
They row iron skiffs, scarring algae, muttering charters none can yet comprehend. <words>252</words>
A bottle strikes the prow, shattering, releasing the smell of impossible Cabernet futures. <words>265</words>
Ribbons of oak-inked yarn unfurl, spelling village songs that speak of belonging, not possession. <words>279</words>
The marsh echoes with uncomposed choirs, and the officials feel absurdly temporary. <words>291</words>
One asks, strangely honest, whether conquest can survive a story everyone already knows. <words>304</words>
Another gazes at the fortress and hears his childhood gulfing inside the walls. <words>317</words>
They retreat, leaving only ripples and a question nagging the unborn bureaucracy. <words>329</words>
From his balcony, Callix watches without triumph, merely noting the tale's newest turning. <words>342</words>
He dips quill in swamp-oil and writes, 'Authority postponed by bottle, not blood.' <words>355</words>
Then he spins the rustic yarn swift again, its wooden arms creaking like galaxies rehearsing. <words>370</words>
Another shingle wraps around its spindle, absorbing the wet ink without complaint. <words>382</words>
He slides the record into a wine bottle already tasting of centuries that never happened. <words>397</words>
Before sealing, he whispers a promise that stories will outpace the birth of rulers. <words>411</words>
The gondola departs, bearing the promise, and darkness listens like an expectant audience. <words>424</words>
Somewhere beyond time's horizon, a young cosmos will awaken already resistant to chains. <words>437</words>
