The ferry left me at dusk below the lighthouse that locals called the Throat. [14]
Wind scraped the rocky island like a file on bone. [24]
I climbed the iron stairs thinking of the note that summoned me. [36]
It had arrived folded inside a fortune cookie, warm from delivery. [47]
The fortune read, 'After last orders, follow the beam and bring an open secret.' [61]
Only one person I knew wrote fortunes that elliptical. [70]
Jun Lao, the cryptic fortune cookie writer, once kept my cover alive in Chengdu. [84]
His fortunes were accidentally prophetic, unveiling tomorrow while pretending to tease today. [96]
Now he promised another revelation. [101]
The lighthouse door yawned, unlocked, as though it had been expecting me. [113]
Inside, lanterns glowed with a sourceless blue like moonlight wrung through glass. [125]
Jun waited at a circular desk where the keeper's log once lay. [137]
He was smaller than I remembered, but his grin still divided mysteries neatly. [150]
'I hoped the tide would deliver you,' he said, voice breaking like surf. [163]
I laid the envelope on the desk without sitting. [172]
Inside were the spycraft microdot film specs we stole in Vienna. [183]
Blown up, they could teach any country to hide libraries on a pinhead. [196]
Jun did not open the envelope; he simply rolled it between his fingers like a reed. [212]
'An open secret at last,' he whispered, 'waiting only for a listener.' [224]
I frowned; the phrase sounded like another fortune awaiting a cookie. [235]
Jun gestured toward the spiral stair that rose through the tower throat. [247]
'We must orchestrate the beam differently tonight,' he said, 'by directing flow rather than light.' [262]
I followed, feeling the sea breathing against stone outside the narrow windows. [274]
At the lantern room, the lens assembly had been dismantled, pieces arranged like a sundial. [289]
Charts, wires, and teak rulers formed channels leading toward the central bulb. [301]
Jun explained that light would travel these corridors, fracture, and scatter messages across the horizon. [316]
He called it semaphore for the blind, music for those who felt photons. [329]
I realized he meant to leak the microdot specs in plain sight. [341]
Anyone with a spectrograph and sky could read them, yet no one would suspect. [355]
It was the purest expression of open secrets I had ever met. [367]
'Why share what nations killed to own?' I asked. [376]
Jun placed his palm on the warm bulb as though tuning a piano. [389]
'Because I want to transpose life into a new key,' he murmured. [401]
The phrase hummed through the glass rafters, resonant, ridiculous, utterly sincere. [412]
He had always ghostwrote destinies inside pastry; tonight he would write upon the night itself. [427]
Together we adjusted mirrors, each tilt a syllable in the silent broadcast. [439]
My training returned, slotting angles the way agents once deployed brush passes. [451]
Hours flowed like mercury until Jun declared the composition ready. [461]
Outside, the tavern on the mainland would be calling last orders right now. [474]
We arrived precisely after last orders, just as his fortune had promised. [486]
Jun flipped the master switch, and the bulb condensed into a white star. [499]
Light rivered along the teak courses, split, recombined, and finally spilled through the open windows. [514]
Beams danced across clouds, spelling blueprints native only to mathematics and wonder. [526]
Somewhere, satellites and hobbyists would record the patterns, certain they witnessed aurora. [538]
Tomorrow, magazines would print photographs, and the open secrets would lie on every breakfast table. [553]
As the machine thrummed, I felt something unexpected loosening inside my chest. [565]
Years of hoarding classified truths had constricted my breathing; now each exhale tasted larger. [579]
'You see,' Jun said, watching the sky perform, 'secrets are only cages we pretend are keys.' [595]
I laughed, the sound foreign yet welcome in the hollow chamber. [606]
The lighthouse answered with echoes like coins dropped into a deep fountain. [618]
Jun produced a final fortune slip, unbaked yet, and handed it to me. [631]
It said, 'When the tide returns, carry nothing heavier than memory.' [642]
The sentence felt accidentally prophetic too, but perhaps only because my pockets were emptier now. [657]
I folded the slip and placed it where my passport once hid. [669]
Below, waves broke, recovering shards of starlight like beachcombers of the cosmic. [681]
Jun began to hum an old Sichuan lullaby, guiding the light's tempo the way a conductor breathes. [698]
That was how he orchestrated worlds, not by command, but by directing flow. [711]
Listening, I realized the beam was no longer a signal; it was a key change. [726]
It raised the night half a tone, sharp enough to promise, soft enough to forgive. [741]
Somewhere below, my former life drifted out with the tide, classified, declassified, untethered. [754]
And inside the tower of familiar enigma, I breathed the key of tomorrow. [767]
