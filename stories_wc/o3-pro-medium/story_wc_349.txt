Fog the color of forgotten pages curled around the glass orchard library floating upon a swirling sea of clouds. [19]  
Its transparent trees bore crystalline volumes, every leaf a thin pane of text. [32]  
It was during the lull on a store's very first opening day. [44]  
In the foyer, a clean slate vendor unfolded a collapsible counter of unmarked tablets. [58]  
His name was Kes Abacus, and he specialized in beginnings yet unscripted. [70]  
Travelers bought slates to erode past errors, and they paid with memories. [82]  
Sales were modest, but Kes had not come merely to profit; he had come to find the place where stories begin. [103]  
Rumor claimed such a locus lay somewhere among these branches of glass and metaphor. [117]  
Kes's plan was mindfully scattered, like a constellation sketched from broken lanterns. [129]  
He trusted fragments to align once placed under sufficient wonder. [139]  
Inside his coat pocket he carried bottled moonlight, the sole inheritance from his vanished mentor, Archivist Selene. [156]  
The bottle's cork pulsed, desiring release, but Kes saved its glow for the right inscription. [171]  
First he needed permission to explore the restricted canopy shelves where drafts of reality were rumored to nest. [189]  
That permission arrived in the form of glimmering parole, a temporary freedom granted by the library's wardens to seekers of narrative truth. [211]  
The parchment of parole shimmered with shifting punctuation, stipulating that Kes could wander until the moon's third sigh. [229]  
He ascended ladders of braided prism, each rung chiming like a turning page. [242]  
Above, sap-glass apples dangled, filled with alphabets still ripening. [251]  
Kes selected one translucent fruit and incised a narrow groove around its equator with a crystal stylus. [268]  
The act was surgical, performed by quantifying absence; he measured what meaning the apple lacked, and cut proportionally. [286]  
The fruit opened without shattering, revealing a hollow core where letters yearned to congregate. [300]  
Kes uncorked the bottled moonlight, pouring a silver stream into the cavity. [312]  
The letters awakened, swimming through luminescence like minnows composing a hymn. [323]  
As syllables coalesced, the apple spoke a coordinate whispered in polysyllabic wind. [335]  
Kes memorized it, sensing the first tug of origin stories under his ribs. [348]  
Yet the parole scroll glinted a warning, for time unspooled faster inside inspiration's canopy. [362]  
He hurried along glass boughs, following further coordinates whispered by other moonlit fruits. [375]  
Each path branched into palimpsest fog, integrated fragmentation guiding his decisions, shards merging mid-stride. [389]  
Finally he reached the nucleus of the orchard, an atrium where no shelves stood. [403]  
The space felt impossibly full of emptiness, a silence that described itself in perfect grammar. [418]  
Here, beginnings waited unclaimed, pure motifs hovering like dew. [427]  
Kes realized he had arrived at the storied coordinate, the unuttered syllable preceding every tale. [442]  
He set a clean slate on the floor and listened to its blankness humming. [456]  
The slate, thirsting, absorbed the ambient hush, turning velvet grey. [466]  
Kes knew he must inscribe a single stroke to seed the orchard with new narration. [481]  
But what stroke could honor every vanished customer who had traded memories for hope? [495]  
He thought of Selene, of moonlight encapsulated to light another's search. [506]  
The answer, he realized, lay not in addition but in subtraction. [517]  
He raised the stylus, measuring the clean slate's emptiness like a surveyor of void. [531]  
Then he chose to incise no mark, allowing the air to etch itself. [544]  
Absence, quantified, became the first letter, and possibility flooded the slate like dawn. [557]  
The apple coordinates vanished, for the story had now begun within him. [569]  
He sensed patrons below beginning to stir, the lull concluding. [579]  
With careful footing he descended, carrying the untouched slate that weighed like a newborn horizon. [594]  
The wardens inspected his hands and found no contraband, yet their eyes widened at the radiance of mere vacancy. [613]  
Glimmering parole expired with a soft chime, resealing the higher canopy until another seeker dared the ladders. [630]  
Kes closed his stand, for opening day would end soon, but the slate on the counter shimmered like a promise. [650]  
Customers lining up again saw their reflections in it and forgot their rehearsed regrets. [664]  
Kes smiled; he no longer needed to sell the slate, only to guard its emptiness. [679]  
Somewhere overhead, the bottled moonlight he had spent recondensed inside a new fruit, proof that origins recycle. [696]  
And far below the cloud sea, a lonely reader felt an unexplained urge to open a fresh page. [714]  
Thus the place where stories begin remained unmapped yet universally adjacent, awaiting anyone brave enough to leave something blank. [733]  
Kes whispered thanks to integrated fragmentation, the invisible craft stitching shards into coherent dawn. [747]  
He unlocked the store's front door one last time, yet he stepped outside unchanged, a vendor with a slate as clean as tomorrow. [770]  
Some journeys, he decided, earn their compass by quantifying absence and letting silence speak. [784]
