I never expected my second life, following a forgettable stint as a pet-store goldfish, to involve supervising aquariums in a forgotten recipe library.<words>23</words>
But the library board paid in sardine cigars and sarcasm, so I accepted with tentatively fierce enthusiasm, determined to keep bored cookbooks company.<words>46</words>
Every shelf smelled of nutmeg remorse, and faint whispers begged for cinnamon that no patron remembered, which suited my taste for tasteful oblivion.<words>69</words>
One rainy Tuesday, the weather performed a vaudeville act, switching from drizzle to blizzard in a single sigh, herding a solitary visitor through the creaking doors.<words>95</words>
She clutched a toy soldier with a missing arm, as though the plastic amputee were her attorney in some unscheduled culinary trial.<words>117</words>
Wind spat hailstones against stained-glass windows, and the soldier's hollow eyes seemed to tap a Morse code of guilt’s haunting echo across the tiled floor.<words>142</words>
I asked whether she sought recipes or redemption, brandishing a water-testing strip like a quill to sign whichever option she preferred.<words>163</words>
She replied that doctors had not yet charted her son's prognosis, and she had promised him soup capable of persuading time to apologize.<words>186</words>
The turning point, she feared, would arrive the moment ink met clipboard, so she needed magic before the chart confirmed despair.<words>207</words>
Tradition dictated she simmer marrow and obligation, but tradition had stagnated like yesterday’s aquarium water, and my scales—figurative now—itched to disrupt it.<words>229</words>
I offered a swap: she would donate the maimed toy soldier to my shelf of improbable mascots, and I would unveil a forgotten broth to alleviate her worry.<words>257</words>
Tentatively fierce, she agreed, though her eyebrows performed skeptical push-ups.<words>267</words>
We tiptoed between alphabetized casseroles until I opened a narrow drawer labeled 'Thunder Velouté,' its parchment rattling like a storm rehearsal.<words>288</words>
Outside, lightning approved our choice, slamming brightness through dust as if signing the permission slip.<words>303</words>
The recipe demanded fish memories, saffron sighs, and precisely one confession, elements I possessed in droves thanks to my aquatic prequel.<words>324</words>
Stirring the pot, I recounted how I once forgot to warn my previous owner about the cat, letting guilt’s haunting echo follow me into this life.<words>350</words>
The steam thickened, absorbing the confession like miso absorbing loneliness, and the library’s cookbooks fluttered their pages in applause.<words>369</words>
When she tasted the broth, her shoulders unclenched, and even the toy soldier—now perched beside battered encyclopedias—seemed to salute with its remaining arm.<words>392</words>
Thunder dwindled to polite drizzle, signaling that weather and worry had both been persuaded to stand down for at least the afternoon.<words>414</words>
She hurried toward the hospital, carrying the recipe and a grin sharp enough to slice prognosis, while I resumed my watch, aquarium lights glinting like cheap halos.<words>441</words>
If the doctor’s chart later dared to declare defeat, I trusted her spoon—and our small mutiny against stagnation—to scribble a brighter margin.<words>463</words>
