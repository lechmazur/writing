<story>
The ash-grey dawn stretched over the ethereal plains, where Rowan the apocalyptic farmer knelt among rows of experimental seedlings sprouting like stubborn sparks. <words>23</words>
He had been breeding new seeds since the last resource war burned the old world barren, praying they would inherit stronger spines than the fallen fields. <words>49</words>
Yet every night his dreams were fenced by the same coercive voice of the regional marshal who claimed ownership over every harvest. <words>71</words>
Rowan sought raw solace in silence, but solace proved typically atypical here, arriving instead as clamor from the tideless sea bordering the plains. <words>94</words>
Each fortnight, green-glass bottles bobbed ashore, their corks whittled into arrows that pointed inland, containing letters written in graceful graphite jabber. <words>115</words>
The anonymous author claimed to travel with the currents, sending counsel through the messages in a bottle carried by the sea to anyone still listening. <words>140</words>
Rowan answered by planting bottles like blue bulbs among his seedlings, filling them with soil and secrets before wading out to return them to the waves. <words>166</words>
One dawn a bottle cracked against a rock, spilling not a letter but a magician's deck of trick cards, the joker face winking with salt-encrusted irony. <words>192</words>
Tucked beneath the joker lay a line of music notation titled The Song of Boundaries, and Rowan felt the ink hum like wind over wire. <words>217</words>
He shuffled the cards, and every flourish released a note from that unseen composition, sketching shimmering perimeters around the farm, as though sound itself built fences. <words>243</words>
Within the audible walls, seedlings straightened, their leaves bristling with a courage Rowan recognized as his own longing to escape a life dictated by another. <words>268</words>
The marshal arrived that evening, boots crunching on glassy sand, demanding tithe; but the song rose, and the trick cards spiraled like startled gulls across the twilight. <words>295</words>
Every note etched a shifting border the marshal could not cross, his orders dissolving into stutters as though his throat suddenly spoke only brittle sand. <words>320</words>
Infuriated, he raised his rifle, but Rowan flipped the joker, and the barrel drooped into a harmless tin flute that squeaked when the wind passed. <words>345</words>
The marshal fled, chased by his own comically piping weapon, leaving the farmer alone with a sky grown suddenly wider than conquest. <words>367</words>
Night fell purple, and Rowan planted the deck at the four corners of his fields, the cards rooting like paper blossoms that pulsed rhythmically with protective song. <words>394</words>
He then wrote a final letter for the sea, thanking the wandering composer for teaching him that boundaries might also grant freedom when sung by honest soil. <words>421</words>
As the bottle drifted away beneath moonlit fog, the seedlings joined the refrain, and the plains hushed, holding a raw solace that no marshal could plow under again. <words>449</words>
