Dust silvered the domes of Ithaca Crater, where the ambivalent prophet Jeru recited forecasts in a voice of bashful arrogance.<words>20</words>
Miners emerging from night shift listened, half believing, half mocking, wholly dependent on the oxygen gauges Jeru predicted would fail.<words>40</words>
Jeru was happily sad, burdened by futures only he heard beating between heartbeats yet thrilled to be necessary.<words>58</words>
In his quarters, a cracked collection of marbles orbited a rusted tin saucer like translucent moons mirroring the colony outside.<words>78</words>
Each fracture refracted pale reflections, and Jeru called the swirling lights his private cosmic scoreboard.<words>93</words>
Tonight he intended to scramble it.<words>99</words>
The chance arrived when Manager Nyx demanded the final oath that every forecaster swear during eclipse season.<words>116</words>
Refusal meant exile to the vacuum; compliance meant surrendering his last unsaid prophecy.<words>129</words>
Jeru stalled, claiming he must first defragment the data shards cluttering his mind.<words>142</words>
Nyx granted one shift, scoffing that prophets were just malfunctioning algorithms in skin.<words>155</words>
Jeru hurried to the salvage quarter, rummaging through a sale box where jigsaw puzzle edges glittered like bone.<words>173</words>
He bought the jagged frame for a song of silent meteors.<words>184</words>
Back in his dome, he fit the puzzle edges around the marbles, locking orbit into labyrinth.<words>200</words>
With every click, a heartbeat paused, and possibilities rewrote themselves in the fissures of glass.<words>215</words>
Timelines that doomed the gauges fizzled; ones that spared the miners flickered alive; Jeru's scoreboard blurred.<words>231</words>
But scrambling order had a cost, and the marbles cracked further, bleeding lunar regolith dust across his desk.<words>249</words>
The dust formed letters spelling the final oath he had evaded: 'Speak, or silence speaks you.'<words>265</words>
Feeling the happily sad tug of duty and rebellion, Jeru strode to the central hall during the eclipsed dawn.<words>284</words>
Miners, administrators, and robots gathered, shadows layered in red starlight.<words>294</words>
Jeru announced that his defragmentation was complete and that he would now deliver the oath, line by shattered line.<words>313</words>
First he swore the gauges would hold, gifting the colony breath; applause erupted.<words>326</words>
Then he swore the marbles would shatter entirely, ensuring no prophet could ever again see the scoreboard he had just rewritten.<words>347</words>
Finally he swore himself forgotten between heartbeats, a void where prediction once stood, and silence rippled outward.<words>364</words>
The marbles dissolved, the puzzle frame collapsed, and Jeru felt bashful arrogance warm his cheeks as destiny rebooted.<words>382</words>
Outside, oxygen alarms slept quiet, moons rose whole, and the miners cheered, unaware that the cosmic scoreboard had been gloriously scrambled.<words>403</words>
