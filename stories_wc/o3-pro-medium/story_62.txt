After the final goodbye, Lyle crawled out of his sewer and sniffed the night blossoms of the orchard amphitheater. <words>19</words>
Branches arched into natural pews, their twigs weaving backs and armrests for an audience that had not yet arrived. <words>38</words>
He carried a punctured plastic cup, dribbling rancid sewer water that mapped trembling constellations on the mossy stage. <words>56</words>
Though he called himself a philosopher, Lyle was rarely honest about anything except his own dishonesty. <words>72</words>
That paradox, he believed, kept listeners alert enough to spot the seams of reality he hoped to unthread. <words>90</words>
Tonight his motivation sharpened, for the world had ended politely during the funeral the villagers called their farewell. <words>108</words>
No trumpets, no fire, just a collective decision to stop pretending that mornings mattered. <words>122</words>
After that hush, rewriting the code of existence sounded like reasonable evening entertainment. <words>135</words>
He knelt center stage, placed the cup before him like a battered chalice, and addressed the absent orchard ranks. <words>154</words>
His voice was humble, yet each syllable slithered with candid deceit, promising only what he would immediately contradict. <words>172</words>
He began one of his chilling bedtime stories, the kind that tucked nightmares under pillows and called them lullabies. <words>191</words>
Tonight's tale explored the mundane miracle of breathing, suggesting that every exhale was actually a quit command in cosmic software. <words>211</words>
If enough sleepers synchronized a sigh, he said, reality would exit to the main menu and await patch notes. <words>230</words>
Beneath the gnarled canopy, wind creaked like skeptical applause, but Lyle pretended it confirmed his theorem. <words>246</words>
To demonstrate, he lifted the punctured cup and blew through one of its ragged holes, releasing a wheezing hush. <words>265</words>
The drops that escaped became tiny mirrors, capturing fragmented stars that nobody wanted anymore. <words>279</words>
Observing their shimmer, he confessed--half truth, half bait--that he once loved a sky he had never seen. <words>296</words>
Because light seldom reaches the sewer, he imagined constellations from the patterns of floating trash, learning humility amid filth. <words>315</words>
That humility, he lied, qualified him to supervise creation's reboot. <words>325</words>
He invited any lingering souls to crawl from their graves and sit among the branches, because attendance, like destiny, was optional. <words>346</words>
Silence remained, but the cup began to leak upward, its droplets reversing gravity exactly as his story predicted. <words>364</words>
The orchard seats rustled, leaves flipping like pages of code being overwritten one character at a time. <words>381</words>
Lyle sensed the algorithmic fibers loosen and declared the pilot episode of the new universe officially in development. <words>399</words>
Yet even now, he feared someone might ask for documentation he had never bothered to draft. <words>415</words>
So he offered the only proof he owned: another clever lie about ordinary breath turning into dawn. <words>432</words>
The branches sighed with him, and somewhere underfoot the sewer murmured, ready to flood the stage with unvarnished truth. <words>451</words>
