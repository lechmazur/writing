The last shards of twilight curved around the collapsed horizon while Ikram stepped onto the ambered observatory deck. [18]  
He inhaled the thin air that smelled of burnt helium, quietly enthusiastic despite the stellar doubt murmuring through every frequency of his bones. [41]  
Somewhere behind him, the dome gears clicked like brittle crickets, reminding him that time, after the universe contracts, is all edges and no middle. [65]  
Ikram had been appointed Recorder of Silence because he was the camp's only cast lots decision maker, deft at lottery judgments when minds conflicted. [89]  
Tonight his duty expanded far beyond ration disputes; he had to decide whether the remnant colony would follow the backwards prophecy etched in errant photons. [114]  
The prophecy, impossible yet magnetic, claimed that answers preceded questions, that futures could distill from echoes if one listened past normal causality. [136]  
Ikram spread his collection of foreign coins across the brass-tarnished table, each disc salvaged from dead civilizations and stamped with extinct constellations. [158]  
Though worthless as currency, the coins were superb for casting lots, their varied densities singing different notes when they struck the hollow metal bowl. [182]  
Each note corresponded to a glyph in the camp's codex, a language the survivors pieced together by understanding static bursts from pre-collapse satellites. [205]  
Ikram believed that if he could align those notes with the deck's tremors, he might discover why he truly existed at this ragged terminus. [229]  
After all, everyone left alive sought the same thing: to wavelength align with purpose before the final darkness completed its slow rewind. [251]  
From the deck's outer railings, stretched nebulae appeared as bruised glass, colors crawling backward into white, as if embarrassed to have once been vivid. [275]  
Ikram touched the first coin, a square pewter piece from ancient Cydonia, and felt a faint vibration spiraling up his arm. [296]  
The bowl resonated with micro-thunder, and the speakers embedded in the deck whispered coordinate numbers that faded the moment he tried to memorize them. [320]  
He cast the rest of the coins, letting cold mathematics and trembling intuition entangle, until a chord impossible for one throat alone floated upward. [344]  
The chord mapped itself onto the backward axis of the prophecy, reading not what would happen, but what had already regretted happening. [366]  
It spoke of a sentinel melody somewhere beyond the collapsed horizon, a tune capable of resetting entropy if sung by voices unsynced from cause. [390]  
Ikram's heart wavered; he feared misleading the colony into annihilation, yet the prophecy's pull felt like gravity’s last remaining cousin. [410]  
He remembered how, as a child, he mistook silence for punishment until he learned to count the photons between radio hisses. [431]  
That practice, that understanding of static bursts, had carried him into leadership when eloquence and brute strength had both failed. [451]  
So he steadied himself, picked one shimmering coin at random, and let it spin on the deck until it stood upright against logic. [474]  
The camp watched from the shadows, breaths held like brittle lanterns, their lives balanced on a metal disk no larger than a fingertip. [497]  
When the coin finally toppled, its fall rang through the bowl in five sharp pulses that matched the colony's recorded birth cries. [519]  
The codex translated the pulses into a single clause: Go where echoes begin, not where they end. [536]  
Ikram almost laughed at the simplicity, but the starlight dimmed another shade, reminding him that simplicity after contraction was rarer than hope. [558]  
He announced the decision: they would depart at shift-turn, guiding the caravans toward the sourceward horizon where causality recoiled first. [578]  
Some cheered, others wept, yet all accepted, for the lot had been cast, and no surviving myth challenged that ancient fairness. [599]  
Before dismantling the telescopes, Ikram stood alone, palms on the cool railing, trying to distill his swirling fear into navigable resolve. [620]  
He whispered to the bruised sky that he would keep listening, even if the answers arrived before he screwed up the courage to ask. [644]  
Somewhere beyond perception, perhaps in the next contraction loop, the universe might overhear and smile backward, grateful that one doubtful heart still tuned itself to purpose. [670]
