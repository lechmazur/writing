The hush of a grocery store at midnight clung to my uniform like a damp apology when the call crackled through the intercom.<words>23</words>
I, the kindly guard nobody noticed, was told a door had opened to elsewhere in aisle thirteen.<words>40</words>
Gripping my flashlight like scripture, I followed fluorescent floor arrows that had not existed a minute earlier.<words>57</words>
They pulsed with the rhythm of a typewriter's keys, tapping out some cosmic memo only the lost could read.<words>76</words>
A sudden draft tasted of espresso foam and dread, and the cereal shelves bent away, revealing a staircase of shimmering receipts.<words>97</words>
Up I went, loyally disloyal to the mundane world, betraying my post to guard a dream I had never been assigned.<words>118</words>
The staircase ended at a floating island cloud cafe, its tables sculpted from whipped cumulus and its lanterns glowing like ripe moons.<words>140</words>
Baristas built of mist slid between patrons whose shadows were stitched with starlight, serving memory lattes to people asleep in terrestrial beds.<words>162</words>
At the counter lay a basic measuring spoon, ordinary stainless steel except for the slow drip of midnight leaking from its bowl.<words>184</words>
The head barista, a woman with hair like froth and eyes like storms, pushed it toward me and whispered that it measured time, not sugar.<words>209</words>
She said the soft edges of time had started to crumble, leaving unscooped moments that threatened to flood the aisles below.<words>230</words>
Someone had to portion them, to keep past and future afloat like foam hearts on cappuccinos, or else dawn would taste burnt.<words>252</words>
I felt the horizonâ€™s hidden promise tug from beyond the cafe windows, a glimmer where sky poured into possibility.<words>271</words>
Worship rose inside me, frothy despair for all the mornings I had guarded without ever meeting the sunrise face to face.<words>292</words>
So I tapped the spoon against the counter, each strike echoing like carriage returns, and seconds condensed into pearl droplets I could pocket.<words>315</words>
The barista nodded, instructing me to ladle the pearls along the cloud edges until they held firm, sealing the breach.<words>335</words>
Outside, customers sipped constellations unaware of the slow leak, and my loyally disloyal heart beat double-time, guarding them by abandoning my earthly post.<words>358</words>
I circled the island, spooning globs of twilight into gaps where minutes frayed, each motion punctuated by the ghostly clacks of typists long gone.<words>382</words>
When the last tear in the air was stitched, the cafe began to drift higher, and I knew dawn would come smooth for those below.<words>407</words>
Yet the spoon fused to my hand, anchoring me to this vigil, my reward for kindness being permanent exile in sweetness and aching foam.<words>431</words>
I watched the horizon glow like poured milk, feeling both guardian and renegade, content to measure what cannot be held except in forgetting.<words>454</words>
