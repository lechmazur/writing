Moonlight floated like chilled breath over the giant mushroom meeting hall, illuminating spongy domes in subdued silver. <words>17</words>
Inside, a dry-tongued bard named Elian leaned against a speckled stalk, savoring the crisp languor of silence. <words>34</words>
Sleepers elsewhere dreamed, but this hall breathed differently, resting in the hush of a dreamless night. <words>50</words>
Elian fingered a stained glass prism he had lifted from a cathedral whose stories had shattered long ago. <words>68</words>
Its fractured colors scattered across mushroom gills, scripting impossible maps that promised exits from places without walls. <words>85</words>
Yet every pattern dissolved whenever he reached for meaning, wrapping him anew in the cloak of doubt. <words>102</words>
He muttered gorgeously awkward melodies about freedom, each note half-whisper, half-scoff, like wine spilt on gravel. <words>118</words>
The hall listened, droplets of echo clinging beneath fungal caps as though unwilling to drip away. <words>134</words>
Elian's true audience, however, hid in his pocket: a crystal recorder filled with forgotten voicemails from past tavern gigs. <words>153</words>
Every recording preserved a jeer, a cheer, or an accusation, voices that insisted he would never escape himself. <words>171</words>
He replayed them, letting the chorus crawl over him like ants tasting sugar, sweet yet unrelenting. <words>187</words>
Tonight he resolved to preserve only a single new message: a path outward, spoken to his future absence. <words>205</words>
Drawing breath, he raised the stained glass prism to the recorder's tiny mouth, as though light could dictate words. <words>224</words>
Rainbow shards poured through the device, and static bloomed like distant applause before settling into expectant quiet. <words>241</words>
With voice pared to bone, he spoke: 'Traveler, hear this when fear tightens; the prison of the self has exits.' <words>261</words>
'Find the door where your shadow forgets your name, and walk out humming the tune no one taught you.' <words>280</words>
The recorder clicked, sealing the message like amber around a restless insect. <words>292</words>
Elian exhaled, and the mushroom hall mirrored him, spores drifting upward like reversed snow. <words>306</words>
For the first time all season, the cloak of doubt loosened, sliding from his shoulders to puddle at his boots. <words>326</words>
He stepped beyond it, feeling gorgeously awkward, as if wearing clothes tailored from fresh laughter. <words>341</words>
Outside, the dreamless night held its breath, wondering whether a single voicemail could redraw constellations. <words>356</words>
Elian marched into the dark, prism in hand, carrying a silence that now sounded unmistakably like freedom. <words>373</words>
Behind him, the hall resumed its slow pulse, mycelial veins glowing faintly, archiving his departure in quiet luminescence. <words>391</words>
Spores settled on the dropped cloak, weaving through its threads as if intent on digesting every leftover hesitation. <words>409</words>
Soon that fabric would crumble into fertile dust, preserving nothing but the shape of release. <words>424</words>
And somewhere ahead, through paths no map could promise, the bard's new voicemail waited to be received. <words>441</words>
His journey would speak through forgotten voicemails, guiding others by echoes of his risk. <words>455</words>
