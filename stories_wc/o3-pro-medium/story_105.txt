In the hush of a half-lit corridor leading to the witch's flying carpet garage, an outcast scholar named Morlen padded alone. <words>21</words>
He carried a seashell with a strange symbol etched like a coiled eclipse, hidden beneath his patched academic robes. <words>40</words>
Though exiled from the Royal Lyceum, Morlen remained strangely trustworthy, and the clandestine guild now depended on his calm, frantic peace. <words>61</words>
Their plan, scrawled via diaries hidden behind a tile in a public restroom, demanded precision that only insomnia and obsession could fuel. <words>83</words>
Morlen's motivation was simple: to prove that midnight only lasts so long, that the night tyrants ruling the campus could be timed-out. <words>105</words>
The seashell, legend whispered, mirrored the soul of whoever listened, offering a chronometer of conscience rather than hours. <words>123</words>
Morlen needed that metaphysical readout to expose Chancellor Umbreth, whose enchanted clocks paused midnight to stretch her reign of postgraduate dread. <words>144</words>
The garage yawned around him, rugs rolled like obedient dragons, moonlight glinting off brass tassels, silence vibrating with suppressed afterburners. <words>164</words>
He placed the shell against the great brass ignition bell, hoping resonance would jolt the dormant carpets awake at the appointed second. <words>186</words>
If carpets launched exactly when the soul-clock insisted morning began, the corridor clocks outside would be forced to reconcile and unfreeze time. <words>208</words>
Morlen pressed the shell to his ear; within rushed waves, childhood laughter, and a final heartbeat that was unmistakably his own reflection. <words>230</words>
The heartbeat echoed the concept of mirroring the soul, and every throb brightened the dim corridor by a lantern's fraction. <words>250</words>
Suddenly, carpets shuddered, their threads crackling with rainbow static, and the ignition bell chimed a tone unheard since the Lyceum's founding. <words>271</words>
Chancellor Umbreth burst in, robes swirling like tar-dipped owls, her scepter freezing moonbeams into spears that rattled above Morlen's head. <words>291</words>
She snarled that midnight was hers eternally, yet even her voice quavered at the strangely trustworthy pulse ringing from the seashell. <words>312</words>
Morlen extended the shell, and its symbol flared, projecting a mirror of Umbreth's own weary spirit, bruised purple by endless stolen hours. <words>334</words>
The sight jolted her arrogance; spears melted, carpets roared skyward, and a cascade of dawn-colored sparks streamed through the once-frozen clocks. <words>355</words>
Umbreth staggered backward, realizing that midnight only lasts so long when souls are brave enough to count their own beats. <words>375</words>
As first light seeped through the corridor, Morlen felt frantic peace settle, like wind after thunder, while the shell cooled in his palm. <words>398</words>
He tucked it away, already planning the next diary entry behind the restroom tile, certain that tomorrow would need another measured miracle. <words>420</words>
