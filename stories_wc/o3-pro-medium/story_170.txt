Surf hissed against the pylons of the coral restoration station suspended above a turquoise cradle. <words>15</words>
Leina, a free-spirited herbalist whose hands smelled of rescued sea-sage, arrived just at dawn. <words>29</words>
She carried a vintage sewing kit, brass hinges salt-kissed, like a reliquary of pocketed tides. <words>44</words>
Inside threaded needles nested among rolled parchment that glimmered with algae-pressed ink. <words>56</words>
These were forgotten letters from a professor who once named her academically artistic during botany practicum. <words>72</words>
His praise had fractured after rumors, leaving her carrying the heart of doubt like submerged coral rubble. <words>89</words>
She had come now, after the last stone is set in an abandoned wall inland. <words>104</words>
With the wall finished, silence in its hollows mocked her with echoing shame. <words>117</words>
Leina hoped the sea breeze could hush the hollow echoes of shame at last. <words>131</words>
The restoration crew had already dived, leaving her alone among tanks of nursery-grown polyps. <words>145</words>
Breathless longing fluttered in her throat as she opened the sewing kit on the dock. <words>160</words>
She unfolded a letter, sea air tugging its corners like impatient gulls. <words>172</words>
Word by word, she began to memorize the professor's once-treasured, now-poisoned compliments. <words>184</words>
The act felt surgical, as if suturing coral fragments so they could regrow into living lace. <words>200</words>
Yet each sentence pricked like a barnacle's barb, reminding her of the research grant he stole. <words>216</words>
She whispered the lines into the surf, letting them dissolve the way limestone yields to waves. <words>232</words>
Still, the heart of doubt throbbed, pulsing questions about her worth beneath every dissolved syllable. <words>247</words>
She turned to the coral cradles, tiny pink nubs waiting for transplantation onto the reef's skeleton. <words>263</words>
If coral could reanimate ruins, perhaps she could reanimate her confidence. <words>274</words>
She threaded a needle with biodegradable twine, parodying her grandmother's quilting but stitching living stone. <words>289</words>
Each puncture affixed coral fragment to substrate while she recited, by memory, the letters backwards. <words>304</words>
Through forgotten letters returned as reverse mantra, she unraveled their hex. <words>315</words>
Salt stung her eyes, but clarity bloomed like polyps extending after night's danger passes. <words>329</words>
The hollow echoes of shame dwindled beneath hammer taps of crabs on piling shadows. <words>343</words>
When the divers surfaced, they found her seated like a queen of barnacled lace, sewing kit closed. <words>360</words>
She offered them trays of revived fragments and a smile stabilized by earnest, academically artistic poise. <words>376</words>
The tide lifted the station gently, as if applauding her reclaimed rhythm. <words>388</words>
Within her chest, the heart of doubt quieted, now merely a cautionary echo preserved like archived coral. <words>405</words>
She closed her eyes and heard only promise in the waves' bright syllables. <words>418</words>
Tomorrow she would dive, stitching color into stone, memorizing wonder instead of wounds. <words>431</words>
