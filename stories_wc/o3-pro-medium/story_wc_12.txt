The loop pedal priest knelt on the cracked marble of the dimensional anchor, layering whispered chants the way musicians stack motifs in real time. [24]  
Each loop returned with muffled clarity, as though the air itself pressed fingers to its lips to keep the underworld from overhearing. [46]  
Around him floated an artist's palette with one color, a lone glob of midnight pigment orbiting like a moon that had forgotten all other hues existed. [72]  
He refused to mix it, because unity mattered more than variety in rites conducted before the possession completes. [90]  
Somewhere inside the trembling girl's ribcage, the invader paced impatiently, sniffing for contradictions it could exploit. [106]  
The priest's task was to illuminate hidden assumptions buried in her heart, for demons thrive on what mortals accept without challenge. [127]  
Yet illumination alone would not suffice; he also needed to plumb the depths of her quiet, to drag secrets into the candlelight of awareness. [151]  
That quiet was no ordinary stillness but an unraveled stillness, threads of time lying loose like severed harp strings waiting to be retuned. [174]  
He inhaled, tasting dust, memory, and the peculiar threat of eternity crowding closer with every skipped heartbeat. [191]  
Then he began to preach, not with doctrine but through rhetorical devices sharpened by centuries of listening to sinners explain themselves. [212]  
Anaphora rolled over polysyndeton; metaphors teased paradoxes until the demon inside the girl fidgeted like a courtroom witness cornered by cross-examination. [233]  
The chants created architecture, each repeated phrase a column, each pause an archway that decorates with silence rather than stone. [253]  
Soon a cathedral of hush surrounded them, its nave stretching beyond sight, pegged to the ground by faith the way ships tether to anchors. [277]  
The dimensional anchor pulsed beneath the marble, reacting to every syllable, preventing the demon from skipping realities the moment judgment grew uncomfortable. [299]  
"Why cling to borrowed flesh?" the priest asked, looping his question until it became an inescapable refrain. [316]  
The demon tried sarcasm, but every retort returned to it smeared in the single midnight pigment of the palette, a monotone it could not ornament. [341]  
Colorlessness exposed its arguments as hollow, and the congregation of one listened while fractures spidered across the creature's borrowed confidence. [361]  
Realizing retreat was impossible, it lunged forward, trying to seize the priest's throat, but the loops caught its motion and played it back slower each time. [387]  
With every replay the demon watched itself, an actor forced to study bloopers, and disgust fermented into reluctant self-awareness. [406]  
He offered the creature the artist's palette with one color, saying that absolution, like paint, begins with admitting emptiness and daring to mark a blank surface. [432]  
For a suspended breath the chamber quivered, possibility bending around them, and even the cracks in the marble seemed to listen for decision. [455]  
The demon sighed, a sound like winter wind slipping under doors, and released the girl, escaping upward through the unlit rafters as loose ash. [479]  
Immediately the loops faded, the palette settled, and the marble stilled; the anchor had done its work, and the world exhaled. [500]  
Yet the priest remained on his knees, aware that this victory would echo only until another heart grew careless, because truth delivered through rhetorical devices seldom survives unaccompanied. [528]  
He gathered the loops, winding them into a final chord, and stored it inside his vestments as a reminder that sound can be caged without being killed. [555]  
The girl, pale but conscious, asked why the sermon had felt like standing in rain yet never getting wet. [574]  
He smiled and pointed to the vacant space where the demon once lurked, explaining that some waters wash from within, and their dampness is a kind of birth. [602]  
Before she could answer, the midnight pigment evaporated, streaking upward like a silent flare, signaling to distant hungers that the anchor yet held jurisdiction. [626]  
The priest sensed their gaze and knew his pilgrimage was not to end but to persist, mapping each fragile soul across the continent of doubt. [651]  
He stepped outside the ruined chapel into a dawn still bruised with stars, carrying the unraveled stillness the way others carry torches, its quiet threads glowing at his heel. [680]  
Some would say he decorates with silence, but he considers himself only a janitor of meaning, sweeping resonance into corners where despair forgets to look. [705]  
As the horizon warmed, he placed one boot after another on the road, each step a cadence, each cadence a promise that assumptions would not stay hidden forever. [733]
