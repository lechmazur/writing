The night the northern compasses spun like drunken dancers, the town of Willow Bend lost its fragile calm.<words>18</words>
Ephraim Cotton, the small-town conspiracy theorist nobody took seriously, felt vindication crackle through his fillings.<words>33</words>
He claimed the magnetic field anomaly above the cornfields was the universe calling in a debt.<words>49</words>
All day he had carried Grandmother Hazel's embroidered handkerchief like a treaty flag between worlds.<words>64</words>
Its scarlet stitches formed an ouroboros no one in the family dared explain.<words>77</words>
Hazel had whispered that the cloth was woven to break generational curses, but she died mid-sentence.<words>93</words>
Now the stitches warmed whenever Ephraim approached the anomaly, like a discreetly flagrant warning flare.<words>108</words>
He needed proof, so he bought a battered walnut desk from Hazel's estate sale, rifling secret drawers.<words>125</words>
There he discovered handwritten letters, folded into triangles and scented of cedar and ozone.<words>139</words>
Each missive addressed him across decades, instructing: polymerize the curse with iron, gold, and human confession.<words>155</words>
The phrase puzzled him until he recalled freshman chemistry, where polymers were chains that stole loneliness from atoms.<words>173</words>
Perhaps a curse could be chained, its malice distributed so thin it snapped like taffy.<words>188</words>
But for balance he also needed a motive purer than self-preservation.<words>199</words>
The letters implored him to act only to weigh a cosmic scale in your favor, never merely his.<words>217</words>
Whose favor was 'your'?<words>221</words>
A cracked cellphone hidden behind a false veneer blinked once, then fell silent at the hush of a phone once its battery dies.<words>244</words>
Ephraim understood the timing was his window; Willow Bend's crumbling peace would not last until dawn.<words>260</words>
He marched into the corn under auroral spirals, handkerchief raised, iron pliers in his pocket, gold class ring on his thumb.<words>281</words>
At field center, compasses fluttered like trapped bees around a rusted scarecrow struck by lightning ages ago.<words>298</words>
He looped the handkerchief around the scarecrow's iron spine, chanting Hazel's half-remembered lullaby backward.<words>312</words>
He dripped sweat onto the gold ring, imagining molecules lining up until grief and greed polymerized into something neutral.<words>331</words>
The air thickened, then ruptured with a sound like paper tearing inside his ears.<words>345</words>
A spectral ledger unfurled above the field, one pan glowing ember-red, the other icy blue.<words>360</words>
Names of Cotton ancestors flickered on the red, their sins grating like static, while Hazel's name pulsed between colors.<words>379</words>
Ephraim placed the ring on the blue pan and pressed the stitched ouroboros against his heart, offering his own paranoia as confession.<words>401</words>
The scales leveled, then dissolved into sparks that drifted upward, reseeding the shimmering bands overhead.<words>416</words>
When morning arrived, compasses pointed true, but the townsfolk whispered that Ephraim walked straighter, as if Earth's gravity finally believed him.<words>437</words>
He tucked the quiet cellphone and the faded letters into the walnut desk, sealing them for the next soul who dares disturb the balance.<words>461</words>
