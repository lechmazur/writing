Across the hush of a possibility just born, a sneering envoy stepped into the domed vineyard on a barren alien plain, bootheels tapping the glass tiles.<words>26</words>
He carried a folded note smelling of ozone and crushed grapes, the last breadcrumb in a labyrinth of paper trails no archivist could ever exhaust.<words>51</words>
Air recyclers purred with a furiously tranquil rhythm, as though serenity itself had been wired to an overworked engine.<words>70</words>
Vines shimmered under artificial suns, their amethyst clusters reflecting distant nebulae that pilgrims once vowed to harvest and ferment into prophecy.<words>91</words>
Yet the envoy was not here for wine but for desire, to cup starlight in mortal palms before anyone else dared taste it.<words>114</words>
His instructions told him to sift through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse beyond the last trellis, where forbidden varietals grew like rumors.<words>138</words>
Each leaf supposedly mapped the orbit of a newborn comet, and whoever arranged them in sequence could chart a kingdom of futures.<words>160</words>
He found the greenhouse roof cracked, the interior wind whipped; still, the leaves danced obediently, waiting for a reader with a cruel smile.<words>183</words>
The envoy spread the folded note on a bench of corroded alloy, comparing its inked spirals to the whirling foliage, hungry for matched geometry.<words>207</words>
He remembered being a boy on a desert moon, scribbling constellations in sand while his mother preached rambling destiny to the strangers who passed.<words>231</words>
Those sermons had taught him that prophecy was a vineyard too, and some grapes fermented into venom if pressed by unworthy hands.<words>253</words>
So he worked carefully, fingers flicking vines aside while he gathered leaves whose shape mirrored the coils on the note, assembling a living map.<words>277</words>
When the pattern closed, the air inside the dome thickened, and the artificial suns dimmed as if a larger star had leaned near to listen.<words>302</words>
Light spilled through the greenhouse cracks, running down the envoy's wrists like molten arithmetic, begging to be held, weighed, owned.<words>322</words>
He cupped his palms together, furiously tranquil, and the luminance pooled between them, trembling with newborn gravity.<words>339</words>
Outside the dome, the barren plain remained silent, but orbital sensors would soon record an impossible bloom where no star should stand, and pursuit would follow the flare.<words>367</words>
The envoy thought of the paper trails he had burned on a dozen worlds to reach this moment and decided those ashes now formed a crown.<words>393</words>
With his makeshift diadem of smoke and light, he turned toward the vineyard rows, ready to march their length and sign their shadows with unimaginable dawns.<words>419</words>
Because destiny, once rambled long enough, crystallizes into orders, and orders must be obeyed even when they lead a man past the edge of stars.<words>444</words>
He left the greenhouse, vines closing behind him like curtains at the end of a tragic opera, and the newborn comet in his hands kept singing its overture.<words>472</words>
Somewhere beyond the vineyard glass, tomorrow paused, tasting the wine of uncertainty, and decided to ferment for one more breath.<words>492</words>
