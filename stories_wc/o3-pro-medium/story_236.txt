<story>
When the ocean swallowed the continents, municipal affairs relocated to domed trenches, and a meek blacksmith named Orrin accepted clerical duty there. <words>22</words>
His cubicle inside the underwater city planning office shimmered with specks of rust from anvils he missed more than breath. <words>42</words>
Orrin's new task felt openly hidden, an assignment everyone pretended was mundane yet none dared describe aloud. <words>59</words>
He was to verify half-baked stories from random hitchhikers who arrived on barnacled elevators, then stamp or reject their building petitions. <words>80</words>
The Council swore this bureaucratic ritual would ignite sustainable energy flows throughout the domes, yet nobody explained the physics. <words>99</words>
Orrin only knew his personal heartbreak over lost forge fires throbbed hotter whenever he approved a narrative. <words>116</words>
So he began harnessing that sorrow as fuel, measuring every tremor of memory against the hitchhikers' unfinished bargain with the sea. <words>137</words>
Each traveler produced a softcover dictionary swollen with waterlogged definitions, insisting the words inside were bricks for future boulevards. <words>156</words>
Orrin leafed through the wrinkled pages, feeling letters drift like plankton, and he marked them with ember-colored ink from his quenched furnace. <words>178</words>
Approvals glowed purple, denials gray, but soon the ink bled inward, recording something stranger than permits. <words>194</words>
The dictionaries began to whisper of a deadline stretched across the hush of time's final ripple, promising rebirth if promises stayed incomplete. <words>216</words>
Orrin understood: the city thrived on luminous regret, on the spark created when desire almost, but never quite, met fulfillment. <words>236</words>
The unfinished bargain was the power plant, and his heartbreak was merely one coal among millions. <words>252</words>
He felt simultaneously betrayed and indispensable, like an anchor forged of longing. <words>264</words>
That night, he carried the purple-gray dictionary stack to the abandoned dry-dock atrium and arranged them in a spiral. <words>283</words>
He whispered every word ever stamped, then struck flint against his last horseshoe, letting a single spark ignite the soaked paper. <words>304</words>
Water should have smothered flame, yet luminous regret burned brighter than physics, sending silver steam through corridors and waking the Council. <words>325</words>
Hitchhikers halted mid-elevator, sensing the bargain edged nearer completion, and their chests ached with purposeful loss. <words>341</words>
Orrin watched ash spiral like seafloor snow, realizing the city might dim forever if sorrow ran out, yet he kept feeding pages. <words>363</words>
In that moment he became the city's quiet sun, openly hidden, glowing behind bureaucracy, ensuring longing survived even beyond the final ripple. <words>385</words>
Breathing salt and smoke, he forged no blade yet sharpened every tomorrow with the tempered edge of incomplete dreams. <words>404</words>
