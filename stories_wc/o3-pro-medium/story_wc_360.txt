Dreya Inkwell adjusted the platen of her antique press, the gears clicking like cicada wings in the chill midnight. [19]  
People called her the cryptic letterpress operator because her broadsheets never spoke plainly, yet strangers wept when reading them. [38]  
Tonight the shop, a topaz workshop under stars, hummed with a special commission from an unseen astronomer. [55]  
He had couriered a small halo fragment, iridescent and warm, insisting she print its story before dawn. [72]  
The fragment floated above the composing stone, spinning slowly like a planet hunting for music. [87]  
Its glow disoriented her apprentices, so she worked alone, welcoming the lucid turbulence stirring behind her eyes. [104]  
Dreya's peculiar gift, if gift it was, let her habitually borrow personalities the way others borrow umbrellas from hallways. [123]  
She touched the halo fragment, and the astronomer's mind slid into her own like a tide reversing. [140]  
Numbers that smelled of pine and grief twined around her tongue, demanding an alphabet both precise and impossible. [158]  
Transposed empathy, she realized, was the astronomer's real request: to print feelings as equations and let strangers solve themselves. [177]  
Yet to achieve it she would need ambiguity, a deliberate ambiguity so sharp it sliced context from reaction. [195]  
Only in the gash between knowing and guessing, she believed, could the mathematics of emotion ever be glimpsed. [213]  
She locked the press, but instead of movable type she inserted mirrors, moth wings, and slices of midnight bread. [232]  
Through the open roof the constellations were thinning, as if one by one they were being erased from chalkboard sky. [252]  
The timeframe the astronomer had warned about had come: the narrow hour between vanishing stars, when light unlearns itself. [271]  
In that hinge of darkness Dreya pulled the first impression, and the paper exhaled a chord no ear could parse. [291]  
The sound disoriented even the clocks, their hands stuttering like hesitant debutants at the edge of a dance. [309]  
Lines of text crawled across the sheet, rearranging themselves each time she blinked, yet always preserving some hidden symmetry. [328]  
A phrase emerged, 'SUM THE RADIUS OF YOUR BREATH,' then dissolved into integral signs shaped like wedding rings. [346]  
Dreya felt the astronomer's loneliness flower inside her chest, petals of cold fire folding around her heart. [363]  
Borrowed emotions bruised her ribs, but she welcomed the ache, measuring its pulse like a teacher tapping chalk. [381]  
By mapping sensation to sound and sound to symbol, she hoped to understand, at last, the algebra of yearning. [400]  
She fed more halo dust into the ink well, and the press began to whisper impossible primes to itself. [419]  
Each prime corresponded to a sorrow she had never felt, yet recognized, the way night recognizes unlit torches. [437]  
Transposed empathy completed the circuit: Dreya, the absent astronomer, and any future reader, all sharing one oscillating heartbeat. [455]  
But the workshop windows now reflected only blankness, for the stars had fully vanished, leaving a ceiling of taut black silk. [476]  
She realized the universe was waiting to be reassured, as though her print might guide the stars home. [494]  
So she set a final line, ambiguous by design, that read: 'RETURN WHEN YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN WHY YOU LEFT.' [513]  
The statement's deliberate ambiguity would disorient any celestial mind, nudging it to question its own inertia. [529]  
Dreya pulled the second impression and flung it skyward; the sheet unfolded into a bright, silent shout. [546]  
Where the paper touched the dark, pinpricks ignited, sketching new constellations whose angles matched the equations of the printed grief. [566]  
One star traced the curve of the astronomer's signature, and another drew the shape of Dreya's unanswered childhood question. [585]  
Light rained back into the workshop, soaking the type cases, the halo fragment, and Dreya herself in warm arithmetic. [604]  
Her borrowed personalities peeled away, returning to their owners like released doves, yet she kept one feather from each. [623]  
Those feathers, she suspected, were variables in the grand equation she had almost solved but dared not finish. [641]  
For if emotion could be quantified completely, empathy might cease to transpose and instead ossify, and she loved its motion. [661]  
Dreya extinguished the lamps, leaving only starlight and the soft ticking of rekindled cosmos to proofread her soul. [679]  
In the lucid turbulence that followed, she finally understood that some equations are true precisely because they never resolve. [698]  
She smiled, set the press to rest, and watched the newly born constellations name themselves without needing her ink. [717]  
Between those once-vanishing stars, a silence bloomed that felt exactly like being understood, and that was mathematics enough. [735]
