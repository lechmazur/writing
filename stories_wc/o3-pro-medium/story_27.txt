I arrived at the abandoned Midway Gardens during the hush of dawn, ostensibly to tally migrating warblers. <words>17</words>
Bird watching, however, proved secondary the moment the haunted amusement park prize booth exhaled its chilly welcome. <words>34</words>
Dusty plush toys dangled like limp bats, and a chipped sign promised 'Fortunes Redeemed for Tickets'. <words>50</words>
I opened my backpack and placed the vintage pencil box on the cracked counter as an offering to silence. <words>69</words>
The box had belonged to my grandmother, who insisted every graphite line tugged a thread in the tapestry of fate. <words>89</words>
I, a cynic cursed to speak only truth, doubted such embroidery but craved the irony. <words>104</words>
Inside the booth, a mirror clouded with carnival grime shimmered as moonlight filtered through collapsing rafters. <words>120</words>
Each silver beam felt deliberate, aligning with lunar charts I had memorized for darker reasons. <words>135</words>
I intended to petrify my own complacency, phase by shimmering phase, until only adaptable thought remained. <words>151</words>
That goal, to provoke evolution in a stagnant mind, justified conversing with ghosts instead of goldfinches. <words>167</words>
A spectral ticket taker materialized, bowing with politely vindictive grace as though remembering every skeptic who'd scoffed. <words>184</words>
'One spin of the lunar wheel,' he hissed, 'and the booth will barter clarity for confession.' <words>200</words>
Because honesty chained my tongue, I could only say, 'Truth already bleeds from me; what else do you seek?' <words>219</words>
He tapped the pencil box, and the lid creaked open to reveal blank vellum sheets glowing faintly. <words>236</words>
'Write,' the spirit commanded, 'but let the phases of the moon direct each word, lest your brain fossilize.' <words>254</words>
At new moon I traced seeds of doubt; at waxing crescent I watered them with reluctant hopes. <words>271</words>
By first quarter, the mirror reflected not my face but a storyboard of alternate futures I had mocked. <words>289</words>
Gibbous light ushered in moving scenes where warblers nested inside my ribcage, loosening calcified certainties. <words>304</words>
When full moon crowned the booth, I acknowledged aloud that cynicism had become another flavor of fear. <words>321</words>
The spirit smiled, a small victory for mercy, yet his politeness sharpened as he waited for more. <words>338</words>
Disseminating truth was easy; surrendering control was the payment stitched into destiny's underside. <words>351</words>
At waning gibbous, I dipped pencil lead in moonlit dust, scripting an apology to the universe I debunked. <words>369</words>
Last quarter demanded silence, so I listened to carousel gears grinding out chords older than entropy. <words>385</words>
Finally, the crescent waned toward dark, and the booth itself began to unravel like cotton candy in rain. <words>403</words>
The mirror shattered inward, yet no shard struck me; instead, calcified thoughts around my skull cracked and fell. <words>421</words>
Unpetrified, my mind stretched its wings with the same quiet elasticity I once admired in passing swallows. <words>438</words>
The spirit saluted, then dissolved into ticket stubs that fluttered skyward, joining the birds I had neglected to count. <words>457</words>
I pocketed the vintage pencil box, now empty, and walked away carrying a tranquility layered enough to last lifetimes. <words>476</words>
