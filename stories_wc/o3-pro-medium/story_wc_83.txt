Ashraf first felt the tremor when the sky sang with iron and the wedding canopy dissolved into ash. [18]
He lived because the blast threw him beyond the courtyard fountain, and because the fountain cracked open a geode crystal that shielded his skull. [42]
Fragments kept falling for months, but the lavender core of that shattered stone grew brighter in his jacket pocket. [61]
When rescue teams found him, their drones mistook the glowing mineral for unexploded ordnance and left him uncounted among the dead. [82]
So he walked east alone, a phantom groom, the crystal humming like an intangibly tangible promise he could neither drop nor understand. [104]
Rumors guided him to the equatorial megacity where a research guild maintained a floating observatory tethered to storm anchors. [123]
They said the platform drifted above weather systems, mapping energies that refused ordinary names. [137]
Ashraf knew energy when it screamed, so he rode a cargo balloon through acid clouds and arrived while circuit breakers cool from a recent power surge. [163]
Steam curled off copper spines; technicians slept beside opened panels, exhausted. [174]
Only Dr. Sanaa, lead quantum cartographer, remained awake, scribbling perturbation theory onto a transparent slate that floated in magnetic lamplight. [194]
Ashraf laid the geode on her desk; its violet glow pulsed in synchrony with the emergency beacons outside. [212]
She did not ask his name; instead she murmured, 'The lattice knots are awake without filters—an unfiltered awakening.' [230]
The phrase rang inside Ashraf like the distant hymn of rotor blades returning. [243]
Sanaa explained that their orbital gauges detected reservoirs of dormant potential under the ruins where his village once danced, but equations refused to pinpoint the pools. [269]
'We need a guide who has already heard the energy,' she said, eyes flicking to the scars hidden by his collar. [290]
Bleak exhilaration spread through Ashraf: a chance not for revenge, but to hunt the source that had rewritten his life with fire. [312]
He agreed, on one condition—when they found where unused potential pools, they would not weaponize it. [328]
Sanaa laughed without mirth, noting every invention becomes ordnance eventually, yet she accepted. [341]
They calibrated the observatory's interferometers to the crystal's frequency and descended in a gravitonic skiff toward the ravaged plains. [360]
All night the hull quivered, translating perturbations into sonar pings that mapped invisible currents beneath the charred soil. [378]
Through perturbation theory, Sanaa visualized the land as a sheet dipped in hidden wells; Ashraf felt the wells like bruises in memory. [400]
At dawn they anchored over a crater no satellite had registered, its circumference lined with glassy weeds whispering static. [419]
Ashraf stepped onto brittle ground, the geode swinging from his neck, guiding him the way a compass obeys spilled blood. [439]
Every footfall triggered low thunder as if circuit breakers under the earth clicked and cooled, preparing for another surge. [458]
The air shimmered, becoming an intangibly tangible curtain that parted around him, revealing vortices of violet dust spiraling downward. [477]
Sanaa monitored readings from the skiff, voice crackling: 'The potential is draining toward a singular node—if it flips, it'll level half the continent.' [500]
Ashraf realized the node pulsed with the same cadence as attack drones; the weapon that spared him had lured energy here like bait. [523]
To silence it, he would need to offer the geode back, completing the circuit that began beneath the wedding canopy. [543]
But surrendering the crystal meant extinguishing the last light the bride he never married had chosen for their table centerpieces. [563]
He hesitated until the ground cracked, coughing sparks that traced the silhouette of her absent body, and then the choice hollowed him of doubt. [587]
Ashraf pressed the geode into the dusty maw; it dissolved into lattices of light that spiraled clockwise, reversing the drain. [607]
Sound fell away; the field became so quiet he could hear the observatory turbines miles above stutter awake. [625]
Energy rushed upward in argent sheets, rejoining forgotten circuits while circuit breakers cool once more, this time without smoke. [644]
Sanaa landed beside him, instruments confirming the wells had flattened, unused potential redistributed across safer gradients. [660]
She asked what he felt; he answered that nothing felt lighter, yet everything felt less heavy, a bleak exhilaration in equilibrium. [681]
Above them the floating observatory glowed like a lantern of remorse, its crew stirring to new data and old temptations. [701]
Ashraf turned away, uncertain whether he had saved a continent or merely delayed the next equation of war, but determined to keep hunting for quieter answers. [727]
Dawn sharpened, and the earth beneath his feet felt, at last, intangibly tangible enough to carry him forward. [745]
