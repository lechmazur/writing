Corva Lynne stood at the rim of the sky reflection pool, studying horizons folded like mirrors inside mirrors.<words>18</words>
She was the city's infamous femme fatale heartbreak counselor, restlessly curious about wounds no lover dared confess aloud.<words>36</words>
After the invention of time travel, her appointments multiplied, because regrets now looped back on themselves like bitten tails.<words>55</words>
Tonight a client had vanished mid-session, leaving only a zip of displaced air and payment in the form of amber earrings.<words>76</words>
Their honeyed facets tugged at Corva with the gravity of desires she was paid to untangle, yet never escape herself.<words>96</words>
Cautious impulsiveness coaxed her to chase the fleeing pain before it congealed into another client's permanent scar.<words>113</words>
So she clipped the earrings on, felt their weight calibrate coordinates, and stepped onto the pool's glassy surface.<words>131</words>
Ripples became timestamps, and water refracted into a spiraling runway that led elsewhere by tracking cloud trails overhead.<words>149</words>
She zipped along the glowing helix, every splash whispering possibilities that might collapse if she hesitated to listen.<words>167</words>
High above, stormbanks recorded travelers like smudged chalk, and Corva read the fresh grooves her client had just carved.<words>186</words>
They arrowed toward a luminous cage of illusions, a carnival orbit where every reflection promised freedom while tightening invisible bars.<words>206</words>
Corva landed there, shoes clicking on prismatic floorboards that rippled like trapped rainbows under anxious applause from hologram crowds.<words>225</words>
Her client, a trembling songwriter, was bargaining with a vendor who sold reruns of first kisses in crystalline jars.<words>244</words>
Each jar glowed, and desire's gravity pulled the man downward until his spine arched like a condemned comet's trajectory.<words>263</words>
Corva approached, voice a velvet scalpel, reminding him that loops of longing rarely ended where they claimed to begin.<words>282</words>
He pleaded to repeat a romance he once sabotaged, hoping repetition might forgive him, but the counselor heard her own echo.<words>303</words>
She, too, wanted to proclaim herself free in a cage of illusions, yet professionalism required selling the key, not using it.<words>324</words>
Corva unclasped the amber earrings and offered them, explaining they held the ache he chased and would weigh honesty against relapse.<words>345</words>
The songwriter touched them, suddenly upright, as if released from lunar tides, while gravity in the carnival thinned to a hush.<words>366</words>
Seeing him stabilize, Corva turned and zipped back along the cloud trails, cautious impulsiveness carrying her toward the next mirrored horizon.<words>387</words>
Yet she noticed her lobes now light, and wondered, restlessly curious, whether losing that weight had tipped her own orbit forever.<words>408</words>
