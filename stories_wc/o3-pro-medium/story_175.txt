Moonlight glazed the mushroom village in silver, pooling like wild water around squat fungal cottages. <words>15</words>
Merrin, an aged minstrel with a harp strung from spider gut, limped through the spongy lanes. <words>31</words>
His back ached, yet his eyes glittered with innocently mischievous schemes nobody trusted but everyone needed. <words>47</words>
Clutched beneath his cloak swung an empty birdcage, its door rattling a rhythm that mocked captivity. <words>63</words>
He had sold the lark that once sang prophecies, because coin unlocked fewer gates than silence. <words>79</words>
Tonight he sought forbidden knowledge whispered to lie at the intersection where an old tradition ends. <words>95</words>
That crossroads bisected the village and the forest, watched by a vintage sign advertising extinct honeybrew. <words>111</words>
Merrin visited nightly, explaining to curious mushrooms how truth erodes by comparing the chipped paint on that sign. <words>129</words>
Each flake that fell, he said, was a mask slipping from the world's crumbling illusions. <words>144</words>
The mushrooms giggled spores, finding his lectures equal parts bedtime story and wildfire sermon. <words>158</words>
Yet Merrin listened harder than he spoke, attuned to the soil's secret sizzling beneath their stems. <words>174</words>
Legends claimed the ground itself remembered the first melody, a note that could unmoor reality. <words>189</words>
To seize it, one must arrive neither early nor late, but exactly when tradition sighed its last breath. <words>207</words>
Tonight the sigh drifted through the village like a wolf wearing perfumeâ€”feral elegance incarnate. <words>221</words>
Merrin reached the vintage sign and traced the newest scar where paint had fallen. <words>235</words>
Under moon glare, the exposed wood resembled a doorway gnawed open by invisible teeth. <words>249</words>
He placed the empty birdcage against the wound and listened, harp forgotten. <words>261</words>
From the hollow space where the lark never was, a single stringless chord curled out. <words>276</words>
It smelled of rain on burnt sugar, and it pulsed like a heart ashamed of beating. <words>292</words>
Merrin answered with words older than speech, weaving them between cage bars like phantom vines. <words>307</words>
The chipped paint shivered, peeled itself entirely, and collapsed into dust that circled his ankles. <words>322</words>
In that spiraling dust he saw the forbidden knowledge: the village existed only while the sign remained scarred. <words>340</words>
If the surface ever restored, mushrooms would petrify, cottages crumble, and memory fizzle like spent dew. <words>356</words>
He laughed, innocently mischievous, realizing his nightly comparisons were the knife slowly killing and saving home. <words>372</words>
Merrin could mend the sign and end illusion, or keep flaking paint and maintain fragile existence. <words>388</words>
He opened the birdcage, inviting the stringless chord inside, then shut the door so softly paint shrieked. <words>405</words>
Dust settled, illusions steadied, and moonlight realigned, but the sign's wound halted its own decay. <words>420</words>
Merrin concealed the cage beneath his cloak, decision unreadable, feral elegance prowling behind his brittle smile. <words>436</words>
He turned from the intersection where the old tradition had ended and a new secret began. <words>452</words>
The mushrooms bowed; their caps knew debt, though their stalks knew nothing of price. <words>466</words>
Only the minstrel, hobbling toward dawn, understood that crumbling illusions sometimes uphold the world more fiercely than truth. <words>484</words>
