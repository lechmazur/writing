Salt-grey dawn seeped through the cracked lens of the lighthouse on the rocky island, etching trembling lattices over scattered puzzle pieces. <words>21</words>
Ephraim Quist, the fanatical puzzle maker, called the glimmer his first daily clue. <words>34</words>
He felt optimistically bitter, certain the universe hid answers but amused that it entrusted them to him alone. <words>52</words>
Between two fateful letters--one archived, one yet unwritten--he intended to chart his own shadowed pilgrimage. <words>67</words>
The motivation was scholarly, he told himself, a noble wish to track spiritual development like stars on nautical maps. <words>86</words>
But the lighthouse groaned as though it knew the heavier truth: secrets accrue mass, and he craved their gravity. <words>105</words>
Every fortnight, a mysterious package arrived without a return address, ferried by gull-bitten skiffs that never lingered. <words>122</words>
Inside he always found a riddle inked on wafer-thin birch, a tarnished coin, and a single piece of string. <words>141</words>
The coin he taped to maps, the riddle he solved by midnight, but the string he merely pocketed. <words>159</words>
It wriggled there like a living thing whenever thunder bloomed off the cliffs. <words>172</words>
Ephraim recorded each sensation, believing the twitching fiber echoed his own sinews pulling toward revelation. <words>187</words>
The lighthouse library smelled of ozone and mildew, a lethargic excitement humming in the air like stalled applause. <words>205</words>
On the great oak desk he arranged the solved riddles into a mosaic shaped like an hourglass. <words>222</words>
Each phrase hinted the next parcel would reveal the weight of secrets, measured not in pounds but confessions. <words>240</words>
He wondered whose confessions they were--his, or the unseen correspondent who refused a name. <words>254</words>
Storm season thickened, and sea-fog plastered the lantern glass like cataracts, yet Ephraim's anticipation sharpened. <words>269</words>
He drafted the second fateful letter, though he vowed to mail it only after the final puzzle unfurled. <words>287</words>
In that letter he promised to forgive the sender for every sleepless night if meaning outweighed mystery. <words>304</words>
The next package arrived during a moonless ebb tide, thudding against the door like a heart in a crate. <words>323</words>
Inside lay no riddle, no coin--only a coiled string long enough to circle the lantern room twice. <words>340</words>
He climbed the spiral stairs, unfurling it, letting it wriggle over iron steps like a pale serpent seeking light. <words>359</words>
When the final inch slipped from his fist, the lighthouse lantern ignited of its own accord, revealing words burnt onto the glass. <words>381</words>
SECRETS ARE ONLY HEAVY WHEN YOU CARRY THEM ALONE, the flame spelled, every letter trembling with phosphorescent sorrow. <words>399</words>
Ephraim laughed, an exhausted bark that scattered gulls, and the bitter optimism in his chest finally reconciled with peace. <words>418</words>
He sealed the second letter with seawater instead of ink, its single line reading, "Weight delivered", before tossing it to the tide. <words>440</words>
The string, now slack around the lantern, seemed feather-light, and so, at last, did Ephraim. <words>455</words>
