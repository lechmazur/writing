Grey clouds sagged like wet wool over the experimental weather station crouching on the cliff. [15]  
It was the first winter after the jet stream shifts, and every barometer sounded like a hinge. [32]  
Marla Finch, the idealistic map librarian on temporary assignment, arrived clutching a damp satchel. [46]  
She was nervously confident, like someone who had practiced courage before a cracked mirror. [60]  
Her mission was private: to honor an ancestor's overlooked bravery by retracing the storm routes he charted. [77]  
Old rumors claimed that he once walked into voluntary exile, a fate rumored reversible but never attempted. [94]  
Marla believed the exile was a code, not a destination, and she intended to question the weather. [111]  
Inside her satchel lay a single copper nail pried from her ancestor's coffin during a discreet midnight disinterment. [129]  
Family superstition insisted the nail could guide a descendant to whatever shore the old cartographer still occupied. [146]  
The station's director, Dr. Havel, offered Marla a bunk and a cautionary smile that looked moth-eaten. [162]  
Equipment hummed around them, measuring gusts that now blew south instead of east, rearranging continents of frostbite. [179]  
Havel asked why a librarian needed to study live wind. [189]  
Marla answered with the polished vagueness librarians keep for overdue patrons, but her eyes betrayed tidal urgency. [206]  
That night, she explored the archives under the radar dome, searching for shipwrecked journals rumored to have washed ashore years earlier. [227]  
She found five, their leather rotted into lichen shapes, their pages stiff with salt. [241]  
Under red lamplight she saw that each entry was a stanza, and every stanza was a latitude impossible on modern maps. [262]  
The code was music, and the melody curved like coastlines reversed. [273]  
She tapped the copper nail against the desk, beating the rhythm until letters rearranged in her mind. [290]  
A single phrase emerged: 'Exile returns when the ocean forgets its name.' [302]  
Marla tasted spongey dread, a damp flavor of possibilities swelling too fast to swallow. [316]  
She suspected the phrase was a question posed to storms, awaiting someone brave enough to reply. [332]  
At dawn a gale slapped the station, and sensors blinked epileptic red. [344]  
Havel pounded on her door, shouting that the sea had breached the helipad. [357]  
Marla sprinted outside, coat unbuttoned, copper nail hidden in her glove. [368]  
Waves heaved with mournful rhythm, as though reciting the stanzas she had only half translated. [383]  
She pressed the nail against a rusted meteorological buoy, the closest metal to coffin size. [398]  
A tone rang out, low, hollow, and the wind abruptly pivoted three degrees east. [412]  
Havel stared, nervously confident this was science, yet terrified it might be grammar. [425]  
Marla faced the gale and shouted the phrase, adding the missing punctuation she had felt rather than read. [443]  
'Exile returns when the ocean forgets its name, question mark, question mark!' [455]  
The sea paused, as if insulted, then recoiled, drawing back to reveal a black channel spiraling seaward. [472]  
Mist within the channel shimmered until it resembled a hallway tiled with drifting barnacles. [486]  
Marla knew this was the corridor of reversible exile, the place her ancestor had vanished to serve unthanked tides. [505]  
Havel grabbed her elbow and demanded data, but she shook him off with a librarian's quiet authority. [522]  
She stepped onto the newly exposed silt, feeling it pulse like turning pages. [535]  
A silhouette emerged from the hallway, thin and upright, carrying a sextant made of shadow. [550]  
The figure removed his hat, revealing Marla's family cheekbones and a weary smile. [563]  
He could not cross the final meter; exile held him by an ankle of vapor. [578]  
Marla understood the rules required exchange, not rescue. [586]  
She turned to Havel, whose clipboard rattled like teeth, and asked the simplest library question: 'May I borrow tomorrow?' [605]  
Before he could invent policy, she placed the copper nail in his trembling hand, a receipt of sorts. [623]  
Wind wrapped them in silence, sealing the loan. [631]  
Marla crossed the channel to her ancestor, and the hallway folded shut like a book returned to stacks. [649]  
Spray collapsed over the silt, erasing footprints, but Havel remained, copper nail warm as new sunrise in his palm. [668]  
Somewhere beyond the horizon, two mapmakers were redrawing wind so that exile might one day reverse again. [685]  
He waited, nervously confident, tasting the same spongey dread that had summoned a doorway where none belonged. [702]
