<story>
I awoke in the brig of the space pirate ship Grim Jubilee, cuffs humming with polite menace.<words>17</words>
As a proudly humble psychic genealogist, I had expected prisons, but never one floating beyond Orion's dust.<words>34</words>
My captor, Captain Larkspur, flicked a chipped die between her knuckles like a tiny moon with scars.<words>51</words>
The matching die, pristine, lay on a shelf outside the bars, mocking symmetry broken by chance and cruelty.<words>69</words>
She wanted my talent to read the lineage of those dice, to divine whose luck she might steal next.<words>88</words>
But my motivation was simpler: to hush the alarm bells of heartbreak still ringing across my tired mind.<words>106</words>
Every clang of the hull reminded me of Mira, whose laughter once lengthened silences into music.<words>122</words>
I promised myself that deciphering destiny's puzzle might knit our severed timelines back together.<words>136</words>
To prepare, I requested the diaries left on abandoned bullet trains that the pirates had plundered for salvage.<words>154</words>
Captain Larkspur, amused by my calm, delivered crumbling notebooks smelling of ozone and distant storms.<words>169</words>
Through ragged entries, engineers had recorded the trajectories of gamblers who rolled those dice on midnight commutes.<words>186</words>
I traced bloodlines in the margins, letting psychic currents flicker like starlight that refuses extinction.<words>201</words>
Names connected, histories dovetailed, and a spiral of probability revealed the dice were siblings of celestial ore.<words>218</words>
One remained whole because its thrower had kissed goodbye without regret; the other chipped when a promise cracked.<words>236</words>
I told Larkspur that fortune would betray anyone holding both dice unless they restored balance by surrendering the unbroken one.<words>256</words>
Her grin faltered, grave playfulness sliding toward uncertainty like a card table tipping in zero gravity.<words>272</words>
She would not admit fear, so she challenged me to roll the pair and read my own fate.<words>290</words>
I obeyed, feeling Mira's memory steady my pulse as the dice tumbled across the steel floor.<words>306</words>
They landed thirteen, a sum whispered to lengthen endings just enough for beginnings to slip through.<words>322</words>
I closed my eyes and declared that the number required a trade: my freedom for the pristine die.<words>340</words>
Larkspur, superstitious beneath her swagger, unlocked the cell and placed the faultless cube in my palm.<words>356</words>
In that contact I glimpsed her ancestral acheâ€”generations pirating to escape a single, ancient betrayal.<words>371</words>
I murmured a benediction, and the alarm bells of heartbreak inside both of us fell silent.<words>387</words>
When the last star fades into morning light, legend says, destiny resets; I walked free to meet that dawn.<words>406</words>
