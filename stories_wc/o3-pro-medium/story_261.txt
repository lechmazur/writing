Beneath a lattice of humming magnets, the particle acceleration garden glittered like dew caught in starlight.<words>16</words>
There, Morrow, the borderline immortal orchard keeper, walked rows of atom-thick saplings.<words>28</words>
Each sapling sprouted leaves that shimmered between realities, photosynthesizing raw probabilities instead of sunlight.<words>42</words>
Yet entropy gnawed their roots, a visible rot in the quantum loam threatening the whole biome.<words>58</words>
He sought a way to restore the broken ecosystem before even his elongated lifespan bent.<words>73</words>
Science manuals offered formulas, but Morrow trusted stranger mediums: spilled ink, bitter laughter, and buried memories.<words>89</words>
So during sketching sessions in the observation dome, he overturned inkwells across parchment maps of rootflows.<words>105</words>
Black rivulets wandered, forming ephemeral patterns in spilled ink that only longevity-tuned eyes could decipher.<words>120</words>
In those shapes, histories long painted over by victors reemerged like frescoes under peeled plaster.<words>135</words>
They told of an ancient launch that once seeded the orchard with self-healing genetic symphonies.<words>150</words>
But one component—a single earbud cover engraved with climatic algorithms—had been misplaced, unmooring the melody of renewal.<words>167</words>
Morrow remembered hurling it away centuries prior, dismissing it as trivial plastic while mourning a lost friend.<words>184</words>
The ink now looped around a storage alcove where the cover still lay, rigidly flexible despite ages.<words>201</words>
With a grunt that crackled into sardonic chuckles, he retrieved the artifact and wiped off dust.<words>217</words>
Its inner grooves replayed compressed storms when touched, making the saplings tremble like audiences before an encore.<words>234</words>
But reinstalling it required navigating the orchard’s nucleus, where magnetic vines warped time in defensive snarls.<words>250</words>
Morrow packed quark fertilizer, the cover, and his sketchbook, then stepped between accelerator rings singing discordant lullabies.<words>267</words>
Radiation hissed, and he answered with bitter laughter that frightened even the dosimeters hung like windchimes.<words>283</words>
At the core trunk he found a ruptured conduit exhaling neutrons the way injured trees bleed resin.<words>300</words>
He fitted the earbud cover into a port shaped like a cochlea, twisting until it clicked.<words>316</words>
Suddenly the whole garden inhaled, launching dormant spores into micro-orbits that shimmered around every leaf.<words>331</words>
Color rippled, rigid yet flexible as origami in rain, and the sickly branches straightened.<words>345</words>
Probabilities brightened from ashen to verdant, rewriting the orchard’s statistics with brushstrokes of rejuvenated chaos.<words>360</words>
Morrow opened his sketchbook and let fresh ink pool, watching for new guidance amid the swirling renewal.<words>377</words>
The patterns now formed a simple sentence: 'Tend, laugh, repeat,' a directive both mocking and merciful.<words>393</words>
He complied, laughter scraping his throat like wind over broken flutes, yet blooming with cautious hope.<words>409</words>
Somewhere beyond the magnets, painted-over history peeled another layer, and forgotten birdsong drifted into the accelerating dawn.<words>426</words>
The orchard keeper lingered, equal parts curator and penitent, until sketches and seedlings rhymed in equilibrium.<words>442</words>
