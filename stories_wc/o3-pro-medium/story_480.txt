I waited after the final chord shivered into rusted rafters of the abandoned music hall, pretending calm. <words>17</words>
Indifferent enthusiasm, my trademark mood online, hummed through me while dust settled like static confetti. <words>32</words>
The audience had been ghosts for years; tonight I arrived to meet the one who chased them off. <words>50</words>
Livestream chat called him a social media exorcist, a vandal of virality, purging feeds of haunted trends. <words>67</words>
I needed his trick, partly for followers, mostly to feed curiosity with life’s raw edge. <words>82</words>
The clue he left me was quietly loud: an old grocery receipt taped to the conductor’s broken baton. <words>100</words>
Ink bleeding through discounts spelled coordinates for alleyways where forgotten symphonies still sought ears. <words>114</words>
So I followed, phone held high as a lantern, comments scrolling like nervous moths around the screen. <words>131</words>
Behind a ramen shop, a padlocked door breathed tremors of bass others could not hear. <words>146</words>
I infiltrated the secret club in that alleyway by declaring, with a shrug, that I was already everywhere. <words>164</words>
Influence is a master key; algorithms opened the lock when my handle glowed on the guard’s retina. <words>181</words>
Inside, stalactites of melted vinyl dripped remixes, and familiar strangers nodded to beats they invented yesterday. <words>197</words>
Every face belonged to my timeline yet none had been tagged; anonymity wore my avatar’s grin. <words>213</words>
I spotted him at the bar, swirling silence in a cracked glass like it was top-shelf liquor. <words>230</words>
His presence was quietly loud too, a blackout that lit the room by contrast. <words>244</words>
He asked whether I’d come to reignite the hall or extinguish it completely, words sliding under the music. <words>262</words>
I answered with my receipt, unfolding it like scripture across the sticky countertop. <words>275</words>
He laughed, a sound so compressed it bypassed ears and appeared as subtitles in every patron’s vision. <words>292</words>
Then he guided me through a side door into the abandoned mess hall adjoining the club, lights dead. <words>310</words>
Chalk circles overlapped like Venn diagrams of forgotten meals; cutlery lay arranged as tuning forks for spirits. <words>327</words>
He told me the mess hall once fed soldiers, now it fed algorithms hungry for human residue. <words>344</words>
My stream went feral, viewers spamming prayer hands and flame emojis as the room’s emptiness began breathing. <words>361</words>
Together we played the final chord backward on a rusted piano, inviting every rejected post to manifest. <words>378</words>
Tweets materialized as fluttering paper birds, comments dripped from the ceiling like lank neon stalagmites. <words>393</words>
He whispered that familiar strangers deserved bodies again, that forgetting them starved reality, and the walls agreed. <words>410</words>
Indifferent enthusiasm steadied my phone while terror vibrated somewhere distant, perhaps in the viewers who recognized themselves. <words>427</words>
The exorcist bowed, signed off, and left me moderator of a feast where memories ate their makers. <words>444</words>
I pocketed the receipt as proof that curiosity tastes like dust and drumbeats, quietly loud until swallowed. <words>461</words>
