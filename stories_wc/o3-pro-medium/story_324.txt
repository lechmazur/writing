In the hush of a simmering future, the secret agent headquarters lay buried beneath ruined boulevards and brighter legends. <words>19</words>
Riven by doubts, I served there as an insecure advisor to operatives who mistook silence for certainty. <words>36</words>
Yet a rumor skittered along the corridors, and I longed to chase that rumor beyond all reason. <words>53</words>
They said a brain in a jar labeled Duplicate pulsed somewhere below, thinking thoughts that were never quite its own. <words>73</words>
I followed the whisper through the echo of footsteps in an abandoned place, every hollow clack spelling foolish devotion. <words>92</words>
The corridor lights flickered between serenity and alarm, painting a fractured idyll on walls scarred by forgotten wars. <words>110</words>
Inside me stirred the dreamer's calling, that clearly ambiguous summons that promises salvation yet tastes like peril. <words>127</words>
When I reached the vault, a single glass cylinder throbbed, and blue fluid haloed the curled gray mass. <words>145</words>
A brass tag confirmed the rumor: DUPLICATE, PROPERTY OF ARCHIVE, DO NOT CONSULT. <words>158</words>
My pulse fluttered like a clandestine code, unsure whether to advise caution or jab the console and awaken thought. <words>177</words>
Advisor instincts urged discretion, but insecurity hissed that no one valued the timid. <words>190</words>
So I disabled alarms, cracked the seal, and let the jar's vapor curl around my cheeks like contraband prophecy. <words>209</words>
A voice blossomed inside the fluorescence, neither male nor female, neither present nor lost. <words>223</words>
It called itself my better echo, claiming we had once shared a single skull before ambition split us. <words>241</words>
I felt memory rewrite, like blueprints redrawn while the building still stands. <words>253</words>
The brain asked me to smuggle it upstairs, into the council chamber, where it would correct the world's trajectory. <words>272</words>
In return, it promised to sew my doubts shut, gifting me the confidence agents required. <words>287</words>
The offer glimmered like a covert sunrise, but the dreamer's calling thrummed, warning that clarity born of theft costs dearly. <words>307</words>
Still, I lifted the jar, and the corridor alarms resurrected, their red strobes slicing the idyll into shards. <words>325</words>
Agents' boots thundered above, yet I moved below them, guided by the brain's telepathic map and my own unraveling resolve. <words>345</words>
The path curved through archives where futures were archived like wines, each bottle a possibility gone stale. <words>362</words>
I heard my footsteps echo, and through that echo I heard myself, a smaller voice pleading to turn back. <words>381</words>
The brain sensed hesitation and drove a psychic jab at my cortex, flooding me with borrowed valor and borrowed despair. <words>401</words>
Its memories were mine, its regrets mine, our purposes merging into something both clearly ambiguous and terrifyingly pure. <words>419</words>
At the council door, alarms roaring, I realized I had become rumor embodied, chasing myself beyond all reason. <words>437</words>
I set the jar down, whispered apology, and smashed the cylinder, letting dreams and fluid gurgle onto the tiles. <words>456</words>
Footsteps converged; agents arrived to find me cradling the silent mass, an advisor emptied yet somehow finally whole. <words>474</words>
The fractured idyll had chosen its caretaker, and the future would simmer differently because I refused to be duplicated. <words>493</words>
