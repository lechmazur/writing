The final hour of daylight slanted across the shadowed garden in autumn, painting long bars of copper over silent leaves. [20]  
I, Peregrine Holt, traveler who writes obituaries for the living, paused beside a frost-stiff rose to study its bruised petals. [40]  
The rose seemed already mourned, yet it breathed a scent of unfinished stories that matched my profession too perfectly. [59]  
I had come to this forsaken principality after the last ship sails, when the harbor emptied like a drained heart. [79]  
The officials who hired me wanted written memorials for citizens still breathing, because departure, not death, was their dread. [98]  
Disappearance had become the realm's currency, and explained absences were considered worth more than unspoken grief. [114]  
So I wandered lane to lane, collecting anecdotes, fears, and half promises, recording them in a leather folio of anticipatory elegies. [135]  
Tonight, however, a summons of stranger hue awaited me beneath the arbor where moonlight barely flickered through the ivy lattice. [155]  
There stood Princess Selene, her silhouette cut from solitude, holding a single loose palace carpet weft thread between trembling fingers. [175]  
Rumor claimed she had not crossed the courtyard in years, yet tonight her eyes searched mine with urgent, lonesome splendor. [195]  
"Write my living obituary," she said, "and weave it into the kingdom's memory before winter erases what still aches." [214]  
Her request alone would not have startled me, but she intuited my deeper hunger and chose to intimate more. [233]  
Selene wished my obituary to map the places inside her that might yet heal if properly named. [250]  
She believed words could stitch scar to horizon and reveal, at last, the geography of healing. [266]  
For nights she had sent herself in silence across the palace by projecting presence, drifting like perfume through locked hallways. [286]  
Few saw her material body; most felt only a chill breath and blamed the draft, never the forsaken princess. [305]  
Tonight she sought to be seen entire, not half remembered, before she too vanished when winter storms severed the last roads. [326]  
I agreed, my own motive stirring like embers: to understand the geography of healing through another's unhealed map. [344]  
We sat on a mossy bench beneath a skeletal oak whose branches scribbled constellations against failing light. [361]  
She spoke, and I listened, my notebook filling with vividly descriptive phrases that rose like lanterns inside the twilight. [380]  
She recounted corridors she avoided because echoes of childhood laughter stung sharper than any wound. [395]  
Those halls, she claimed, were explained absences written into her daily schedule, ghost hours everyone politely ignored. [412]  
Other rooms she haunted as spirit, not flesh, testing whether remembrance alone could keep their colors from fading. [430]  
At last she placed the carpet thread in my palm, its crimson glistening with half vanished heraldry. [447]  
"Pull this through every line you write," she whispered, "so the kingdom feels my pulse without seeing my face." [466]  
The request was intimate, binding my craft to her beating secrecy like needle and thread. [481]  
Wind scuttled dry leaves across marble, sounding like distant applause for a play no audience would witness. [498]  
I began composing aloud, each sentence a tentative longitude, each pause a trembling latitude on her inner atlas. [516]  
She corrected my course gently, insisting sorrow must border hope the way cliffs border sea, perilous yet defining. [534]  
When midnight tolled, frost filmed the bench, and our breath rose like paired ghosts rehearsing departure. [550]  
She stood and, by projecting presence, stepped away while her body lingered only a heartbeat longer, as if deciding which to keep. [572]  
Before the garden swallowed her outline, she turned back and said, "Remember, Holt, an obituary for the living is a compass, not a tombstone." [596]  
Then she was gone, leaving only the thread warm against my wrist and the lonesome splendor of unfinished stars above. [616]  
I walked back toward town, rehearsing her cartography in my head, determined that no healed land stay hidden this winter. [636]  
Somewhere beyond the dim harbor, waves kept the beat of absent ships, and their rhythm promised my pages would reach her. [657]  
I felt the kingdom's unsung pulse under my feet, and I knew my own healing had already found its first coordinate. [678]
