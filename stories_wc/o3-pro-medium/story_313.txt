Crickets clicked like broken machines across the dystopian farm while Amos Skell, a small-time con artist, practiced sincerity.<words>18</words>
His manner, despite his racket of forged ration coupons, remained unusually normal, which unsettled the scarecrow sentries.<words>35</words>
Night mist soaked the cabbage husks, and Amos felt the lull of remorse hover as hushy as fog.<words>53</words>
He hated that feeling, so he crafted a new distraction.<words>63</words>
During story time in the barn bunker, he would comfort the orphan hands by interrogating ghostly apparitions.<words>80</words>
Questions kept the spirits loud and the children quieter.<words>89</words>
"Who stole the moonlight?" he would ask the invisibles with mild fervor that made his grin wobble.<words>106</words>
The air answered with creaks in the rafters, and the kids believed justice worked.<words>120</words>
Amos believed nothing, yet that disbelief itself was a way to taunt the jaws of defeat and grin.<words>138</words>
He kept trophies of failure close, chief among them an empty tape dispenser scavenged from the abandoned printing shed.<words>157</words>
Its plastic cradle, all teeth and no roll, mirrored his own hustle: slick promise missing adhesive substance.<words>174</words>
Some nights he pressed the dispenser to his ear, pretending it hissed fresh tape, pretending tomorrow could stick.<words>192</words>
Tonight, however, the barn children demanded a different yarn, one starring him, the ghosts, and the farm itself.<words>210</words>
So Amos stood on a feed crate, smoothed his patched coat, and addressed the darkness like a court.<words>228</words>
"Specters," he declared, "were you ever swindled by a man who looked this unusually normal?"<words>243</words>
The rafters groaned, pigeons fluttered, and the kids gasped at the implied yes.<words>256</words>
Amos felt the lull of remorse deepen, then plateau, like a lake refusing tide.<words>270</words>
He realized confession alone could splice his broken narrative.<words>279</words>
With the empty tape dispenser raised as a gavel, he sentenced himself to one honest paragraph.<words>295</words>
He told the children how the forged coupons starved families, how he pocketed futures like loose change.<words>312</words>
Tears salted his grin, yet the grin stayed, because surrendering the story still mocked defeat.<words>327</words>
The orphan hands, hearing raw truth, formed a circle around him and offered calloused palms of comfort.<words>344</words>
Their acceptance struck harder than any haunting, and the lull of remorse finally broke into living wind.<words>361</words>
Outside, patrol drones buzzed, reminding everyone the farm remained dystopian, but inside the barn, hope sounded plausible.<words>378</words>
Amos lowered the tape dispenser, now crowned by invisible ribbon, and invited the ghosts to seal the tale.<words>396</words>
In the hush that followed, scissors of silence trimmed regret, and every listener, living or dead, felt bound together.<words>415</words>
