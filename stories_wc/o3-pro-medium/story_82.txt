In the hush of a hidden sunrise, I inspected the orchard that never stopped whispering my name.<words>17</words>
I was its reluctant caretaker, drafted by bloodline and bureaucrats after the last guardian vanished leaving only clawed foot-prints in the frost.<words>39</words>
The trees bore fruit slick with nightshade resin, and tourists from the distant futuristic hub paid to film them rot.<words>59</words>
Profit never silenced the moans curdling beneath the roots.<words>68</words>
So I laughed with gleeful sorrow, an analytically playful defense against dread.<words>80</words>
Everyone assumed the orchard was cursed by agricultural pathogens, but I suspected language.<words>93</words>
Words can germinate deeper than spores, if you grip their stems before they blossom into commands.<words>109</words>
To trace the dialect, I carried a fossilized dragon tooth found in a cave beneath the abandoned mag-lev tracks.<words>128</words>
The legend claimed the tooth could taste phonemes, vibrating whenever a buried syllable tried to escape the soil.<words>146</words>
Its tremors guided me past the orchard fence and toward three rotting farmhouses strangled by blackberry wires.<words>163</words>
I knew the method: by unlocking secrets in rotting farmhouses, one might free the orchard or confirm its damnation.<words>182</words>
Inside the first husk of a home, holographic family portraits flickered like trapped fireflies, replaying arguments about failed harvests and missing children.<words>204</words>
When the dragon tooth hummed, the portraits' mouths rewound, chanting coordinates in a code older than silicon.<words>221</words>
I mapped the numbers onto the orchard rows, discovering each tree corresponded to a phonetic consonant, each fallen apple to a vowel unspoken.<words>244</words>
Speech wanted a mouth, and saplings curled like tongues aching to articulate.<words>256</words>
That craving mirrored my own motivation: to become the voice of the unknown.<words>269</words>
But parroting forests invites echo, so I sought the remaining two houses for context.<words>283</words>
The second house sagged beneath meteor-scarred tin, its basement flooded with nutrient gel, where albino koi circled a rusted server.<words>303</words>
I jacked the server into my wrist console, and lullabies spilled out, genetically tuned to calm extinct pollinators.<words>321</words>
The dragon tooth glowed, digesting melodies, then projected a lattice of letters across the koi water, spelling LISTEN.<words>339</words>
The final farmhouse was merely a chimney surrounded by ash, yet the lattice guided me to its hearthstone.<words>357</words>
Below the stone, I found a microphone fashioned from applewood and bone, wired directly into the bedrock.<words>374</words>
I spoke the coordinates, the lullaby, and the orchard's consonants, my tone trembling between gleeful sorrow and childish wonder.<words>393</words>
The ground responded with a slow, seismic purr; branches twisted into a colossal larynx, and dawn cut itself on the sound.<words>414</words>
Every fruit split, releasing letters like moths, drifting toward the futuristic hub to nest inside apathetic skylines.<words>431</words>
I realized the orchard had never wanted freedom; it wanted audience, and I, at last, had curated the premiere.<words>450</words>
As echoes lifted into morning traffic, the dragon tooth cooled, my caretaker contract dissolved, and a new language began composing me.<words>471</words>
