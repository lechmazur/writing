Sand hissed above the cracked glass ceiling as Lio, the hopeful pickpocket, threaded through the time-worn marketplace inside the giant hourglass. <words>21</words>
He moved with blithe discontent, smiling at tourists while cursing the slow rain of grit that measured every opportunity. <words>40</words>
Today the chalk lines on the distant sidewalk above would finally fade away, and he felt the hour demand a confession. <words>61</words>
In his pocket rattled a broken pencil sharpener, worthless to most, sacred to him, because its blade remembered blood he had never admitted spilling. <words>85</words>
That memory was the secret that seared his soul, and he had resolved to share it before the next dunes of sand eclipsed the stalls. <words>110</words>
But how does a petty thief stand on a crate and pour remorse into ears dulled by barter? <words>128</words>
An answer seemed to materialize when the rusted speaker system crackled, inviting shoppers to a spontaneous karaoke duet contest for free. <words>149</words>
Lio saw the chance: sing his crime into a melody, hide confession within rhythm, and let curiosity do the rest. <words>169</words>
He pulled aside Mira, a street poet whose verses were tastefully offensive, mocking emperors with such finesse even the guards bought her pamphlets. <words>192</words>
She agreed to duet if he finally told her why he flinched whenever metal scraped. <words>207</words>
Lio whispered about the sharpened blade, the frantic scuffle, the accidental slit, the merchant who bled into sand no one bothers to sweep. <words>230</words>
Mira did not recoil; she only nodded, seeing the depths of devotion hidden beneath his pickpocket grin, the aching wish to repair the torn hour. <words>255</words>
They mounted the cedar stage between spice counters, sand already burying their boots, and the first tremor of music fluttered like a trapped moth. <words>279</words>
Mira opened with a playful taunt about royal taxes, while Lio followed by turning the refrain into a confession, each note peeling his guilt like fruit. <words>305</words>
Stall keepers stopped haggling; tourists lowered cameras; the entire marketplace bent closer, unsure whether to laugh, dance, or summon the constable. <words>326</words>
When the final chord rang, silence pooled, and Lio raised the broken pencil sharpener high, its dull blade glinting with remorse rather than menace. <words>350</words>
He vowed to pay every coin he ever lifted to the dead merchant's widow, and the crowd, moved by melody and audacity, tossed him purses instead of stones. <words>378</words>
Above them sand shifted again, but a thin ray of light broke through, sketching new chalk lines in brightness where the old ones had vanished. <words>403</words>
Lio exhaled, tasting spice and dust, and realized devotion, even from a thief, could slow the hourglass just enough to let forgiveness settle. <words>426</words>
