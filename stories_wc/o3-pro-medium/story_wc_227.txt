Sulphurous mist lapped at the gears-and-cogs workshop floating on the acid sea. [12]  
Inside, an uncertain alchemist named Brielle held her breath, half expecting the rivets to scream. [27]  
Between breaths held underwater in the containment cistern, she timed her movements with the workshop's wheezing pistons. [44]  
Every exhale risked drawing acid vapor into her lungs, so silence became survival. [57]  
Yet the hush also amplified the statue's whispers. [65]  
The effigy, salvaged from a drowned basilica, crouched at the room's heart, marble scarred by caustic storms. [82]  
Brielle believed the pockmarks recorded a language older than sound. [92]  
Her task was to narrate that language into gold, practicing what she called kintsugi intentions. [107]  
Fragments of the world's broken history would be mended, not erased, if the seams glittered honestly. [123]  
But uncertainty gnawed like rust at every joint in her spine. [134]  
She carried that doubt on a key ring charm shaped like a hollow circle. [148]  
Whenever it spun around her thumb, she remembered the mentor who forged it then vanished into the brine. [166]  
He had promised the charm would unlock courage, but never said which door it fit. [181]  
Now doors were scarce; only hinges remained, corroded and sighing against each other like quarrelling ghosts. [197]  
Still, Brielle approached the statue with calipers and starlight chalk. [207]  
She would quilt memories together by matching the pockmarks on a centuries-old statue, mapping rupture into revelation. [224]  
Each measured crater corresponded to a moment the world had cracked but refused to crumble. [239]  
First she found a star-shaped pit on the statue's brow and murmured the tale of the Glass Rebellion. [257]  
The gears overhead shuddered, and a filament of molten gold trickled from her lips into the wound. [274]  
Dire enchantment thickened the air, tasting of lightning struck salt. [284]  
She tucked the key ring charm between her teeth to douse the trembling. [297]  
Next she traced a crescent nick along the statue's collarbone, conjuring the mourning of the Clockwork Peninsula. [314]  
Again the gold seeped, sealing fracture with lament, brighter than the workshop's failing lamps. [328]  
But as the statue drank her stories, Brielle's lungs begged for air. [340]  
She dashed to the cistern, plunged her face beneath its reclaimed rainwater, and borrowed another heartbeat of oxygen. [358]  
Between breaths held underwater, reflections warped into visages of kingdoms she had not yet repaired. [373]  
They sank back when she surfaced, replaced by the relentless clang of metal hearts turning. [388]  
Third, the alchemist discovered a cluster of tiny perforations over the statue's sternum, like constellation dust. [404]  
She hesitated, recognizing the pattern as her own childhood village seen from the sky the night it burned. [422]  
Uncertainty clashed with duty, but the key ring charm warmed, reminding her that terror could be alloyed into purpose. [441]  
She narrated the fire, every scream, every ember twisting upward like pleading hands, letting the pain pour unedited. [459]  
Gold welled in rivulets, filling the perforations until they gleamed as a phoenix breastplate. [473]  
The statue, once hunched, straightened with a grinding sigh, scattering acid droplets from its shoulders. [488]  
Gears in the floor reversed, and the whole workshop tilted toward the sea's hissing mouth. [503]  
Brielle stumbled, clutching the statue's ankle, hearing within its marble chest a heartbeat echoing her own. [519]  
In that dire enchantment she understood the final seam she needed to mend lay not in stone but in herself. [539]  
She pressed the key ring charm against the pulse at her throat, feeling the circle complete. [555]  
A fissure she had carried unseen opened from collarbone to sternum, mirroring the statue's restored heartline. [571]  
Without flinching, she narrated her own story into the crack: mistakes, departures, unanswered letters, and the mentor's disappearance. [589]  
Gold surged from within, sealing her flesh with radiant veins that hummed like newborn gears. [604]  
The workshop steadied, its cogs now synchronized to the alchemist who had conjured meaning from the edge of oblivion. [623]  
Brielle exhaled at last, and the air tasted of storms forgiven. [634]
