At the break of a brittle branch in a silent forest, Eirin the gentle conjurer felt destiny crack open like a geode of echoing light. <words>25</words>
The sound carried beneath roots to Umbradell, the underground city of the dwarves, where rumors said justice itself had been chained to iron stalagmites. <words>49</words>
Eirin descended spiral obsidian stairs, driven by the tender urgency to rebuild a forgotten garden once perfumed with moon-vine and ember-lily. <words>70</words>
Legends whispered that the garden would bloom again only when wrongs were righted and a stained glass butterfly was made whole before dawn. <words>93</words>
Yet the butterfly lay shattered in a vault of dwarven law tablets, each shard etched with letters that read coherently only when spoken backward. <words>117</words>
The dwarves, wedded to solidity, deemed the inscriptions inscrutably obvious, insisting anyone of true purpose would discern their inverted simplicity. <words>137</words>
So Eirin petitioned the Stone Council, offering a demonstration: she unfurled a ribbon of speech, reciting her request entirely through reversed messages that fluttered like bats. <words>163</words>
Joy twined with terror as the syllables echoed back-to-front, causing torches to flare azure and stalactites to drip melodies instead of water. <words>185</words>
Convinced, the council allowed her to reassemble the fragments beneath the Hall of Resonance, where every spoken word became a colored vibration. <words>207</words>
Eirin arranged the shards on a basalt lectern, aligning jagged edges to the rhythm of a lullaby sung in perfect reverse. <words>228</words>
Piece by piece, ruby halo met sapphire vein, amber wingtip met emerald core, until the butterfly pulsed with kaleidoscopic life. <words>248</words>
Suddenly the hall quaked, and spectral chains snapped somewhere deeper, releasing a roar that was half laughter, half indictment. <words>267</words>
Justice, personified as a blindfolded dwarf of molten silver, emerged, its presence a joyful terror that filled every lung with frost-scented hope. <words>289</words>
The apparition bent to the rebuilt butterfly, breathed upon it, and the creature ascended, scattering prismatic dust that mapped forgotten garden paths in midair. <words>313</words>
Seeing the map, Eirin invited dwarves and root-bound spirits alike to follow; fear quivered in their beards, yet wonder compelled trembling boots onward. <words>336</words>
They surfaced through mossy vents, reaching the forest clearing where the first brittle branch had broken, and found soil glowing with dormant seeds. <words>359</words>
Guided by reversed chants that sounded gloriously wrong, Eirin planted the prismatic dust, and instantly vines spiraled upward, ringing like crystal chimes against dawn. <words>383</words>
The forgotten garden awakened, each blossom revealing truths previously hidden, making the dwarves weep because the path to justice had been so inscrutably obvious all along. <words>409</words>
Eirin smiled, joyful terror subsiding into steadier joy, knowing the reassembled butterfly would forever patrol the garden, ensuring no branch would break unheard again. <words>433</words>
