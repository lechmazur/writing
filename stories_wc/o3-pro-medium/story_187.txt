The stoic wanderer arrived just as the dusk bell clanged across the marsh. <words>13</words>
He had followed a trail of nightmares, each dream leaving mud on his boots. <words>27</words>
Before him stretched the witch's familiar training ground, a meadow restless with cackling ravens. <words>41</words>
The air hummed with brash tenderness, like someone shouting lullabies into a wound. <words>54</words>
He carried a single plank, a floorboard pried from an abandoned cabin upriver. <words>67</words>
Its grain was mesmerizingly bland, so neutral it seemed to erase any shadow that touched it. <words>83</words>
The board would impose order upon chaos, or so the necessary lies had promised. <words>97</words>
He needed those lies the way cartographers need horizons they will never reach. <words>110</words>
His true mission was to archive ritual practices, not to mend the witches' shredded moonshifts. <words>125</words>
But archives demand stories, and stories demand endings, even false ones. <words>136</words>
A crooked schoolhouse loomed, its blackboard flickering with chalk sigils like dying fireflies. <words>149</words>
Inside, apprentices murmured while their teacher prepared to wipe the final formula away. <words>162</words>
That fleeting instant was the timeframe he had crossed swamps to intercept. <words>174</words>
He stepped through the doorway without invitation. <words>181</words>
Ravens scattered, and the apprentices gasped at the plank like peasants before a crown. <words>195</words>
The teacher, a silver-eyed crone, asked what authority dared interrupt curriculum. <words>206</words>
The wanderer replied with a smile carved from gravel, "History, madam, and its hunger." <words>220</words>
He laid the floorboard across the desks, aligning it beneath the residual chalk glow. <words>234</words>
Symbols leapt from the blackboard onto the timber, burning like quiet comets. <words>246</words>
The wood drank the runes, storing the lesson in sap veins older than language. <words>260</words>
Archiving completed, truth would have demanded he walk away. <words>269</words>
Instead he spoke the necessary lies again, declaring the ritual sealed and safe. <words>282</words>
The class exhaled, accepting relief like children accept bedtime monsters turned to jokes. <words>295</words>
Only the teacher saw the cost stitched behind his mesmerizingly bland eyes. <words>307</words>
She whispered, "Nightmares never end; they simply change routes." <words>316</words>
He nodded, for the trail already curved back toward him, carrying tomorrow's terrors. <words>329</words>
Yet he lifted the plank, feeling its weight turn hopeful, as though lies might float. <words>344</words>
Outside, twilight thickened, but the meadow seemed slightly mended, the ravens humming softer chords. <words>358</words>
He walked on, archiving each heartbeat, imposing distance between horrors and the tender hush of maybe. <words>374</words>
Behind him the final formula faded completely, and the world forgot why it felt lighter. <words>389</words>
Only his journal would remember, pressed between warped pages like a flower nobody dared sniff. <words>404</words>
And even that memory would lie when asked, because tenderness sometimes survives only through deception. <words>419</words>
