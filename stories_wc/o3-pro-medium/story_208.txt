The conveyor belts hummed like metallic beehives inside the automated postal sorting facility, where I unstrapped my battered guitar case after midnight. <words>22</words>
I, a street musician by trade and vagrant by circumstance, had never meant to trespass so deeply into mechanized intestines. <words>42</words>
Yet the night carried a dare, a playful screech of destiny coughed from the backlash of regrets choking my every chord. <words>63</words>
Security drones floated unaware, and their cameras glimmered with complexly deceptive reflections of fluorescent light, as if lying about what they watched. <words>85</words>
I searched the dead letters bin for something worthy of melody and uncovered a vintage fountain pen wrapped in customs tape like an apology. <words>109</words>
Its nib shimmered, begging to rewrite fate, promising that ink could rewind time the way fingers rewound cassette strings in alleys. <words>130</words>
I clicked it open, and the belts suddenly hiccuped, parcels oscillating through forgotten patterns the barcode gods had abandoned decades earlier. <words>151</words>
A package burst, and at the close of a suitcase that may never reopen, the clasps slammed shut with the funeral finality of cosmic punchlines. <words>176</words>
The pen twitched, ink sketching invisible staves on air, and I heard an audience both unborn and long deceased laughing in joyful despair. <words>199</words>
Motivated to find humor in cosmic absurdity, I balanced my guitar atop a conveyor and strummed the sorted boxes like makeshift drums. <words>221</words>
Each rhythm teased the sensors, and the facility's algorithm tried to rewind its scanning log, only to loop, confused by unexpected syncopation. <words>243</words>
Lights strobed, painting me as both culprit and maestro, while parcels started waltzing down wrong chutes toward improbable destinations. <words>262</words>
I realized the facility itself was a gigantic music box whose spring was wound by consumer optimism, and I had snapped it. <words>284</words>
But the backlash of regrets thickened; memories of unopened guitar cases, unsung subway stations, and faces passing without coins seeped between notes. <words>306</words>
To escape drowning, I wrote lyrics with the vintage fountain pen across moving cardboard, tracing complexly deceptive jokes only the universe could grok. <words>329</words>
Every parcel bearing ink rerouted to a chute shaped like an exclamation, erupting outside where dawn mist waited like a breath before laughter. <words>352</words>
I followed the torrent, but the drones finally noticed and sealed exits, the suitcase that may never reopen thudding against the locked gate. <words>375</words>
Its latch clicked, a quiet verdict, urging me to rewind my own path, back through forgotten patterns none of the machines remembered. <words>397</words>
So I looped the facility's central belt in a ringing arpeggio, climbed atop the suitcase, and let the cycle carry us toward whatever punchline waited outside. <words>423</words>
Over the whirring applause, I whispered a promise to reopen the world with song, even if the case stayed shut forever. <words>444</words>
