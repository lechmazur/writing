The bleak clown arrived at the floating rock yoga studio just as the day's earliest train sighed awake beyond the clouds.<words>21</words>
He carried a pocket clock whose lone hand would not stop spinning, a shrill compass of impossible urgency.<words>39</words>
People called him Moros, but he rarely answered, preferring the soft cackle the wind made in helium lanterns.<words>57</words>
The studio floated on basalt slabs stitched together by ropes of incense, its mats drifting like promises never signed.<words>76</words>
Moros had come to master those drifting promises, to bind them into a grin bright enough to outshine the northern lights.<words>97</words>
His tone with the assembled yogis was jagged generosity, a kindness cut on glass but still reflecting dawn.<words>115</words>
They balanced in mid-air poses while he planted the crazy clock at the studio's center, its hand whirling like a saw.<words>136</words>
Every revolution shaved a second from the sunrise, which made the session technically absurd yet spiritually punctual.<words>153</words>
Moros whispered private poetry under the incense ropes, dismantling illusions with each crooked stanza only he could hear.<words>171</words>
He recited, 'Skin is a curtain, sorrow is lighting, laugh until the play can't afford props,' and the slabs trembled.<words>191</words>
The yogis, hearing nothing, felt their postures loosen as if gravity had quietly changed its mind about them.<words>209</words>
From the windows of dawn the earliest train released a whistle, and the note stitched itself into Moros's grin.<words>228</words>
That grin, cracked like river ice, began to glow, pale at first, then pulsing brighter than auroral curtains over poleward snows.<words>249</words>
The northern lights themselves hovered on the horizon, insulted by competition, writhing into sharper greens to reclaim their throne.<words>268</words>
But Moros's grin widened, reflecting jagged generosity across the basalt, and the spinning clock hand accelerated like a cheering crowd.<words>288</words>
Promises once drifting among yoga mats shot inward, threading through his painted lips, sealing into consonants of molten neon.<words>307</words>
He had mastered them, yet mastery gnawed: every promise accepted meant another unspoken, spiraling off with the clock's frenzy.<words>326</words>
Moros realized the technically absurd price of brilliance: to outshine beauty, one must also eclipse ordinary warmth.<words>343</words>
So he tilted the clock, letting the insane hand point directly at his own heart, and spoke a final verse.<words>363</words>
'Let my radiance be loaned, not owned,' he rasped, and the hand slowed, trading velocity for silence like a forgiven debt.<words>384</words>
The basalt slabs settled, the yogis breathed true gravity again, and dawn slipped forward exactly on schedule.<words>401</words>
Moros, now merely a clown without adjectives, watched the northern lights relax, their rivalry resolved into mutual glow before departing on the train whistle.<words>425</words>
In the car's reflection he saw himself smiling enough, no brighter than the aurora, yet no longer bleak.<words>443</words>
