Rusting crates drifted like tarnished moons in the cargo hold of the battered space pirate ship.<words>16</words>
Among them paced Peregrine Voss, the wry caretaker hired to inventory plunder no one dared touch.<words>32</words>
His manner was warmly aloof, a lantern that glowed yet refused to promise heat.<words>46</words>
Tonight, the only sound was the lonely hum of an outdated phone’s dial tone echoing from the brig.<words>64</words>
Voss waited for the exact moment when an outdated phone’s dial tone cuts out, as if time itself hiccuped.<words>83</words>
That hush, precise and razor-thin, always opened a slot in the chronicle where impossible errands could begin.<words>100</words>
He lifted a battered piece of chalk, its tip worn to a crescent, and began sketching equations on a crate.<words>120</words>
Lines curved into spirals, spirals collapsed into arrows, and arrows converged upon a single phrase: the nature of time.<words>139</words>
Voss was not searching for treasure; he sought an exit route for memory, a way to hush the endless 'what if' siren song.<words>162</words>
Each unsold bauble around him shimmered with half-finished choices, and their chorus gnawed with gentle harshness at his sleep.<words>181</words>
The chalk diagram told him that possibilities behave like clouds: trailing edges reveal where they’ve been, bow fronts foretell where they may drift.<words>204</words>
So he stowed the chalk, hoisted a cracked porthole open, and began tracking cloud paths across the vacuum-stained stars.<words>223</words>
In the blackness, there were no true clouds, only ice exhaust curling from neighboring hulls, but he read them just the same.<words>245</words>
Vector by vector, he calculated a minute-wide crevice in spacetime, an alcove where regret could briefly vanish.<words>262</words>
Yet the crevice would not open unless the ship jettisoned the weight of at least one yearning artifact.<words>280</words>
His eyes fell on a silver locket humming faint lullabies of a planet he never visited.<words>296</words>
With a sigh sharpened by humor, the wry caretaker pried the locket from its velvet groove and palmed it.<words>315</words>
He whispered, 'You’re lovely, but you’re late,' and flung it through the porthole just as the dial tone died again.<words>335</words>
Silence dilated, swallowing the locket and its unborn memories, and a pale doorway unfurled between cargo nets.<words>352</words>
Through the doorway Voss saw nothing grander than a cottage porch at dusk, where questions perched yet chose not to speak.<words>373</words>
He wanted that pour of peace more than any gem locked in these rusted coffers.<words>388</words>
But caretakers cannot abandon their charges, so he only touched the threshold, memorized its hush, and stepped back.<words>406</words>
The doorway folded shut like paper, leaving a chalky scent and a map Voss alone could smell.<words>423</words>
He cleaned the crate with his sleeve, erasing every spiral, then tucked the piece of chalk behind his ear for next time.<words>445</words>
Far off, the dial tone rallied again, and the cargo hold resumed its chorus of possibilities, softer for having been heard.<words>466</words>
