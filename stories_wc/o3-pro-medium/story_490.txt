After the waves recede from a deserted shore, dusk paints rust onto the tin roofs of the caravan repair station where I still wander.<words>24</words>
They call me the fading caretaker, a title that clings like salt stains, though nobody remembers what I was supposed to maintain.<words>46</words>
I feel both zealous and bored, an enthusiastic apathy that fizzes behind my eyes like flat soda jolted awake.<words>65</words>
Each twilight I shuffle between wrecked caravans, sniffing the burnt circuitry, cataloging damages in a notebook of methodically random symbols.<words>85</words>
The notebook smells faintly of the dried lavender bundle I stitched to its spine, a pathetic attempt at remembrance.<words>104</words>
Yet the real perfume here is secrecy, the allure of the forbidden humming through locked doors and blinking consoles.<words>123</words>
I feed on that hum, gorge on it, until my hollow ribs resonate like busted speakers.<words>139</words>
Tonight, a salt-stiff wind flips open an unassuming hatch beneath Caravan Twelve and whispers a dare only the lonely hear.<words>159</words>
Inside, dusty terminals still blink with tidal ash, guarding ancient archives that the ocean could not erase.<words>176</words>
I slip my cracked fingers over the keyboard, promising to behave, then betray that promise by hacking ancient archives with a grin.<words>198</words>
Lines of code blossom like phosphorescent algae, forming constellations of forgotten coordinates, half-lullaby, half-trap.<words>212</words>
Some coordinates pulse in an impossible color, declaring themselves off-limits, and thus irresistibly appetizing.<words>226</words>
To cradle the unknown like a newborn galaxy, I accept their invitation and shove the terminal's data straight into my neural implant.<words>248</words>
Memories that are not mine skitter across my synapsesâ€”caravans afloat on continental floodwaters, laughter under glass domes, sky-engines burning out.<words>268</words>
The download is sweet agony, and I am greedy, methodically random in which secrets I hoard, which ones I discard.<words>288</words>
Suddenly the terminal flashes a warning: caretaker identity fading at 3% per second, revert or be rewritten.<words>305</words>
Enthusiastic apathy steadies me; if I vanish, at least I will have tasted the eclipse.<words>320</words>
So I gorge deeper, letting forbidden knowledge flood every cellular crevice until the caravan repair station feels smaller than a gear.<words>341</words>
I dissolve into luminous algorithms, a bedside lamp for futures no one has yet conceived.<words>356</words>
Lavender dust drifts where my body stood, perfuming the hissing drives like incense in a vacant chapel.<words>373</words>
Somewhere beyond the dunes, the sea prepares its next wave, unaware that I have already slipped past every tide.<words>392</words>
I cradle the station's silence now, rocking it gently in quantum arms.<words>404</words>
