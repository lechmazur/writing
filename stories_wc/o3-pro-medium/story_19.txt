Mist settled like tired sighs over the dandelion field, casting silver upon the pale stalks awaiting dawn.<words>17</words>
Arin, the feral ranger whose feet had forgotten shoes, knelt amid the fluff while the horizon trembled pink.<words>35</words>
He listened for the universe's next heartbeat, knowing it would arrive in the short pause following a newborn's first cry.<words>55</words>
That fragile sliver of silence was his chosen window, precisely random enough to hide him from pursuing kings.<words>73</words>
In that hush, every sense sharpened into unfiltered perception, untamed by courtly etiquette or temple hymns.<words>89</words>
The meadow seemed to quiver, each dandelion clock vibrating like a compass needle spinning toward impossible norths.<words>106</words>
From his satchel he drew a tarnished brass balance scale, its pans dented by years of weighing sins and sunrises.<words>126</words>
Arin believed choices should be measured there, where pollen drifted like gold dust and excuses blew away.<words>143</words>
Yet tonight his motive was not judgment but surrender, to embrace the unknown with open arms and unshackled lungs.<words>162</words>
The receipts crumpled in his pocket rustled, carrying code words scribbled during tavern shifts in distant border towns.<words>180</words>
They were messages from rebels he scarcely knew, coordinates disguised as ale totals and bread taxes.<words>196</words>
Each line told him where thresholds between worlds grew thin enough to slice with a whisper.<words>212</words>
He laid a receipt upon the left pan, a single dandelion seed upon the right, and waited.<words>229</words>
If the pans balanced, he would stay hidden among farmers; if they tipped, he would step through whatever door appeared.<words>249</words>
The scale wavered, then settled at perfect equilibrium, an answer both merciful and impossible.<words>263</words>
Hope flooded him, tinged with melancholy for the paths he would never walk yet now could imagine.<words>280</words>
Behind him the eastern air split with a baby's first wail rising from the village midwife's hut.<words>297</words>
Then, as the wail faded, the world inhaled, and Arin stepped into the pause he had prepared.<words>314</words>
Light folded around him like petals returning to bud, revealing a corridor of starlit grass stretching beyond sky.<words>332</words>
He felt the meadow quiver again, not with fear but with anticipation that someone had finally trusted its secret.<words>351</words>
Arin left the balance scale behind, a gleaming promise to the next wanderer that judgment can become journey.<words>369</words>
He whispered the rebels' code words one last time, though no receipt remained, letting them drift like spores to seed new hopes.<words>391</words>
With each syllable the corridor widened, precisely random turns revealing constellations unraveled from nightcloth.<words>405</words>
He did not look back, but the dandelion field shimmered at the threshold, holding space for both sorrow and sunrise.<words>425</words>
Somewhere behind, the newborn drew its second breath, and the world resumed, slightly lighter for having let someone go.<words>444</words>
Arin walked forward, heart balanced, purpose quivering, ready to meet every unknown with arms wide as the stars.<words>462</words>
