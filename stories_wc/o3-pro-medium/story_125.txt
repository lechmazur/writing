I hovered at the console of the abandoned space station control room, practicing exceptionally usual sparks.<words>16</words>
Nothing flashy, just the mediocre magic that had defined my reputation as an underachieving mage.<words>31</words>
Outside the viewport shimmered the boundary of farmland soon to be sold, fields turning ghost-grey in twilight.<words>48</words>
That pending sale felt like a foreclosure on my family's orbit-farming heritage, and boredom curdled into excitement.<words>65</words>
I intended to reclaim it, but first I had to spring a trap on my own limitations.<words>82</words>
The plan would unveil itself via misdelivered packages that had been stacking like unsolved riddles at the airlock.<words>100</words>
Each crate carried equipment meant for richer wizards, but station routing errors placed them beautifully in my lap.<words>118</words>
Tonight's delivery was strangest: a doll head with blinking eyes, optical circuits winking hello in the dark.<words>135</words>
According to the manifest, the head belonged to a ceremonial golem that guided ancestral recordkeepers.<words>150</words>
An accidental heirloom, just waiting for someone exceptionally usual to misuse it creatively.<words>163</words>
I wired the head into the dusty navigation mainframe and whispered, "Show me forgotten roots of orbit soil."<words>181</words>
Its eyes blinked star-chart patterns, revealing secret agrarian coordinates my ancestors had written in photons centuries ago.<words>198</words>
Somewhere between Mars and the auctioneer's desk lay unregistered cropland, enough to cancel the sale if reclaimed.<words>215</words>
But accessing it required a navigation spell far beyond my middling syllabus.<words>227</words>
So I decided to trap my weakness itself.<words>235</words>
I set the autopilot to loop a complex route, then chained myself to a feedback chair rigged with dullshock capacitors.<words>255</words>
Every time my concentration slipped, the capacitors zapped a reminder, annoying but not harmful, provoking bored excitement into focused fervor.<words>275</words>
The doll head served as sarcastic coach, its eyelids flickering Morse insults whenever I mumbled incantations incorrectly.<words>292</words>
Hours blurred until a final surge of clarity unfolded like sunrise over rusted panels.<words>306</words>
I spoke the coordinates with confident cadence, and the station's engines rumbled, aligning toward the hidden farms.<words>323</words>
Green holograms blossomed across the control boards, proof of legal ownership encoded in electromagnetic filigree.<words>338</words>
With that evidence, the sale planetside would collapse under its own fraudulent paperwork.<words>351</words>
Still, I felt the old inertia lurking, whispering that tomorrow I'd revert to mediocrity.<words>365</words>
So I opened one last misdelivered crate and found a velvet curtain labeled simply "For The Revelation".<words>382</words>
I hung the curtain before the viewport, then, with ceremonial flourish, pulled its cord to unveil my reclaimed horizon.<words>401</words>
Sunrise light exploded through the fabric, setting the doll eyes flashing gold, and for once the sparks around my fingers outshone them.<words>423</words>
Limitation had walked straight into the snare I built from boredom, misdeliveries, and exceptionally usual diligence.<words>439</words>
The station turned, the farmland awaited, and my heritage, no longer misplaced, blinked alive like the doll's steady gaze.<words>458</words>
