The cashier snapped off the fluorescent light, rolled coins into the till, and silence unfurled.<words>15</words>
In that hush after a cashier closes out the register, Lira felt the doorway loosen.<words>30</words>
She was a subtle illusionist, casually intense, practiced at walking where concrete turns weightless.<words>44</words>
Tonight her steps climbed invisible stairs rising from the shop roof into the milk-grey altitude.<words>59</words>
There, among drifting pews of vapor, slept the temple in the clouds.<words>71</words>
Its bells were icicles, ringing whenever the wind remembered forgotten hymns.<words>82</words>
Lira unclipped an unmarked binder clip from her coat pocket and freed a folded lace.<words>97</words>
The antique lace pattern looked harmless, tea-stained, fraying like a grandmother's joke.<words>109</words>
Yet each hole, knotted with patience, nested instructions too shy for ink.<words>121</words>
She breathed on the lace, and invisible letters steamed across the stitches.<words>133</words>
They read: Rekindle what endures, for the understory grows beneath every flourish of light.<words>147</words>
The phrase trembled through her ribs like dawn humming through shutters.<words>158</words>
Long ago Lira had bartered her own heart-language for applause loud enough to hide sorrow.<words>173</words>
Now the applause had faded, but the sorrow stayed, politely clapping alone.<words>185</words>
To learn the language of the heart again had become her quietly roaring wish.<words>199</words>
She stepped beneath the temple's central oculus, where moonlight fell like patient instruction.<words>212</words>
Following the lace's woven map, she placed the unmarked binder clip upon the bell floor.<words>227</words>
Metal met ice, and a soft spark flared, blue as bedtime stories.<words>239</words>
Illusions had always obeyed her fingers, but now they uncoiled from hidden roots.<words>252</words>
Mist thickened into silhouettes of every spectator she once dazzled, wearing expressions she never read.<words>267</words>
Their smiles were bright, yet edges drooped, as though applause had tired them too.<words>281</words>
Lira's chest ached with doleful cheer, half grief, half relieved recognition.<words>292</words>
She whispered, and the silhouettes answered in pulses, not words, brushing her pulse like wings.<words>307</words>
She realized the heart spoke only in feelings that outlived sentences, echoing beneath conversation.<words>321</words>
To listen, she must let the understory grow, letting roots speak upward through bark.<words>335</words>
She closed her eyes and let the temple floor fall away, revealing a garden of suspended saplings.<words>352</words>
Leaf whisper overlapped bell chime, making a grammar without syntax yet perfectly clear.<words>365</words>
Through those tones, she finally deciphered the first syllable of love: humility.<words>377</words>
A warmth threaded her veins, delicate but enduring, as though lace had turned to arterial fire.<words>393</words>
She gathered the binder clip, now glowing, and promised to return whenever applause threatened honesty.<words>408</words>
Descending toward the dark city, she carried doleful cheer like a lantern made of silence.<words>423</words>
Behind her, the temple bells melted, raining music that only listening hearts could hear.<words>437</words>
