In the fungal orchard fed by luminescent slime molds, Queen Aralune wandered amid towering toadstool trunks.<words>16</words>
The once radiant monarch was now a disenchanted queen, her silken scepticism rustling like brittle leaves.<words>32</words>
She had come in the hush right before a new invention was revealed to the courtly astronomers.<words>49</words>
That invention, rumor said, could distill constellations into cupfuls of prophecy, yet something muffled the skies tonight.<words>66</words>
Aralune understood the muffling as the cosmic hush—an unseen seal she meant to crack open.<words>81</words>
Her motivation burned quietly, a timidly bold ember nestled beneath layers of ceremonial doubt.<words>95</words>
To plan, she consulted forgotten wind chimes dangling from a warped arch of fungus, their tubes mute with spores.<words>114</words>
Every chime corresponded to a dream she had once sacrificed for duty, now remembered only as metallic stains.<words>132</words>
She retrieved those memories by retrieving scraps from a dream journal sewn into the lining of her cloak.<words>150</words>
Pages were missing, devoured by slime mold tendrils that glowed like patient lanterns among the roots.<words>166</words>
Where language had rotted, sketches of sacrifice remained: a crown flung into darkness, a child given to stars.<words>184</words>
The echo of sacrifice rippled through her ribs, each beat urging an action more drastic than counsel allowed.<words>202</words>
So she rehearsed organized disorder, arranging the orchard's capering mushrooms into a spiral of calculated chaos.<words>218</words>
When midnight's second hush descended, she would hurl the wind chimes into the spiral's heart.<words>233</words>
The collision of metal and fungus, she believed, would summon vibrations strong enough to fracture silence itself.<words>250</words>
As minutes oozed like syrupy spores, Aralune listened to distant trumpets heralding the inventor’s approach toward the pavilion.<words>268</words>
Each brassy note pressed her nerves tighter, yet made her conviction expand, timidly bold as sprouting mycelia.<words>285</words>
Finally the predicted hush thickened, a velvet pause before revelation, and the orchard’s shadows leaned in expectation.<words>302</words>
Aralune exhaled the last of her fear and hurled the forgotten wind chimes into the luminous vortex she had plotted.<words>322</words>
Metal clanged against soft caps, releasing spores that shimmered, then rang again, but the second sound came from nowhere visible.<words>342</words>
It was the echo of sacrifice amplified, a resonant answer to every offering etched in her ragged journal.<words>360</words>
Air tore like parchment, and a fissure of starlight split the hush, pulsing in sync with Aralune's trembling heartbeat.<words>379</words>
From that rupture drifted voices of sidelined constellations, thanking the queen for remembering the cost of dreams.<words>396</words>
The inventor arrived beneath the torn sky, gears sparkling on his cloak, only to witness silence bleeding into melody.<words>415</words>
His device, unneeded now, drooped in his grasp, while the queen, crowned by motes of broken quiet, stepped toward uncharted sound.<words>436</words>
Organized disorder had awakened the orchard and opened the cosmos, and Aralune smiled, her disenchantment finally carrying a tune.<words>455</words>
