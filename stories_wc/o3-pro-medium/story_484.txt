The lull inside the chanting blockade drifted over the ruined estate like a held breath.<words>15</words>
In that hush, a groggy brewer named Ellis stumbled toward the haunted mansion graveyard, searching for caffeine and conviction.<words>34</words>
He claimed his ale was protest fuel, but his deeper thirst was to become a living embodiment of one's values.<words>54</words>
Flippant solemnity clung to him the way last night's hops clung to his beard.<words>68</words>
The protestors regrouped at the distant gates, their murmurs rolling back like a tide promising fresh slogans.<words>85</words>
Ellis figured he'd rejoin once his head stopped fizzing like an overcarbonated vat.<words>98</words>
Ahead, moonlight painted the mausoleums with a uniquely generic glow, as though the architect feared originality might offend ghosts.<words>117</words>
On a cracked plinth lay a single piece of a broken mirror, catching what light remained.<words>133</words>
Ellis lifted it, seeing not his ragged face but the encroaching darkness behind him.<words>147</words>
The reflection writhed like stout fermenting too long, threatening to overflow the glassy shard.<words>161</words>
Instinct told him to drop it, yet purpose bubbled louder: initiate something brave before the slogans returned.<words>178</words>
He recalled an old brewer's superstitionâ€”that malt, mirror, and moon could seal any creeping rot.<words>193</words>
So Ellis followed the staircase spiraling from the crypt door, dust puffing under each uncertain step.<words>209</words>
Halfway down, the slightest discoloration on the dusty spiral staircase revealed a handprint darker than shadow.<words>225</words>
That stain pulsed, and Ellis understood the method: via the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase, he could speak to whatever brooded below.<words>249</words>
He pressed the broken mirror piece against the mark, creating a dull chime like bottles toasting in a cellar.<words>268</words>
The darkness answered, spilling stories of hypocrisy, abandoned pledges, and watered-down principles ready to drown the world.<words>285</words>
Ellis laughed, a bark of barley-scented defiance, then spoke with flippant solemnity.<words>297</words>
'I am both brewer and brew,' he declared, 'and I won't let stale darkness dilute my recipe for justice.'<words>316</words>
His words foamed inside the stairwell, pushing the shadows back as if by carbonation alone.<words>331</words>
The handprint lightened, turning beer-amber, then flaked away like spent yeast.<words>342</words>
Ellis pocketed the mirror shard, climbed out, and found the protest's voices swelling again beyond the wrought-iron fence.<words>360</words>
This time he felt clear, almost sober, though his gait still zigzagged like a drunk line of verse.<words>378</words>
He raised the shard toward the crowd, letting it flash warning and promise in equal measure.<words>394</words>
Behind him, mausoleum doors slammed, sealing the encroaching darkness like a keg finally corked.<words>408</words>
Ellis strode to rejoin the chant, intent on pouring his newly fortified spirit into every resonating syllable.<words>425</words>
