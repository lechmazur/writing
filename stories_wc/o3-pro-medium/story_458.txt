The abandoned spaceport baggage claim echoed with lost announcements when Captain Myrren, pilot of the flying library Archivalis, drifted in on silent antigravs. <words>23</words>
He came seeking a single suitcase rumored to contain the bridge to unity, a manuscript older than the stellar republic itself. <words>44</words>
The library’s turbines hummed above, fractal sorrow in their chords, aware that every minute more stories dissolved in the cosmic dark. <words>65</words>
Myrren himself practiced a spiritually secular rite: reading the future in coffee stains dripped on decommissioned boarding passes. <words>83</words>
Spread across a carousel belt frozen mid-spin, the stains now resembled continental maps cracking under drought. <words>99</words>
He traced them, whispering phonemes of ink, until a pattern declared that one object here must be obliterated or tradition would perish. <words>121</words>
Moments later, a detached coat button rolled from under a dusty bench, ticking like a forgotten chronometer. <words>138</words>
The button belonged, legend said, to the last archivist who answered yes when the universe had asked whether knowledge should remain free. <words>160</words>
That simple yes or its opposite no could still change everything in a single second, resonating through every data spiral. <words>180</words>
But the coffee stains insisted that the button now tipped the balance toward censorship, a microgram of denial disguised as nostalgia. <words>201</words>
To preserve the fading tradition of unrestricted reading, Myrren lifted the button with metal tongs and placed it beneath the library’s plasma nozzle. <words>224</words>
He hesitated, remembering the archivist’s smile, the warmth of shared constellations, and the price unity often charges its builders. <words>243</words>
Up in the cockpit, a mechanical bell chimed, counting down the second granted by prophecy for decisive obliteration. <words>261</words>
Myrren whispered, "Knowledge must breathe," and squeezed the trigger; ion fire reduced the button to vapor that smelled faintly of cedar shelves. <words>283</words>
The carousel lurched, spinning again, and the lost suitcase surfaced like a buoy, its lock clicking open in quiet gratitude. <words>303</words>
Inside lay pages bound in star-silk, titled "The Bridge to Unity," promising collective freedom through fiercely individual voices. <words>321</words>
As Myrren uploaded the text into the ship’s auroral stacks, the turbines harmonized, sorrow unfolding into recursive hope across the station’s hollow halls. <words>344</words>
From the vapor of the button, a spectrum ghost of the archivist bowed, relieved, before dissipating into the circuitry, its mission complete. <words>366</words>
Outside the loading bay door, dawn over the asteroid’s horizon spelled unreadable glyphs in orange frost, and Myrren vowed never again to hesitate. <words>389</words>
The flying library ascended, trailing ribbons of ion light that stitched a bridge across vacuum, uniting scattered minds who listened for its song. <words>412</words>
