The steady gravedigger paused before the reimagined ancient Aztec temple jutting from the desert dust. <words>15</words>
He arrived during the hush that follows a sudden confession, though no priest stood to absolve him. <words>32</words>
Minutes earlier an archeologist had blurted that the sarcophagus held living blood, then fled in terror. <words>48</words>
Where others heard raucous silence, the gravedigger sensed invitation. <words>57</words>
He unpacked his vintage magnifying glass, its brass rim nicked from centuries of clandestine burials. <words>72</words>
Light poured through the temple's aperture, refracted in the lens, and painted glyphs across the sand like restless ghosts. <words>91</words>
The images overlapped, worlds folding upon worlds, until feathers sprouted from carved stone serpents. <words>105</words>
This was when worlds overlap, he muttered, recalling tales whispered by graveyard owls. <words>118</words>
His motive remained firm: to preserve ritual practices that balanced life and death since smoking mirrors first gleamed. <words>136</words>
The modern scholars only sought headlines, but he carried the covenant in calloused palms. <words>150</words>
Kneeling, he pressed ear to lintel and listened through the hush of wind passing a broken fence line beyond the dig site. <words>172</words>
Each gust spelled syllables the magnifying glass translated into shimmering Nahuatl above the altar. <words>186</words>
They instructed him to kindrelize the restless, forging kinship so memory would not rot with flesh. <words>202</words>
Obedient yet diligently whimsical, he chuckled, knowing whimsy keeps hands steady when stitching families of bone. <words>218</words>
He scattered obsidian shards, each reflecting dawn although the sky remained night-black inside the temple. <words>233</words>
Reflections merged with feathered shadows, birthing translucent mourners who once built these stones. <words>246</words>
He lifted the magnifying glass like a censer, and its focused beam drew the spirits into sharp relief. <words>264</words>
They shimmered, overlapping the mortal diggers pacing outside, and the temple seemed to breathe with two chests. <words>281</words>
Through raucous silence, the gravedigger spoke, his voice a shovel striking granite under moonlight. <words>295</words>
Let stone remember, let blood sleep, let soil be our mutual cradle, he declared. <words>309</words>
The spirits answered with a sigh that rattled the broken fence line and scattered sand like applause. <words>326</words>
Worlds sealed along that breath, and the archeologist outside felt only a calming of his frantic heart. <words>343</words>
Inside, the gravedigger gathered his tools, certain the covenant now lay safe among multiplied realities. <words>358</words>
He walked out as dawn finally broke, the hush lifting while birds argued about nothing at all. <words>375</words>
Behind him the temple settled, diligently whimsical in its secrecy, a triumphant monument to kindrelized worlds. <words>391</words>
The gravedigger smiled, hearing the raucous silence echo forever between footfalls across the awakening sands. <words>406</words>
