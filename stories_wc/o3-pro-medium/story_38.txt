I have not slept for seventy hours, yet ink still beads on my fingertips like midnight dew, because I am the subway's resident insomniac poet. <words>25</words>
Between stops where steel screams and lights stutter, I scrawl cramped verses onto ticket stubs, hunting a silence that might finally hush my skull. <words>49</words>
Tonight, a woman in a velvet coat presses a box of wilted botanical samples into my palm, her eyes clouded like abandoned greenhouses. <words>72</words>
Take them, she whispers, warnings in whispers, every petal a map of what the city tries to bury. <words>90</words>
Before I can reply, the doors hiss, she vanishes, and the carriage lurches toward the next dark throat of track. <words>110</words>
I cling to the box until my stop, then follow an impulse as brittle as old station posters, climbing to the haunted attic of the shuttered museum above. <words>138</words>
Curators fled decades ago, but their meticulously messy catalogues, broken mannequins, and echoing dust remain, a kingdom of empty abundance waiting to be misread. <words>162</words>
I set the samples beneath a skylight where moonlight sputters through boarded slats, and I listen, imagining chlorophyll rehearsing tragedies too quiet for daylight. <words>186</words>
The attic answers with breaths not my own, syllables knitted from floorboard groans that say eliminate nothing, translate everything. <words>205</words>
I remember after-parties where publishers drown awards in gin; I remember poets spilling secrets via drunken confessions at after-parties until dawn scrubbed them sober. <words>229</words>
Their boasts of brawls, bitter feuds, and canceled hearts always felt hollow, yet their hangovers birthed the same violent metaphors I mailed to magazines. <words>253</words>
Now, surrounded by spectral curators and pollen ghosts, I want to discover the power of non-violence, to compost aggression into gentler nouns. <words>275</words>
So I open my notebook, tear out every stanza that worships blades, and shred them into the box, fertilizing the brittle leaves with yesterday's rage. <words>300</words>
A breeze impossible on the fourth floor turns pages and lifts husks of petals until they hover like hesitant fireflies between rafters. <words>322</words>
They whisper again: we are enough when allowed to wilt, we are warnings in whispers, we are roots refusing to strangle the soil that feeds us. <words>348</words>
The message rings brittle but clear, and my pulse slows as though soothed by unplayed lullabies riding the tunnels below. <words>368</words>
When the subway rumbles under the building, I know only seconds separate one station from the next, yet within that pause I feel years bloom and fall, harmless as paper snow. <words>399</words>
I descend the stairwell carrying nothing but the emptied box, already planning to gift its space to another sleepless stranger between subway stops. <words>422</words>
The night is still awake, and so am I, but the clamor inside my chest stands quietly, eliminated by whispers, radiant in its new vacancy. <words>447</words>
