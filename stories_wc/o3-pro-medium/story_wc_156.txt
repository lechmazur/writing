Dawn found Ada Reyes kneeling before a crumbling sea-green mural inside the Sound Wave Garden. [15]  
She was the city's most vivid mural restorer, equal parts chemist, historian, and street magician. [30]  
Her reputation came not only from skill but from a methodically playful spirit that charmed skeptics. [46]  
Today, though, she carried a stranger commission than repairing flaked pigment. [57]  
The city council wanted the dormant acoustics of the garden revived for next week's solstice concert. [73]  
Rumor said the original architect tuned every curve so echoes painted invisible flowers across the air. [89]  
Ada believed art and sound were cousins sharing a restless heartbeat, so she accepted. [103]  
She unpacked solvents, tiny brushes, and a battered coin—a hobo nickel her grandfather had carved. [118]  
Its altered profile of Liberty wore goggles and grinned like someone who'd already heard tomorrow's secrets. [134]  
Ada used the coin as a talisman when puzzles threatened to calcify into certainties. [148]  
Certainty, she felt, was a cage built from answers at the cost of better questions. [163]  
Her true motive for accepting the commission was to exchange certainty for curiosity on a citywide scale. [180]  
She scraped decayed varnish, humming scales that bounced from wall to wall like polite gremlins. [195]  
Each note returned slightly changed, as if the garden were correcting her pitch with editorial laughter. [211]  
She recognized the pattern from her grandparent's stories about nested awakenings. [222]  
Wake the paint, wake the stone, wake the silence, then wake yourself, they had said. [237]  
Ada took the instruction literally, deciding to bewitch the garden through reflected sound. [250]  
She pressed the hobo nickel against the mural's throat-shaped alcove and whispered a question: "Where do echoes sleep?" [268]  
Then she waited, holding her breath. [274]  
In the pause between question and reply, the world thinned like ice under midday sun. [289]  
Sound seemed to kneel, folding obediently around her boots. [298]  
From the alcove emerged a tone mirrored from her whisper but colored with antique brass. [313]  
It ricocheted among the sculpted hedges, rebounded off marble benches, and returned wearing overtones of sea gulls. [330]  
The answer arrived inside that returning chord: "Deep in your waiting." [341]  
Ada felt a shiver, uncertain whether the words were hers, the garden's, or something between. [356]  
The mural's pigments brightened as if the original blues and vermilions heard their own names again. [372]  
She realized the restoration required more dialogue than solvent. [381]  
So she asked another question, striking the nickel against stone to produce a clear ping. [396]  
"What do you want in exchange for awakening?" [404]  
The returning echoes split into chords, then into whispering syllables that seemed to blossom from the air. [421]  
"Loose the city's certainty," they sang, "and we will gift you living murals of curiosity." [436]  
Ada laughed, not with mockery but recognition. [443]  
Her own private motive echoed perfectly in the garden's demand. [453]  
So began the true restoration, a sequence of nested awakenings spiraling outward. [465]  
First she woke the paint by applying glazes whose molecules resonated with specific frequencies. [479]  
Each brushstroke accompanied a corresponding hum she produced by tapping the nickel against crystal beakers. [494]  
Reflected sound bounced between pigment and wall, weaving invisible stitches that sealed centuries of cracks. [509]  
Next she woke the stone benches by drumming them with mallets tuned to subterranean harmonics. [524]  
The benches shuddered, shaking off moss like blankets tossed from half-roused sleepers. [536]  
Finally she woke the silence itself, standing in the garden's center and waiting without breath. [551]  
The pause between question and reply stretched until it felt primordial. [562]  
When she exhaled, the released air carried every unanswered riddle she'd hoarded since childhood. [576]  
The garden inhaled those riddles and exhaled a mist shimmering with images no eye had seen. [592]  
Murals erupted across hedges, pathways, even clouds, each shifting whenever someone tried to name it. [607]  
Certainty became impossible; only curiosity could keep pace with the changing art. [619]  
News of the miracle spread, and citizens flocked, asking the garden questions just to taste the interval before answers. [638]  
Within those pauses, they heard their own hearts reflected, bewitching them into deeper wonder. [652]  
Ada watched, twirling the hobo nickel between chalk-streaked fingers, satisfied that the exchange was complete. [667]  
Yet even she felt a fresh ripple of questions rising, like new rooms opening inside an already vast house. [686]  
She understood that awakenings were doors arranged inside one another, and curiosity always held the next key. [703]  
So she pocketed the coin, stepped beneath a singing archway, and listened for the following question. [719]
