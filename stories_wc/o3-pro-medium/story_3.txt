The tide ghosted over cracked anchors in the sailor's graveyard, where a surly watchman kept restless vigil. <words>17</words>
It was a night poised between seasons, neither winter's hush nor spring's chatter willing to declare dominion. <words>34</words>
Such in-between weather draped the graveyard in dignified chaos, gull cries weaving solemn hymns with drunken winds. <words>51</words>
Rope lantern in hand, the watchman walked a serenely frantic circuit, pretending purpose while courting revelation. <words>67</words>
His true motive, concealed like rum beneath a captain's coat, was to understand cosmic patterns the sea hinted at. <words>86</words>
Years ago an elder net-maker had taught him a traditional craft: knotting yarn into mnemonic constellations. <words>102</words>
The elder claimed market wisdom resided not only in prices but in the way currents bartered with moonlight. <words>120</words>
Decode those trades, he had said, and you would riddle open the ledger of the stars themselves. <words>137</words>
Now the watchman removed from his pocket a short piece of yarn, frayed yet faithful to silent instruction. <words>155</words>
Between two toppled figureheads he knelt, looping the yarn around rusted nails as sailors once looped stories around tavern tables. <words>175</words>
Each loop echoed a merchant proverb--buy low tide, sell high tide--binding commerce and cosmos into slipping knots. <words>192</words>
Storm clouds flickered green, approving or perhaps negotiating, and his heart beat a serenely frantic drum in response. <words>210</words>
He spoke the riddle the elder bequeathed: 'What profits the trader who never returns, yet fills every harbor?' <words>228</words>
Echoes of drowned crewmates whispered through cleats, answering, 'Memory, for no taxman can seize a tale well told.' <words>246</words>
Satisfied, the watchman tugged the yarn's final knot, and the constellation unfurled like a ledger balanced to zero. <words>264</words>
Lines of firefly phosphorescence aligned with the knotwork, sketching a grand circle that swallowed horizon and sky. <words>281</words>
Within the circle swam patterns--tides, prices, heartbeats--rising and falling under invisible lunar auctions. <words>294</words>
He saw that scarcity was merely a shadow of rotation, abundance a pause in the orbit of need. <words>312</words>
The realization struck him like salt spray: market wisdom and cosmic patterns were the same capricious ledger, only scaled differently. <words>332</words>
He laughed, a gravelly sound polished by wind, and the graveyard buoys clanged approval in dignified chaos. <words>349</words>
Yet wisdom is freight, and freight demands delivery, so he folded the yarn into his logbook for tomorrow's auction. <words>368</words>
The circle of light dimmed, leaving constellations to resume their ordinary disguises as scattered prices across a nocturnal ledger. <words>387</words>
Morning would bring cost, but tonight he bore profit: the answer to a riddle older than any port. <words>405</words>
He resumed his patrol, surly as ever yet glowing within, a watchman balancing storms and silence between seasons. <words>423</words>
