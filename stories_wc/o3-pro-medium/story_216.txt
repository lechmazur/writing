After the last library card gets returned to the desk in the floating bibliotheca of Cloud City, the air hushes expectantly. <words>21</words>
I, Marcus Vale, professional scapegoat for hire, arrive exactly then, because silence is the only receptionist I trust. <words>39</words>
My newest client demanded anonymity so severe that they left no name, only a sun-bleached envelope containing a single metal washer. <words>60</words>
The washer's inner rim is etched with spirals resembling sacred symbols I have hunted for across a dozen nations in quiet, obsessive calm. <words>83</words>
My motivation tonight is to decode those spirals, to refashion mystery into meaning before someone decides I should bleed for their mistakes. <words>105</words>
The job, like every other, is contracted through cryptic phone calls at midnight that never last longer than the tolling of twelve drones. <words>128</words>
A velvet voice instructs me to ascend to Stateroom Nimbus-Eighteen, leave the washer on its balcony, and await absolution. <words>147</words>
I comply, for compliance is the slipknot that keeps a scapegoat's neck robustly delicate. <words>161</words>
Cloud City corridor lights glow soft pearl, hiding ceramic cameras shaped like doves, watching me without mercy and without contempt. <words>181</words>
I pass the closed reading rooms where scholars once abandoned identity after drowning in mythic incantations, their leftover masks stacked like wilted roses. <words>204</words>
Inside Nimbus-Eighteen, mist curls around brass railings, and the balcony hangs over an endless swirl of storm, offering neither up nor down. <words>226</words>
I place the washer on a marble plinth, aligning the etched spirals with the city's polar lightning, exactly as the unvoiced diagrams suggested. <words>249</words>
A distant chime echoes, and suddenly every holographic billboard across Cloud City flickers into the same sigil that slithered along the washer's rim. <words>272</words>
I jot the pattern inside my memory, knowing tomorrow I will be blamed for hijacking the citywide grid, yet the blame will buy me time. <words>297</words>
Time is the only currency my profession cannot invoice, so I hoard it like contraband oxygen. <words>313</words>
The velvet voice calls again, softer, telling me the decoding is incomplete until I refashion the symbols into a confession the city can swallow. <words>337</words>
In obsessive calm I reply that confessions require sinners, and sinners require names, but names were the first thing this cloud-bound sanctuary learned to shed. <words>362</words>
Static mutters back, finishing the call with coordinates pointing to the city's abandoned identity registry, decommissioned after the last revolution left everyone unclaimed. <words>385</words>
I walk there under drizzling starlight, unlock rusted drawers, and slide the washer inside a folder marked ZERO, feeling the machinery of blame click shut. <words>410</words>
By dawn, the sigils will resolve across every screen, the city will indict the empty name in that folder, and my robustly delicate neck will stay free another day. <words>439</words>
Somewhere beneath the clouds, truth keeps turning like a washer in a storm drain, small, patient, and indestructibly round. <words>458</words>
