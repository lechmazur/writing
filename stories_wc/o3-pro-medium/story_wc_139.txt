Formaldehyde mist hung like philosophy in the funeral home prep room as Mara balanced on a stool, polishing a vintage ink pot that once belonged to her father. [28]  
He had been the capital's most notorious con artist, yet she, his honest child, now served corpses instead of swindling the living. [50]  
During slow nights she whispered to the ink pot, hunting equations that could balance gain and loss, the mathematics of a fair trade her father never achieved. [77]  
Tonight was not slow. [81]  
Agent Corvus from the Interior Ministry wheeled in a zipped bag bearing the insignia of the ousted Blue Cabinet, and locked the steel door behind him. [107]  
His gray eyes carried deathly vitality, bright as if fevered by possibility. [119]  
"We need a discrete prep," he said, unzipping the sack to reveal a living man bound and gagged, twitching like an unreleased theorem. [142]  
The captive wore the Blue Cabinet seal on a ring: Minister of Equitable Exchange, rumored missing after yesterday's breach of Parliament. [163]  
Mara knew asylum seekers sometimes traveled through morgues, disguised as cadavers to cross checkpoints, but no one had ever arrived breathing. [184]  
"Political asylum?" she mouthed, and the minister nodded, eyes pleading for logic stronger than terror. [199]  
Corvus slid papers across the embalming table: a confession forged by Mara's father years ago in the same ink pot, now to be repurposed as the minister's death certificate. [228]  
"Sign and stamp it, girl, or the next bag will hold you," Corvus hissed. [242]  
Mara's pulse scrawled proofs against her ribs, measuring fear versus value, looking for a fair trade that preserved two integrities: hers and the minister's. [266]  
She remembered her father's maxim: a con fails when the mark stops believing motion can liquefy rigid thinking. [284]  
So she moved, but only inside, waiting actively like water eroding stone, letting Corvus grow impatient. [300]  
Minutes passed heavy with chemical fragrance, and Corvus finally yanked the ink pot from her hands, splashing ancient black across the white shroud. [323]  
"Useless heirloom," he snarled, unscrewing his own pen, unaware that the pot's inside lip housed a sliver of glass she had loosened each night for weeks. [349]  
She had studied angles enough to know it would fall at ninety degrees when shaken, breaching skin exactly where power forgets itself. [371]  
The shard dropped, kissed Corvus's wrist, and a red signature blossomed more honest than any ink. [387]  
He recoiled, swore, and Mara seized the moment to pull the minister behind the refrigeration units. [403]  
Cold coils inhaled and exhaled like distant surf, covering their breaths as Corvus fumbled for gauze. [419]  
Mara whispered her plan: they would exit as two corpses scheduled for incineration, security tags already printed for morning transfer. [439]  
The minister objected that such deceit violated fair exchange, but she countered that freedom carried incalculable interest owed by corrupt states. [460]  
"I will settle the ledger later," she promised, feeling the deathly vitality of her own heartbeat argue that sometimes debts live longer than people. [484]  
They zipped themselves into fresh body bags, leaving the ink pot visible on the table like an open variable daring Corvus to solve it. [508]  
Hidden darkness offered time, and time was her chosen method: by waiting actively she allowed events to calcify around a gap only she could move through. [534]  
When the morning crew arrived, alarms shrieked as sensors found no pulse in Corvus's body, slumped by the table, bled into the spilled ink. [558]  
Throughout the building doors unlocked automatically for the scheduled transfer, and two tagged bags glided on trolleys past confused guards who saw only institutional routine. [583]  
Outside, sunlight refracted on frost, splitting into spectrums of possibility as Mara and the minister were loaded into the waiting van of a humanitarian league. [608]  
Their destination was a coast where neutral ships granted political asylum to anyone who could prove government violence, and Corvus's blood would testify elegantly. [632]  
Mara inhaled the sterile air of her bag and, in the quiet, calculated exchange rates: one life surrendered for two lives protected, interest payable in future justice. [659]  
The numbers balanced imperfectly, but the world, she realized, was a problem set that only liquefied rigid thinking could solve. [679]  
She pictured the vintage ink pot waiting back in the prep room, still half full, a small black sea where new equalities might yet be written. [705]  
For now, though, she and the minister lay still, practicing the art of motionless flight toward fairer shores. [723]
