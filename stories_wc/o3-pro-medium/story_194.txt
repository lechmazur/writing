Bastien Fir, a spirited lumberjack with calloused palms and a philosopher's grin, pedaled his squeaky touring bicycle toward the Bone & Marrow, the ancient ossuary turned gourmet restaurant that loomed over the river cliffs.<words>34</words>
Every marrow-scented shift he worked there was another leg of a larger journey he traced throughout bike rides skirting forests he once felled.<words>57</words>
He had come not for cuisine but to learn healing traditions whispered to persist in the crushed dust of venerable bones.<words>78</words>
The maitre d', a gracefully awkward archivist named Pallas, hired him to split beech logs for the smoker yet seemed to study Bastien more than the flames.<words>105</words>
One dusk, while scrubbing resin from his beard, Bastien found a coded letter from a future war folded inside a hollow femur delivered with the day's marrow.<words>132</words>
Symbols marched across the parchment like bayonets, yet a line flared in his mind: "Revamp the menu, or cities will burn again."<words>154</words>
The threat felt absurd, so he carried the bone to Pallas, expecting laughter.<words>167</words>
Instead, Pallas paled, closed the kitchen doors, and unlocked a reliquary of salt-bright skulls revealing innumerable hidden agendas chiseled on their vaulted interiors.<words>190</words>
Pallas confessed the restaurant was a clandestine council where timelines gnawed one another like sharks in broth, and the menu guided the bites.<words>213</words>
Every spice ratio, every smoke curl, determined which era's suffering might be eased.<words>226</words>
Bastien's chest hammered with harsh tenderness, a love for strangers yet unborn entwined with terror of cooking them into oblivion.<words>246</words>
That night his sleep splintered through reawakened nightmares of clear-cut forests screaming like children while artillery bloomed where trunks once stood.<words>267</words>
He rose before dawn, revamp plan blazing, and hauled cedar planks into the dining crypt.<words>282</words>
During service he replaced opulent marrow tartlets with humble forest broths, stirring in pine resin, spruce tips, and comfrey taught by hermit healers he had visited between loggings.<words>310</words>
Guests gagged, coughed, then, as steam cleared, cried quietly while old wounds on their knuckles faded like dusk-stung campfire embers.<words>330</words>
The bone letter's symbols re-arranged on the counter, now reading, "Balance begins, watch the wheels turn."<words>346</words>
Outside, bicycle messengers from rival futures circled the cobblestones, sniffing the air as if broth were radio static.<words>364</words>
Pallas urged caution, yet Bastien only strapped knives to his handlebars, feeling the gently brutal duty root deeper.<words>382</words>
Throughout bike rides that followed, he delivered jars of restorative broth to burned villages and bruised timelines, mending fear with smoky sap.<words>404</words>
Each pedal stroke whispered the felled trees' forgiveness and the ossuary's brittle blessing.<words>417</words>
Nightly he returned to the Bone & Marrow, tasting memories in stockpots, refining the recipe that could teach empires to feel pain before they caused it.<words>443</words>
His once lone mission to learn healing traditions had become a lumberjack's covenant with time, chopped open, sanded smooth, and offered like a table to whoever dared dine.<words>471</words>
He kept only a corner of the letter beneath his bicycle seat, a reminder that tenderness sharpens itself against threatened steel.<words>492</words>
