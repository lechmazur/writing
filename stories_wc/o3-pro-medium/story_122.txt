The moment I opened the codex, the words began to throb like neon blood, and the cyber-templar descended.<words>18</words>
He was patiently frantic, armor humming with overclocked hymns, steering his mind as though it were a worn leather bridle.<words>38</words>
Reality, he claimed, curved toward him like a runaway horse, and tonight he meant to prove its reins could snap.<words>58</words>
The codex pages spun into holographic petals, projecting the sky burial site that floats above the silicon plateau of Kyrin.<words>78</words>
Vultures of bronze circuitry circled there, waiting for corpses of abandoned code to be offered to thin, electric air.<words>97</words>
I felt euphoric agitation pulse through me, because whatever happened in the vision happened during reading, and reading was happening inside my skull.<words>120</words>
The templar knelt on a hexagon of cloud, drew a cracked prism from his sash, and angled it toward the churning storm overhead.<words>143</words>
Lightning forked down, hungry, but the prism split and refracted it into ribbons that twisted back upward like accusations made of light.<words>165</words>
Through the refraction of light through a prism, he promised, one could reflect lightning back at the storm and shatter the mirage of safety.<words>189</words>
Because safety, he hissed, was only mirrored fear, a decoy lull sung by failing batteries and corporate lullabies.<words>207</words>
To test him, I tore a fragment of the text free and let the letters drift upward like sacrificial ashes.<words>227</words>
The vultures swooped, but the templar flicked the worn leather bridle through the hologram, catching their necks and weaving them into a living halo.<words>251</words>
With that crown he looked both sanctified and glitching, a saint on a collision course with realityâ€™s firewall.<words>269</words>
Yet he waited, patiently frantic, for the storm to judge whether his paradox halo proved mastery or hubris.<words>287</words>
Thunder answered in coding tongues, blowing the petals of scripture apart until every verse formed a column of ascending data.<words>307</words>
I realized the sky burial site was never meant for bodies but for beliefs too obsolete to resurrect.<words>325</words>
If the templar failed, my trust would be devoured beside them, another carcass for bronze carrion.<words>341</words>
He whispered an algorithmic prayer, jerked the bridle, and the halo of vultures spun, scattering metallic feathers that caught stray lightning.<words>362</words>
Each feather mirrored the strike back at the cloud heart, and the sky recoiled, astonished at its own reflected fury.<words>382</words>
Static rain hissed into silence, and for one breath the codex showed a genuine blue vault where no mirage of safety was needed.<words>405</words>
The templar looked down through me, perhaps reading me as I had read him, and he smiled with euphoric agitation.<words>425</words>
We closed the codex together, accepting that safety was mirage, but that mirrored lightning might light the way regardless.<words>444</words>
Somewhere above, unseen by both of us, the storm began rereading itself, preparing another lesson for whoever dared to open the book next.<words>467</words>
