Salt still clung to my boots when I crossed the midway toward the abandoned carnival shooting gallery.<words>17</words>
I, Mara Velasquez, wreck-diver ghost whisperer, had come ashore to honor a family tradition of attending a specific event together, even if the event itself had died years ago.<words>46</words>
Tonight the rusted rifles and chipped porcelain ducks would stand in for the fireworks my cousins used to arouse cheers.<words>66</words>
Their echoes would be enough for remembrance.<words>73</words>
Yet I was here for more than memory; I sought to step out of the shadow of my legendary mother, Calypso Velasquez, whose whispers raised fleets of phantoms from seabeds.<words>103</words>
The carnival, landlocked and forgotten, felt safely beyond her surf-churned realm.<words>114</words>
Wind rattled tin ducks, shaking loose decades of dust like confetti too tired to shine.<words>129</words>
I unpacked my dive bag and placed a thumb-sized piece of amber with an insect inside on the splintered counter.<words>149</words>
The fossilized gnat had ridden with me through reefs, trenches, and midnights, a pocketed compass of trapped summer.<words>167</words>
It glowed now, feverish, as though the thawing heart of something ancient huddled just beneath its honey shell.<words>185</words>
I listened, because ghosts seldom start with words; they begin with temperature.<words>197</words>
A chill coiled up my sleeve, promptly contradicted by a warmth that felt joyfully melancholic, like laughing while packing funeral flowers.<words>218</words>
The insect’s prison pulsed brighter, and I realized the gnat was not the captive—its luminous grief was seeking to arouse me.<words>239</words>
Between the lines of a half-written letter tucked under the counter, a voice seeped, ink turning to mist.<words>257</words>
The letter, addressed simply to 'Darling Carnival,' apologized for abandoning it when the river rerouted trade and children’s dreams.<words>276</words>
Its author wanted one last game, one last shot, but their pen fell silent mid-sentence, mid-life.<words>292</words>
I loaded a marble under the gallery’s warped rifle sight, breathing the briny rhythm I used before plunging into wrecks.<words>312</words>
The gnat-light flared, painting targets with molten gold circles.<words>321</words>
I squeezed the trigger, and the marble rang against metal, a small rebellion echoing through booths and bone.<words>339</words>
Ducks toppled in domino procession, releasing a chorus of carnival spirits who smelled of popcorn and tarnished prizes.<words>357</words>
Their translucent smiles bowed toward the amber, then toward me, as if acknowledging that both of us were finally seen.<words>377</words>
I felt my mother’s distant tide recede from my lungs, leaving space for my own salt, my own song.<words>396</words>
The gallery’s lights, though broken, flickered awake for a heartbeat, then returned to darkness, a fleeting rebellion fulfilled.<words>414</words>
I pocketed the amber, now softly dim, and walked into dawn, certain the thawing heart would beat on its own.<words>434</words>
