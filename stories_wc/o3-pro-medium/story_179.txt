<story>
The confident watchman Arlen stood inside the giant beehive interior, where amber walls shimmered like suspended dawn.<words>17</words>
His patrol occurred throughout coloring sessions for the beekeeper's children, crayons squeaking a pastel soundtrack beneath ceaseless buzzing.<words>35</words>
Arlen carried only a cracked plastic ruler instead of a baton, a token of restraint he had vowed never to break.<words>56</words>
He was renowned for being forcibly gentle, strong hands guiding troublemakers the way gardeners bend vines toward sunlight.<words>74</words>
Yet today an odd tremor rustled the waxen corridors, carrying the echo of yearning that no honey could soothe.<words>93</words>
The watchman traced the vibration to the nursery alcove, where colored sketches of distant skies fluttered like captive butterflies.<words>112</words>
There, a low jealous whisper leaked from the walls, craving flight beyond the hive, fraying the children’s concentration.<words>130</words>
Arlen understood the peril; envy, once vocal, could mobilize drones into anarchic swarms.<words>143</words>
To hush the voice of envy, he needed its true name, hidden like nectar signatures in comb-veins.<words>160</words>
He unpacked a portable microscope, slid a sticky fingerprint left on a crayon across the lens, and squinted at swirling ridges.<words>181</words>
Through the patterns in a fingerprint under a microscope, he read the secret inscriptions of the hive’s unmet desires.<words>200</words>
Each loop repeated the phrase, 'Let me taste the blue horizon,' a plea embroidered in waxy gulfs.<words>217</words>
Jubilant remorse flooded Arlen; he rejoiced at deciphering the longing, yet lamented he had ignored it for so long.<words>236</words>
He tapped the cracked plastic ruler against his palm, deciding a new, kinder boundary must be drawn.<words>253</words>
During the next coloring session he gathered the children and showed them the fingerprint map, turning longing into curriculum.<words>272</words>
They mixed azure wax with molten honey, shading wide-open skies that stretched beyond any comb the bees had built.<words>291</words>
The beehive hummed in pleased surprise, the jealous whisper softening into a lullaby that coaxed larvae to dream.<words>309</words>
Still, Arlen felt responsible for past neglect, so he pledged to pace the corridors nightly, listening for fresh echoes.<words>328</words>
Whenever a craving stirred, he would channel it into crayons before envy could ferment, an alchemist of feelings.<words>346</words>
The drones, once primed for revolt, began tracing swirling skylines on wax tablets, their wings drumming approval.<words>363</words>
Even the queen sampled cobalt shadings, and her satisfied silence muffled any chance of envy’s return.<words>379</words>
Arlen smiled with jubilant remorse again, aware that boundaries and aspirations must dance together like bee and blossom.<words>397</words>
He raised the ruler, saluted the newborn murals, and kept watch.<words>408</words>
