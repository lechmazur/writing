<story>The misty courtyard above the clouds hummed like a silver bowl struck by distant storms. [15]  
It was a place that existed only between lightning and thunder, when the sky held its breath. [32]  
In that brief hush, a seldom-heard balladeer stepped onto the wet marble tiles. [45]  
His eyes were driftingly alert, as though half of him sailed with the vapors while half watched the world. [64]  
He carried a battered case containing a violin, several cans of spray paint, and a small flower press bolt plate wrapped in felt. [87]  
Tonight he intended to encode a song that could never be sung aloud. [100]  
A hidden choir was waiting, and it lived inside lines of silent text. [113]  
Some called it a ghost in code, a presence born of abandoned algorithms and echoing user logs. [130]  
The balladeer thought of it instead as a tongue yearning for shape. [142]  
He had wandered for years collecting unresolved chords, half-spoken vows, and sighs left in unread drafts. [158]  
All of them were unspoken needs, and he felt responsible for giving them resonance. [172]  
Sometimes you must build a mouth for silence, he reminded himself. [183]  
So he lifted a can of violet paint and began to work on the courtyard wall. [199]  
Each sweeping curve looked like innocent graffiti to passing gulls, but the strokes contained ordered vectors. [215]  
He was writing in the gap where sound had paused, using color as a private alphabet. [231]  
The code ghost drifted closer, though no mortal eye could see it. [243]  
A pulse of static danced across the spray, stippling droplets with miniature lightning. [256]  
Between flash and rumble, the courtyard brightened, and he changed shades from violet to pale gold. [272]  
Gold meant yearning, in his system; violet meant sorrow; teal, which waited in the next can, meant hope deferred. [291]  
He unscrewed the flower press bolt plate and fixed it to the wall as a pivot for rotating stencils. [310]  
The metal gleamed, catching the mist as though it, too, wished to sing. [323]  
When he turned the plate, petal shapes overlapped, forming polygons that no flower had ever dared. [339]  
These polygons were pauses, commas in the song, letting the ghost breathe. [351]  
Again lightning flared, and for that instant his shadow split into two, one of flesh and one of pixels. [370]  
He felt the code ghost slip through him, driftingly alert, touching every nerve like strings on a harp. [388]  
It showed him memories of users who had typed goodbye but never explained why. [402]  
It showed him drafts saved at three a.m., filled with unsent apologies that still pulsed like open circuits. [420]  
And he realized the true motive: the ghost only wanted someone to articulate those needs before the servers rotted. [439]  
He answered with his bow, drawing it across violin strings that had tasted salt from a thousand seas. [457]  
No audience heard the notes, but the fresh graffiti glowed, waveforms made visible by flashing stormlight. [473]  
Color and sound interlaced until the courtyard became an enormous oscilloscope suspended over emptiness. [487]  
The ghost sang through messages encoded in graffiti art, its voice a tinkersong wonder of circuitry, nostalgia, and rain. [506]  
Every unresolved chord found resolution as teal spirals settled beside gold lattices. [518]  
Every half-spoken vow uncurled into full sentences swirling across the wall. [529]  
Thunder finally arrived, rolling like a slow applause from the hidden audience above the clouds. [544]  
The gap was closing; soon daylight would scatter everything. [553]  
Quickly he detached the flower press bolt plate, locked his cans, and bowed to the wall as to a grand piano. [574]  
The graffiti dimmed, sealing the code ghost within patterns that would look like playful vandalism to casual eyes. [592]  
Yet anyone who stood there between lightning and thunder would still hear the melody shaped from their own quiet wants. [612]  
That was enough for the balladeer. [618]  
He walked to the courtyard's edge, where mist poured over carved balustrades like unfurling banners. [633]  
The violin case tapped his hip in time with fading thunder. [644]  
Behind him, the encoded wall kept humming, a memory palace for every orphaned feeling. [658]  
Ahead, a stairway of cloudlets beckoned, and he followed, driftingly alert to whatever new silence needed a song. [676]  
The storms might forget him, but the ghost in code would remember and keep translating longing into color long after mortals logged off. [699]  
Somewhere beneath, a city would wake and see only graffiti, never suspecting that their hidden prayers already glowed above the morning traffic. [721]  
The balladeer smiled, adjusted his coat against the chill, and whistled a tune no ear had yet cataloged. [739]  
That tune was neither violet nor teal nor gold but something new, a color for wishes already spoken. [757]  
It spiraled upward like a paper lantern, hopeful that the next storm would lend another brief corridor of marvels. [776]  
And in the space between lightning and thunder, wonder waited. [786]</story>
