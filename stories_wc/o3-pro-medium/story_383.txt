The Dark Matter Diner hovered at the midway of the interstellar carnival, serving quantum coffee to travelers who had a moment between rides.<words>23</words>
At his usual corner booth slumped General Calder Vox, a burnt-out strategist whose medals now clinked like loose change in an overcoat.<words>45</words>
He nursed a strip of dried seaweed instead of dinner, claiming its salt reminded him of planets he had once defended.<words>66</words>
Opposite him sat Dr. Kestrel Wey, a cognitive cartographer who mapped shared anxieties the way others traced star lanes.<words>85</words>
She flipped through black-and-white photographs, each capturing arcing silhouettes of two people embracing then recoiling, like emotional lightning between hemispheres.<words>105</words>
Their mission tonight, rationally absurd yet strategically sound, was to renew Vox's courage by exposing fear's flimsy monarchy.<words>123</words>
Wey believed the brain, when shown its own terror refracted via arcs in black-and-white photographs, would mutiny against panic.<words>142</words>
Vox snorted, a sound like faulty thrusters, but mischievous wisdom winked behind his bloodshot eyes.<words>157</words>
He slid his seaweed across the table, declaring that even rations could learn diplomacy if fear abdicated.<words>174</words>
Wey arranged the photographs in a spiral, each arc depicting soldiers, lovers, children, and tyrants confronting mirrored uncertainties.<words>192</words>
As the diner's neon flickered, the images seemed to animate, casting grayscale ghosts across Vox's fraying uniform.<words>209</words>
He watched himself within them: first as a cadet crying behind a bunker, then as a commander signing an armistice he feared.<words>231</words>
The rationally absurd part arrived when the photographs spoke in chorus, their voices flat like radio static but incontrovertibly his own.<words>252</words>
They accused him of letting fear sit where reason should, of decorating that throne with recycled slogans and military protocols.<words>272</words>
Vox laughed, a reluctant bark that startled a passing automaton waiter, and admitted he had grown comfortable polishing that seat.<words>292</words>
Wey tapped the final photograph, a blank rectangle waiting for exposure, and challenged him to fill it with something bolder.<words>312</words>
Outside, the carnival's gravity-flux rollercoaster rumbled; passengers screamed wonder, not doom, reminding him that courage often hides between rides.<words>331</words>
He stood up, straightened the medals he once despised, and declared his intention to dethrone fear from the throne of reason.<words>352</words>
The seaweed was ceremoniously pinned atop the photographs like a laurel, absurd yet rational, marking the abdication document.<words>370</words>
Together they stepped into the midway's starlit draught, ready to renew the cosmos one unafraid snapshot at a time.<words>389</words>
Behind them, the diner lights dimmed approvingly, as though darkness itself had signed the treaty.<words>404</words>
