The abandoned waiting area of the bombed-out railway station vibrated with a screaming silence no siren could penetrate. <words>18</words>
Graffiti ghosts glowed whenever the emergency generators hiccupped, sketching jagged halos around Alia, the city's most subdued vigilante. <words>36</words>
She entered the derelict lounge during virtual calls that corporate generals mistook for secure briefings, their faces flickering across shattered tablets. <words>57</words>
Alia's artfully clumsy gait—half stumble, half dance—left onlookers certain she posed no threat, a miscalculation she nurtured carefully. <words>75</words>
Her sole ornament, a plain wooden bead strung on frayed cord, knocked softly against metal chairs as she surveyed the near-dark. <words>96</words>
Inside its lacquerless grain hid the last scripture of the Spiral Blades, an ancient art she longed to master completely. <words>116</words>
Tonight, the scripture demanded she learn the cost of ending wars before they began, the true price of war itself. <words>136</words>
Alia unfolded an antique funhouse mirror scavenged from a carnival ruin and propped it against a cracked vending machine. <words>155</words>
By tracking distortions in an antique funhouse mirror, the Spiral Blades taught disciples to map hidden trajectories of power and guilt. <words>176</words>
Each ripple across the warped glass corresponded to a spoken lie within a hundred meters, and tonight the air rippled violently. <words>197</words>
The generals on the call planned to flatten three refugee blocks at dawn, then flatter shareholders with forged peace metrics by noon. <words>219</words>
Alia watched their pixelated bravado, the mirror blooming with bruised colors whenever a new euphemism camouflaged slaughter. <words>236</words>
She tightened the wooden bead between finger and thumb, feeling the indentations that matched ancient star charts only initiates could read. <words>257</words>
To strike now, the scripture warned, would spare children yet orphan futures elsewhere; war merely changed addresses unless debts were understood. <words>278</words>
Therefore she embraced the waiting area’s screaming silence, letting its stillness weigh heavier than any explosive. <words>294</words>
When the call paused for confidential caucus, Alia stepped into camera view, executed a wobbling bow so artfully clumsy the guards laughed. <words>316</words>
She spoke softly, offering to flatter their commanders with a commemorative dance she claimed would trend favorably on propaganda feeds. <words>336</words>
Permission granted, she spun with exaggerated missteps, palms brushing furniture, planting microreflectors precisely where the mirror’s distortions demanded. <words>354</words>
The reflectors bent the room’s light into the mirror, turning it into a throat of swirling horizons the generals could not parse. <words>376</words>
Within the glass they saw future casualty lists painted over their own faces, and their war-charts melted into personal ledgers of loss. <words>398</words>
Their voices fled, leaving only the waiting area's native hush, an indictment louder than artillery, a contract they finally recognized. <words>418</words>
Alia retrieved the bead, bowed again, and disappeared between stalled escalators, carrying with her both the scripture and its unanswered price. <words>439</words>
Behind her, the virtual call remained connected, but only screaming silence stared back at the commanders until dawn erased their screens. <words>460</words>
