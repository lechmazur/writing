Mist beaded on warped panes of the witch's greenhouse clinging to a hill of gravestones, muting dawn's reluctant glow. <words>19</words>
Inside, Bartholomew Quill, the uptight scribe of Eldergate, unrolled his parchment with the precision of a surgeon. <words>36</words>
He had marched here under protest, clutching a velvet satchel that concealed a dusty prototype light bulb from Tesla's workshop. <words>56</words>
The witch, Mistress Alderwing, cultivated orchids from lunar ashes and secrets from broken visitors, her reputation both dreaded and desired. <words>76</words>
Bartholomew's motive, to cradle empathy in arms of steel, rattled like loose quills within his otherwise orderly mind. <words>94</words>
The bulb was said to glow only when a soul accepted its own contradictions, a legend he found certainly uncertain yet irresistible. <words>116</words>
Mistress Alderwing demanded payment not in coin but in confession, and she would test his claim through a peculiar analytical rite. <words>137</words>
She thrust forward a cracked envelope, once sealed with royal wax, and ordered him to describe its sender by analyzing the leftover adhesive from a once-sealed envelope. <words>164</words>
Bartholomew adjusted his spectacles, inhaled composted moonflowers, and felt the greenhouse shift, as though roots listened for his verdict. <words>183</words>
He whispered observations--traces of myrrh, a fleck of sea salt, the faint sweetness of tears-- and, in the moment when a puzzle piece finally fits, he knew the sender mourned a drowned prince. <words>216</words>
The greenhouse sighed; the bulb flickered like captive lightning, and Bartholomew felt the quiet transformation begin beneath his ink-stained ribs. <words>236</words>
Yet the witch demanded volume, so she bellowed that empathy required thunder, not whispers, startling crows perched upon marble angels outside. <words>257</words>
Bartholomew flinched, then straightened, discovering an odd resolve in the echoing silence that followed her shout, a buried optimism surfacing. <words>277</words>
He raised the bulb high, its filament sketching fragile constellations across coffin-shaped planters, and addressed the witch with trembling authority. <words>297</words>
'My confession is incomplete,' he declared, voice still quavering yet audible, 'because the steel around my heart was forged by grief, not cruelty.' <words>320</words>
Mistress Alderwing nodded, sensing the claim genuine, and dabbed sap upon the bulb's base, sealing his admitted sorrow into its circuit. <words>341</words>
Light surged, neither daylight nor witchfire, but a gentle radiance that made even the gravestones outside appear to lean closer. <words>361</words>
Within that glow, Bartholomew felt the rusted armor of certitude fall away, replaced by pliant resolve to pen stories that heal. <words>382</words>
He thanked the witch, placed the awakened bulb back into the velvet satchel, and stepped toward the cemetery path with measured courage. <words>404</words>
Outside, fog parted like curtains, and he walked away certainly uncertain but undeniably alive, carrying new ink and hush-born hope. <words>424</words>
