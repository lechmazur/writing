Silver light seeped through hairline cracks in the fairground pavement, echoing the memory of the moon that once guided Aurin. <words>20</words>
Known in whispered legend as the moonlit archer, Aurin now loitered above the shuttered carousel acting indifferent to fear. <words>39</words>
His aimlessly passionate heart tugged him downward toward the forbidden trapdoor rumored to open into the park's buried colosseum. <words>58</words>
He descended stair after creaking stair, driven by a reckless kindness that still measured every breath with cautious impulsiveness. <words>77</words>
Aurin sought dangerous knowledge said to sleep beneath the arena sands, knowledge he hoped to attain and transform into mercy. <words>97</words>
He wished to create a legacy of compassion rather than carnage, and felt destiny dangling like a paper airplane above. <words>117</words>
When the trapdoor slammed shut behind him, a draft lifted a forgotten airplane from the dusty bleachers into its final flight. <words>138</words>
Aurin decided that the plane's arc would measure his own time; once it landed, he must leave or be lost. <words>158</words>
Torches flickered around the subterranean colosseum, revealing tiers of bone-white benches and a central pit strewn with brittle leaves. <words>177</words>
Their pattern, spiraling like constellations, formed an unmistakable map that only a moonlit archer would trust over stone corridors. <words>196</words>
Remembering childhood lessons in reading wind by leaf tremors, Aurin knelt and traced the spirals, letting them guide his boots. <words>216</words>
By the pattern of fallen leaves he would attain the vault, for metal signs had been stripped to mislead intruders. <words>236</words>
The leaves steered him to a shadowed alcove where a bent fork hung on a velvet cord like a relic. <words>256</words>
Legend claimed the utensil once fed the tyrant who staged gladiatorial hunts here, its crooked tine pointing toward the chamber of secrets. <words>278</words>
Aurin followed the bent fork's direction and soon stood before a marble door etched with lunar phases and bleeding roses. <words>298</words>
Inside, he found scrolls bound in mica, each glowing faintly, promising formulas to turn enemy arrows into seedlings. <words>316</words>
He trembled, aware that dangerous knowledge tempts pride, yet compassion urged him to memorize only the portions that healed. <words>335</words>
As he copied sigils onto his quiver, the paper airplane circled overhead, losing altitude like a swan surrendering to dusk. <words>355</words>
He pocketed the bent fork as proof of pilgrimage, then sprinted, heart ricocheting between cautious planning and impulsive gratitude. <words>374</words>
The leaves now rustled in reverse currents, warning that guards descended, drawn by the same map he had disturbed. <words>393</words>
Aurin nocked an arrow but tilted its head toward the torches, recalling a scroll that transmuted flames into blossoms. <words>412</words>
When he released, petals exploded, blinding the guards without harm, and the airplane finally landed beside him, counting his escape complete. <words>433</words>
Climbing back to starlight, Aurin understood that true legacy lies not in hoarded secrets but in the gentle trajectory of their release. <words>455</words>
