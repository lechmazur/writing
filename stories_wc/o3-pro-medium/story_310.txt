Beneath a skin of turquoise waves, the mysterious underwater city of Pelagios echoed like a seashell held to memory. <words>19</words>
Into its coral streets drifted Ilyra, a wide-eyed conjurer whose pupils still reflected surface starlight. <words>34</words>
She gripped a blacksmith's hammer with runic carvings, the iron head sheened by brine and stubborn promise. <words>51</words>
Every rune promised weight, yet weightlessness was her aim. <words>60</words>
She had descended at the hour that divides bad habits and new starts, when the city's clocks exhaled bubbles instead of chimes. <words>82</words>
Street wisdom in Pelagios said a traveler arriving then would meet themselves walking away. <words>96</words>
Ilyra wanted the meeting to be silent, and so her motivation nested: to master the art of silence. <words>114</words>
Yet Pelagios thrummed with gossip written on drifting vellum and tacked to bronze bulletin boards moored by seaweed chains. <words>133</words>
The conjurer chose to resist that chatter by hijacking the messages themselves, rewriting them into quiet. <words>149</words>
Her method was methodically chaotic: tidy calligraphy but sentences rearranged like kelp torn by storm currents. <words>165</words>
A proclamation about tax shells became a lullaby of hush, a missing-pearl notice transformed into blank blue space between commas. <words>185</words>
Citizens paused, mouths still open for words that no longer surfaced. <words>196</words>
Even the gossiping eels, famous for electric rumblings, found their lines erased into shimmering silence. <words>211</words>
But every spell requires an echo, and the hammer began vibrating with words she had buried. <words>227</words>
Runes flared, casting silhouettes of elders who once forged the tool to judge whether quiet could bear truth. <words>245</words>
They whispered that silence without listening is only heavier noise. <words>255</words>
Ilyra felt the bittersweet reckoning rise like salt on her tongue. <words>266</words>
She realized she had muted the city but not herself, because fear still clanged inside her ribs. <words>283</words>
So she turned the hammer inward, tapping its head gently against her chest as though striking a bell of flesh and memory. <words>305</words>
The runes peeled away like silver barnacles, drifting upward as mute confessions. <words>317</words>
They fluttered past bulletin boards, past wary citizens, settling finally upon the vaulted ceiling of ocean above the city. <words>336</words>
There they formed a shimmering sentence only she could read: 'Silence is the space where words become listening'. <words>354</words>
Humbled, she released the hammer, and it drifted downward to embed beside the quieted bulletin boards as a public hushstone. <words>374</words>
The citizens, hearing nothing, felt everything; they touched their throats, joined hands, and finally listened to the water's slow heartbeat. <words>394</words>
At that moment, upon the hour dividing bad habits and new starts, Ilyra met herself departing along a silent avenue. <words>414</words>
The other Ilyra smiled, no longer wide-eyed but clear-eyed, and vanished like a bubble freed from history. <words>431</words>
Left alone, the conjurer breathed, hearing for the first time the rich hush she had once only imagined. <words>449</words>
Her silence was no absence now, but a harbor where words might someday anchor without breaking the surface. <words>467</words>
