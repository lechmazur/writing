Sudrick, an understudy sorcerer perpetually relegated to odd jobs, unlocked the salt crystal growing chamber. <words>15</words>
He had promised the Archmage he would merely launder apprentice robes, nothing more dramatic. <words>29</words>
Yet laundry cycles were long, and boredom for a curious mind was longer still. <words>43</words>
So Sudrick smuggled inside a small cardboard box rattling with experimental runes and half grown socks. <words>59</words>
The chamber glimmered like frozen moonlight, playful yet humming with a dread only alchemists respect. <words>74</words>
He arranged salt stalagmites into spiral ears, preparing to wake the unheard stories trapped inside crystals. <words>90</words>
His motivation was neither fame nor gold but to track cultural evolution across centuries of silent gossip. <words>107</words>
Salt, he believed, archived society the way diaries archive secrets, crisp, preservative, and wonderfully judgmental. <words>122</words>
However, protocol required supervision, and Daphnil the surveyor arrived, obnoxiously polite like a smiling guillotine. <words>137</words>
"May I hinder your illicit progress, good sir, only so rules remain fragrant?" she inquired with bowing flourishes. <words>155</words>
Her deference was so overpowering Sudrick nearly thanked her for obstructing him. <words>167</words>
He stalled, knowing another option waited among roots older than the academy itself. <words>180</words>
Midway through the wash cycle's spin, he cracked open a floor grate and whispered toward distant soil. <words>197</words>
Sound tunneled into an ancient oak grove miles away, where gnarled sentinels traded gossip as wind. <words>213</words>
Sudrick eavesdropped on their whispers, plucking linguistic spores like mushrooms of meaning from leaf to leaf. <words>229</words>
Each spore contained songs of shepherds, rebellions, flirtations-evidence the unheard deserved dawn. <words>241</words>
He poured the spores into the salt ears, then tapped the cardboard box thrice as catalyst. <words>257</words>
Crystals trembled, emitting laundry-steam scented with forgotten lullabies and faint, worried giggles. <words>269</words>
Daphnil clapped approvingly, exclaiming, "How inconveniently marvelous; do continue disobeying while I file paperwork!" <words>283</words>
The polite menace jolted Sudrick to hurry, for the rinse alarm would soon echo through corridors. <words>299</words>
He focused, inviting the unheard to step from crystal shells and speak within the swishing dryers. <words>315</words>
Voices unfurled: a potter describing plague masks, a child recounting dragon parades, a widow inventing jazz. <words>331</words>
Sudrick recorded timbres and idioms onto ribbon scrolls, mapping how dialects morphed like colors in brine. <words>347</words>
The data would help scholars predict tomorrow's slang and maybe prevent yesterday's mistakes from repeating. <words>362</words>
But as new speech swelled, the chamber walls cracked, leaking brackish dread disguised as ticklish bubbles. <words>378</words>
If bubbles popped outside, administrators would quarantine the wing and confiscate his living archive. <words>392</words>
To hinder catastrophe, Sudrick politely borrowed Daphnil's clipboard and used it to scoop hissing foam into the box. <words>410</words>
Cardboard darkened, runes activated, and the box folded space, storing menace between missing socks. <words>424</words>
Daphnil bowed so low her hat touched brine, saying, "Splendid hindrance, sir; you have spectacularly complied with rebellion." <words>442</words>
The rinse alarm chimed, washers stopped, and the unheard settled inside crystals like tired theatre audiences after applause. <words>460</words>
Sudrick sealed the grate, pocketed his scrolls, and left with laundry baskets, whistling in playful dread of tomorrow. <words>478</words>
