When the night yields to golden embers, Mortimer Vale buttoned his black coat with reverent haste.<words>16</words>
He was an overly curious mortician, forever negotiating life and death like cordial conspirators.<words>30</words>
Tonight his hearse rested at the edge of the mangrove labyrinth inhabited by singing spirits.<words>45</words>
Their melodies curled above brackish water, loudly serene yet itching with secrets.<words>57</words>
Mortimer had come not for corpses but for dream journals hidden beneath those crooning roots.<words>72</words>
He believed each unwritten nightmare a posthumous confession worth embalming on crisp paper.<words>85</words>
Rumor claimed the spirits would relinquish such pages only to one who imitated their first heartbeat.<words>101</words>
Imitate he would, for curiosity is a scalpel that never rests.<words>112</words>
With lantern unlit, he stepped between gnarled trunks, listening for the rustle of revelation.<words>126</words>
It sounded like pages turning inside wind that had gone to finishing school.<words>139</words>
Soon footprints appeared before him, glowing violet, and he matched their stride precisely.<words>152</words>
Each print vanished after a single heartbeat, but Mortimer's mimicry kept the path alive.<words>166</words>
Thus he advanced, guided through footprints that vanish after a single heartbeat, deeper than mourning itself.<words>182</words>
The spirits emerged as shimmered silhouettes, mouths open in perpetual lullabies.<words>193</words>
They greeted him with polite anarchy, bowing as if sabotaging etiquette from inside.<words>206</words>
Their leader wore a tarnished silver bracelet that chimed whenever an untruth touched the air.<words>221</words>
Mortimer's eyes lingered on that relic the way surgeons pause before incisions.<words>233</words>
He asked, as courteously as a knife could, for the compiled dreams of the drowned.<words>248</words>
The leader tilted her shimmering skull and demanded payment in mortal memories.<words>260</words>
Mortimer offered the day he first realized cemeteries were libraries with stubbornly closed covers.<words>274</words>
The spirits devoured that recollection, humming until the mangroves shook like tuning forks.<words>287</words>
In return, they stacked translucent volumes at his feet, each glowing with sleeping ink.<words>301</words>
Yet one journal remained locked by the tarnished silver bracelet itself.<words>312</words>
To unlock it, the leader explained, he must surrender the rustle of revelation he chased.<words>327</words>
Reluctance prickled, but curiosity screamed louder, a serenade incorrectly shelved under silence.<words>339</words>
He agreed, letting the concept slip from his tongue like a label peeled off history.<words>354</words>
Instantly the bracelet darkened further, pages fluttered open, and the labyrinth quieted to breathless applause.<words>369</words>
Mortimer gathered the final journal, its cover whispering questions that would never respect coffins.<words>383</words>
The spirits receded, satisfied, leaving only footprints that vanished before even echoes could remember them.<words>398</words>
As dawn embroidered the world in gentlest gold, the mortician strode away, loudly serene and inexhaustibly inquisitive.<words>415</words>
Within his pocket, revelation rustled no longer, yet its absence promised grander autopsies of the mind.<words>431</words>
