The sun had already slid behind the western crags when I reached the amber grotto at dusk. [17]  
Gold light caught in the resinous walls, making every droplet look like a suspended hourglass. [32]  
I chose this shimmering vault for the evening’s transactions because secrecy breathes more freely among relics. [48]  
My clientele considers me a counterfeit emotion dealer, yet I prefer to think of myself as an archivist of possibilities. [68]  
Tonight’s client, Dr. Celine Marrow, approached with the posture of someone professionally thorough and privately terrified. [84]  
She clutched a fragrance chemist’s blotter petal, its edges stippled by earlier experiments in manufactured longing. [100]  
The petal’s paper fibers still shimmered with microscopic oils that fluttered against my fingertips like moth wings. [117]  
I never smell these relics; instead, I read them by sensing through static electricity stolen from the air. [135]  
Each faint spark sketches the silhouette of an intended feeling against my palms, as intimate as pulse. [152]  
Celine wanted a premium blend that could not be traced to any laboratory or confession booth. [168]  
She spoke in half truths, weaving professional jargon with evasive pauses, as if honesty might invite dissection. [185]  
I answered with affectionate detachment, the practiced tone of one who must neither encourage nor condemn desire. [202]  
“Tell me what you hope to feel,” I said, tracing the petal’s contour to map her unspoken ache. [220]  
Her gaze drifted to the liquid amber pooling between stones, and something in her throat unlocked. [236]  
“Insight without heartbreak,” she murmured, “so I can fix people faster and break less of myself doing it.” [254]  
There it was, the motivation I understood best: to fuse insight with empathy until they became indistinguishable. [271]  
Yet such fusions demand a vessel, and vessels have limits that feelings love to overflow. [286]  
I told her the price would be memory fog, nothing more serious if she kept the dosage humane. [304]  
She agreed, professionally thorough even in her recklessness, and laid coins the color of moon bruises on the stone. [323]  
I folded the blotter petal into a narrow reed and slid it between two copper prongs of my apparatus. [342]  
Coiled wires drank the grotto’s charged dusk, and filaments glowed like sleepy fireflies beginning their shift. [358]  
As the first current passed, the petal bled chromatic fumes that hung in the air, waiting for adoption. [376]  
I instructed Celine to breathe only when the aura cooled from violet to honey, or her nerves might subsume the mixture. [397]  
She nodded, strands of hair lifting as invisible ions hummed between us like distant violin strings. [413]  
During the waiting, I let half truths drip from my mouth about supply shortages and unpredictable regulators. [430]  
Distraction is a safer cousin of comfort, and I cannot afford authentic solace in my profession. [446]  
At last the vapor shifted to warm gold, reflecting the cave’s amber heart back upon itself. [462]  
Celine inhaled, and the fumes raced along her bloodstream like news eager for an audience. [477]  
Her pupils dilated, then steadied, more observant than before yet cushioned by a new, silken patience. [493]  
I flicked the switch to disperse remaining residue, because excess longing tends to colonize lungs uninvited. [509]  
She exhaled a single sentence: “I can finally see why grief hides inside jokes.” [523]  
The grotto answered with faint dripping, as though validating her paradox with mineral applause. [537]  
I packed my tools, each movement precise so no echo revealed us to the inquisitive night birds outside. [555]  
Payment confirmed, I offered the standard caution: the blend will fade within a lunar cycle unless nourished by mindfulness. [574]  
She thanked me with a smile both present and elsewhere, a smile quietly testing its expanded range of compassion. [593]  
As the transformation completes, I always watch for rupture, but tonight the air folded back into stillness without protest. [612]  
I realized the procedure had worked a little on me as well; some of her patience lingered like scent. [631]  
Yet I carried it with affectionate detachment, knowing a dealer must never become the merchandise he curates. [648]  
Outside, the night had thickened into indigo, and distant thunder teased my skin with tiny sparks of forewarning. [666]  
New customers will soon need me, drawn by storms they barely sense, and I will be here, listening to the static. [687]
