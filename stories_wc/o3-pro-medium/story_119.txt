The seconds following the revelation hit Maren like cymbals crashing inside the hollowed carnival grounds.<words>15</words>
She stood on the abandoned roller coaster track, splinters glittering where sunlight pierced gaps in warped cedar.<words>32</words>
Moments earlier, her heart had whispered the truth she sometimes always feared: compassion could not be quarantined.<words>49</words>
Even astral travelers risked bleeding it across realms.<words>57</words>
Maren inhaled rust and cotton candy ghosts, and her secret soul slipped from flesh like practiced spontaneity.<words>74</words>
She drifted above the rails, scouting routes to flee before her body registered panic.<words>88</words>
Survival skills were preserved, she reminded herself, by tracking sun shadows rather than the decaying wood below.<words>105</words>
Shadows elongated east, carving dark arrows along looping beams, promising a corridor toward the freight gate.<words>121</words>
But another glint interrupted flight: an antique brass key glimmered between buckled ties like a mute SOS.<words>138</words>
Keys are invitations, her mentor had said before vanishing into coma-spawned deserts of the astral plane.<words>154</words>
Unyielding compassion struck again, ordering her to descend, reunite spirit and skin, and lift the object.<words>170</words>
She rethreaded herself like silk through a needle, knees buckling as corporeal pain rebooted.<words>184</words>
Fingers closed around cold metal that seemed to hum with ferris wheel lullabies and lost pocket wishes.<words>201</words>
Instantly, visions poured: cages where children once pretended courage, gears rusting into constellations, her mentor shackled beyond.<words>218</words>
The key matched that astral lock; only she could deliver it, and delay meant forgetting how to survive.<words>236</words>
Therefore she must flee, yet not from danger, but toward it, guided by luminous shadow compass needles.<words>253</words>
She sprinted along the track, every footfall drumming memories of fire drills her father conducted in rainy kitchens.<words>271</words>
Those lessons, meant to preserve survival skills, now choreographed her dance through rotting joists and startled pigeons.<words>288</words>
Sun shadows shortened as clouds rolled, threatening to erase her compass, so she leapt onto a maintenance ladder.<words>306</words>
Wind howled, demanding spectacle, but she answered with steady breath, the tone of practiced spontaneity refined by fear.<words>324</words>
At the peak she paused, aligning the key with a padlock sealing the coaster's control booth.<words>340</words>
Metal greeted metal with a sigh older than steam calliopes, and the door swung like a curtain.<words>357</words>
Inside, her mentor's body lay inert, yet a spectral outline hovered, tethered by chains of habituated despair.<words>374</words>
Maren projected once more, sometimes always daring more kindness than caution, and unlocked the astral fetters with will.<words>392</words>
Her mentor's eyes fluttered open in both realms, gratitude flowing like midway lights powering up after decades.<words>409</words>
Outside, the coaster track groaned, yet compassion held it still long enough for teacher and student to descend together.<words>428</words>
They left the carnival ruins by tracking fresh sun shadows, fleeing not from peril but toward the next soul needing rescue.<words>449</words>
