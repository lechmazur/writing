Even during his brisk morning walks past the dew-damp gravestones, Gideon Mbeki, the guilt-ridden black market genealogist, rehearsed confessions he doubted anyone would ever hear. <words>25</words>
His paradoxical flair for brazen modesty made strangers assume he slept well, but the lie hummed under his coat like contraband bees. <words>47</words>
Today he carried a chipped bowl swaddled in newspaper, the last relic from the witch's incantation chamber he once ransacked for genetic ash and ancestral echo. <words>73</words>
The artifact's jagged rim whispered accusations with every footfall, insisting that penance required more than cataloging lineage for pay. <words>92</words>
Gideon had earned fortunes matching desperate heirs to forbidden bloodlines, yet each transaction dragged him further from the brink of renewal he secretly craved. <words>116</words>
So he devised an atypically typical redemption scheme: slip into funerals during these walks, zoom past the mourners with polite nods, and harvest sorrowful speeches for genetic subtext. <words>144</words>
By analyzing the subtext in funeral eulogies, he believed he could map hidden kinships, return stolen heritage, and thus chart a path to self-forgiveness. <words>168</words>
Data, however, could not erase the smell of burnt sage that still clung to his memory of that midnight burglary in the chamber's spiral cellar. <words>193</words>
The witch, long vanished, had woven her curses into every cobweb, warning thieves that their heirs would inherit their shame as surely as their genes. <words>218</words>
Gideon feared no offspring would want what he carried inside, so he remained childless, married only to the ledger of sin he kept beneath his bed. <words>244</words>
After weeks of covert attendance, one elegy froze him: a daughter thanking an unidentified genealogist who had restored her mother's true surname, gifting dignity to their grieving. <words>271</words>
Realization cracked open inside him like dawn through barred windows; his anonymous corrections had already nudged lives toward renewal, even while he believed himself beyond repair. <words>297</words>
That night he returned to the abandoned incantation chamber, placing the chipped bowl upon the chalked pentacle exactly where he had found it. <words>320</words>
He poured into the vessel every scrap of stolen DNA, every index card, every whisper of illicit profit, letting the bowl glimmer with potential like a reluctant star. <words>348</words>
Then, in a voice both brazen and modest, he recited a counter spell improvised from the funeral phrases he had cataloged, petitioning the unseen witch for permission to walk forward. <words>378</words>
The chamber lights, long dead, flickered like anxious fireflies, and Gideon felt himself stand on the brink of renewal, atypically typical, wholly himself, finally zooming toward self-forgiveness. <words>405</words>
