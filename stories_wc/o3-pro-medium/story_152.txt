A flickering lantern swayed over the yawning void where the amphitheater of vanished sounds once hovered.<words>16</words>
In that trembling gloom, Ralio the frenzied juggler rehearsed without applause, tossing invisible spheres.<words>30</words>
Every orbit he traced felt peculiarly functional, as though gravity still respected the vanished audience.<words>45</words>
Beside him fluttered a crumpled love letter he had never dared to open.<words>58</words>
Its handwriting blurred, smeared by salt blown upward from drowned cities and their sunken libraries.<words>73</words>
Ralio had come, at the final moment of an abandoned summer, to salvage those libraries.<words>88</words>
Knowledge, he believed, might weave cultural bridges strong enough to span voids even wider than this.<words>104</words>
But first he had to isolate the precise place where the books still whispered.<words>118</words>
His only compass lay in an ancient rite: interpreting tea leaves brewed from abyssal algae.<words>133</words>
So he balanced porcelain cups on spinning clubs, letting the liquid settle with gentle percussive clinks.<words>149</words>
The pattern formed a spiral shaped like an open door, pointing toward depths below the stage.<words>165</words>
Muted euphoria tingled through his nerves; purpose, at last, replaced the restless thrumming of performance.<words>180</words>
He pocketed the letter, promising to read it only after rescuing whatever wisdom still breathed.<words>195</words>
With a cartwheel he plunged through the door of air, descending a staircase made of silence.<words>211</words>
Shelves appeared like constellations, each volume sealed in bubbles that glimmered with refracted daylight from lost summers.<words>228</words>
Ralio's clubs now spun as lamps, their ends igniting phosphorescent dust to illuminate titles in forgotten alphabets.<words>245</words>
He juggled bubbles toward higher ledges, catching them upon his shoulders without letting the membranes quiver.<words>261</words>
Each catch released a puff of words that reassembled midair into bridges crossing the cavernous dark.<words>277</words>
Crossing one such bridge, he found a sealed trunk marked only by a tea-stain sigil.<words>292</words>
Inside lay scrolls describing civilizations that communicated solely through shared rhythms of rain on clay roofs.<words>308</words>
Ralio realized his juggling patterns echoed that forgotten language, and the void had been listening.<words>323</words>
The shelves vibrated, releasing more bubbles that drifted upward, seeking new listeners across uncharted distances.<words>338</words>
He almost cheered, but the muted euphoria urged restraint, like smiling in reverence before dawn.<words>353</words>
Only then did he uncrumple the letter, its paper stiff with brine and anticipation.<words>367</words>
The words inside confessed love for every unheard story and begged him to juggle them skyward.<words>383</words>
Tears, peculiarly functional here, mingled with tea dregs, creating fresh ink that rewrote the confession into invitation.<words>400</words>
Accepting, Ralio tossed the letter upward, and it blossomed into countless pages forming luminous, new cultural bridges.<words>417</words>
They spanned not stone to stone, but heart to heart across the yawning void now softly humming.<words>434</words>
Libraries rose from water like awakened whales, balancing upon those bridges while summer exhaled its last breath.<words>451</words>
Ralio bowed once, isolated no longer, and let his spinning lamps extinguish into satisfied darkness.<words>466</words>
