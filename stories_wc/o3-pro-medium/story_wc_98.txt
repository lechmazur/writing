Mist curled around the ancient ridge in bloom, where I, the appointed fantasy island reality checker, paced at dawn, uncertain whether the stones beneath me still remembered us. [28]
The monsoon loomed two weeks away, its violet clouds caged at the horizon, granting me a narrow season to verify the island's stories before rain drowned every unspoken syllable. [57]
I carried a single knowledge fruit seed in my pocket, warm and faintly humming, entrusted to me by the council of elders who feared our collective memory was withering. [86]
They claimed the seed could only sprout if the island itself chose to remember, an experiment both empirically whimsical and gravely serious, much like my calling. [112]
My method, refined through interpreted dreams, required sleeping at sacred waypoints, recording whatever visions rose, then testing their truth by day. [133]
On the first night I slept beneath a jacaranda whose petals glowed silver, and dreamed of children laughing in a vanished village that once crowned this ridge. [160]
When dawn returned, I excavated gently and found clay marbles exactly where the dream children had played, their surfaces etched with spirals matching the council's oldest pattern books. [188]
The evidence stirred luminous doubt within me: delight that the island cooperated, fear that it merely performed for my benefit. [208]
Reality, here, could be polite to a fault. [216]
At midday I planted the knowledge fruit seed beside the marbles, whispering the names of ancestors I had never met, hoping to waken more than soil. [242]
The ground shivered, but nothing broke through, and I moved on, carrying the soft tremor inside my ribs. [260]
That evening, wind brought the scent of turmeric and wet rope from the western cliffs, cueing the second waypoint. [279]
I dozed in a fishermen's abandoned hut, where dreams spoke in creaking floorboards, telling how storms once erased an entire fleet, yet the islanders remembered each sunken mast by song. [309]
Awake, I followed gull cries to tide pools and found carved driftwood labeled with the same verses the floorboards had rattled, preserved like shrines in salt. [335]
Again the proof felt too elegant, as though the world curated exhibits for my inspection. [350]
Still, I collected a sliver of driftwood and pressed it beside the planted seed, believing artifacts might talk to each other when I was gone. [375]
The third waypoint waited near the ridge's summit, where orchids burst like tiny suns; there I hesitated, feeling watched by petals that had outlived dynasties. [400]
Sleep refused me, so I chewed an orchid stem, hoping its mild alkaloids would blur the boundary to dreams, and soon colors seeped from moonlight itself. [426]
Within the dream I stood inside a library built of rain, shelves rippling, each droplet holding a memory that belonged not to one person but to everyone who ever sang here. [457]
A voice of water instructed me to return at dawn and listen without ears; only then would the seed decide its fate. [479]
I awoke soaked in dew, yet the sky before monsoon remained clear, stars blinking like puzzled witnesses. [496]
Obeying the dream, I sat in silence beside the seed until sunrise, letting thoughts fall away until even doubt turned luminous and translucent. [519]
Birdsong gathered, not outside but inside my skull, an echo of all voices the island had ever hosted, swelling into a single sustained chord. [543]
The earth answered by cracking gently, and a shoot emerged, pale gold veined with violet, already bearing an embryo fruit shaped like an ear. [567]
I heard through it the hidden marbles rolling, the driftwood keening, the drowned masts creaking, all memories threading themselves into new roots. [589]
The collective memory was not stored; it was alive, and my role was less to verify than to midwife its awakening. [610]
Yet the luminous doubt remained, urging me to test one final sign before the monsoon's arrival. [626]
I pressed my palm to the shoot and asked, aloud, whether it could remember futures as well as pasts. [645]
A ripple of wind carried petals upward, arranging them into the shape of a boat heading east, where new storms would form. [667]
I understood that memory, once wakened, also steers, warning and guiding simultaneously, and that the knowledge fruit would ripen only if we sailed toward the answer. [693]
So I hurried to carve a new mast from the driftwood relics, planning to depart before the first monsoon drop, carrying the seedling as captain, logbook, and compass. [721]
The ridge watched, blossoms closing like eyelids, trusting that an empirically whimsical voyager could protect what no wall ever could: the songs that remember themselves. [746]
