Low tide revealed the causeway to Larksand, the tidal island no map still named. [14]  
Even after the Water Wars, its shattered cottages gleamed with salt like unhealed wounds. [28]  
Marlin Crewe trudged across, canvas satchel bumping his hip in a restless tattoo. [41]  
He was the insomniac painter everyone in the floodlands whispered about but never visited. [55]  
Every night without sleep he mixed pigments until sunrise bled through shutter cracks. [68]  
Now he sought something broader than color, a meaning he could finally thresh from experience. [83]  
Rumor said Larksand held a relic able to knot past and future into one brushstroke. [98]  
He felt wryly earnest about the quest, mocking himself even as hope prickled his ribs. [113]  
The only guide was the pattern of recent storms, mapped by following rain trails across sand. [129]  
Silver rivulets winked under cloudbreaks, threading him forward like anxious handwriting on wet parchment. [143]  
Halfway, he met another traveler alone: Adra Pike, archivist of the Post-Deluge Congress. [156]  
She cradled a velvet box as if it might dissolve with one wrong breath. [170]  
Her voice held the same haggard awe echoing in Marlin's chest. [181]  
Together they reached the island's drowned square where barnacled statues pointed inland like forgotten signposts. [196]  
Adra opened the box, revealing an amber brooch warm as trapped sunset. [208]  
Inside the fossilised sap glimmered three infinitesimal water droplets, worlds upon worlds compressed. [221]  
She explained the Congress wished to trade the brooch to whatever force haunted Larksand. [235]  
In exchange, they hoped to learn why storms were re-knitting oceans faster than dams could hold. [251]  
Marlin laughed, a dry wave against broken shells, because his goal matched hers precisely. [265]  
Both desired an unearthed convergence, a point where histories and perceptions collided into luminous clarity. [280]  
They agreed to proceed together, reasoning that meaning favors company the way fire favors oxygen. [295]  
Following rain trails along mossy lanes, they approached the chapel ruins perched above tideworn cliffs. [310]  
Inside, altar stones were split, and luminous plankton pooled where holy water once dripped. [324]  
Marlin set up his easel without thinking, brush twitching in moon-pale fingers. [336]  
Adra laid the brooch upon the altar as though placing a heart into soil. [350]  
A hush spilled over cracked pews; even gulls silenced their ragged questioning. [362]  
The brooch glowed, and droplets within began rotating, tiny tides responding to unseen moons. [376]  
Colors leaked from the droplets and threaded into Marlin's waiting paints like summoned ghosts. [390]  
Suddenly he saw every moment he had ever stayed awake, layered like sedimentary dreams. [404]  
He painted feverishly, canvas devouring visions of flooded avenues, ration riots, and quiet shoulders of survivors. [420]  
Adra watched, her own memories surfacing in the rotating droplets: archival shelves collapsing under humidity, lost diaries. [437]  
She realized the exchange demanded equal vulnerability, so she began reciting titles of destroyed books. [452]  
Each name sparked across the chapel like fireflies of regret, illuminating the plankton pools brighter. [467]  
The building trembled, stones shedding barnacles in a gritty snow as floorboards breathed. [480]  
Through a widening fissure rose a column of brine smelling of age, singing in polyphonic whisper. [496]  
The song folded painter and archivist into a single hush, a living chiaroscuro of longing. [511]  
They understood without words that the island itself remembered every droplet lost during the wars. [526]  
It would share that memory only with spirits willing to gift their own. [539]  
Adra pressed the brooch against her sternum, leaving a resin smear that tingled like static. [554]  
Marlin dipped a finger into the smear and painted a final spiral on the canvas's heart. [570]  
At the center of the spiral he wrote one sentence: 'Water remembers who listens'. [584]  
The fissure sealed; the plankton sank; the chapel exhaled a relieved, timorous silence. [597]  
Outside, dawn rose, and tide began creeping back across the causeway, erasing footnotes of their arrival. [613]  
Adra and Marlin hurried toward shore, carrying canvas and empty box, now equally weightless. [627]  
They followed fresh rain trails shimmering atop returning waves, pathways only the awakened could read. [642]  
Behind them, Larksand sank into anonymity again, yet sunlight flashed once on the chapel spire. [657]  
The flash felt like a nodded thanks, wryly earnest, inviting them to keep threshing meaning. [672]  
Marlin sensed that insomnia henceforth would not be a curse but a covenant with remembering. [687]  
Adra, likewise, planned to rebuild her archives as gardens where stories could root in silt. [702]  
Their uneasy wonder accompanied them inland, haggard awe stretched into promise by the morning wind. [717]
