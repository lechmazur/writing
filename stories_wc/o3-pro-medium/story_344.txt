In the hush of improbable beginnings, Mira Havel breached the surface of waking memory. <words>14</words>
She was an underwater explorer who dreaded tight spaces more than crushing depth. <words>27</words>
Claustrophobia clung to her wetsuit like cold salt, yet curiosity pulled harder. <words>39</words>
That curiosity, quietly bold, had lifted her onto a floating rock tea house above the misted gulf. <words>56</words>
The proprietor, an elderly scholar named Wren, greeted her with a pair of wire-rimmed glasses balanced on his nose. <words>75</words>
Wren had advertised tea brewed to map emotions, and Mira came to study human behaviors. <words>90</words>
A lightly heavyhearted ache accompanied her since childhood dives where darkness pressed like stone. <words>104</words>
She hoped the tea might soothe the squeeze inside her ribs. <words>115</words>
As steam spiraled upward, Wren explained his method: by tasting subtle differences in old jam recipes he adjusted the leaves' temperament. <words>136</words>
Strawberry for courage, plum for patience, blackberry to inflame dormant memories into honest speech. <words>150</words>
Mira sipped, tasting the hesitant blend, and images of narrow copper tunnels flooded her mind. <words>165</words>
Her chest tightened, but Wren laid two fingers upon her pulse with a quiet, healing touch. <words>181</words>
The panic ebbed like tide withdrawn, leaving damp sand and space to breathe. <words>194</words>
Grateful, she noticed the glasses now rested beside the teapot, fogged by her exhalation. <words>208</words>
Their lenses reflected not her face but an unfamiliar hallway carved within coral. <words>221</words>
Startled, she realized the spectacles were portals channeling each drinker's unspoken story. <words>233</words>
Wren watched with scholarly delight, jotting observations in margins of a damp notebook. <words>246</words>
Studying human behaviors, he said, required respect for their hidden architectures of fear and hope. <words>261</words>
Mira felt suddenly seen, her claustrophobia no longer aberrant data but meaningful geography. <words>274</words>
She asked to assist him, offering dives through memory rather than water. <words>286</words>
Together they brewed, tasted, and recorded, charting maps where emotions crystallized like salt pans. <words>300</words>
Sometimes the blackberry note flared too hot, inflaming patrons into arguments that split crockery. <words>314</words>
Mira would slip on the wire-rimmed glasses and find the quarrel's root, then let Wren's fingers quell it. <words>332</words>
Each success widened the interior ocean behind her ribs, spacious and bright. <words>344</words>
At dusk the tea house drifted past cloud lanterns, and she felt no fear of the low ceilinged sky. <words>363</words>
Instead, she tasted promises of rooms inside people, endlessly wide, waiting for her footsteps. <words>377</words>
The hush of improbable beginnings had become a steady hum of possible continuations. <words>390</words>
And within that hum, Mira knew her own heart could be a generous vessel. <words>404</words>
