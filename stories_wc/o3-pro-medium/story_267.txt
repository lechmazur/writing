Tevan, the mild-tempered guard of the Event Horizon Spa, pedaled his sputtering rental bike along rings of swirling starlight. <words>19</words>
Tourists screamed with savage bliss as they dove into simulated singularities, while Tevan searched for stray cats that threaded the resort's underbelly. <words>41</words>
He followed them by instinct, convinced the felines guarded the unraveling thread binding the artificial black hole to corporate reality. <words>61</words>
Each alleyway yawned like a gravity well, lit only by neon arrows promising cosmic cocktails and ironic enlightenment. <words>79</words>
Tevan wore a poetically bland uniform so beige it seemed designed to concede defeat before any confrontation began. <words>97</words>
Yet beneath the neutral fabric, he concealed a disguise stitched from maintenance rags, holographic soot, and a stolen starfield scarf. <words>117</words>
He wore it not to be a hero or a villain, but to refuse that false dichotomy entirely. <words>135</words>
The cats, sleek as quantum secrets, led him to the defunct forge behind the spa where an ancient blacksmith's anvil floated weightless. <words>157</words>
Micro singularities flickered around the iron like fireflies, hammering silent music against spacetime's brittle shell. <words>172</words>
Tevan realized the resort's engineers had anchored their simulations to this relic, an absurd artifact of heft in a place that worshiped collapse. <words>195</words>
If the anvil cracked, the fake horizon would unravel and drag every pampered guest toward true nothingness. <words>212</words>
A shadow emerged, the Spa Director, radiant in solar flair robes, declaring maintenance codes and moral absolutes with marketing firmness. <words>232</words>
He labeled Tevan either saboteur or savior, demanding the guard choose, but Tevan simply brushed cat fur from his cuffs and kept pedaling in circles around the forge. <words>260</words>
Amid these bike rides, momentum became argument; every loop braided another doubt into the Director's certainty. <words>276</words>
Finally the cats pounced onto the anvil, their combined mass triggering a harmonic quake that split the magnetic clamps with a ringing sigh. <words>299</words>
The unraveling thread shimmered visible, a silver Mobius strand whipping through corridors, unseaming holograms, cocktail menus, and spa pamphlets alike. <words>319</words>
Guests, smeared in premium event-horizon mud, howled with exhilarating terror, discovering that savage bliss tastes sharper when reality bites back. <words>339</words>
Tevan steered between them, guiding panicked people to emergency light rails while refusing applause, promotion, or condemnation. <words>356</words>
He left final judgment to the cats, who merely licked their paws and stared into the newborn void like critics of unfinished poems. <words>379</words>
Then, wearing his poetically bland uniform once more, Tevan rang the anvil with his bike bell, sealing the crack not by force but by ambiguous music. <words>405</words>
The strand recoiled into silence, balance restored, yet the resort would forever remember the guard who spun neither heroics nor villainy but something stranger, freer. <words>430</words>
