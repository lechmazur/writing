After the last tree falls, the vacuum sighs against the station hull like a disappointed god.<words>16</words>
I, once a shipwrecked merchant, pace the observation deck and feel nothing but aloof passion for the ruin below.<words>35</words>
It is honestly strange how grief grows elegant in silence.<words>45</words>
Earth is a charcoal sphere, yet the tourist posters on the ghost station still promise waterfalls, orchards, and meadows.<words>64</words>
Their corners flake like burnt parchment, and rebellious sparks of static flutter across them whenever the air recyclers wheeze.<words>83</words>
I have chosen those rebellious sparks as my guides, because every honest navigator is extinct.<words>98</words>
The grand illusion—that commerce will outlive forests—still lingers in the station’s advertising algorithms, whispering bargains to no one.<words>116</words>
I intend to shatter it, even if only a soundless crack ripples through dead circuitry.<words>131</words>
First I must ascend from this hollow promenade to the broadcast mast above.<words>144</words>
The lift is locked, so I improvise an escape route via the flaking edges of a travel poster in a ghost station corridor.<words>167</words>
My gloves pinch the brittle film, tearing vistas of alpine serenity into ladder rungs.<words>181</words>
Behind the holographic ink, an old maintenance shaft yawns, smelling of ozone and powdered regrets.<words>196</words>
I carry a rustic butter churn strapped like a jetpack, a relic from the hold of my wrecked freighter.<words>215</words>
Inside churned nothingness, I fermented fuel from spoiled cream, proving desperation still breeds invention.<words>229</words>
The shaft rises narrow, lit by dim constellations of malfunctioning LEDs, and I climb, propelled by short hisses from the dairy thruster.<words>251</words>
Each burst scatters more sparks, which whirl around me like mutinous fireflies eager to compose a new star map.<words>270</words>
When I reach the mast hatch, the observation deck below looks merely decorative, a glass bauble floating in eternal Monday.<words>290</words>
I jack the butter churn into the transmission port, let the fermented gases cough through the PA, and speak over the roar.<words>312</words>
Citizens of nowhere, your coupons are ashes, your forests are ember, your merchants are ghosts, and the sale is over, I declare.<words>334</words>
The broadcast converts apostasy into radiant static, and the station’s displays flicker, their paradise panoramas peeling into honest grayscale.<words>353</words>
Below, the charcoal planet accepts the confession without applause.<words>362</words>
Above, the rebellious sparks cohere, spelling in geometry a single word: Enough.<words>374</words>
I feel aloof passion cool into simple relief, as though I finally traded false abundance for unvarnished vacancy.<words>392</words>
Then the butter churn sputters its last bubble, and the ladder of torn posters loosens beneath me like exhausted handiwork.<words>412</words>
I descend willingly, not to orbit illusions, but to wander the echoing decks until some other honestly strange dream requests ascent.<words>433</words>
