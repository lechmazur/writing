Rain has not fallen since the calendar choked on its final digit, yet my hands still smell of damp paper.<words>20</words>
I, Rho Taliesen, convicted dream thief and notoriously mathematically challenged fugitive, guard the forgotten library inside a treehouse that outlived cities.<words>41</words>
The last human was born three centuries ago, and no one bothered to mark when she died, so history simply flattened.<words>62</words>
I miss her the way a mirror misses a face, fiercely and in shards, because she carried my stolen dreams like contraband.<words>84</words>
Now the thunder is gone, the skies silent as paper lanterns, and my purpose has narrowed to coaxing sound from that muteness.<words>106</words>
I believe, with the quiet mania of a sleepless archivist, that noise can return if I rearrange enough memories.<words>125</words>
All night I sort brittle scrolls, but the centerpiece is a flimsy photo album whose pages wilt like wet moth wings.<words>146</words>
The album belonged to the last human, and each blurred snapshot shows us playing rooftop basketball beneath gathering, unfulfilled clouds.<words>166</words>
Our shared love for that ridiculous sport was my favorite burglary tool, because while she dribbled, I dipped nets into her slumbering subconscious.<words>189</words>
She never guessed that every bounce was a mnemonic metronome guiding me through the corridors of her dreaming.<words>207</words>
Tonight I study the album again, hoping a misfiled echo will teach me how to plunge into the sky itself.<words>227</words>
But numbers betray me: coordinates, humidity ratios, lightning probabilitiesâ€”they swirl like unsolved fractions and taunt my mathematically challenged brain.<words>246</words>
So I retreat into the notion of the fragmented self, convinced that somewhere inside my own broken reflections, a storm generator hides.<words>268</words>
I tear a page from the album, fold it into a paper basketball, and lob it against the dusty globe lamp.<words>289</words>
The ball arcs, misses the bin, and strikes a ceiling beam, dislodging a scroll that tumbles open like a lazy bolt of lightning.<words>312</words>
Within the scroll lies an ancient rulebook for weather priests, written in the forgotten dialect of free throws and layups.<words>332</words>
Each diagram is a court, each sigil a pivot step, and I realize that thunder is merely applause from an invisible audience.<words>354</words>
To fill the empty bleachers, I must play both sides of the fractured self: thief and warden, dreamer and guard, shooter and rebounder.<words>377</words>
I pace the narrow planks, chanting shot-clock mantras, until the library shivers with remembered cheers.<words>392</words>
Then I plunge through the trapdoor of consciousness, dribbling my paper ball across storm-colored thought until a first raindrop smacks the roof.<words>414</words>
Outside, clouds erupt like crowds, and applause rolls as thunder, summoned not by calculations but by a game only two ghosts remember.<words>436</words>
Somewhere within the downpour, I hear her laughing, and for the first time since my conviction, I count perfectly to three.<words>457</words>
