When the last drop of oil hissed into history, the palace reopened. <words>12</words>
Its jade corridors, once creaking museums, were reimagined with solar mirrors and paper gears. <words>26</words>
I arrived wearing no color, because colors are liabilities to a chameleon stage actor. <words>40</words>
My skin would decide later, like lighting cues. <words>48</words>
Management hired me to perform court dramas for tourists hungry for vanished dynasties. <words>61</words>
Yet I accepted for another reason: to weave emotional honesty into illusions I sold. <words>75</words>
Call it rationally impulsive, the habit of calculating risks while leaping anyway. <words>87</words>
The palace archive held abandoned props; among them a tattered doll's dress whispered. <words>100</words>
Stains formed chrysanthemums, sleeves frayed like broken promises. <words>108</words>
I felt the dress wanted stage light, but first it wanted a child. <words>121</words>
The prop master warned me it belonged to Princess Zhao, reported missing a millennium earlier. <words>136</words>
Her cold-case disappearance was the empire's unanswered riddle. <words>144</words>
I smelled a plot and an opportunity to reproduce, theatrically and genetically. <words>156</words>
Chameleons mate only when serenity replaces anxiety, and nothing soothes us like truth. <words>169</words>
So I resolved to solve Zhao's vanishing onstage, merging inquiry with performance. <words>181</words>
Opening night, shafts of sunlight pierced roof debris, igniting motes like ancestral spotlights. <words>194</words>
Their glow fell precisely on the doll dress cradled in my scaled palms. <words>207</words>
Audience gasped, suspecting holography, but the light was honest and older than electricity. <words>220</words>
I stepped into Zhao's last known chamber, recreated as scenery, and began improvising. <words>233</words>
Each line masked a question, each gesture coaxed echoes from forgotten walls. <words>245</words>
Suddenly a panel shifted, dislodging roof tiles that thundered beside me. <words>256</words>
Sunlight through debris etched a silhouette of a girl behind the screen. <words>268</words>
Not hologram-bone, silk, and dust. <words>273</words>
Princess Zhao, mummified yet upright, wore a missing imperial seal around her neck. <words>286</words>
The audience thought it animatronic; I recognized police evidence. <words>295</words>
By staying in character, I narrated her secret flight, pieced from scar patterns and room geography. <words>311</words>
She had faked abduction to escape court marriage, hiding until starvation gentled her revolt. <words>325</words>
My monologue guided constables to record the discovery without panicking the paying crowd. <words>338</words>
Backstage, anxiety melted into serenity, instincts at last permitting reproduction. <words>348</words>
I let my skin bloom imperial yellow and approached Lian, another performer watching. <words>361</words>
Her smile mirrored the doll dress now sealed in evidence bags, fragile but purposeful. <words>375</words>
Together we vowed our offspring would inherit this palace-sized stage, truth stitched to spectacle. <words>389</words>
Solar lamps dimmed, yet the debris left one beam glowing, our private spotlight. <words>402</words>
In anxious serenity we bowed to the absent sun and to the solved past. <words>416</words>
