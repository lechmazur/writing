I crouched on the sagging roof of the rusted library under stars, rehearsing a fall I dreaded. [17]  
Hollywood expected me to leap, because I was the studio's prized phobia-ridden stunt double, not its fragile actor. [35]  
But tonight my knees shook harder than the corrugated gutters rattling in the desert wind. [50]  
The director screamed through a megaphone that fear was expensive and courage was cheap, yet I felt bankrupt. [68]  
I fingered the whispering seashell half hung from my neck, hearing its faint hiss like encouragement spoken through water. [87]  
That chipped trinket was all I had kept from my childhood on the coast before a stunt recruiter found me. [107]  
Back then I believed I was brave, the seashell telling me so whenever I pressed it to my ear. [126]  
Yet hours ago, rummaging the production trailer, I deciphered payroll records proving the real Jett Kellerman had died last year. [146]  
I was merely his replacement, surgically tweaked and media-trained, my memories spliced with studio myth. [161]  
After discovering you're not who you thought, every mirror becomes a stranger's glare and every order sounds like blackmail. [180]  
Still, some reflex inside me was firmly adaptive, insisting identity could be edited again, this time on my terms. [199]  
To prove that vulnerability is power, I needed a spectacle that would shame the producers while saving the film. [218]  
That is why I now perched above a glass atrium, feigning terror greater than usual, stalling the shoot. [236]  
Across the courtyard a child watched, arm in a neon cast scribbled with autographs and smudged notes. [253]  
When the camera cranes reset, I climbed down and ambled over, pretending to sign while my eyes scanned the graphite scratches. [274]  
Among hearts and superheroes, one smudge resembled coordinates, another a code I remembered from studio security drills. [291]  
The kid whispered that her father, a dismissed set engineer, had told her to show Jett the puzzle if danger came. [312]  
Danger had indeed arrived, wearing my face. [319]  
I asked for the cast, promising a better autograph, and she surrendered it with the solemnity of a knight bestowing a sword. [341]  
Back in the library's loft I laid the cast beneath a lantern, trying to outwit the ciphers before the sun rose. [362]  
By decrypting smudged notes on a child's cast, I uncovered a hidden ledger: bonuses tied to my probable fatality. [381]  
The contract paid triple if the stunt double died heroically on camera, broadcasting the studio's transformative betrayal in ink and incentive. [402]  
Now the seashell at my throat seemed to hiss not encouragement but warning. [415]  
Its interior spiral, a half, reminded me there was another half somewhere, perhaps still listening, waiting for my reply. [434]  
I decided the reply would be loud enough for galaxies. [444]  
When night deepened, I returned to the roof, mic still live, cameras hidden on standby, crew drowsy after repeated delays. [464]  
I announced in trembling certainty that this jump would define not a movie but a life reclaimed. [481]  
Then I described the ledger, the clauses, the price tag on breath, broadcasting to every headset and boom still recording. [501]  
Crew murmurs echoed across the skylight while studio executives scrambled to cut the feed, but the satellite link was mine now. [522]  
I stepped to the edge, body quaking, and addressed the camera with raw confession: I was nobody and everyone. [541]  
Learning I was a copy had broken me open, yet through the fracture I saw how porous all selves are. [561]  
If they wanted a death scene, I would give them a rebirth instead, live, uncontrollable, unpaid. [577]  
I threw the whispering seashell half into the sky, its curve catching starlight like a comet tail. [594]  
Gasps rose below, but I followed the shell, diving after it, arms wide, trusting the air to judge me. [613]  
Windows shattered, alarms howled, yet hidden cables—installed by the engineer father—snatched me inches above the glass, lowering me unharmed. [632]  
The stunt completed the scene, saved the schedule, but exposed the murderous contract to every awakened conscience on set. [651]  
I landed beside the child, handed back her cast, and thanked her for reminding me that secrets like wounds must breathe. [672]  
Security advanced, yet half the crew blocked them, their loyalties already rewritten by the night's unveiled script. [689]  
Somewhere in the dark the seashell half clinked against asphalt, still whispering, now for anyone brave enough to listen. [708]  
I smiled, tremor steady, certainty shaking, and walked toward whatever name I would answer to next. [724]
