The last horn of the realm fell silent after the final warning, and Queen Sereya felt the hush seep into her bones. [22]  
Her throne room, once lacquered with applause, now pulsed with a lacy menace she could almost taste. [39]  
Councillors whispered that the sky bled, yet none knew she saw it nightly in recurring dreams of bleeding starlight. [58]  
To unravel the mystery threatening both her sleep and sovereignty, she ordered her most faithful captain, Riall, to ready the northern ascent. [80]  
A cobalt grotto above clouds, whispered in lullabies, supposedly waited near the summit, a place where dreams birthed and memories ossified. [101]  
Sereya's order was softly commanding, neither plea nor threat yet irresistible as tide. [114]  
Riall answered with armor half buckled, meeting her in the moonlit orchard where they had once planned festivals instead of escapes. [135]  
Together they would climb the ridge before dawn, guided by the queen's ominous reveries. [149]  
Storm lanterns shuddered, hinting that the palace itself feared her plan. [160]  
But Sereya had grown disenchanted with marble walls and scripted courtesies, and disenchantment breeds daring. [175]  
They rode until the road buckled into shale, then traded horses for silence. [188]  
Riall pointed out constellations, yet Sereya watched only the gaps where stars seemed wounded, dripping unseen into morning. [206]  
Soon they reached an ember grotto on the ridge, its entrance glowing as if some buried hearth dreamed of release. [226]  
Sereya paused, recalling that her nightmares always opened with this same vermilion mouth. [239]  
Riall offered a torch, but she shook her head and stepped inside, following a deeper illumination pulsing like a sovereign's heartbeat. [260]  
They walked until the ember light ceded to vast sapphire shadows, air thin enough that clouds curled beneath their boots. [280]  
At last the tunnel erupted onto a balcony cut from azurite, the cobalt grotto above clouds the nursery rhymes had half forgotten. [302]  
Stalactites hung like organ pipes, and each drop that fell rang a note only nerves could hear. [319]  
In the center hovered an orb of bleeding starlight, luminescence seeping through invisible wounds to pool on the stone in quivering runes. [341]  
Sereya felt words forming inside her chest, a scripture she had never learned yet had always known. [358]  
She spoke, the sound softly commanding though her lips barely parted, and the orb pulsed in reply. [375]  
With that pulse, memories unfurled: a younger queen promising mercy, the people's cheers, the first lie, the warships, the smoke, the final warning. [398]  
She realized the starlight bled because she had wounded it, siphoning hope when she seized the crown from her sister years ago. [420]  
The dreams were not omens but confessions her conscience could no longer lock away. [434]  
Riall stepped beside her, and for the first time since childhood they shared an exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer that drifted among the runes. [460]  
Tiny lamps winked around them, echoing stars now restored, and the lacy menace loosened into fragile possibility. [477]  
Yet starlight still dripped, slower but unstaunched, demanding recompense more than regret. [489]  
Sereya knelt, crown jangling against stone, and offered to abdicate, to heal the sky even if it shredded her name from history. [511]  
The orb brightened, and droplets of light reversed their fall, threading upward into its core like silver fish returning to a midnight sea. [534]  
Outside, thunder broke; clouds parted to reveal a corridor of dawn climbing across the horizon. [549]  
Sereya rose lighter, as though the grotto had subtracted weight equal to every citizen she had failed. [566]  
But payment remained: she must return and speak truth that would unseat her, and truth is a path steeper than any ridge. [588]  
Riall offered his arm without question, loyalty shifting from crown to woman, from ruler to pilgrim. [604]  
They turned back through the tunnels, their steps echoing like twin drums, and fireflies escorted them as torches never had. [624]  
Sereya glanced once over her shoulder at the cobalt chamber, praying it would remain radiant after her confession toppled palaces. [644]  
High on the ridge, morning scattered petals of rose and tangerine across the sky, no longer bleeding but still tender. [664]  
She breathed that color, and for the first time since coronation it did not taste like guilt. [681]  
Yet the lacy menace lingered at the edge of her awareness, a reminder that healing requires constant watchfulness. [699]  
Step after step, queen and captain descended toward a realm that would no longer recognize them, hearts aligned with the slow mending of the wounded stars. [725]
