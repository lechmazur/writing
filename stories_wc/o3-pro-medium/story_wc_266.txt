The tide hushed against the wooden pilings like a shoreline lullaby, whispering sleep over the small harbor of Nuncoll. [19]  
Boats swayed, their ropes drawing soft creaks that measured time more kindly than any clock. [34]  
On the longest pier waited the wise ferry guides, two elders whose eyes held lantern gleams even when no flame burned. [55]  
They were Calla, tall and gently persistent, and Brin, stout as a tide-worn bollard yet feather-light in voice. [73]  
Every dusk they set out on their quiet vocation, guiding foot travelers across the inlet to the veiled ridgeway that rose beyond the mist. [97]  
Tonight felt different, for a vigil in twilight had been proclaimed by the stars themselves. [112]  
When the lighthouse first winked purple, a young woman named Lis sailed in on a borrowed skiff, her brow knotted with unfinished resolve. [135]  
She carried no luggage save a leather lanyard, evidence of the hours after the leash breaks, when certainty slips free and bolts for the trees. [160]  
Calla and Brin felt the snap still vibrating in Lis's chest, as audible to them as gull cries. [178]  
Without a word, Calla presented the ferry's ticket punch with star stamp, a small brass tool etched by moon-salt. [197]  
She pressed it against Lis's palm; the punch clacked, and a starry hole glimmered on the edge of invisible paper. [217]  
Brin murmured that the fare was paid by longing alone, provided the traveler named her heart's destination. [234]  
Lis breathed once, found the word jangling in her throat, and said she sought to find where unused courage waits. [254]  
At that, the harbor exhaled, as though it too understood the quest and wished her gentle seas. [271]  
The ferry guides unmoored their flat boat, its hull painted a muted indigo that drank the gloaming. [288]  
Lis stepped aboard, and Brin steered them away from the lamplight, choosing to traverse the inlet through indirect routes forgotten by charts. [310]  
The detours curved like question marks between sandbars, and each curve hummed a different verse of dusk. [327]  
Mist slid over the gunwales, wrapping Lis in damp vellum, while Calla recited quiet lore of mariners who had misplaced their bravery and returned shining. [352]  
Lis listened, gently persistent in her silence, letting the stories root inside the star-punched space of her ticket. [370]  
Soon the boat nuzzled a spit of land few had touched, and a thin path climbed up the ridge like breath steaming from stone. [394]  
This was the threshold of the veiled ridgeway, the backbone of an ancient dune masked by heather and low cloud. [414]  
Calla handed Lis a lantern whose wick was unlit, explaining that its glow would appear only when fear stepped aside. [434]  
Brin stayed with the boat, promising they would watch the channel like doorkeepers of dream until her return. [452]  
Lis began to climb, feet slipping on petals of fog, heart thrumming louder than the surf below. [469]  
The path forked and reforked, every choice a whisper, so she followed echoes rather than directions, trusting the ferry guides' doctrine of detour. [492]  
Halfway up, she found a clearing where wind had braided grass into seats, and there lay a scatter of collars, ropes, and snapped chains. [516]  
Realization struck: every leash dies so that a creature might remember the sky, yet the courage to take the first soaring step often falls here, unused. [542]  
She knelt, placed the unlit lantern among the rusted buckles, and waited, holding still so the ridge could speak. [561]  
Minutes flowed like tides, and then, with a hush, a faint golden filament caressed the wick, blooming into steady flame. [581]  
Lis felt warmth pool under her ribs, the unused courage rising to meet its claimant, neither pushed nor summoned, simply unveiled. [602]  
She realized the vigil in twilight was not a waiting for rescue but a listening for one's own footfall returning from tomorrow. [624]  
When she stood, the lantern guided her descent, though the path no longer forked, having consented to her certainty. [643]  
At the shore, Brin punched a second star beside the first, sealing the passage with quiet pride. [660]  
Calla whispered that courage never vanishes; it only waits where leashes empty, and travelers who walk obliquely can always retrieve it. [681]  
The ferry glided home, lullabying the inlet with its wake, while Lis rested against the gunwale and watched new constellations blossom inside the punched stars. [706]  
Somewhere behind them, chains rusted peacefully, and somewhere ahead, the ridgeway gleamed, hidden yet known, a promise carried on brine and moon. [728]
