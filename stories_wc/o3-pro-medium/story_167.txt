Midori Yan, an uncommonly typical yet dutiful scholar, checked into the capsule hotel reserved for time travelers.<words>17</words>
Its corridor hum vibrated like a dormant chronometer, though the night outside Tokyo was windless.<words>32</words>
Tomorrow she would sit for the Interdimensional Ethics Final, the test determining who may safeguard history.<words>48</words>
But calm before exams always disguised the stir of her unspoken heart.<words>60</words>
Hidden under her pillow lay a small wire coil, seemingly mundane yet humming with illicit narrative energy.<words>77</words>
The coil was contraband because it could capture and replay memories unsanctioned by the Temporal Ministry.<words>93</words>
Midori intended to smuggle a forbidden tale from a forgotten poet whose verses had been erased.<words>109</words>
She believed that history without poetry was a sterile river where no soul could drink.<words>124</words>
Still, contamination of approved timelines carried penalties, so she rehearsed caution like ritual breathing.<words>138</words>
Inside her capsule she pressed the coil to her ear, hoping for a whisper, but silence persisted.<words>155</words>
Protocol required any illicit device be activated by the echo of a voice in an old well.<words>172</words>
That well lay two centuries back, beneath the teahouse where the poet once listened to cranes.<words>188</words>
Time travel students were forbidden excursions on exam eve, but her motive outweighed regulation.<words>202</words>
She slipped from the pod, floor lights dimming like respectful conspirators.<words>213</words>
Sensors mapped her breath, yet she threaded between them with the scholar's practiced geometry.<words>227</words>
In the lobby, a holographic receptionist recited curfew clauses, but Midori answered with polite nods and kept walking.<words>245</words>
Outside, night air tasted of neon and forgotten blossoms, and gravity felt generous enough for earthbound flight.<words>262</words>
She reached the maintenance shaft that served time tourists as an emergency portal and dialed minus 217 years.<words>280</words>
Reality folded politely, leaving her kneeling before the moonlit well in Edo's outskirts.<words>293</words>
She leaned over the stone lip and whispered the first line the Ministry had censored, letting it fall inward.<words>312</words>
The abyss returned her words braided with the poet's voice, a living echo that magnetized the coil.<words>329</words>
Verse coursed through copper loops, blooming images of plum shadows and war widows into Midori's mind.<words>345</words>
Tears welled, not from sorrow but from the sudden expansion of rooms she had kept locked.<words>361</words>
She knew now she would contaminate the authorized curriculum, substituting one safe paragraph with this dangerous beauty.<words>378</words>
The penalty might be expulsion to prehistory, yet the unspoken heart inside her demanded nothing less.<words>394</words>
She reopened the portal, carrying both coil and echo back toward the capsule hotel's sterile corridors.<words>410</words>
As the timeline stitched behind her, dawn prepared its soft drums, signaling the calm before the crucial test.<words>428</words>
Midori returned to her pod, heart racing like a grounded bird that still remembers sky.<words>443</words>
She slid the coil beneath her examination notes, confident that tomorrow, history would feel a plume of secret wind.<words>462</words>
And in that almost silent breeze, every uncommonly typical soul might finally lift.<words>475</words>
