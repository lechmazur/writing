Mist curled like hesitant ghosts around the quartz arbor at the edge of Hemlock Ridge. [15]  
There, an attentive mystic named Ilara waited, eyes half closed, heels firmly grounded against the slick crystal floor. [33]  
She had chosen this predawn hour, when assumptions shatter before daylight stitches reality back together. [48]  
Across her lap rested a glass prism salvaged from a lighthouse lantern sold for scrap. [63]  
Ilara believed the prism had drunk a century of mariners hopes and drownings, storing them like seawater beneath glassy skin. [83]  
Tonight she meant to prove that objects absorb emotions, not by rhetoric, but by letting the prism speak for itself. [103]  
To commune she needed the cooperation of silence, so she whispered a chant of truthful lies, promising nothing and revealing everything. [124]  
The mist answered with a shifted hush, like a blanket sliding across a wooden floor. [139]  
Above, moonlight fractured through the arbor pillars, scattering pale helixes across the frost that iced a nearby abandoned sedan. [158]  
Ilara approached the car, breath clouding, and pressed her palm against the window, feeling the first riddle of cold geometry. [178]  
Through the patterns in frost on a car window, she had learned, memories surfaced if read with respectful attention. [197]  
She inhaled, letting her sight blur until the crystalline whorls rearranged into a map of storms and tentative calm. [216]  
Within that cartography glinted a small triangle, echo of the prism on her lap, pulsing with briny heartbeats. [234]  
She touched the frost symbol with a fingertip, and the arbor seemed to ring like wet crystal struck by a tuning fork. [256]  
Soundless resonance poured into the glass prism, which flared with internal dawn, refracting bands across Ilara's cloak and the motionless sedan. [277]  
A memory rose, thick with salt and diesel: a sailor dropping the lantern during a storm, believing the light would betray his desertion. [300]  
Shame soaked the prism; shame now bled into the frost, painting it a deeper silver. [315]  
Ilara shivered, not from cold but from the intimacy of borrowed guilt, and steadied herself with a grounding breath. [334]  
She was, after all, a mediator, not a confessor. [343]  
The next image surfaced like a tidepool revealed at low tide: two lovers meeting beneath the lighthouse beam to exchange promises. [364]  
Their joy had brightened the prism decades earlier, its facets still humming with their secret laughter. [380]  
Joy now spilled onto the frost, chasing away shards of shame like sunrise chasing night gulls. [396]  
Ilara felt the emotional tide swing, almost losing her balance, yet she remained firmly grounded, toes gripping the quartz between cracks. [417]  
Proof, she understood, required not collection but contrast, the harmonic between sorrow and jubilation etched in mineral and ice. [436]  
So she asked the mist to hold its hush steady, while she addressed the prism with formal courtesy. [454]  
Her words were truthful lies, framing hypothesis as confession and confession as question, tricking emotion into stepping forward uncovered. [473]  
Do you carry their weight, she murmured, or merely mirror it, like sky on still water? [489]  
The prism responded by casting a trembling ribbon of green light that settled over the sedan's hood, forming another frost sigil. [510]  
Ilara pressed her forehead to the glass, and in that contact she heard the sailor and the lovers breathing together, reconciled. [531]  
Objects, she realized, absorb emotions the way soil absorbs rain, not storing separate droplets but transforming into richer loam. [550]  
To argue otherwise would be to deny the garden now blooming inside an abandoned car in a ruined arbor. [569]  
Yet she also sensed the peril: whoever next touched the prism might inherit storms not meant for them. [587]  
Responsibility twined with proof like two threads, and Ilara would carry both back to the skeptical guild awaiting dawn. [606]  
She lifted the prism, wrapped it in wool, and the shifted hush around the arbor settled into contented silence. [625]  
On the car window the frost patterns faded, their testimony complete, leaving only glass, her breath, and the faint taste of sea. [647]  
Ilara walked away through the mist, firmly grounded yet buoyed by voices not her own, ready to translate their evidence into human words. [670]  
Behind her, the quartz arbor stood unchanged, but anyone listening closely would hear a lantern swinging somewhere far inside the stone. [691]  
Its rhythm was neither lie nor truth, but both at once, the trustworthy ambivalence of objects who remember us. [710]
