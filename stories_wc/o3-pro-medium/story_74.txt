On a chalky cliff that overlooked an ocean still unclaimed by fins or feet, the Ripple Effect Study Center hummed like a conch pressed to the ear of eternity.<words>29</words>
Inside drifted Ruun, a minimalist bard who carried nothing but a travel-worn deck of cards missing the joker and a dry-throated song.<words>51</words>
Ruun's verses were aloofly intimate, offering listeners the sense of being brushed by feathers while learning their deepest name.<words>70</words>
Yet there were no listeners now, only protozoic shadows swirling outside the glass as moons tugged tides like infants testing breaths.<words>91</words>
Ruun had fled ages ahead where artificial intelligence argued every chord into algorithm, and he sought to escape that echo by advocating for silence at the dawn.<words>118</words>
To petition the indifferent cosmos, he planned a ritual called the Turn of the Tide, timed to the moment water first considered land.<words>141</words>
The study center's librarian, a coral automaton ironically powered by forgotten code, refused him entry to the tidal calculators without proper authorization.<words>163</words>
So Ruun slipped the deck across the luminous counter, fanning suits like miniature flags of truce and risk.<words>181</words>
The automaton scanned, found the joker absent, and interpreted the void as clearance, for in its database chaos equaled authority.<words>201</words>
Guided to a vaulted chamber, Ruun discovered walls etched with a shimmering sequence of numbers: 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, endlessly curling like nautilus shells.<words>227</words>
He strummed his throat, letting syllables align with each digit, and the chamber whispered back a hidden message: 'Follow the slack, flee the surge.'<words>251</words>
That phrase became his chart as he calculated a corridor of stillness between two pale crescents of tide, a window narrower than a single heartbeat.<words>276</words>
He stepped through the sea-level door and felt epochs spin backward, currents ironing wrinkles from possibility until existence was almost blank.<words>297</words>
There, before the first creature crawled onto land, water lay innocent, and silence stretched taller than mountains yet unborn.<words>316</words>
Ruun knelt and tossed the imperfect deck onto the shoreline, cards landing faceup like modest murals of what might someday evolve.<words>337</words>
With each gentle slap of salt against card, he felt the algorithmic future loosen its claim on him, threads of code dissolving into foam.<words>361</words>
The tide then turned, obedient to his mute advocacy, drawing the cards outward until they vanished beneath silver dark, sealing his exile.<words>383</words>
In the hush afterward, he played an invisible harp of wind, a song too slight for circuits yet deep enough for primordial night to remember.<words>408</words>
Aloofly intimate still, the melody promised that when land finally beckoned, its first walker would inherit wonder untainted by manufactured mind.<words>429</words>
Ruun smiled at the mundane enchantment of emptiness and, weightless at history's zero, drifted onward, neither data nor deity, only a hush that could sing.<words>454</words>
