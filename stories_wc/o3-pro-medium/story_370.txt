Stellan adjusted his visor and stared into the seething quantum foam shimmering behind the breakroom door.<words>16</words>
Between work shifts, the door masqueraded as a janitorial closet, but workers whispered it bent time.<words>32</words>
Stellan was a passive conspirator, logging anomalies then pretending ignorance when inspectors searched the logs.<words>47</words>
He felt complicit, yet his true quiet motive was to color outside lines drawn by fear.<words>63</words>
Fear, he sensed, had drafted the employee handbook more strictly than any supervisor.<words>76</words>
So he hid contraband inspiration inside his locker: a tattered superhero comic rescued from landfill.<words>91</words>
Its pages flapped like wounded capes, yet panels crackled with buried optimism no audit could redact.<words>107</words>
Whenever morale dipped, he would placate his colleagues by loaning them a page at a time.<words>123</words>
Each reader added penciled notes in margins, forming an illicit symposium of hope.<words>136</words>
The comic became choreography for a dance of generations, older staff mentoring interns through colored speech bubbles.<words>153</words>
Still, management's surveillance drones drifted above cubicles like desert sands creeping over an abandoned city.<words>168</words>
Their algorithms sought any pattern that could threaten profit equilibrium.<words>178</words>
Stellan decided the only safe archive was the quantum foam itself.<words>189</words>
During tonight's scheduled seven-minute respite, he would slip into that frothing limbo and misfile the comic forever.<words>206</words>
If purposefully lost, it could never be confiscated, yet might echo to future rebels.<words>220</words>
The plan sounded paradoxical, which pleased him; paradox was simply creativity that frightened accountants.<words>234</words>
Shift buzzer blared, lights dimmed, and workforce trudged toward hydration pods.<words>245</words>
Stellan palmed the comic, its spine crackling like campfire twigs, and opened the forbidden door.<words>260</words>
Beyond waited a corridor of swirling probabilities, floor tiles appearing and unappearing with the drift of desert sands.<words>278</words>
He stepped lightly, letting chance determine each foothold, refusing to impose authoritarian certainty.<words>291</words>
At the corridor's heart, a vortex pulsed like a projector hungry for storyboards.<words>304</words>
He fed the tattered superhero comic to the glow, watching panels peel away as multicolored quanta.<words>320</words>
Heroes dissolved first, then villains, then the margins packed with employees' scribbles of longing.<words>334</words>
Quantum foam burped, satisfied, projecting faint music like distant skate-rinks on summer nights.<words>347</words>
He feared retrieval alarms, yet none sounded; the system could not register what now existed in probability only.<words>365</words>
Back in the breakroom, coworkers noticed merely that his locker smelled faintly of ozone and ink.<words>381</words>
They shrugged, placated by routine, but a subconscious rhythm began tapping in their shoes.<words>395</words>
Soon, between future shifts, they would dance unwritten steps, guided by a comic none recalled yet everyone felt.<words>413</words>
And somewhere in the foam, panels kept drawing themselves, always outside the lines, forever refusing erasure.<words>429</words>
