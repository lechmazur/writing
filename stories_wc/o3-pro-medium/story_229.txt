The moonless night draped velvet shadows over the sailing ship graveyard where splintered masts pierced the sky like frozen prayers. <words>20</words>
Among their creaking skeletons wandered Oren Larke, a mildly curious inventor drawn by more questions than convictions. <words>37</words>
He carried a pearl-encrusted ring box whose hinges chimed softly, as though tiny oceans resonated within its lacquered heart. <words>56</words>
The box was not his but the last relic of Selene, his vanished friend who had once trusted him with an impossible promise. <words>79</words>
She had asked him to reconstruct the past she refused to describe, saying only that the shards would explain themselves if arranged rightly. <words>102</words>
Her guidance, philosophically absurd yet oddly practical, was to follow rain patterns the way astronomers follow constellations. <words>119</words>
So Oren charted storms on vellum, letting drops bloom into inkblot maps that pointed here, to this desolate flotilla. <words>138</words>
Tonight, distant thunder sounded like broken cannons, and the salty wind carried a secret, hushed but urgent. <words>155</words>
Oren touched the ring box, feeling his heartbeat resonate with its quiet ticking, and knew the moment had arrived. <words>174</words>
A single gull alighted on a toppled helm, staring at him as if deputized by gods who preferred riddles to commandments. <words>195</words>
He whispered, 'Selene, show me,' believing the bird might carry the sound backward through time to her listening absence. <words>214</words>
Rain began, not in sheets, but in meticulous syllables, tapping hulls like a language half remembered from dreams. <words>232</words>
He raised a copper umbrella rigged with phonautograph needles that scribbled the drops' intervals onto wax cylinders. <words>249</words>
The pattern spelled coordinates of memory, and when he aligned them with rusted compasses, deck planks groaned open like theatrical curtains. <words>270</words>
Below, two preserved cabins faced each other across a flooded corridor, still furnished for a voyage that never completed its first dawn. <words>292</words>
Within one cabin hung Selene's childhood portrait; within the other lay an untouched journal titled 'Instructions for the Future That Already Happened'. <words>314</words>
Oren opened the journal, and the ink rose off the pages like mist, coalescing into Selene's shape beside him. <words>333</words>
She was translucent starlight, yet her voice was dense with gravity when she whispered the secret they had shared as children. <words>354</words>
'Promise me you will remember what never occurred, so the world stays large enough for impossible things,' she murmured. <words>373</words>
His throat trembled because honoring a paradox felt heavier than any anchor, yet he nodded, accepting the absurd dignity of her request. <words>395</words>
He placed the pearl-encrusted ring box between them, and the rain intensified, striking it like a choir hammering a cosmic bell. <words>416</words>
Its lid opened of its own accord, releasing a note made of condensed moonlight that resonated with their identical heartbeats. <words>436</words>
The note unfolded into a horizon, and together they stepped through, reconstructing the past not by fixing it but by keeping it unfinished. <words>459</words>
Behind them, the graveyard of ships sighed shut, the rain ceased, and the secret settled into the tides like living mica. <words>480</words>
