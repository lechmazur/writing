Worn boots dragged dust as the town-weary traveler approached the abandoned carnival house of mirrors at dusk.<words>17</words>
He had crossed counties under a tone of hammered repose, every step muffling thoughts he could no longer bear.<words>36</words>
Inside, corrugated laughter still echoed in the chromium walls, an intentionally accidental resonance left by fleeing carnies.<words>53</words>
He sought this glittering ruin to escape the confines of one's mind, a maze outside to disarm the maze within.<words>73</words>
Moonlight splintered through a stained glass panel propped against cracked rails, tossing jeweled shards across the mirrored floor.<words>91</words>
The traveler touched the panel, and crimson blues converged to birth pinpoints of fire he called the cradle of sparks.<words>111</words>
Every spark reflected infinitely, making galaxies of delusion that he hoped would overwrite the villages he had disappointed.<words>129</words>
Yet the mirrors also returned his own eyes, unflinching, like creditors.<words>140</words>
To silence them, he decided to fertilize new visions, the way forgotten farmers seed winter fields with ash.<words>158</words>
He lifted shards of the panel and scattered them across the room, each landing with a brittle hymn.<words>176</words>
But the mirrors refused passivity, warping to focus every shard-light onto a single metal sign that still hung outside.<words>195</words>
Sea gusts curled through broken shutters, and the sign began tapping like a metronome for unspoken confession.<words>212</words>
Its rhythm, via the tapping of a metal sign swinging in coastal wind, dictated the traveler’s next breath.<words>230</words>
He inhaled on the downbeat, exhaled on the rise, forging an accidental intentionality that steadied trembling wrists.<words>247</words>
With composure hammered into him like a rivet, he spoke to the mirrored galaxies, promising to release them if they released him.<words>269</words>
The sparks dimmed, and the house fell into the hush before someone finally says, "I love you," though no mouth moved.<words>290</words>
In that pregnant silence, he felt his thoughts slide off their rails, leaving room for something unnamed to grow.<words>309</words>
Outside, gulls snapped at sky-motes, and the sign kept time like a blacksmith counting strikes.<words>324</words>
He realized the sound itself was a message: runaway, yes, but run toward, not from.<words>339</words>
Gathering the remaining shards, he fashioned a crude compass, its needle a sliver that aligned with unseen lightning offshore.<words>358</words>
That flash existed only in potential, a distant cradle of sparks promising orientation beyond mirrored self-regard.<words>374</words>
He stepped through a buckled doorway, boots ringing like coins against metal sheets, and let the compass pull him into storm.<words>395</words>
Behind him, the mirrors swallowed the carnival’s final glimmer, content that both prisoner and jailer had agreed on parole.<words>414</words>
And somewhere between thunderclap and heartbeat, the traveler heard a voice he could not name whisper, at last, 'Love yourself first'.<words>435</words>
