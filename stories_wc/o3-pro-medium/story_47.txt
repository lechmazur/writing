Silence pressed like velvet when Lon, the dutiful ward of Tremayne Theater, entered its soundless sanctuary. <words>16</words>
He relished that hush, though his heart beat with eagerly jaded impatience for the day's strange auditions. <words>33</words>
The directors sought performers to inhabit death itself, and Lon intended to solve that casting conundrum personally. <words>50</words>
Tucked in his coat pocket rested a worn leather glove, frayed fingers whispering reminders of unfinished promises. <words>67</words>
It belonged to Ms. Tremayne, the late grand doyenne whose will decreed Lon protect the theatre from oblivion. <words>85</words>
Protecting, however, now meant transformationâ€”reframing the familiar planks, lights, and lines into a final, fearless laugh at mortality. <words>103</words>
Lon's plan unfolded throughout auditions like shadow choreography no choreographer authored. <words>114</words>
He had stolen seven ancient flip phones from the prop cellar, each still able to record rasping voice notes. <words>133</words>
Backstage, he whispered scripts of cryptic encouragement into them, disguising his timbre with playful coughs and sighs. <words>150</words>
During every audition, one stolen phone, hidden beneath the boards, would ring out with those haunting instructions. <words>167</words>
Actors thought mysterious judges were guiding them; Lon watched their improvised dread bloom into graceless beauty. <words>183</words>
Some quivered, some danced, all unconsciously rehearsing the theatre's impending resurrection scene. <words>195</words>
Yet the glove's empty shape in his pocket insisted that mere performance was insufficient. <words>209</words>
He needed the audience itself to gasp, grasp, and finally giggle at dying, exactly as Ms. Tremayne had. <words>227</words>
On closing night of auditions, Lon locked the theatre doors, converting hopeful performers into unwitting conspirators. <words>243</words>
He issued a final batch of voice notes: 'The stage is hollow; tap thrice; descend; greet the quiet.' <words>261</words>
Curiosity eclipsed caution, and they pried up the boards to reveal the long-abandoned orchestra pit Lon had prepared. <words>279</words>
Within, candles flickered around mirrors painted with skeletal smiles, while speakers replayed their own earlier gasps on loop. <words>297</words>
The familiar theatre now reframed itself as a mausoleum, yet pulsed with living, terrified rhythm. <words>312</words>
Actors screamed, then laughed at the absurd echo, realizing no greater judge existed than mortality mocking back. <words>329</words>
Their collective laughter filled the soundless sanctuary without shattering its hush, somehow making the silence audible. <words>345</words>
Lon stepped forward, glove raised like a wilted standard, announcing the auditions complete and the cast eternal. <words>362</words>
He slipped the glove onto one hand, feeling Ms. Tremayne's ghost press his knuckles approvingly. <words>377</words>
In that graceless beauty, audience, actors, and ward bowed together, united by the solved riddle of fear. <words>394</words>
Lon exhaled, a thin whistle cracking the hush, his final fearless laugh at mortality delivered. <words>409</words>
Then lights died, phones fell silent, and the sanctuary kept watch over the reframed familiar, endlessly alive. <words>426</words>
