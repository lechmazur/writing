The blackout began with a hush so dense that even electricity seemed to forget its own existence.<words>17</words>
On the seventeenth floor of the floating cloud cafe, candles fluttered like timid suns above drifting tables.<words>34</words>
I was there because Echo, my soft-voiced guide, insisted that we meet where gravity took holidays.<words>50</words>
Her embroidered vest caught the candlelight, each stitched constellation pulsing as though charting roads to vanished stars.<words>67</words>
Despite the blackout, she radiated a zeal that felt like sunrise wearing velvet gloves.<words>81</words>
Echo believed that partnerships, when kept quiet, were constantly rare and therefore more resilient than shouted alliances.<words>98</words>
Tonight, she whispered, our partnership would trap a sound no ear had ever recorded.<words>112</words>
She called it the scream of silent plains, a paradox she wanted to harness before dawn asked questions.<words>130</words>
To reach that distant landscape of hush, we had taken a different train than usual, one that ran on forgotten timetables.<words>151</words>
The carriage windows had shown only matte darkness, as if the world were refusing to look back at us.<words>170</words>
Now, suspended among vaporous balconies, we waited for the plains' mute cry to ripple through the cafe's buoyant beams.<words>189</words>
Music had stopped, generators had sighed off, but our pulses drummed a metronome of blissful agony.<words>205</words>
Echo closed her eyes and pressed her palm against the vest's center, inviting me to do the same.<words>223</words>
The threads were warm, vibrating with stories of needle and night, and under them something deeper quivered.<words>240</words>
A tremor, inaudible yet monumental, traveled from cloth to bone, erasing the difference between fabric and flesh.<words>257</words>
I realized the scream we sought was never meant for ears; it was a message carved in shared silence.<words>276</words>
Its letters were pulses, and reading them required two heartbeats beating as one undetectable line.<words>291</words>
That necessity confirmed Echo's doctrine of quiet partnerships, for without my pulse hers stuttered, and mine alone was ungrammatical.<words>310</words>
Together we translated the tremor: a map pointing inward, instructing wandering souls to return to the body they abandoned.<words>329</words>
The moment we understood, the cafe brightened not with light but with weight, settling gently onto unseen stilts.<words>347</words>
Patrons gasped in relief, mistaking the shift for restored power, while Echo and I knew power had turned inward.<words>366</words>
She unbuttoned the embroidered vest and draped it over my shoulders, a coronation of anonymity and responsibility.<words>383</words>
Wear this, she murmured, so the next train you choose will remember to veer off the usual tracks.<words>401</words>
Her instruction felt like a promise and a sentence, blissful because entrusted, agony because inescapable.<words>416</words>
Yet zeal rose inside me, not shouting, just blossoming like soundless thunder rolling over the remembered plains.<words>433</words>
Outside the panoramic windows, clouds parted, revealing miles of night grass that bowed but never rustled.<words>449</words>
Their voiceless scream had been harvested, and for the first time the silence sounded complete.<words>464</words>
Echo smiled, softer than ever, guiding me toward the stairway that led nowhere yet promised everything.<words>480</words>
