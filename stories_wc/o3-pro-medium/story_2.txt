My name is Celestine Graves, a skeptical spiritual medium who reads doubts as others read palms.<words>16</words>
I had traveled, in brazen humility, to an iridescent cave inside a giant crystal geode rumored to hum with extinct alphabets.<words>37</words>
The hush when a roller coaster stalls at its peak floated above the tourist park outside, granting the cavern an improbable stillness.<words>59</words>
I came motivated to learn forgotten crafts that even ghosts had misplaced in their rattling memories.<words>75</words>
Yet mists of uncertainty seeped from every prismed wall, peculiarly frequent and smelling faintly of old library corridors.<words>93</words>
Guided only by the scent of a new book, I followed the freshest whiff the way others pursue bread from a bakery.<words>115</words>
It led me to a pedestal where a centaur horseshoe engraved with shimmering runes rested like a fallen crescent moon.<words>135</words>
Legend insisted the artifact could strengthen any discipline, provided the seeker acknowledged disbelief as devoutly as belief.<words>152</words>
I scoffed, then apologized to the silence, because skepticism pays better interest when seeded with courtesy.<words>168</words>
When my fingers touched the metalline curve, the cave shivered, and runic sparks assembled into a parchment vortex.<words>186</words>
Pages drifted around me, illegible until I inhaled their crisp aroma, each gulp translating sigils into instructions for weaving echoes or bottling sunrise.<words>209</words>
Astounded, I realized the knowledge emerged only while the roller coaster above remained stalled, its passengers suspended between terror and thrill, amplifying liminal tension.<words>233</words>
The mists of uncertainty thickened, demanding an offering harsher than politeness.<words>244</words>
In brazen humility I recited the one doubt I had never spoken: that my mediumship was mostly cold reading and lucky pattern matching.<words>267</words>
The vortex swallowed the confession like wine, and the horseshoe flared, stamping a blazing rune upon my palm.<words>285</words>
Pain unfurled into resolve, and I sensed every craft I might now revive would carry the aftertaste of that honesty.<words>305</words>
The pages settled into a single codex bound by crystalline veins, its cover forever smelling like the first cracking open of possibility.<words>327</words>
As the roller coaster finally roared downward, the silence shattered, the mists recoiled, and daylight fractured through the geode, scattering rainbow ghosts of doubt and promise.<words>353</words>
I left the cave clutching the codex and the centaur horseshoe, both now cool as humility and bright as brazenness.<words>373</words>
Every few steps, the rune on my palm pulsed, peculiarly frequent, reminding me that uncertainty can be a more obedient guide than certainty ever was.<words>398</words>
I headed toward the world, ready to strengthen it by unearthing its lost arts one honest breath at a time.<words>418</words>
