The quartz-eye mender arrived at dawn, limping across cracked tiles toward the orchard that now flooded the old cathedral. [19]
Apple boughs arched from rafters like green chandeliers, their roots burrowing through collapsed pews and pulpit alike. [36]
He had helped plant the first seedlings years earlier, intending only to hide evidence after the breach of contract with the Restorers Guild. [59]
Now the orchard had overgrown its secrecy, whispering sweet scented confessions beneath stained glass suns. [74]
Seraphin, as he still called himself, carried a weathered satchel and his daughter's hair ribbon tied round the strap. [93]
The ribbon's faded lilac reminded him that some repairs were impossible, others merely unattempted. [107]
He paused beneath an arch where vines hung like curtains and felt the quartz sphere embedded in his left socket cool against bone. [130]
That artificial eye had once belonged to a chalice; he had cut it free to save a child from shattered glass. [151]
Such meddling violated the Guild's rigid contract, yet his conscience, endearingly feisty like the rescued girl, refused apology. [169]
The penalty had been lifelong exile, a verdict signed on vellum leaves popularly known as deciduous vows. [186]
Those vows crackled in autumn, shedding from city notice boards like guilt-colored maple scraps, erasing his name with the season. [206]
But memory clung to him thicker than sap. [214]
He had returned today because rumor said a new breach loomed, this time threatening the orchard itself. [231]
The Guild planned to raze the cathedral, claim the growing timber, and finally bury the scandal of his defiance. [250]
Seraphin pushed deeper, seeking the bell tower where the oldest trunks knotted around iron stays like protective serpents. [268]
Halfway up a spiral of roots and broken stairs, he heard footfalls lighter than falling petals. [284]
A girl appeared, perhaps twelve, freckles spattered across her nose like dawn on stone. [298]
She wore an apprentice's smock and carried pruning shears bigger than her arms. [311]
Eyes bright, she demanded, 'Are you the tree thief or the tree doctor?' [324]
Seraphin answered truthfully that he was a mender of whatever broke, people included. [337]
The girl introduced herself as Liora, newest recruit of the Guild, secretly rooting for the orchard to survive. [355]
Her loyalty, she confided, was complicated; her grandmother had tended these very branches before the cathedral collapsed. [372]
Seraphin unfastened the lilac ribbon and offered it, saying it once belonged to his own daughter, another silent caretaker. [391]
He hoped the gesture might bridge generational wisdom, knotting past grief to future resolve. [405]
Liora tied the ribbon around her sleeve like a commander's sash, suddenly looking even more endearingly feisty. [422]
Together they climbed until daylight shimmered through the belfry and fruit hung overhead like planets in an upside-down sky. [441]
There, the trees groaned, stressed by their own weight and by sabotage scars left from preliminary Guild cuts. [459]
Seraphin knelt, opened his satchel, and realized he had forgotten what lay inside since exile began. [475]
Yet the orchard needed him to persist, using forgotten bag contents the way seasons repurpose fallen leaves. [492]
He spread the contents on a flattened branch: copper twine, shards of colored glass, a broken tuning fork, and a spool of grafting tape. [516]
Memories fluttered like startled birds, and accidental wisdom perched quietly beside them. [528]
He wound copper twine around cracked limbs, inserted glass shards where bark had been gouged, letting sunlight refract into healing warmth. [549]
The tuning fork, struck, vibrated through trunks, aligning their resonant fibers the way choirs once tuned to sacred bells. [568]
Liora followed every motion, securing grafting tape where sap bled, repeating his instructions aloud so roots could overhear. [586]
When the work ended, twilight painted the orchard bronze, and branches sighed with lighter relief. [601]
Drifting petals clung to Seraphin's coat like signatures reaffirming once-shredded deciduous vows. [613]
He realized the contract's breach had not exiled him; it had planted him where renewal was most needed. [631]
Liora asked what payment he required, her voice trembling between childhood and command. [644]
Seraphin tapped his quartz eye and answered that he would charge only stories, for stories never violated any contract worth keeping. [665]
Under the rustling canopy, they traded tales until stars speckled the shattered ceiling, bridging eras the way light bridges glass. [685]
Somewhere below, city officials measured walls for demolition, oblivious to the quiet graft already binding wood, stone, and will. [704]
Tomorrow might bring axes, but tonight the cathedral echoed with new roots and shared, accidental wisdom. [720]
Seraphin and Liora, guardians unrecorded, watched petals fall like blessings, knowing they too would persist until the last vow leaf dropped. [741]
