The tectonic plate edge of Veridon hummed with quiet threat, yet our family unfurled the checkered blanket anyway.<words>18</words>
It was picnic day, as fixed in our bones as the legendary hourglass that guarded the cliff, forever tipping then resetting its sand.<words>41</words>
Grandmother said eating here kept death distracted, a possibly impossible bargain struck generations ago.<words>55</words>
I never doubted her until the slapdash bard arrived, lute missing strings, eyes sparkling like spilled ink.<words>72</words>
He bowed with comic flourish and presented a tarnished brass doorplate engraved with the family surname, Malorene.<words>89</words>
No door in sight, yet the plate felt heavier than the cliff itself.<words>102</words>
The bard claimed the plate once marked a sacred space beyond any temple, a hinge between breathing and not.<words>121</words>
He had come to disrupt our tradition, he said, for traditions rot when unquestioned.<words>135</words>
Father laughed with melancholic glee, a brittle sound snatched by ocean wind rising from the abyssal scar below.<words>153</words>
He invited the bard to sit, share bread, and taste why our family still breathed.<words>168</words>
While crumbs danced across the blanket, the hourglass atop its basalt pedestal flipped itself, crystalline grains beginning anew.<words>186</words>
I saw the bard watching the sands with feverish hunger, as though counting breaths remaining to steal.<words>203</words>
Grandmother whispered that the glass measured the distance between living and dying, and whoever overturned it owned the tally.<words>222</words>
Realization struck: the bard meant to flip it again before completion, creating a temporal stutter where death could not grip us.<words>243</words>
Such mercy sounded bright, yet the bargain required balance, and chaos would claim another space in exchange.<words>260</words>
The plate, he revealed, must be nailed into earth as a new threshold, sealing the picnic ground forever.<words>278</words>
Our family's laughter faltered, remembering songs sung here, names carved into blanket fringe, flavors echoing ancestors' tongues.<words>295</words>
Yet Father, sore of joints, wanted one more summer, and Mother, who coughed blood at night, wanted any summer at all.<words>316</words>
They agreed to the possibly impossible reprieve, signing with crumbs upon the brass.<words>329</words>
When the bard rose to hammer the doorplate, the tectonic edge quivered like a held breath.<words>345</words>
I seized his lute and struck the hourglass instead, shattering time into sunlit dust that whirled around our lunch.<words>364</words>
In that sparkle I heard every ancestor singing warnings we had ignored, and I chose to listen at last.<words>383</words>
The bard began to fade, his outline shredding like parchment caught in sea spray, payment for meddling with sacred spaces.<words>403</words>
Father pulled me close, sorrow brightening his smile, relief sobering his eyes.<words>415</words>
Around us, the cliff settled, the plate melting into harmless ore, the picnic returning to ordinary afternoon.<words>432</words>
Deaths clutch lingered, but no longer squeezed; it waited elsewhere, and we would meet it honestly someday.<words>449</words>
For now, sandwiches tasted of tears and sunshine, and that bittersweet flavor felt like living.<words>464</words>
