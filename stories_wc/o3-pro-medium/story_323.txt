Mist twirled between aerial plazas of Banyoria, the treehouse metropolis strung across giant banyans like carnival ribbons. <words>17</words>
Down one swaying walkway skipped Cala, a carefree dancer whose laughter kept rhythm with creaking ropes. <words>33</words>
She carried nothing but a single shoelace, twirling it as though it were an obliging partner. <words>49</words>
Cala's goal, oddly predictable despite her whimsical swagger, was to collect sacred practices whispered through the canopy. <words>66</words>
Legends claimed those practices fluttered like invisible birds, ready to perch in any earnest heart. <words>81</words>
Yet earnest hearts were rare up here because everyone preferred lunchtime acrobatics over reflection. <words>95</words>
So Cala resolved to scour the banyan labyrinth until wisdom surrendered. <words>106</words>
Her method, advised by a dubious fortune-teller, was to navigate through misguided wishes as if they were signposts. <words>124</words>
Each wish hung in a glowing bubble beside the walkways, offering absurd directions like 'Turn left at yesterday' or 'Applaud every silence'. <words>146</words>
Embracing the absurd, Cala followed them faithfully, because defiance would only make the universe sulk. <words>161</words>
Meanwhile, the entire metropolis pulsed in present tense while the final seeds are planted in a forgotten field below. <words>180</words>
That simultaneity lent every treetop shadow a phosphorescent edge, giving the air a tone of phantasmal humor. <words>197</words>
Cala giggled when a ghostly punchline rustled the leaves, though no joke had been told. <words>212</words>
The first sacred practice arrived disguised as a hiccup that made passersby bow politely before sneezing in unison. <words>230</words>
Cala caught the etiquette of synchronized sneezes on her single shoelace, knotting the wisdom so it would not escape. <words>249</words>
Predictably, the bubble of the next wish floated by exactly when her hands were free, instructing, 'Lose your shadow to find your spine'. <words>272</words>
She shrugged, stepped sideways, and her shadow sauntered off like a bored understudy, leaving her lighter but oddly predictable in every motion. <words>294</words>
Now able to foresee each of her own twirls, Cala weaponized anticipation, whirling through branches with clockwork grace. <words>312</words>
She scoured the upper atriums, gathering rites of bubble-blowing benedictions, leaf-reading lullabies, and acorn applause, all tied in careful loops upon the shoelace. <words>335</words>
Every loop glowed, illuminating her path as the sun set like a dim idea nobody quite remembered wishing for. <words>354</words>
Beneath her, the forgotten field exhaled, for the last seed settled and the present finally exhaled with it. <words>372</words>
Time rippled upward, trembling the banyan bridges, and Cala sensed the absurd door she'd been dancing around all day. <words>391</words>
Without hesitation she threaded her radiant shoelace through an invisible keyhole, bowed with flourish, and executed a final pirouette into nothingness. <words>412</words>
Absurdity yawned wide, swallowing her collection of sacred practices, and from its echo bloomed a new walkway made of swirling color. <words>433</words>
The metropolis cheered, shadows returned, and Cala reappeared atop the walkway, carefree as ever yet carrying every solemn lesson in her grin. <words>455</words>
Nobody was surprised, because here even miracles remained oddly predictable so long as one kept dancing. <words>471</words>
Somewhere below, the forgotten field whispered thanks, and the seeds dreamed of treetops, absurdity, and shoelaces. <words>487</words>
