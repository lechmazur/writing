Salt wind sighed across the half collapsed pier as Lira knelt beside the corroded freight hatch. [16]  
She was a claustrophobic spelunker who preferred catacombs to open decks, yet tonight the sea felt narrower than stone. [35]  
Her chest fluttered in a crashing hush as waves slapped beams beneath her boots. [49]  
Somewhere below, undersea cables hummed like trapped eels, carrying the last whispers of the continent to foreign shores. [67]  
Lira listened, imagining words rubbing their copper jackets raw against barnacles. [78]  
She had come between tidal changes, the only hour when the sealed lift shaft of the forgotten research facility emerged from froth. [100]  
Her guide rope already quivered, smelling of ozone and fear. [110]  
No one had maintained the place since the blackout fifteen years ago; no one but Lira remembered its name. [129]  
That was why she had promised to stand by the unremembered, even if the unremembered were only pipes and ghosts. [149]  
Yet her real lure glittered smaller than a fingernail: a codex margin illuminant gold fleck sealed inside a quartz ampoule. [169]  
Archivists believed it to be mere decoration, but Lira knew it charted the phase transitions of silence itself. [187]  
Follow its glints correctly, and invisible things left footprints bright as lantern oil. [200]  
Lira alone tracked invisible things. [205]  
That gift had driven her into hollows most miners could not crawl through, but it had never cured her tight-throat panic. [226]  
Tonight, the map of glints told her the facility wanted her to descend, then return before the moon tugged the tide back in. [249]  
She clipped on her respirator, pressed palm to rusted panel, and the hatch shuddered open with a sigh warmer than the air. [271]  
Stairs spiraled downward, walls sweating brine that caught emergency strobes in damp auroras. [284]  
With every step she counted heartbeats to keep corridors wider inside her head. [297]  
Two levels below, the hum of undersea cables deepened to a bass drone, as though whales recited equations. [315]  
She reached a laboratory whose glass roof had fissured, letting moonlit water pulse above like a breathing ceiling. [333]  
Here the glint map shone fiercest, pointing to a console draped in seaweed filaments. [347]  
Her fingers brushed slime aside, revealing a cracked display still powered by the cables she had heard. [364]  
Data flickered: pressure logs, desalination rates, and at the center, a blue icon labeled PHASE GATE STATUS. [381]  
Lira inhaled until her ribs hurt. [387]  
The facility had studied how matter might walk through phase transitions from liquid to vapor without heat, a way to evacuate hulls during floods. [411]  
If she could restart it, the drowned archives could return, rising as mist nobody else would notice but her. [430]  
To stand by the unremembered was now literal; she would give them bodies of cloud. [445]  
She overrode safeties, rerouting power until copper stank hot. [454]  
Alarms blinked, but the crashing hush beyond the glass swallowed their beeps. [466]  
The PHASE GATE ignited, a ring of violet shimmer that rippled the lab air like desert heat above asphalt. [485]  
Mist poured from file cabinets, from keyboards, from cracks in the wall, condensing into silhouettes of technicians clutching clipboards. [504]  
They were transparent but more real to her than the living workers topside who had forgotten them. [521]  
Lira's throat tightened, yet the claustrophobia eased, replaced by the crowding comfort of shared purpose. [536]  
The silhouettes gestured toward the stairwell, urging her to return before water reclaimed the lift shaft. [552]  
She nodded, pocketed the gold fleck, and followed the flickering procession upward. [564]  
Between landings, she glanced back and saw them dissolving through phase transitions, drifting along cables toward coastlines still redacted from maps. [585]  
Every foot above crushed air into thinner boxes, yet the knowledge marching beside her held the corridors wide. [603]  
She emerged onto the pier just as the tide slobbered against the hatch lip and the moon pivoted west. [622]  
Behind her the facility plunged beneath foam, swallowing its lights, sealing its new archive of vapor-bound souls. [639]  
The crashing hush of surf and cables braided into a lullaby none but Lira could hear. [655]  
She set her lantern on the boards and watched invisible footprints dry into salt, already tracking their next forgetting. [674]  
Though the night widened around her, she felt no walls, only the promise that she would be there when memory needed company again. [697]
