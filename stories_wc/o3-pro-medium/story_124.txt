Nobody expected the skittish drifter to step through the airlock of the lunar colony command center. <words>16</words>
Even the antique brass spittoon beside the telemetry consoles seemed to flinch at his arrival. <words>31</words>
He carried only a canvas sack and a pair of worn ballet shoes tied by faded ribbons. <words>48</words>
Their satin was frayed like parchment maps, yet the drifter cradled them with reverence bordering on liturgy. <words>65</words>
Commander Maeve, whose voice usually cracked meteor storms into silence, greeted him in tones of dramatically understated courtesy. <words>83</words>
She sensed purpose flickering behind his darting gaze, brass lantern light chasing minnows beneath a frozen pond. <words>100</words>
He asked for the communications loom, the ancient manual relay that stitched quantum whispers into navigable vectors. <words>117</words>
Technicians shrugged, then guided him past cobalt monitors to the loom's wooden frame salvaged from Appalachian mills. <words>134</words>
There, at the hush in a barbershop after the last trim of the day, he began. <words>150</words>
The command center's lights dimmed, imitating that closing-time lull when scissors sigh and hair falls no more. <words>167</words>
The drifter removed the ballet shoes, slipped them onto his dusty feet, and inhaled lunar dust like incense. <words>185</words>
He declared his intent to pioneer the summoning of grace, to discover the power of the subconscious mind. <words>203</words>
No one laughed, because lunar nights make mockery sound hollow and fearful. <words>215</words>
Guided by memories of mountain looms in forgotten barns, he moved by reconnecting parted threads in a loom's warp and weft. <words>236</words>
Each knot coincided with a plie, each shuttle flight with a silent pirouette across the command deck's grit. <words>254</words>
Data streams flared into aurora ribbons, aligning with his steps as though the colony itself awaited choreography. <words>271</words>
Maeve watched, feeling barn dust and moonlight mingle, a rustic refinement salted with vacuum. <words>285</words>
When the final thread met its partner, the loom hummed like bees in clover, then fell startlingly quiet. <words>303</words>
In that pause, every monitor displayed the same image: a child leaping over a creek under Earthlight. <words>320</words>
The scene belonged to none of their archives yet belonged to everyone's secret dream of first freedom. <words>337</words>
Breath caught, hearts remembered muscles, and the command crew felt themselves lighter than the gravity programmers promised. <words>354</words>
The drifter bowed with homely sincerity, the ballet shoes now glowing like coal embers in a winter stove. <words>372</words>
He whispered that subconscious rivers run beneath every crater, waiting for a loom, a dance, and listening souls. <words>390</words>
Then he departed as quietly as clippings brushed from a barber's cape, leaving only grace orbiting the room. <words>408</words>
