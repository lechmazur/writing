Abram Finch, the station's lonely ringleader, slid into the cramped ghost story recording booth, humming a carnival waltz. <words>18</words>
The flickering ON AIR bulb painted playful dread across his cheeks, as if auditioning phantoms for a smile. <words>36</words>
He waited between whispered confessions submitted by callers, shuffling a stained napkin embroidered with cryptic sigils. <words>52</words>
The napkin, the only relic to survive the carnival fire, was the inexplicable artifact he had sworn to guard. <words>71</words>
Its blotches resembled a star map but rearranged themselves whenever nobody looked, like secrets with stage fright. <words>88</words>
Abram considered this property commonly individual, a paradoxical singularity that still belonged to every wondering spectator. <words>104</words>
His ancestors had ferried similar riddles through ages, and their ancestral wisdom pulsed inside him like hidden drums. <words>122</words>
Tonight, the napkin's blotches formed a maw, warning of someone coming to steal it. <words>136</words>
Right on cue, static hissed, and a new caller breathed, 'I am the Collector, and I have arrived.' <words>154</words>
The booth lights dimmed; gravity wavered like a hesitant juggler dropping balls he never admitted holding. <words>170</words>
Abram unclipped a miniature candle, sparked it, and watched the flame float, a rebellious dancer unmoored by physics. <words>188</words>
He knew he could outmaneuver any unseen intruder by the dance of a flame in zero gravity. <words>205</words>
The flame twirled left, signaling a presence approaching from the corridor; it looped once, meaning hostile intent. <words>222</words>
Abram softened his voice into velvet, inviting the Collector to step inside the booth for an exclusive tale. <words>240</words>
While the disembodied caller pushed open the soundproof door, Abram folded the napkin into an origami eclipse. <words>257</words>
Ancestral wisdom had taught him that certain shapes could redirect hunger back upon the devourer. <words>272</words>
The Collector materialized as a frostbitten silhouette, eyes like black royalties demanding tribute. <words>285</words>
'Tell your story,' Abram chirped, needle poised above vinyl, mischief gilding terror. <words>297</words>
Drawn by vanity, the silhouette leaned toward the microphone, its voice weaving cold cobwebs over the meters. <words>314</words>
Before it finished sentence one, Abram snapped the napkin eclipse open, releasing a hush so deep it devoured echoes. <words>333</words>
The flame pirouetted right, marking the moment of reversal, and the Collector's outline inverted, folding inward like a burnt film reel. <words>354</words>
It howled but only static emerged, promptly spooled onto magnetic tape that clattered harmlessly beside the mixer. <words>371</words>
Abram sealed the tape in a tin labeled 'Laugh Tracks,' the last place anyone would search for real terror. <words>390</words>
The flame dimmed, gravity returned, and the booth regained its familiar musk of coffee, ozone, and antique circus wood. <words>409</words>
Abram exhaled, scribbled another caller's number onto the stained napkin, and waited for the next hush between whispered confessions. <words>428</words>
