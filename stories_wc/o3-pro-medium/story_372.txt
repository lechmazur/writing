Rainlight drizzled neon over the stacked shanties of Vanta Block, the outermost scar of the megacity. <words>16</words>
Among rusted aerial walkways, Serin Vale moved with the curiously indifferent gait of someone already haunted by every consequence. <words>35</words>
Officially he was a nutrient cart mechanic, unofficially the lovelorn spy tracking heartbeats instead of state secrets. <words>52</words>
Tonight his target was Liora Ash, a chef whose menus could topple empires more surely than bombs. <words>69</words>
She had promised to taste her new recipe at midnight, and Serin intended to be there first. <words>86</words>
An unstoppable avalanche of black-market cartels would descend the moment her tongue confirmed success, so Serin planned escape routes instead of love notes. <words>109</words>
The slums whispered in microdrones, mirrors, and puddles, offering unfamiliar reflections of anyone bold enough to stare. <words>126</words>
Serin saw himself multiplied there, each echo slightly happier, each smile something he could never file into a dossier. <words>145</words>
He met Liora during an illegal roofwalk two months prior, both drawn by a shared interest in urban exploration. <words>164</words>
They had traded maps, flashlights, and half-guarded hopes, but Serin never surrendered the name of the avalanche chasing him. <words>183</words>
Now he slipped into her loft kitchen through a vent, clutching a single unused sticky label like a talisman. <words>202</words>
With it he meant to tag the recipe jar, warning her to flee before flavors turned fatal. <words>219</words>
But the moment he landed, Liora was already plating a shimmering cube of noodles onto her tongue. <words>236</words>
Midnight struck; taste met nerve; destiny rambled forward like an improv poet drunk on prophecy. <words>251</words>
Her pupils widened, and a grin spread that made the city look underseasoned. <words>264</words>
She began to gloat about cracking the genome of flavor itself, unaware microphones in the walls already relayed her triumph. <words>284</words>
Serin tried to speak, but the reflections on her chrome utensils showed versions of him shaking their heads. <words>302</words>
They begged silently for a courage he rarely catalogued. <words>311</words>
In that pause, drone rotors buzzed outside like distant snow, heralding the cartel's approach. <words>325</words>
To outrun the unstoppable avalanche, he seized Liora's wrist and pointed at the ceiling hatch. <words>340</words>
She tasted destiny, he tasted regret, but together they tasted urgency more vivid than any broth. <words>356</words>
They clambered into the night maze of cables, leaving the unused sticky label fluttering beside the cooling saucepan. <words>374</words>
Below, armored buyers stormed the loft, expecting perfection and instead finding only unfamiliar reflections in abandoned spoons. <words>391</words>
Serin and Liora sprinted across rooftops where holographic ads flickered like warning lights on a cosmic treadmill. <words>408</words>
Their breaths mingled, their futures tangled, and the city seemed to ramble myths about them into the power lines. <words>427</words>
Somewhere behind, snowless but unstoppable, the avalanche searched, while ahead the lovers hunted a mirror that would finally look familiar. <words>447</words>
