Orbital debris whispered against the station hull like restless ghosts when Father Osric began tonight's covert liturgy.<words>17</words>
An exorcist with stage fright, he preferred machines for pews and starshine for candles, away from crowds that expected certainty.<words>37</words>
Still, the giggling echo of children assembling plastic satellites in the workshop next door seeped through vents, reminding him audience was inevitable.<words>59</words>
He opened the battered reliquary, revealing pressed wildflowers his grandmother claimed had once pinned a demon to a meadow.<words>78</words>
Those blossoms were his inheritance of lies, yet also his only map through the labyrinth of forgotten evils drifting outside.<words>98</words>
The station floated inside a ring of broken dolls, spent boosters, and classified shards, each fragment a prayer somebody never finished.<words>119</words>
Osric's mission was to sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never', forging hope where engineers only filed insurance reports.<words>138</words>
He breathed a defiant hush into the microphone, summoning courage the way others summon spirits.<words>153</words>
Sensors spiked; a malignant signal approached, not through air but through memory, intent on nesting inside the toys mid-assembly.<words>172</words>
Osric recited verses backward, letting the syllables submerge into static until the station's locks thrummed in sympathetic vibration.<words>190</words>
By the sound of a key turning in a lock, the entity always revealed its shape, believing freedom waited beyond metal.<words>211</words>
It surged, a mosaic of orphaned software and astronaut regrets, coalescing from the orbital debris like frost on a window.<words>231</words>
Stage fright slammed Osric's throat shut, but he pressed the wildflowers to the console, remembering their scent of crushed summers.<words>251</words>
Each petal was never usual; pigments bruised by decades in vacuum now radiated the violet of dawn before language.<words>270</words>
The entity hesitated, recognizing ancestral sigils hidden in the veins, realizing the meadow it once devoured had survived in pressed silence.<words>291</words>
Osric spoke, voice cracking but firm, confessing the inheritance of lies, naming every sham miracle his family had sold to fearful towns.<words>313</words>
Truth, he gambled, was an acid demons could not stomach, and the entity recoiled as if forced to read its own autopsy.<words>335</words>
He chased the retreating code through airlocks, sealing each bay by the sound of a key turning in a lock, ritual reinvented as protocol.<words>359</words>
When silence finally settled, the children next door cheered, believing a new toy model had passed inspection, unaware an exorcism had concluded.<words>381</words>
Osric slumped, stage fright washing away with the demon, and slipped the wildflowers back into the reliquary, petals slightly brighter than before.<words>403</words>
He realized that possibility, once sculpted, does not require applause, only the courage to speak in a defiant hush and keep counting stars.<words>426</words>
