The gnarled forest village perched in twisted branches creaked like a ship in storm whenever the wind prowled underneath its rope bridges. <words>22</words>
In a mossy loft above the communal forge, I, Yara the pragmatic soothsayer, kept counsel with shadows and cooling iron. <words>42</words>
Villagers called me lavishly humble, for I wore only burlap yet spoke as if fate were a tapestry I had stitched. <words>63</words>
Their reverence was useful, but it was not why I listened to the roots singing beneath the floorboards at night. <words>83</words>
I listened because I meant to birth manufactured miracles, and I needed the forest’s forgotten rhythms to teach my hands. <words>103</words>
Across the hush of memory’s corridors, those rhythms still carried the echo of a long-forgotten song that once told trees to stand upright. <words>126</words>
If a melody could order wood, I reasoned, then a tempered note might bend storms, rivers, even bone. <words>144</words>
So I stole the blacksmith’s hammer at dusk, when sparks still floated like crimson gnats above the anvil. <words>162</words>
I needed metal to remember that song as clearly as wood remembered it, and the hammer would be my tuning fork. <words>183</words>
Each night, I struck iron to tempo with the hammer while whispering the chorus no mouth had sung for centuries. <words>203</words>
When the notes aligned, sparks froze midair like shards of sunrise, and the village trembled with dreadful hope. <words>221</words>
They thought an omen of blessing approached, yet I felt only the storm of becoming coiled in my ribs. <words>240</words>
To become a force of nature, one must first betray the quiet covenant between flesh and bark. <words>257</words>
At the seventh forging, the hammer rang so purely that leaves miles away inverted to listen. <words>273</words>
From their undersides drifted dew, gathering in the forge like a silver lung thirsty for thunder. <words>289</words>
I quenched the glowing blade I had beaten, and the dew hissed into a cloud that shaped itself into antlers of lightning. <words>311</words>
The miracle was manufactured; the weapon sang the forest’s secret hymn without a throat, vibrating through sap and marrow alike. <words>331</words>
Branches writhed, huts tilted, and the people realized the blessing had appetite. <words>343</words>
They rushed to me for prophecy, but I answered only with the hum of the blade, because prophecy had become deed. <words>364</words>
Stormclouds curled around the antlered cloud, drawn by its resonance, and rain began to fall upward into the branches. <words>383</words>
I offered the hammer back to the blacksmith, its handle scorching with new runes, and asked him to strike me as I had struck iron. <words>408</words>
He hesitated, but the village cracked above us, and survival suddenly meant obedience. <words>421</words>
The hammer fell, kissing my brow, and the blade responded with a roar that uprooted the central oak supporting every home. <words>442</words>
As wood and screams spiraled skyward, I stepped into the rainless void left behind, feeling roots, wind, and water submit to my pulse. <words>465</words>
I had manufactured myself, at last, into the dreadful hope the forest would never dare to forget. <words>482</words>
