<story>
The poison taster named Vireo descended the spiral stairs toward the subterranean waterfall, chasing the serene upheaval he believed would finally silence his yearning for death. <words>26</words>
His leather pouch carried nothing but a simple cloth bookmark, frayed at the edge where earlier venom had eaten the dye into ghostly runes. <words>50</words>
The bookmark was his membership token in a hidden society of cartographers who mapped energy flows beneath cities instead of streets, a strangely compelling vocation. <words>75</words>
They sought momentary convergences where power, poison, and prophecy bound together like braided lightning, and Vireo was tonight's observer. <words>94</words>
He had learned the rendezvous time by interpreting frantic calls to talk-radio psychics, who unknowingly broadcast seismic whispers from the underworld between advertisements for garden hoses. <words>120</words>
Each caller's tremor pointed him, like a divining needle, to this cavern where water fell through basalt curtains and churned luminescent spores into blue fog. <words>145</words>
At the cascade's center stood an ice sculpture of interlocked hands, already cracking under the humid breath of the falls, counting down to liquefaction. <words>169</words>
When the final second before its collapse arrived, the society would reveal a filament of raw current, and Vireo would taste it or die. <words>193</words>
Death, he hoped, would finally bind his restless nerves to stillness, because every poison so far had betrayed him with survival. <words>214</words>
Yet the cartographers needed his calibrated palate to verify that the energy was potable for humankind's metamorphosis, so they trusted his despair like a tool. <words>239</words>
He knelt on obsidian sand, flipped the bookmark, and the runes glowed, projecting a lattice of lines across the cavern walls, describing invisible rivers beneath nations. <words>265</words>
Tonight's confluence intersected precisely where meltwater would drip from the sculpture's fingertip, an ephemeral coordinate only attainable in that final breath of frozen art. <words>289</words>
The hidden society emerged from alcoves, robes shimmering with the strangely compelling calm of those certain the universe kept private ledgers. <words>310</words>
Their leader, salt-haired Lunos, offered Vireo a crystal vial, but he shook his head, craving unmediated contact, yearning to prove nothing could keep him alive. <words>335</words>
Water roared louder, the sculpture groaned, and in that suspended heartbeat, Vireo stretched his tongue toward the descending droplet radiant with unseen circuits. <words>358</words>
It splashed upon his taste buds like mint, mercury, and morning, mapping a topography of pain across his skull while also engraving inside him the runoff routes of hope. <words>387</words>
Instead of dying, he felt the currents rush through his veins toward every scar, soldering regret and venom into lucid stillness, and his death wish evaporated. <words>413</words>
Realizing survival could be intentional artistry, he lifted the glowing bookmark and declared the map complete, the hidden society now free to guide cities above toward gentle power. <words>441</words>
Behind him, the ice sculpture collapsed with a sigh, sheets of water veiling the circle, sealing the moment like a page bound forever into subterranean scripture. <words>467</words>
And in the lingering mist, Vireo tasted nothing but possibility. <words>477</words>
