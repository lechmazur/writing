I took the post of dutiful sentinel in the photosynthesis research lab the night the sun went absent. <words>18</words>
The administration called the darkness temporary; the plants, drooping and sallow, whispered a different, delightfully strange prognosis. <words>35</words>
I was assigned to guard the prototype heliophore, but my true duty was to stories themselves. <words>51</words>
People forget that in this lab light grows from narrative, that chloroplasts respond to myth as much as photons. <words>70</words>
So, when the heliophore faltered, administration summoned donors to a bustling restaurant, seating them at a shared table. <words>88</words>
I accompanied the device, boxy and humming, like a flower girl escorting doom amid wedding toasts. <words>104</words>
Crystal flutes clinked while executives praised love, never knowing their metaphors kept the last artificial dawn alive. <words>121</words>
But a rumor arrived earlier, perched inside a basic plastic hair clip on the maitre d's lapel. <words>138</words>
The clip belonged to Mara, my colleague, who believed the only way to usher in the hidden sunrise was destruction. <words>158</words>
She slipped me a note between courses, its ink flickering like embers: Destroy the stories trapping the light. <words>176</words>
Mara argued that repetition had calcified hope, and that only a narrative void could birth a novel dawn. <words>194</words>
I felt torn, hammered between primal sophistication and bureaucratic caution, like steel oscillating between club and scalpel. <words>211</words>
The toasts crescendoed; a CEO compared photosynthesis to marriage, and the heliophore pulsed greedily at the applause. <words>228</words>
I realized Mara was right--the machine fed on stale metaphors, dimming any chance for the sunrise no one believed. <words>247</words>
Guided by duty, I lifted the hair clip, its cheap teeth glinting like sacrificial daggers. <words>262</words>
I stood, tapped my glass, and spoke a storyless silence, a pause so blank it devoured ceremonial rhetoric. <words>280</words>
The diners shivered; their minds searched for symbolism and found none, only the clip clacking against the heliophore casing. <words>299</words>
In that vacuum the machine withered, screens snowing static as chloroplastic algorithms starved for narrative nutrition. <words>315</words>
I pressed the clip through its vent, severing circuits with one pragmatic snap, and lightless smoke curled like unborn dawn. <words>335</words>
Mara joined the hush, raising no toast, yet in her eyes I saw horizons assembling themselves molecule by molecule. <words>354</words>
Outside, night remained, but it smelled faintly of morning, as if the world rehearsed colors it had forgotten. <words>372</words>
Some diners wept, sensing the impact of stories once present, now ruptured, their absence more illuminating than neon daylight. <words>391</words>
I resumed my watch, a dutiful sentinel over unstoried dark, waiting to greet the sunrise no one believes in. <words>410</words>
