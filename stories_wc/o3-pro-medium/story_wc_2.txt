Milo Garrick collected clocks that no longer knew how to tell time. [12]  
He called himself a broken-clock tinkerer, the only job title that felt honest. [25]  
Each night he repaired failures that refused repair, certain the effort mattered even if the result did not. [43]  
That stubborn paradox made him uncertainly certain about everything else in his life. [56]  
So when an envelope of scorched vellum arrived, he opened it without hesitation. [69]  
Inside lay a brass shard etched with half of an admiral's lost compass rose. [83]  
The accompanying note read, 'Find the tick that never tocks, and the circle will close.' [98]  
Milo compared the handwriting to his grandfather's and to his creditors' but recognized neither. [112]  
He decided the clue qualified as that delicate moment when coincidence becomes pattern. [125]  
The search began in the burnt-out conservatory behind his workshop, long abandoned after a lightning strike. [141]  
He stepped through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse and felt them brush his face like restless clocks. [160]  
Debris crunched underfoot, some charred, some brittle, all whispering stories buried beneath the ashes. [174]  
Near the cracked fountain, he spotted a gear half melted into the stone floor. [188]  
The gear's teeth matched the compass shard like two broken sentences seeking grammar. [201]  
Yet nothing else revealed itself, and dusk swallowed the room in gray doubt. [214]  
If he wanted answers, he'd have to improvise. [222]  
Improvisation, he realized, demanded surrender, and surrender was precisely how one hoped to befriend uncertainty in planning. [239]  
His purpose felt clear: to befriend uncertainty in planning, not to cage it. [252]  
He unbolted a rusted hatch hidden behind climbing ivy and descended a spiral staircase he had never seen. [270]  
The air grew damp, then thunderously alive with the roar of a subterranean waterfall. [284]  
Mist shimmered in lantern light, sketching rainbow ghosts across slick cavern walls. [296]  
At the waterfall's base, a cavernous alcove housed a colossal clock frozen at midnight. [310]  
Its pendulum hung motionless above a pile of soot that looked suspiciously like cremated blueprints. [325]  
Beneath the ashes something glinted, as though time still kept a single polished nail. [339]  
Milo brushed away the soot and uncovered the other half of the admiral's lost compass rose, pristine despite the gloom. [359]  
He fitted the two halves together, and the compass clicked with a heartbeat he felt through bone. [376]  
Needles spun, finally settling to point not north, but toward the waterfall's curtain. [389]  
Trusting the device, Milo stepped into the cascade and discovered a dry corridor disguised by liquid thunder. [406]  
Here the ticking returned, faint yet relentless, guiding him deeper than memory. [418]  
Corridor walls were studded with lockers, each labeled with a date and a storm's name. [433]  
Inside one locker he found weather logs penned by an admiral obsessed with impossible coincidences at sea. [450]  
Another held a child's sketch of constellations arranged to spell the word 'Again' in fifty languages. [466]  
Patterns, Milo realized, were imprisoned here, archived like unruly prisoners of probability. [478]  
The compass pulse quickened, urging him toward a vault door fashioned from overlapping clock faces. [493]  
He pressed the united rose into a flower-shaped recess, and the door unlatched with an exhalation of steam. [511]  
Inside the vault stood a table of sand, endlessly falling upward in a glassless hourglass. [526]  
Every grain that drifted formed brief maps, then collapsed, as if the universe were forever rehearsing routes. [543]  
Milo understood: the admiral had discovered a place where chance rehearsed before performing, and tried to record it. [561]  
But recording had only broken the rhythm, turning living questions into dead clocks. [574]  
A choice waited, uncertainly certain: seal the room again or let the rehearsal proceed unobserved. [589]  
To keep patterns alive, he smashed the compass against the table, scattering rose and sand across the air. [607]  
The vault lights died, and in that darkness he felt the tick from the colossal clock resume. [624]  
Upstairs, the workshop clocks would now wake, their hands freestyling minutes never printed on calendars. [639]  
He retraced his path, but the swirling leaves in the neglected greenhouse had settled into calm spirals. [656]  
Outside, night rain kissed the roof, rhythmic yet unpredictable, exactly the kind of music he hoped for. [673]  
Tomorrow he would plan, but only enough to invite detours, certain now that clarity lives in motion. [690]  
And if coincidence became pattern again, he would simply improvise until wonder outran prediction. [704]
