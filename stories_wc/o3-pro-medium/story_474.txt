I first overheard Orion Vale, the midnight radio host who channels the dead, during a power outage that draped our city in whispering static.<words>24</words>
His voice threaded through the dark like an intricately simple melody, promising answers to riddles I'd never dared form aloud.<words>44</words>
By dawn, my own nightmares had begun to sprint, and I needed to outrun the living nightmare that always woke before me.<words>66</words>
So when the station advertised a community cooking class taught inside a celestial grotto guarded by living shadows, I signed up, certain guidance simmered there.<words>91</words>
Orion arrived late, colliding with me near the spice racks--our run-in while both taking a cooking class that no longer seemed accidental.<words>113</words>
Between our aprons hung an antique chessboard missing all the pawns, as if strategy itself had relinquished its foot soldiers.<words>133</words>
The instructor, a shadow with ember eyes, told us every ingredient must represent someone absent, because the strength in diversity blooms from honoring the missing.<words>158</words>
Orion set basil for his grandmother, while I offered cinnamon for a brother still breathing yet unreachable behind otherworldly insomnia.<words>178</words>
When the cauldron bubbled, the living shadows parted, revealing constellations etched on wet stone that pulsed like an old transistor dial.<words>199</words>
Orion placed his fingertips on the luminous rock and invited the dead to broadcast, but static answered, begging him to relinquish the microphone.<words>222</words>
He wavered, sweating cardamom, insisting that amid quiet rebellion the dead required a voice to negotiate cease-fires between nightmares and dreamers.<words>243</words>
Yet the grotto's stars rearranged into a pawnless chess game, spelling a familiar puzzle: without humble pieces, even kings march alone.<words>264</words>
I realized my fear of the living nightmare isolated me, denying the intricate choir that could drown its footsteps.<words>283</words>
Behind us, students of every accent tasted each other's sauces, improvising recipes that survived only because no flavor tried to dominate.<words>304</words>
I touched Orion's sleeve and whispered that we should both relinquish our separate broadcasts and mix the signals, letting listeners decide the harmony.<words>327</words>
The word relinquish echoed, each syllable a pawn returned to the board, modest yet essential.<words>342</words>
Shadows sighed approval, and the grotto ceiling unfurled into daybreak over imagined rooftops, promising we could outrun nightmares by running together.<words>363</words>
Orion opened the station's portable transmitter, routing its antenna through stewing steam so every frequency carried notes of basil, cinnamon, and revolution.<words>385</words>
Voices--living, lost, and merely afraid--interlaced like an intricately simple fugue, proving the strength in diversity to any ear tuned for wonder.<words>406</words>
My nightmare paused at the threshold of that broadcast, suddenly outnumbered, as Orion smiled and switched from host to fellow traveler.<words>427</words>
Together we ladled hope into bowls, served it across the airwaves, and tasted freedom in flavors no single tongue could name alone.<words>449</words>
