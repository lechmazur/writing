At the hush as an empty swing set slows to a stop, I unlock the fruit preservation vault beneath the orphanage.<words>21</words>
The corridor exhales icy warmth, like forgiveness delivered on frostbitten breath.<words>32</words>
I, a penitent memory thief, clutch a simple wooden toy block stolen from the dreams of a forgotten child.<words>51</words>
It is my compass, its edges worn smooth by lovingly hateful fingers that once prized innocence only to devour it.<words>71</words>
Tonight I will recalibrate the world it points to.<words>80</words>
Beyond stacked jars of apricots and ghostly pears, a spiderweb crack in reality glimmers across a steel wall.<words>98</words>
Each shard shows another era when fruit was sealed with songs rather than freon.<words>112</words>
I seek those voices, driven to restore ancient methods the modern palate forgot.<words>125</words>
Yet the crack widens only when memories are laid upon its threshold, one secret for one revelation.<words>142</words>
So I scatter the toy block's stolen recollections by tracking flower petals I have conjured from their owners' lost Springs.<words>162</words>
Petal after petal drifts toward the crack, mapping desire like a febrile cartographer.<words>175</words>
With each flutter, a jar lid pops, releasing centuries of sugared air that tastes of grandmother lullabies.<words>192</words>
The vault quivers, and the swing outside shrieks on rusted chains though no wind exists, syncing heartbeat to silence.<words>211</words>
I press the block against the wall, confessing the children's laughter I erased for profit.<words>226</words>
The crack drinks the confession, and in return shows a vista of orchards where apples are preserved in stories whispered to saplings.<words>248</words>
I step through, but the block remains behind, sealing the fissure like a dowel hammered into cosmic timber.<words>266</words>
Memory drains from me in ribbons, colorless yet fragrant, fertilizing the orchard I now tend.<words>281</words>
The lovingly hateful part of my heart claws, wanting to hoard one last secret, but the petals dissolve it like dew on salt.<words>304</words>
In the orchard's icy warmth, I am reborn as keeper, not thief, my penance carried on the slow hush of the swing's final stillness.<words>328</words>
Ancient methods unfold in me like grafted branches, teaching that apricot pits once measured seasons more faithfully than clocks.<words>347</words>
I learn to seal peaches inside poems, pears inside riddles, cherries inside lullabies that never quite resolve.<words>364</words>
To recalibrate each fruit's sweetness, I chant the child's name that once owned the toy block, letting syllables ferment like honeyed yeast.<words>386</words>
Their giggle ripples through the orchard, and blossoms obey, aligning petals along invisible meridians leading back to the sealed vault.<words>406</words>
Somewhere on the other side, accountants of reality tug at the crack, sniffing for profit, but the toy block creaks, refusing the ledger's touch.<words>430</words>
I kneel under moon-bleached branches and promise the orchard that no memory here will ever be monetized again.<words>448</words>
The swing's chain somewhere beyond the veil stops with a click, and the hush becomes a cradle for restored tradition.<words>468</words>
