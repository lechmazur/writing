Rainwater clung to crumbling statues as Rowan Blake drifted down an overgrown city street reclaimed by nature. <words>17</words>
The repressed poet kept his notebook fastened shut, fearing any line might betray feelings he barely acknowledged. <words>34</words>
A spontaneous decision to explore a side road had led him here, away from disciplined routines and polite salons. <words>53</words>
Metal girders sprouted ivy like prehistoric bones regrown with green marrow, and birdsong echoed through shattered glass facades. <words>71</words>
Yet Rowan carried lingering doubts about why he wandered, and the doubts rustled louder than the leaves. <words>88</words>
An antique perfume bottle, heavy with dust and memory, winked from a cracked shop window like a forgotten dare. <words>107</words>
Thinking its scent might unlock metaphors, he slipped it into his coat, secretly terrified someone watched the petty theft. <words>126</words>
At that instant, he heard the weightless plink of a pin landing in some distant, silent corridor of the abandoned hotel across the street. <words>150</words>
Time tightened; every vine, shadow, and brick seemed poised in suspense, awaiting whatever had dropped more than the pin. <words>169</words>
Rowan's chest fluttered with both dread and possibility, for poetry often entered him through such needle-small openings. <words>186</words>
He followed the echo into the lobby, where ferns grew from parquet and chandeliers dangled like skeletal constellations. <words>204</words>
Sudden footsteps erupted behind him, an ambush of hurried boots against marble, forcing him to duck beneath the concierge desk. <words>224</words>
Two scavengers stormed past, arguing about copper wiring and oblivious to the poet trembling in dusty gloom. <words>241</words>
Rowan inhaled, and the perfume bottle uncorked with a sigh, releasing a fragrance that smelled of seawater and ruined starlight. <words>261</words>
Memories not his own cascaded: sailors tattooing verses on lovers' shoulders, astronomers mapping freckles like galaxies, children bottling fog at dawn. <words>282</words>
The vision clarified his buried hunger to pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin, using ink, scent, and heartbeat as syllables. <words>303</words>
But lingering doubts coiled again, hissing that his words would fade like murals under moss. <words>318</words>
He staggered from the desk, determined to answer the hiss with a quill of courage disguised as curiosity. <words>336</words>
Outside, twilight bruised the clouds, and the scavengers were silhouettes scaling telephone poles for loot. <words>351</words>
Rowan approached them, surprising even himself, and offered the perfume bottle in trade for a single permanent marker. <words>369</words>
They laughed at his bargain yet accepted, believing the glass bauble worth more than any ink, then vanished into leaves. <words>389</words>
With knowing naivety, the poet knelt beside a graffiti-blotted statue, rolled up his own sleeve, and wrote across his pulse: 'Here beats the universe, unfinished'. <words>414</words>
The marker squeaked like a distant comet, and Rowan finally heard applause louder than any falling pin, echoing solely inside his freed chest. <words>437</words>
Among cracked pavements and flowering rebar, his cosmic verse glimmered, and for once no doubt ambushed the silence. <words>455</words>
