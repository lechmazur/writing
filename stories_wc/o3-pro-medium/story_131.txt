Dust spiraled around Jules, an aloof orphan assigned to clean Mrs. Mercado's cluttered garage on a shimmering afternoon.<words>18</words>
He approached the task with affectionate detachment, observing memories that were not his slide through his gloved fingers.<words>36</words>
Throughout the garage cleaning, a softly audible hum persisted, as though unseen machinery tuned itself to his heartbeat.<words>54</words>
When he brushed aside an oil-stained tarp, a collection of smooth stones rolled from a forgotten shoebox and hovered midair.<words>74</words>
Gravity had loosened its ordinary grip, turning the garage into the heart of a gentle gravitational anomaly.<words>91</words>
Jules neither gasped nor ran; instead, he cataloged the floating nails, rags, and paintings with the calm of an astronomer.<words>111</words>
Adapt or perish, he reminded himself, echoing the motto the orphanage matrons had embroidered above the dining hall.<words>129</words>
As he reached to reclaim the stones, he noticed a crumpled lottery ticket magnetized to the floating fuse box.<words>148</words>
Across its faded pink surface, a cryptic message scrawled on the lottery ticket read, 'Loosen fear, tighten courage, quarter past three'.<words>169</words>
The phrase nudged his chest like a cautious friend, suggesting that courage was a choice of calibration, not inheritance.<words>188</words>
The hovering stones aligned into a spiral, pointing toward a jammed hatch door at the floor where tools now drifted like minnows.<words>210</words>
Remembering the message, Jules reached for the rusted bolt that sealed the hatch and began to loosen it carefully.<words>229</words>
With each slow turn, the softly audible hum grew brighter, as if approving the conversion of his old fear into present courage.<words>251</words>
When the bolt gave, the anomaly collapsed, returning weight to every object, but leaving the stones stacked like a tiny monument.<words>272</words>
Jules opened the hatch and found merely concrete beneath, yet the act felt like stepping onto a dawn-colored sky.<words>291</words>
He pocketed the collection of smooth stones, their surfaces warm as handshakes, tokens of the moment gravity trusted him.<words>310</words>
Outside, Mrs. Mercado called that dinner was ready, her voice softly audible through the cracked door yet distant, like a planetarium narrator.<words>332</words>
Jules answered with a polite hum, affectionate yet detached, already considering how to apply his new calibration to the wider cosmos.<words>353</words>
Tonight he would polish the stones, decode more of the ticket, and perhaps draft a motto of his own above his cot.<words>375</words>
It would say, 'Fear is an echo; courage is the voice,' reminding him that orphans endure not by clinging, but by tuning the universe.<words>399</words>
And if gravity misbehaved again, he would greet it like an old, instructive companion.<words>413</words>
