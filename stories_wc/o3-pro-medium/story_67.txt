Clouded glass rattled in the contraption inventor's attic as the afternoon train whistled its last goodbye down the valley. <words>19</words>
Marlo Tun, a jovial blacksmith precariously confident in matters beyond iron, watched through the dormer slat. <words>35</words>
He lifted a single earring between calloused tongs, its bronze spiral catching stray beams like a captive sunbeam begging parole. <words>55</words>
Outside, the final wave from a departing train window flickered across rails, a semaphore of parting hearts he pretended not to notice. <words>77</words>
His skin tingled with fervent indifference, a heat so committed to apathy that it burned brighter than longing. <words>95</words>
He was here to prove darkness can be tamed, and sentiment, like raw ore, merely waited for proper forging. <words>114</words>
The attic room quivered with pendulums, gears, and the maestro of them all: a brass metronome clicking steady dominion over time. <words>135</words>
Permission to endure arrived by the motion of a metronome, chiseling seconds into survivable shapes. <words>150</words>
Marlo synchronized his pulse to that mechanical decree, feeling his worries queue neatly behind the downbeat. <words>166</words>
He set the earring on the anvil shaped like a question mark, a gift from the attic's late owner, Felix Draught. <words>187</words>
Felix had believed every problem of the human condition could be reduced to leverage, fulcrum, and bold vibration. <words>205</words>
Now the apprentice blacksmith meant to finish that theorem with flame instead of chalk. <words>219</words>
He breathed, counted four ticks forward, and swung his hammer not down but sideways, coaxing ringing rather than crushing. <words>238</words>
The earring rotated, molten at its edges, unveiling within the metal a trapped ribbon of smoky luminance. <words>255</words>
Darkness hissed like steam but did not escape, swirling instead into a disciplined helix that mirrored the metronome's sweep. <words>274</words>
Marlo grinned, yet his eyes remained remote, as though cheering for a stranger in a race whose prize he detested. <words>294</words>
To tame darkness, one must refuse its intimacy, he recalled Felix muttering amid gear oil and insomnia. <words>311</words>
Outside, the train whistle dwindled to a memory, and the distant waver of that farewell arm finally lowered into ordinary gesture. <words>332</words>
The attic light, refracted through shadow and glow, settled upon Marlo like impartial verdict. <words>346</words>
He quenched the earring in a vat of rainwater and heard, above the steam, the metronome continue its aloof applause. <words>366</words>
Within the cooled metal shone a candle-dark ember, gyring gently in place, proof enough that chaos respected choreography. <words>384</words>
Marlo pocketed the jewel and, with a shrug neither happy nor sad, descended toward the evening streets where anvils waited. <words>404</words>
