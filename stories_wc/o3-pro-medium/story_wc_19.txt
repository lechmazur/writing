Clouds lapped at the latticed beamwork of the xenial trellis, and I exhaled into air thinner than whisper. [18]
Father had built this perch as a rehearsal bunker for storms, yet he never guessed it would become my laboratory of hush. [40]
I am his claustrophobic child, more frightened of walls than of the sky’s vacancy. [54]
So I raised beams outward until they formed a porch of vines, letting hospitality spill toward any drifting creature. [73]
Even the wind treated the structure like a friend, brushing each rung softly before moving on. [89]
But I was here for silence, the way chefs travel for spices. [101]
Silences differ, and I meant to collect their flavors, harvesting them during the curious hour when gravity inverts. [119]
In that reversal, sound droops upward, leaving a gilded hush pooled at floor level, intangibly tangible to the careful palate. [139]
I learned this from Mother’s tiny porcelain doll, cracked yet still smiling, which I kept as both metronome and barometer. [159]
When gravity wavered, the doll’s head would sprout minute ringing tones, audible only to those listening inward. [176]
Father hated that sound, saying bunkers must remain definite, not whimsical. [187]
He built below, layering steel by limiting exposure to open air, whereas I built above, courting it. [204]
Our philosophies were stretching contracted, an elastic tension that hummed across supper tables. [217]
Yet he allowed me supplies, perhaps hoping the sky would scare my fears back into walls. [233]
Tonight the world tipped at precisely twenty-three minutes past nine, and everything not nailed drifted down toward the stars. [252]
I felt my lungs rejoice as my boots stuck to the trellis planks, reversed gravity pinning me like a leaf against a ceiling. [275]
Sound drained, splashing around my ankles in shimmering puddles no ear could drink except mine. [290]
I knelt and cupped the hush, tasting notes of abandoned factory, cathedral dusk, and infant’s held breath. [307]
Each flavor slid across my tongue like warm brass, leaving afterimages of lives I never lived. [323]
As I bottled the silence in vials of resonant glass, the porcelain doll chimed a warning. [339]
Father was climbing the support ladder, his toolbox clanking up toward what he still called dangerous nonsense. [356]
If he arrived before the hour ended, gravity would right itself while he stood mid-rung, breaking both philosophy and spine. [376]
I could not let either happen. [382]
Clutching a vial that glowed with gilded hush, I slid along the underside of the trellis like a gecko on a floor. [404]
Father’s boots dangled above me, their soles trembling in the updraft of reversed weight. [418]
I uncorked the vial and let the collected silence breathe out, its intangibly tangible aroma circulating around the ladder. [437]
By limiting exposure, I directed the hush only toward Father, a ribbon of stillness wrapping his senses. [454]
His grip slackened not from fear but from wonder, muscles releasing as if soothed by unsung lullabies. [471]
I murmured, telling him to stay absolutely still until the world turned right-side again. [485]
He obeyed, eyes wide, the hush filling all the arguments he had prepared to hurl. [500]
Below, stars looked like streetlights; above, rooftops shimmered like distant ponds. [511]
The trellis, always welcoming, groaned politely, its vines adjusting to hold both of us. [525]
Minutes seeped by, and the porcelain doll’s chime sank pitch by pitch, marking the approach of normal gravity. [543]
When the final note thudded to silence, everything above shuddered and settled downward; Father and I were merely standing on a sky deck once more. [568]
He stared at the glassy vial now empty, comprehension sprouting in his expression like green through concrete. [585]
You bottled quiet, he whispered, discovering how loud a whisper can be after tasting stillness. [600]
I nodded and offered him the porcelain doll, an invitation to join the next harvest. [615]
He cradled it awkwardly, the trellis lights reflecting in his eyes like unhatched plans. [629]
The hush had taught him that some shelters grow upward, not inward. [641]
Together we began reinforcing the beams, preparing for tomorrow’s inversion and the next bouquet of silences. [657]
Father hummed as he worked, and his tune tasted faintly of apology, a new flavor for my collection. [675]
