The nebula observation deck floated above the city smog like a cathedral of starlight. <words>14</words>
Ilan, an urban hermit with a side hustle repairing hacked vending machines, haunted its metallic hush. <words>30</words>
He had come clutching a broken zipper pull, the last relic from his evacuated apartment. <words>45</words>
The object jingled absurdly, yet its silence felt solemn, like bells refusing to ring. <words>59</words>
Tonight he intended to re-invent himself, breaking free from conformity before morning trains resumed. <words>73</words>
His method, polished during lonely lunches, was audacious: propagate rebellion through analyzing contradictions in local folklore. <words>89</words>
He believed stories were viruses; expose their mismatched seams, and new narratives would sprout uncontrollably. <words>104</words>
Yet the deck's holographic signage kept insisting, with impersonally personal cheer, that observation hours ended promptly. <words>120</words>
Rules, Ilan muttered, were merely gravity wearing a tie. <words>129</words>
Across the hush of unspoken promises, tourists pressed against transparent rails, photographing cosmic whirlpools. <words>143</words>
They didn't notice him slip beneath the maintenance ladder toward the staff console. <words>156</words>
The console greeted him with default friendliness, but he responded by feeding it folklore. <words>170</words>
He uploaded the tale of the river that flows uphill when people forget its name. <words>185</words>
Then he overlaid the contradictory saga claiming that same river never existed, only pretended to. <words>200</words>
Algorithms panicked, scrambling for consensus, and the tourist holos suddenly showed waterfalls defying geometry. <words>214</words>
Whispers propagated, first amused, then unsettled, as menus offered uphill-water espresso and anti-gravity umbrellas. <words>228</words>
Ilan pocketed the broken zipper pull like a detonator whose countdown had just begun. <words>242</words>
Security drones drifted nearer, blinking red approval and red warning simultaneously, unable to reconcile protocols. <words>257</words>
Their confusion granted him a corridor of possibility wider than the Milky Way. <words>270</words>
He stepped onto an external catwalk where nebulas painted his face with indigo riddles. <words>284</words>
Wind tugged at his jacket, exposing the zipper's gap, a broken statement refusing closure. <words>298</words>
He raised the metal pull toward the swirling Carina clouds as if christening a newborn myth. <words>314</words>
The deck lights dimmed, recognizing ceremony where policy saw breach. <words>324</words>
Within minutes, livestreamers broadcast the impossible river in the sky, and disbelief mutated into pilgrimage. <words>339</words>
Urban screens replayed the anomaly, selling tickets to nowhere, inadvertently financing Ilan's vending-machine empire. <words>353</words>
His side hustle had propagated into capital for an exodus of ideas, not just snacks. <words>368</words>
Every billboard now displayed the slogan 'Forge New Paths-Stay Hydrated on Uphill Water' without attribution. <words>383</words>
Ilan watched the city swallow its own contradictions and felt an impersonally personal relief bloom. <words>398</words>
He did not smile; absurd solemnity suited the midwife of fractured folklore. <words>410</words>
Somewhere beyond conformity's event horizon, a zipper of stars waited to be pulled open. <words>424</words>
