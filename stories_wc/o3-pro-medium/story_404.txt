The wandering monk Alaran shuffled into the dimension door repair shop just as three malfunctioning portals coughed sparks across the counter of cracked neon mica.<words>25</words>
He carried no luggage save a rusty skeleton key that clinked like history's tooth inside his patched sleeve.<words>43</words>
Outside, the city of Delvane boiled with speeches and sirens, proof that this was a period of radical change nobody had actually planned.<words>66</words>
The shopkeeper, an ex-architect named Brill, greeted Alaran with cynical warmth, the sort reserved for customers who might pay in riddles rather than coins.<words>90</words>
Alaran replied with a bow that felt lightly unbearable to hold, as though etiquette itself weighed an ounce too much in this thinning air.<words>114</words>
He explained that a comet called the Candle of Olt had slipped through a gap between planes and would flare for only seventeen more heartbeats of eternity.<words>141</words>
To capture that fleeting cosmic event, he needed Brill to fix the westernmost door, whose lock had been crushed by runaway chronomancers last winter.<words>165</words>
Brill eyed the key, noting its jagged rust and the faint sigils of sworn fraternity etched along its spine like ties of forged trust turned brittle.<words>191</words>
Those sigils, Alaran admitted, could only be reactivated by collecting haunted melodies, the spectral songs that linger where doors remember every departure and regret.<words>215</words>
Brill scoffed, yet his fingers trembled, for he too once heard such music the night his apprentice vanished through an unpaid portal.<words>237</words>
The monk proposed a bargain: they would roam the service corridors between dimensions, harvest the echoes, and pay the shop's overdue taxes with hope rebottled as sound.<words>264</words>
Trust, normally expensive, was forged swiftly in the furnace of dwindling minutes, and both men stepped through the damaged frame before common sense could veto them.<words>290</words>
Between worlds, the air tasted of burnt violins; Alaran tapped the skeleton key against silence, and haunted melodies poured out like bruised fireflies embracing arrest.<words>315</words>
Each note spiraled into the key's grooves, repairing rust with sorrow, until the lightly unbearable weight of history clicked into readiness.<words>336</words>
They hurried back, barely ahead of the comet's zenith, and Brill slammed the key home, the portal window blooming into crystal view of the Candle of Olt.<words>363</words>
Alaran knelt, letting the comet's blue tail flood his eyes, then crushed a single teardrop into dust to honor impermanence, the monk's only permissible prayer.<words>388</words>
Beside him, Brill felt the ties of forged trust cinch his chest, lightly unbearable yet welcome, and wondered whether redemption could be sold over a counter.<words>414</words>
In the dim shoplight, the comet dwindled, the door healed, and two strangers shared a cynical warmth bright enough to guide whatever came next.<words>438</words>
