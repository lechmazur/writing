After the final grain slips through the hourglass, the tunnel beneath the abandoned manor yawns open like a throat awaiting confession. [21]  
Its bricks, slick with echoing mildew, carry every past whisper so faithfully that even current silence sounds overdressed. [39]  
Into this resonant artery steps Maestro Orren Finch, the leaf blower symphony conductor, cloak smelling of gasoline and brittle pine needles. [60]  
He is mournfully eager, a man whose eyes shine with grief yet widen like lanterns at the possibility of joy. [80]  
The household above, once rattling with children, has not produced a single chuckle since the youngest drowned in a copper washtub. [101]  
Parents shuffle like muted ghosts, plates clang softly on purpose, and every toy remains exactly where it was the day tragedy struck. [123]  
Orren has been hired to restore lost laughter to the household, though the contract never dared to phrase it so brightly. [144]  
Instead it spoke of tending to the unspoken, of coaxing back vibrations that once bounced gladly between rafters and hearts. [164]  
That task suits Orren, for he converses best with what other people smother beneath napkins of polite denial. [182]  
He inhales the subterranean hush, then reaches for the leaf blowers lined like brass choirs along the moist wall. [201]  
Each machine bears a pull cord handle frayed by rehearsal, its knot darkened by countless anxious thumbs. [218]  
He tugs them in sequence, the engines coughing alive like choirboys awakening after a century-long yawn. [234]  
Vibrations ricochet down the echo chamber tunnel, multiplying until raw sound seems to macerate the very cobwebs. [251]  
Leaves, stored in burlap sacks, he scatters before the blower nozzles like communion wafers awaiting transubstantiation. [267]  
As the engines roar, blades shred the leaves into particulate confetti, green and gold memories macerated into aromatic mist. [286]  
Through the torn foliage Orren begins conducting, arms carving crescents, baton replaced by the skeletal pull cord handle of an unused blower. [308]  
He mouths directions to the machines via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind generated by their spinning fans. [327]  
The lullabies are the ones the drowned child used to hum while building twig cities beside the garden pond. [346]  
Because the melody never learned completion, it now wavers, haunting yet hopeful, like a smile glimpsed in cracked glass. [365]  
Sound funnels upward through floor vents, brushing the kitchen first, where spoons vibrate inside chipped mugs and grief-stiffened shoulders twitch. [385]  
The mother hears wind but also something intimate tucked inside it, a lullaby she once abandoned out of fear it hurt too much. [408]  
Tears bead on her lashes, then, startled by their own warmth, fall as laughter’s timid prototypes. [424]  
The father, sharpening a silent knife just to feel activity’s lie, pauses when the blade begins singing back to him on every stroke. [447]  
He snorts, half sob, half chuckle, and the sound surprises the ceiling into shedding a speckle of plaster like confetti. [467]  
Upward still, laughter’s seedlings drift, pass through picture frames, stir dust off portraits, and finally seep into the nursery painted shut since funeral day. [491]  
There the shredded leaves swirl, assembling shapes that resemble the child’s outline, all made of memory and chlorophyll. [509]  
The outline does not speak; it merely tilts its leafy head, as though pleased someone finally listened to what it never said. [531]  
Back in the tunnel, Orren feels the air lighten, and he knows his mournfully eager gamble has succeeded. [549]  
He slows the blowers, their voices descending from wail to whisper like a choir granted permission to rest after a long vigil. [571]  
When at last engines fade, silence returns, but it is no longer overdressed; it wears a grin stitched from freshly restored laughter. [593]  
Orren coils the pull cord handle around his wrist and bows to the unseen audience, tending to the unspoken one final reverent time. [616]  
The tunnel keeps the moment suspended, a true haunting that hums with reclaimed mirth. [630]
