I, Marisol Quanta, earn my living as a professional dream interpreter for workers who inhale mist all day in the city's vapor collection facility. <words>24</words>
Their exhausted minds ring with a quiet pulse that only I can translate, though the rhythms are occasionally frequent enough to bruise my skull. <words>48</words>
Yesterday, while loaves were baking in the industrial ovens next door, a janitor slid me a crumpled invitation stained with flour and secret ink. <words>72</words>
It summoned me to the abandoned kiln at midnight, promising answers to questions I had not yet dared to dream. <words>92</words>
Compelled by a peculiar faith that revelation prefers smoke, I arrived to find no janitor, only the vacancy shaped like a missing foreman named Aster Glaive. <words>118</words>
Aster had disappeared months earlier during a shift change, and rumors claimed his dreams calcified into stalactites hanging above the cooling racks. <words>140</words>
I knew then that someone wanted me to impersonate the missing man, to breathe through his absence the way ovens breathe through cracks in brick. <words>165</words>
So I studied his personnel file, rehearsed his curt nod, and folded my own voice until it sounded like dough stretched to translucence. <words>188</words>
The next afternoon, during baking, I walked the catwalks as Aster, letting the steam kiss my borrowed skin and listening for the facility's coded heartbeats. <words>213</words>
Deep in the condensation vault, I discovered panels of ancient law literally carved in stone, regulating dream harvest quotas and the price of sleep. <words>237</words>
The invitation had not lied; it merely waited for me to realize that interpretation is a form of authorship. <words>256</words>
By impersonating a missing person, I temporarily owned his supervisory clearance, enough to rewrite those laws during the brief minutes the ovens roared loudest. <words>280</words>
I replaced phrases about quotas with promises of restorative silences, letting the chisel's echo sync to the quiet pulse I hear in every sleeper. <words>304</words>
Stone dust whirled with vapor, forming a halo that occasionally frequent clangs of metal could not disperse, as if the air itself prayed. <words>327</words>
When the foreman's ghost-memory surfaced, asking what right I had, I answered that laws which calcify consciousness must crumble like burnt crusts. <words>349</words>
My revisions completed just as the timer rang, and the facility's alarm translated the new statutes into waves of scented steam drifting toward the night shift. <words>375</words>
Outside, the city's sleepers inhaled that vapor of rewritten dream-laws, and in their slumber I heard gratitude rise like leaven, slow but unstoppable. <words>398</words>
Tomorrow, I will return to decode the fresh pulse, because faith, peculiar or not, is occasionally frequent in the hearts we emancipate. <words>420</words>
