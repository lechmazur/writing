Salt wind licked the field hospital's cracked skylight, promising another uneasy night over the archipelago. [15]
I, once the pacific conflict-zone translator nobody noticed, now listened for silence more than speech. [30]
The roar of wounded lungs behind curtains had grown familiar, an unwanted dialect I understood too well. [47]
Tonight, however, one small body was being wheeled toward surgery, his broken arm chalky beneath gauze. [63]
A brain coral fragment rested in his other palm, its labyrinth frozen mid-thought like him. [78]
He whispered that his mother said corals remember how to regrow after storms, and so would he. [95]
I slipped the fragment into my pocket, promising return, though promises here dissolved faster than sutures. [111]
After the anesthetic kicks in, the wards always quiet, as if fear itself drowses beside each cot. [128]
I waited for that hush before entering the mist-clad atrium at twilight, our only place without groans. [145]
Portable humidifiers leaked into cracked glass, so white ribbons of vapor tangled the hanging vines overhead. [161]
I came here to unknot more than vines. [169]
My actual mission, self-assigned and reckless, was to graft new meaning onto old wounds. [183]
Words sometimes suture where medicine fails. [189]
Yet lately every language tasted of gunpowder, every plea slumped under shared anxieties I could not translate away. [207]
The boy's plaster cast was smothered in scrawls from soldiers, refugees, and medics passing his stretcher. [223]
Some messages blurred in blood, others in salt tears, all in hurry. [235]
Decipher them, I believed, and I might thread one fragile sentence through the hearts still beating at odds. [253]
So I balanced the cast on my lap, lamp dimmed, hoping to unknot fears by decrypting smudged notes on a child's cast. [275]
A medic from the north had written, 'Your courage teaches snow to melt.' [288]
A displaced fisherman answered beside it, 'Then let melted snow learn to feed the sea.' [303]
Lines overlapped like coral ridges, layer over layer, sorrow over stubborn hope. [315]
While I worked, the anesthetic dream must have carried the boy far from pain, but closer to truth. [333]
Every phrase I teased free felt shrewdly innocent, aware of cruelty yet adamant about gentleness. [348]
Soon I noticed a broken acrostic formed by initial letters, maybe intentional, maybe mercy's coincidence. [363]
It spelled R-E-G-R-O-W, the very sermon of the brain coral fragment warming my pocket. [377]
I pressed the cast against my chest, and the atrium's mist glowed around me like a slow pulse. [395]
Suddenly I knew what sentence to deliver when the boy woke, and to everyone quarreling outside. [411]
But the night withheld its consent, rumbling with distant shellfire that rattled loose plaster onto my shoes. [428]
I remembered how language can shatter when thunder interrupts, and my throat tightened with lotus-hearted ache. [444]
The ache neither clings nor retreats; it simply opens, like a flower asked to bloom in smoke. [461]
I took the brain coral fragment out, placed it on the floor, and watched condensation bead in its grooves. [480]
Each droplet mirrored the ceiling fires, turning wounds into small, temporary constellations. [492]
I whispered the new line aloud: 'Let what was broken remember its pattern, and build again together.' [509]
The words were not mine anymore; they belonged to the cast, the child, the sea, the snow. [526]
They were a treaty drafted in chalk, humbler than ink yet harder to erase. [540]
Above me, vines dripped, and mist curled like listening smoke; the atrium itself seemed to unknot. [556]
I realized my task as translator was never to mediate between enemy tongues but between frightened hearts. [573]
The shared anxieties that gagged every conversation could be eased, not by neutrality, but by remembered tenderness. [590]
Footsteps approached; surgery was ending; soon the boy would surface through narcotic fog, looking for his coral. [607]
I slid the fragment back into his warm fingers, and the grooves fit his skin like an ancient alphabet. [626]
In that fit I sensed a promise sturdier than any I could voice. [639]
Words might fade, but patterns hold, and patterns can lead strangers home. [651]
Outside, the guns kept time, yet inside the atrium a softer metronome had begun. [665]
It ticked in tandem with his pulse and mine, steady as tides reshaping a reef long after the storm. [684]
The night was still unforgiving, but I carried a sentence, a fragment, and a map of echoing hearts. [702]
That would be enough, at least until dawn asked its next difficult question. [715]
