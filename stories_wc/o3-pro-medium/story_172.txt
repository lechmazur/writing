After the last photo was snapped in the deserted hallway, I realized the prophecy's clock had started to sprint. <words>19</words>
The museum emptied like lungs at dusk, leaving only my unsettled guide, Lira, shivering beside a locked service elevator. <words>38</words>
She clutched a wooden puzzle box whose grain formed shifting corridors whenever moonlight glanced across its lacquered lid. <words>56</words>
Rumor claimed the box hid architectural secrets capable of rearranging any structure, brick or bone, with one decisive alignment. <words>75</words>
We rode the elevator down, its cables singing with that sharp gentleness metals acquire when they accept inevitable failure. <words>94</words>
Lira whispered that the prophecy promised disaster the instant the seashell swallowed the horizon, and tonight the tide obeyed. <words>113</words>
We fled the back exit and sprinted through fog toward the deserted beach, footprints filling with phosphorescence behind our heels. <words>133</words>
There, rising like a listening ear from sand, loomed the giant seashell, its inner whorls pulsing with nocturnal surf. <words>152</words>
The prophecy stated that once the shell echoed a name, that person would dissolve into architecture for the coming age. <words>172</words>
Lira, accidentally heroic by persistent accident, decided to outrun fate not by running but by forcing geography to forget us. <words>192</words>
She pressed the puzzle box into my palms and told me to wish backward, syllables spoken as though chewing fresh ice. <words>213</words>
I closed my eyes and voiced, 'Align,' while imagining walls deconstructing, corridors bending, and cameras unclicking their memories in reverse. <words>233</words>
The box warmed, then unfolded like a wooden flower, gears spinning counterclockwise to siphon my wish straight into its heart. <words>253</words>
Sand rippled outward, and the colossal shell rotated ninety degrees, realigning coastline so that the museum corridor pointed out to sea. <words>274</words>
Somewhere behind us, the deserted hallway I had photographed moments earlier erased itself, last shutter echo reversing into unborn silence. <words>294</words>
The prophecy relied on linear echoes, but we had bent the acoustic architecture, leaving destiny pacing an absent corridor for names. <words>315</words>
Freed from its script, the seashell hummed gratitude, spitting out pearlescent sand that glittered like forgiveness across Lira's trembling boots. <words>335</words>
She laughed, less unsettled now, and admitted she had guided many but survived none until someone wished in the wrong direction. <words>356</words>
Realizing the city might soon look for its missing corridor, we buried the box beneath the shell's shadow and walked north. <words>377</words>
With every step, the shoreline shuffled footprints behind us, aligning and realigning, erasing our trail the way a tide edits sentences. <words>398</words>
Some prophecies chase, but others, when turned around, become roads leading quietly toward unimagined dawns. <words>413</words>
