Birdsong echoed impossibly through the flooded vaults, and amid bird songs the forgotten underwater city garden shimmered like a dream. <words>20</words>
In that lucid frenzy of color and silence, Lysander, a graceful swordsman, practiced footwork between coral-covered statues. <words>37</words>
He had come not for battle but for freedom, seeking to escape a world where individuality is suppressed. <words>55</words>
Above the drowned colonnades, an ancient astronomy telescope jutted like a bronze spine, still aimed at a sky long gone. <words>75</words>
Lysander believed the rusting instrument could become a doorway, if only he dared to innovate beyond sword and stance. <words>94</words>
His mind was mindfully scattered, harboring tactics, memories, and wild theories like pearls swirling in the water. <words>111</words>
Theories said that sound carried differently under pressure, able to thread through metal and stone as secret currents. <words>129</words>
If birds could still be heard, surely other messages drifted as well. <words>141</words>
So he scavenged the abandoned halls for broken TVs, remembering an outlawed manual that spoke of reading the heavens by scavenging for cosmic signals in broken tvs. <words>168</words>
Waterlogged screens flickered when struck with his blade, releasing constellations of emerald static like newborn plankton. <words>184</words>
He wired the telescope to these monitors, creating a cathedral of crackling light that pulsed with indecipherable starmaps. <words>202</words>
Each pulse felt like a heartbeat beyond the surface, a promise of other minds unshackled. <words>217</words>
Lysander translated the surges into steps, dancing through the garden while algae swirled around his ankles. <words>233</words>
The choreography shaped an algorithm, and the algorithm triggered the telescope to tilt toward an impossible downward horizon. <words>251</words>
A lens meant for stars now revealed a tunnel of light beneath the seabed, as if the ocean had grown its own aurora. <words>274</words>
He hesitated, sensing the core concept of unforeseen consequences breathing in that glow like a leviathan. <words>290</words>
Yet the suppressed world above would drown him more surely than any beast below, so he stepped into the shaft. <words>310</words>
Gravity inverted; water became sky; his sword morphed into radiant script spiraling around his body. <words>325</words>
The script spelled names of people erased by conformity, each glyph urging him to keep moving. <words>341</words>
Finally he surfaced inside a vast chamber where birds nested in glass domes, singing to machinery that printed unique masks. <words>361</words>
Engineers in identical uniforms approached, astonished to witness a man wrapped in living letters. <words>375</words>
Lysander offered them the lens of the telescope, explaining his method and the garden's hidden door. <words>391</words>
Some recoiled, fearing punishment; others felt the wingbeat of possibility and joined his lucid frenzy. <words>406</words>
Together they innovated further, tuning discarded screens to the birds' melodies and discovering whole dialects of cosmic invitation. <words>424</words>
With every new note a mask dissolved, revealing faces no authority had cataloged, and the chamber brightened with reckless hope. <words>444</words>
Somewhere above, officials wondered why the surveillance feeds now showed nothing but swirling green constellations. <words>459</words>
The answer gleamed far below, carried by a graceful swordsman who had turned suppression into signal and signal into escape. <words>479</words>
