In a borrowed dawn, the atom-powered lighthouse at the edge of no maps hummed like a sleepless heart. <words>18</words>
Its keeper, Rhian, a time refugee from a forgotten empire, considered the hum a language only trustworthy strange souls could hear. <words>39</words>
She awaited her guests in the hush of a line that never moves, a queue of moments frozen between ticks. <words>59</words>
By the alignment of the stars, tonight was the single crack through which history could be resewn. <words>76</words>
Across the salt flats, a makeshift catapult creaked, flinging itself empty, signaling the arrival of the one she meant to heal. <words>97</words>
He came cloaked in an embroidered tablecloth whose faded thread depicted constellations nobody remembered, passport and shroud in the same fabric. <words>118</words>
His name was Jutren, and his eyes carried centuries of exiles walking backward through collapsing dynasties. <words>134</words>
Quietly defiant, he refused to kneel to the present, even as dust from vanished palaces still glittered in his hair. <words>154</words>
Rhian ushered him inside the lighthouse's copper throat, where reactor cores pulsed like caged auroras and corridors smelled of ozone and salt. <words>176</words>
They spread the tablecloth over the central gyroscope, its needle flicking north, then nowhere, then toward memories neither could pronounce. <words>196</words>
To bind old wounds with unstoppable will, Rhian had gathered relic frequencies, each a syllable from empires scoured off parchment and bone. <words>218</words>
She tuned the machinery by whispering those frequencies while Jutren stitched star patterns with light leaking from his palms. <words>237</words>
Outside, the catapult reset itself, winding rope around absence, ready to hurl whatever pain escaped back into the gulf of before. <words>258</words>
As turbines roared, the lighthouse rotated heavenward, casting not beams but corridors, so that the past could walk forward in new skin. <words>280</words>
Jutren stepped through one such corridor and felt every exile behind him step too, their sorrows duct-taped to his ribs. <words>300</words>
The gyroscope spun wild, sewing time's torn hem; sparks embroidered the air until the tablecloth ignited into a calm, silver flame. <words>321</words>
By that light, Rhian read the final alignment: the empire forgotten would remain forgotten, yet its people would remember themselves unbroken. <words>342</words>
Gravity hiccuped, and the lighthouse sank a microsecond into tomorrow, locking shut the seam through which ghosts had leaked. <words>361</words>
Exhausted but whole, Jutren whispered gratitude to Rhian, his voice the hush of that line which at last agreed to move. <words>382</words>
She smiled, quietly defiant as ever, sealing the reactor doors and watching a new dawn, no longer borrowed, climb the quiet sea. <words>404</words>
