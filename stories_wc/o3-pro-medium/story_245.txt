Rust flaked off the railings of the abandoned spaceport flight deck as Varek Pell jogged his daily laps, cursing the emptiness. <words>21</words>
He was an irate smuggler without cargo, pacing like a jailed comet, yet still following the burn in his calves. <words>41</words>
The jogging routine kept the ghosts of sirens quiet and gave him time to study the patterns in his cooling tea leaves. <words>63</words>
Through patterns in tea leaves he believed the universe whispered smuggler routes and the coordinates of hidden waterfalls untouched by tariffs. <words>84</words>
Those waterfalls, rumored to hang beneath shattered moons, were the last fresh water havens a fugitive heart could dream of. <words>104</words>
His heart's revolt had begun the night the syndicate bombed his cargo skiff, killing a stowaway child whose laughter he remembered. <words>125</words>
Profit felt abstractly physical now, like a bruise you could press but never heal, and every credit smelled of gunpowder. <words>145</words>
So he ran laps, read leaves, and waited for a map made of tannin constellations to memorialize the fallen child. <words>165</words>
This morning the cup revealed a jagged line intersecting a spiral, unmistakably a canyon river pummeling down into mist. <words>184</words>
Varek slammed the single chopstick he used as stirring rod against the deck, its click echoing like a starter pistol. <words>204</words>
He would flee the spaceport tonight, chase that omen, and let the syndicate choke on the vacuum of his absence. <words>224</words>
Yet every revolt needs supplies, and the maintenance bays still hid contraband plasma rations he had stashed before the crackdown. <words>244</words>
During jogging, he measured stride length to estimate the time security drones circled, turning exercise into reconnaissance with biting sincerity. <words>264</words>
The drones passed overhead exactly every nine minutes, their lenses fogged by dust storms that peeled off forgotten banners. <words>283</words>
On the seventh lap he broke pattern, slipped beneath a collapsed boarding bridge, and pried open his old locker. <words>302</words>
Inside were ration packs, a cracked helmet, and a folded cloth map he once bartered from monks who brewed epiphany-grade oolong. <words>323</words>
The monks claimed the cloth would reveal hidden waterways when wetted with tears, but Varek thought sentimental textiles absurd until today. <words>344</words>
He dipped the fabric into his teacup and watched sepia lines bloom, matching the canyon spiral the leaves had sketched. <words>364</words>
His pulse hammered a battle rhythm; the heart's revolt had drafted its campaign orders in tannin, textile, and sweat. <words>383</words>
He shouldered the rations, pocketed the single chopstick as lucky cudgel, and sprinted toward the launch catapults before doubt could reload. <words>404</words>
Outside, sunlit dust devils danced like miniature waterfalls, promise flickering in grit, and Varek Pell chased them with blistering hope. <words>424</words>
