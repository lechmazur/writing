After the old record player scratches its last tune, the wasteland orchard thriving amid radioactive dust storms crackles with impatient silence. <words>21</words>
Lisira, a headstrong mage, stands between leafless apple trunks whose bark glows sickly green, feeling merry bitterness fizz at the corners of her grin. <words>45</words>
She is here for one simple reason: to bring color back to a gray world, even if the palette is toxic and the brush is her own beating heart. <words>74</words>
In her gloved hands rests a stained glass box, prisms flickering beneath soot like trapped rainbows begging for release. <words>93</words>
The box can only be opened by someone tenuously certain of what they love, neither arrogant nor doubtful, balanced on the taut wire of almost-knowing. <words>118</words>
Lisira believes she qualifies, yet belief is brittle today, rattling like dead seeds inside her robe. <words>134</words>
Still, she inhales the metallic wind and begins the ritual, drawing sigils in dirt with a finger that shakes from equal parts fear and fizzing hope. <words>160</words>
The final sigil demands one humiliating step: she must feminize her own shadow, granting it curves it never owned, through the residue of glitter on a once-sparkling costume she salvaged from a circus crater. <words>194</words>
The glitter, dull now, remembers carnival lights, and when it touches the drawn silhouette, the dust around her blooms in tentative pinks and lilacs. <words>218</words>
Colors swirl, but they stall, refusing to leap into permanence until Lisira finds the courage to confess what even irradiated trees suspect. <words>240</words>
She kneels, voice hoarse, and confesses that the world was gray because she painted it so, banishing hues the day her sister vanished in the first fallout storm. <words>268</words>
She confesses she was jealous of that sister's effortless brightness, and that jealousy drove her deepest spell. <words>285</words>
She confesses she would trade every bristle of power for one laugh shared under unbroken sky. <words>301</words>
With each confession, the stained glass box vibrates, seams whining like violins strung too tight. <words>316</words>
When her final secret bleeds out—she loved her sister more than herself—the lid unlatches, coughing prisms into the storm. <words>335</words>
Beams refract across roiling dust, spearing clouds, tasting ash, and wherever they land, dead bark absorbs them like thirsty tongues. <words>355</words>
Apples of sapphire and amber puff into being, ridiculous, radioactive, irresistible. <words>366</words>
Lisira laughs, a sound of merry bitterness that startles crows of soot from nearby branches. <words>381</words>
She is not healed; she is only painted, her robes catching shards of color that cut and comfort simultaneously. <words>400</words>
Tenuously certain at last, she lifts a cobalt apple, sees her own prismatic reflection, and dares another confession. <words>418</words>
She whispers that tomorrow she will plant seeds of apology across the desert, even if they grow into memories rather than trees. <words>440</words>
The orchard answers with a rustling applause, part wind, part magic, part sisterly echo. <words>454</words>
After the applause dies, the old record player starts again in her memory, but the needle now rides grooves of color instead of decay. <words>478</words>
And so, within ruins tinted like stained glass, Lisira walks on, carrying both bitterness and merriment like twin lanterns against night. <words>499</words>
