I slipped into the dusty attic where clockwork animals clicked in nervous rows.<words>13</words>
Their tin feathers brushed my bandaged shoulders, reminding me that I was still a bruised fighter.<words>29</words>
Below my boots, the sculptor downstairs raised his hammer; the first strike on marble rang upward.<words>45</words>
That chisel crack was my signal.<words>51</words>
Every time fresh stone met steel, I gained a heartbeat of cover.<words>63</words>
I had come to abduct a memory from myself, through forgotten dreams no rival could patrol.<words>79</words>
A shard of clay pot waited in my pocket, its inscription promising truth if blood warmed the letters.<words>97</words>
The attic smelled of rust oil and old vows.<words>106</words>
Clockwork foxes froze as I passed, as though afraid my purpose might infect their precise illusions.<words>122</words>
Once, I had fought for prize arenas, standing for something I could shout but never believe.<words>138</words>
Today I fought only silence, determined to extinguish the last vestige of self-deception before dawn.<words>153</words>
The pot shard was keener than knives; if I cut my palm and pressed, the script would answer.<words>171</words>
Yet fear bred delay, and delay was the skill at which I remained skillfully incompetent.<words>186</words>
Downstairs, the sculptor's second strike echoed, shaking plaster dust like winter snow across metal fur.<words>201</words>
Each echo shortened my window; the dream corridor would close once the thirtieth chisel fell.<words>216</words>
I unfolded within myself an alley of childhood nights and stepped inside its shadows.<words>230</words>
There, Mother stirred soup that never cooled, telling me greatness meant never admitting pain.<words>244</words>
I touched her shoulder, and the kitchen peeled away to reveal the ring where I first lied about courage.<words>263</words>
My younger self bounced on his toes, freshly bruised yet grinning for the roaring bets.<words>278</words>
I stepped between him and the crowd, abducting the applause that once owned us.<words>292</words>
He stared, confused, until I placed the clay shard into his taped glove.<words>305</words>
Blood from his split knuckles seeped across the inscription, and firefly letters rose like incense.<words>320</words>
They spelled: 'Stand for nothing false.'<words>326</words>
The ring dissolved, leaving us in the attic again, chisel blow twenty-five booming below.<words>340</words>
My younger twin shimmered, then folded into my chest like a note returned to its envelope.<words>356</words>
Pain of both eras braided along my ribs, but deception loosened.<words>367</words>
I pressed the shard against my own heart, accepting scars as signature.<words>379</words>
Below, the thirtieth strike arrived, a final thunder that sealed the marble forever.<words>392</words>
The attic gears halted, as if even the animals acknowledged my stand.<words>404</words>
No applause followed, only a quiet wide enough to house my newest bruises honestly.<words>418</words>
I left the attic carrying no trophies, yet leaving behind every lie that could still hit back.<words>435</words>
That, at last, was standing for something.<words>442</words>
