<story>
Across the tapestry of lost legends, I, Elian Verge, bind forgotten tomes in a world that would rather forget itself.<words>20</words>
My telekinetic fingers flip phantom pages while my tone stays strictly casual, as though levitating parchment were morning coffee foam.<words>40</words>
Tonight I stand inside an abandoned carnival prize booth, prisms of colored bulbs long dead but still reflecting my quiet ambition.<words>61</words>
The booth once rewarded ring-toss champions with stuffed dragons, yet now it shelters my latest commission: reviving a manuscript that never breathed.<words>83</words>
Knowledge has a price, and rumor claims this text contains the equation for changing flesh to starlight, payable in memories.<words>103</words>
I place a single chopstick wrapper atop the warped counter as an offering, its crinkled paper printed with the fortune, 'Break to awaken.'<words>126</words>
Wind whistles through the slats, and the sound bite snaps open a flashback of a child winning this wrapper, crowing beneath neon showers.<words>149</words>
The memory is not mine, yet it revives inside me like a loaned heartbeat, and my telekinesis quivers with fresh voltage.<words>170</words>
I crack the wrapper, releasing stale soy fragrance and another auditory spark—the plink of carnival bells—which hurls me into earlier centuries.<words>191</words>
Through those bells I witness alchemists wagering hearts for higher forms, each bargain a lattice added to the legend I now inhabit.<words>213</words>
When the vision fades, the manuscript before me flutters without wind, its leather sighing like a tired barker inviting one last game.<words>235</words>
I read the opening glyphs, and each symbol rearranges midair, demanding the tribute of my sweetest recollections in exchange for completion.<words>256</words>
Strictly casual, I sigh, 'Invoice me later,' though the ledger of fates glows brutal crimson above the booth.<words>274</words>
Another sound bite—distant laughter riding rusted ferris wheels—shoves me into a flashback of myself aged fourteen, first levitating a notebook during detention.<words>296</words>
I had felt the surge of transformation then, but lacked the wisdom to steer it; now wisdom knocks, charging admission.<words>316</words>
So I pay, allowing the memory to dissolve like sugar in rain, and the manuscript drinks every grain of dissolving childhood.<words>337</words>
In return, letters bloom into instructions for binding skin to possibility, a recipe that can revive what history buried under skepticism.<words>358</words>
But the final paragraph warns that each act of revival warps the reviver into myth, a ripple erased from personal chronology.<words>379</words>
Grandiose subtlety settles over me like velvet dusk; I realize my transformation begins not with power, but with my willing disappearance.<words>400</words>
Telekinesis lifts the page, folds it around the chopstick wrapper, and the booth itself flickers, becoming a rumor that might teach another wanderer.<words>423</words>
I drift outward as ink-smoke, paid in full, leaving behind only the scent of soy and the hush of unplayed carnival bells.<words>445</words>
