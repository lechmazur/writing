Glass roofs were supposed to let in sunrise, yet above the alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night nothing glimmered. [20]  
Within that starless vault, I served as the scattered memory keeper, cataloguing recollections that drifted like bruised petals. [38]  
Each tree grew crystallized fruit from past joys, and each fruit murmured secrets I struggled to arrange in linear rows. [58]  
Order mattered, for the harvest powered the last lamps of our realm, now flickering as sullen embers. [75]  
The Regents claimed hope slept behind a mica window embedded in the oldest trunk, yet none remembered its exact pane. [95]  
My task, they insisted, was to locate it and open woven dawns, a light rumored thicker than silk. [113]  
Those words felt impossible, because dawns here were only stories, and silk rotted before cocoons ever split. [130]  
Still, I obeyed, not from loyalty, but to rekindle a dying realm whose lullabies rasped like broken reeds. [148]  
I carried a lantern of fermented fireflies and entered the western aisle, where shadows grew roots and stared. [166]  
There, suspended among branches, hung a cocoon of intertwined harp strings, humming through forgotten songs that stitched the air. [185]  
I leaned close, and the melody unraveled memories I had misplaced: hearth chatter, market cries, and children braiding ribbons. [204]  
The sound knits communities together even in recall, tugging scattered pieces of self into a warm braid around my ribs. [224]  
When the final chord trembled, the cocoon split, revealing a swaddled figure no larger than an apple. [241]  
It opened mirrored eyes, and I saw not myself but a corridor of endless archways, each leaking pale horizons. [260]  
A whisper followed: 'The pane you seek lies where bound release coils, beyond fear of breaking or being broken.' [279]  
I did not yet understand, but the figure crawled onto my palm and pointed deeper, so I swaddled it tighter. [299]  
Deeper meant the heart trees, where sap ran like mercury and the air smelled of thunder about to remember. [318]  
There, trunks leaned together, forming something like a cathedral built by roots desiring conversation more than worship. [335]  
In the nave stood the mica window, dull as burnt sugar, framed by vines that pulsed with sleeping lightning. [354]  
I approached, yet a lattice of memories erupted across the pane, each scene reflecting my failures to order the orchard. [374]  
Faces I had misplaced begged, 'Do not shelve us; let us breathe together,' and their desperation bound my steps. [393]  
I realized then that my meticulous archives had stratified life, pinning living moments like insects behind dusty labels. [411]  
The window would never open while memories remained separated, because woven dawns required threads crossing, tangling, and shimmering in union. [431]  
The swaddled guide began to sing again, softer, and I sensed I must add my own cracked voice. [449]  
So I freed the logbook from my belt, tore its pages, and tossed them into the cathedral air. [467]  
Each page blossomed into a chorus, releasing fragrances of first meetings, common meals, and arguments cooled by shared rain. [486]  
Soon the nave roared with voices layering, an orchestra of everyday breath, and the vines around the window loosened. [505]  
The tone in my chest felt like bound release, a simultaneous holding and letting go, aching yet joyful. [523]  
Cracks spidered across the mica, and light dripped through, not blinding gold but woven dawns of blues, ambers, and violets. [543]  
The orchard, long starved, drank the colors, and blossoms ignited like lanterns awakening after patient hibernation. [559]  
Branches straightened, pushing against the glass roof until shards popped free, revealing distant constellations reversing themselves like ink absorbing paper. [579]  
I realized the greenhouse was only a reflection; we were in the mirror world, and the true sky waited behind. [599]  
The swaddled guide crawled onto the sill, now glowing, and beckoned every rooted shadow to follow its newborn luminescence. [618]  
Trees uprooted with groans, yet their leaves sang eagerness, for they sensed horizons they had only tasted in sap dreams. [638]  
I stepped through the fractured pane last, carrying nothing but the hum of shared memory weaving inside my veins. [657]  
Beyond lay a dawn still being woven, strands of color floating loose, awaiting singers to knot them into morning. [676]  
We sang, tree and keeper and shadow, through forgotten songs that remembered themselves while inventing new stanzas for unborn hearers. [696]  
With every note, threads connected, knits communities together across rifts, and the nascent sky firmed like cloth stretched on looms. [716]  
When the final chord settled, the orchard shimmered beside us, no longer greenhouse, but forest open to infinite mornings. [735]  
At last I understood my title anew: not to imprison memories, but to swaddle them until they could fly. [754]
