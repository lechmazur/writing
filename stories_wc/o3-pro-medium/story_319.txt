Salt mist veiled the tidal island as the frail guard Etris limped along the ridge at dawn, inventory scroll trembling. <words>20</words>
His duty, reserved for the weakest, was sorting confiscated relics throughout sorting, day after restless day. <words>36</words>
Yet each item whispered of destinies freer than the narrow corridor assigned to his predetermined fate. <words>52</words>
From the crate he lifted a sour-smelling alchemy phial whose fumes curdled even the gulls' cries. <words>68</words>
A sliver of paint on the glass depicted two entwined serpents, allegiances once vivid but now peeling like regret. <words>87</words>
Etris knew the emblem: the rebel tide-painters who vowed freedom by marking loyalties on warriors' skin, their painted allegiances living banners. <words>108</words>
Rumor said the phial held ink harvested from moon-sick cuttlefish, capable of rewriting a brand when brushed on flesh. <words>127</words>
Etris' resolve, always resolutely wavering between obedience and yearning, tipped toward daring as the tide began to retreat. <words>145</words>
He pocketed the vial, then hastened to the pine grove where rebels once met, its trunks scarred with clandestine writings. <words>165</words>
Through messages carved in tree bark, he had long yanked fragments of hope: coordinates, passwords, and merciful jokes. <words>183</words>
Tonight, one fresh line awaited: 'Paint anew, ride west cave, low tide, freedom.' <words>196</words>
But the sea would return by moonrise, sealing the causeway and any chance to escape. <words>211</words>
Heart throbbing like a caged sandpiper, Etris pried off his uniform glove and uncorked the phial. <words>227</words>
The ink reeked of vinegar and thunder, but he dipped a trembling finger and painted over the garrison's iron brand on his wrist. <words>250</words>
Letters bloomed, pulsing like low lanterns: a swirling sigil that claimed no master but the tide itself. <words>267</words>
Pain seared, yet a hush of hopeful melancholy settled when the old scar dissolved, as though forgiven. <words>284</words>
Etris hid the emptied phial beneath moss, then began the descent to the exposed sandbar, legs shaking, spirit steadier. <words>303</words>
Rain clouds heaved offshore, promising delay to patrols; still, he heard distant horns where captains sorted new prisoners. <words>321</words>
Their cries reminded him why painted allegiances mattered, why even resolutely wavering hearts must choose a direction before chosen for them. <words>342</words>
A watchtower beam swept across the surf, but the sigil on his wrist glimmered, tricking the light into seeing only foam. <words>363</words>
He reached the cave, damp ribs of stone yawning, and felt the current tug like a mother's uncompromising yank toward unknown cradles. <words>385</words>
Inside, rebel boats waited upside down, fireflies nested in their hulls, illuminating oars etched with the same serpent sigil. <words>404</words>
A lone messenger, face daubed half-blue half-white, nodded once, acknowledging the paint's truth more loudly than any password. <words>422</words>
Together they slid a vessel to water, winds swelling, waves rearranging moon shards, the island already shrinking behind regretful greys. <words>442</words>
Etris, once a frail guard, now felt the weight of endless sea air fill his ribs, fragile yet undeniably widening. <words>462</words>
Whatever awaited beyond the horizon, he realized, was no longer predetermined, and the melancholy tasted sweet as unbroken dawn. <words>481</words>
