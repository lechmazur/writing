Within the space of a thought experiment, I slipped into the perpetual motion workshop. <words>14</words>
The air smelled of copper filings and graceless beauty, humming unevenly like startled birds. <words>28</words>
I, an undercover plant whisperer, pressed my ear to a fern wired to gears. <words>42</words>
Its fronds murmured instructions in chlorophyll syllables only I could parse. <words>53</words>
They spoke of a loose shoelace dangling beneath the chief engineer's restless boot. <words>66</words>
Tug it gently, they said, and the entire apparatus would reveal its hidden heart. <words>80</words>
But the tug would also constrict the steam collar around the engineer's throat. <words>93</words>
Thus the puzzle became a test of faith, not of engineering. <words>104</words>
Was I willing to risk a life to save a dying forest miles away? <words>118</words>
The workshop's machines spun in singularly multiple loops, each wheel reflecting infinite versions of itself. <words>133</words>
I felt my own identities multiply, agent and gardener, saboteur and healer. <words>145</words>
The engineer plucked a violin to mark tempo, every note stretching threads of tension. <words>159</words>
I waited, with the melody of a violin string breaking, to mask my move. <words>173</words>
When the snap rang, sharp and sorrowed, I knelt by the boot and tugged. <words>187</words>
Metal lungs gasped; vines inside the walls shuddered like prisoners glimpsing daylight. <words>199</words>
Panels slid aside, exposing a crystalline seed spinning at impossible velocity. <words>210</words>
That seed was the last piece of the puzzle, promised cure for blighted groves. <words>224</words>
I cupped it, feeling timelines bloom and wither across my palms like sped-up seasons. <words>238</words>
Behind me, the engineer gagged as the collar cinched, eyes pleading for reprieve. <words>251</words>
Faith demanded I trust the plants' wisdom, yet my own humanity screamed louder. <words>264</words>
I whispered an apology and guided vines to loosen, not tighten, the cruel mechanism. <words>278</words>
Released, the engineer collapsed, breathing like an accordion abandoned after carnival dusk. <words>290</words>
He saw the seed glowing in my grasp and understood the theft immediately. <words>303</words>
Yet awe softened his fury, for graceless beauty had rewritten our roles in seconds. <words>317</words>
Together we agreed to publish designs that shared motion with forests, not stole from them. <words>332</words>
The workshop's wheels coasted to stillness, as though mechanics themselves waited for our covenant. <words>346</words>
Outside, dawn leaked through glazed vents, turning oil slicks into opals, turning doubt into promise. <words>361</words>
I planted the seed beneath the central flywheel, where centrifugal prayers could nurture it. <words>375</words>
Roots erupted, swift yet tender, threading bearings, pistons, and belts with photosynthetic ligaments. <words>388</words>
Instead of seizure, the whole machine began to sing, energy circulating like serene sap. <words>402</words>
The melody resonated precisely with the earlier breaking string, as though failure had rehearsed triumph. <words>417</words>
Gears no longer ground for endless profit; they breathed, expanded, and rested like living leaves. <words>432</words>
In that instant, my undercover mission concluded, yet my pilgrimage had only begun. <words>445</words>
I stepped into the awakening morning, escorted by vines that were singularly multiple companions. <words>459</words>
Their rustling voices reminded me that every faith worth keeping must sometimes reinvent its test. <words>474</words>
So I walked on, shoelace still loose, trusting the road to tighten where necessary. <words>488</words>
