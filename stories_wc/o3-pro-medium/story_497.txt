<story>
After the last glacier melts, the cursed lake swallows daylight in ripples of pristine chaos.<words>15</words>
Beneath its mirror, a submerged palace of coral windows and rusted marble waits like a drowned chronicle.<words>32</words>
Into this impossible architecture drifts Liora Vecht, a daydreaming scholar whose footsteps echo only in her mind.<words>49</words>
Her routine is seldom regular, for tides and whims share the same unreliable clock.<words>63</words>
She seeks a masterpiece that will inspire generations still unborn and still unsure of water's mercy.<words>79</words>
Legends tell of a sliver of a crashed meteor-bound satellite lodged deep in the throne room ceiling.<words>96</words>
Its alloy sings, storytellers say, whenever someone arrives capable of weaving threads of compassion from raw sound.<words>113</words>
Liora imagines symphonies shaped like raindrops, so she follows the rumors beneath the surface.<words>127</words>
At the palace gate she discovers dozens of fish bones laid out as arrows, promoting perseverance over prudence.<words>145</words>
She obeys with a scholar's curiosity, not a pilgrim's faith.<words>155</words>
Soon the corridors narrow into an atrium converted long ago into a forgotten skating rink by exiled courtiers.<words>173</words>
The tiled ice is gone, but scuff marks scar the floor in patterns that almost resemble constellations.<words>190</words>
Realizing the palace itself might be writing, she unrolls tracing paper and begins deciphering the coded scuff marks.<words>208</words>
Angles replace alphabets, curvature replaces cadence, until sentences emerge describing how to coax music from metal.<words>224</words>
Each stanza insists that compassion is not softness but tensile strength, the same property that holds planets together.<words>242</words>
Armed with new notation, she swims to the throne room where voidlike silence vibrates in anticipation.<words>258</words>
The satellite sliver gleams like frozen lightning embedded above a coral throne draped in algae.<words>273</words>
Liora raises her waterproof stylus and taps the alloy according to the rink's secret choreography.<words>288</words>
Notes peel off into shimmering bubbles that thread through shattered chandeliers and sleeping murals.<words>302</words>
Each bubble bursts upon a wall, stitching cracked mosaics back together with luminous veins.<words>316</words>
Statues of tyrant kings crumble, yet the palace grows whole, illustrating the paradox of pristine chaos she pursues.<words>334</words>
Outside, the cursed lake glows turquoise as silted sorrow transforms into vibrating colors travellers will someday map.<words>351</words>
But her composition is unfinished until she folds herself into the melody, offering memory as the final instrument.<words>369</words>
She thinks of peers who mocked her meandering studies and promotes their names within a rising chord of forgiveness.<words>388</words>
These added threads of compassion stabilize the structure, preventing the palace from imploding under its own restored majesty.<words>406</words>
When she finally surfaces, twilight stretches overhead like an unwritten preface, and the lake no longer feels cursed.<words>424</words>
Observers of the future will dive here, hear her music in the walls, and pass it onward, seldom regular yet forever resonant.<words>446</words>
In their retellings, they will call Liora Vecht the scholar who daydreamed entire continents into repair.<words>462</words>
Her masterpiece will not erode until water itself forgets sound, and even then echoes will promote new dreamers.<words>480</words>
