The dismayed minstrel lounged alone in the black velvet sky-lounge floating above the endless city, strumming mute strings for company. <words>20</words>
He had come amid garden secrets, a time whispered by the greenhouse breeze that slithered strangely this high up. <words>39</words>
His motive was subjectively rational: to draw a map of an endless night before its darkness smothered even memory. <words>58</words>
Boundaries, he believed, must be drawn where nothing otherwise ends, or art has nowhere to lean. <words>74</words>
His only tool besides the battered lute was a broken watch band, dangling like a silver question mark from his wrist. <words>95</words>
The face of the watch had fallen somewhere in the cloud-strewn traffic below, leaving the band as a reminder that time can slip its mask. <words>120</words>
So he excavated memories by studying old Polaroid photographs spread across an obsidian cocktail table shimmering with condensation. <words>138</words>
Each square image glowed like a tiny window punched through night, revealing fragments of parks, lovers, and streetlamps swallowed years ago. <words>159</words>
With laconic exuberance he arranged them in spirals, letting their edges kiss until invisible avenues emerged. <words>175</words>
Those avenues hinted at lanes his lute once serenaded, and he outlined them on scrap vellum, remarking distances in chords rather than miles. <words>198</words>
Yet gaps remained where the city duplicated itself like a careless mirror, taunting him with corridors he could neither name nor sing. <words>220</words>
He pressed the broken watch band against the photographs, using its curve to mark territories of lost minutes, and the map began to breathe. <words>244</words>
Whispers drifted from potted night-blooming jasmine that ringed the lounge like secret archivists, promising they would guard the drawn boundaries he inked tonight. <words>267</words>
The minstrel, though dismayed, smiled at their perfumed oath and scribbled a legend: Here ends wonder, there begins recollection. <words>286</words>
He felt the lounge tilt, as if approving, and city lights below rearranged themselves into compass points of showy neon. <words>306</words>
Suddenly a final Polaroid surfaced beneath the table's brass rim, depicting an unlit greenhouse door labeled Exit to Morning. <words>325</words>
He realized dawn itself was the boundary his map required, and that to finish he must refuse to photograph it. <words>345</words>
So he turned the Polaroid face down, drew its outline empty on the vellum, and listened to silence fill the vacant shape. <words>367</words>
Silence, he noted, was a chord too deep for any string, yet perfectly suited to chart the unknowable. <words>385</words>
At last, amid the hovering garden secrets, he set the lute aside, fastened the broken watch band around the rolled map, and let the night stand still. <words>412</words>
The endless city paused with him, waiting for his next tune, but content for now to exist inside the freshly drawn boundaries of a map no dawn could erase. <words>441</words>
