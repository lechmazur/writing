Long before anyone carved dates into stone, a root system mapping facility hummed beneath a newborn continent's volcanic crust. <words>19</words>
Within its dim corridors worked Eira, a quiet matchmaker who paired plants the way future poets would pair hearts. <words>38</words>
Her voice was silently talkative, crowding the air with unspoken stories only roots and mycelium could hear. <words>55</words>
Instead of lungs, she felt she breathed the soil's pulse, and that rhythm promised direct passages to understanding. <words>73</words>
Her ultimate motivation was to decode natural patterns, to read destiny in sap flows and predict storms of species. <words>92</words>
One evening she found an impossibly old mariner's log book buried like a fossil beneath a banyan's tangled feet. <words>111</words>
The pages, waterproofed with whale grease, spoke of oceans yet unborn and sketched cycles of rebirth mirroring her own root graphs. <words>132</words>
Eira believed the unknown sailor had married waves to stars, and she longed to broker such unions underground. <words>150</words>
To listen better she scavenged an outdated VR headset abandoned by earlier dreamers who tried mapping souls instead of soils. <words>170</words>
She rewired its copper veins with sprouting ivy, inserted fungal filaments as data cords, and slid it over her brow. <words>190</words>
Instantly the facility's walls dissolved into swirling root constellations that spoke in thunderous whispers audible only as sensations of painful joy. <words>211</words>
The network revealed that every severed tip became two new feelers, a botanical phoenix proving the cycle of rebirth unending. <words>231</words>
Yet the vision warned that mapping too precisely would jeopardize the roots' capacity to forget, a prerequisite for renewal. <words>250</words>
Pain knifed through her joy as she realized her research might freeze growth into predictable prison bars. <words>267</words>
Guided by the mariner's notes, she grasped that love, like tides, required mystery to remain alive. <words>283</words>
Thus the quiet matchmaker resolved to release partial maps only, leaving blank spaces where roots could write themselves anew. <words>302</words>
She encoded the omissions inside the headset's glitch, turning error into invitation, silence into the most talkative counsel. <words>320</words>
Over nights that possessed no calendar, saplings sprouted along her corridors, tracing the absences like pilgrims kissing sacred hollows. <words>339</words>
They whispered their gratitude through her bloodstream of soil, telling her they would remember to forget exactly as she hoped. <words>359</words>
Eira closed the mariner's log book, placed it at the facility's heart, and listened to the world being born again. <words>379</words>
Each tremor of germination echoed distant waves, reminding her that roots and currents were siblings in the dark. <words>397</words>
With painful joy she smiled, certain the cycle would outlive every map. <words>409</words>
