The guarded minstrel Caelum drifted into the nano-forest at dusk. <words>10</words>
Leaves no bigger than motes hummed circuitry lullabies around his cautious boots. <words>22</words>
He sought, despite his perpetual armor of silence, an angry peace. <words>33</words>
Caelum was skeptically credulous, believing rumors yet doubting every smiling mouth. <words>44</words>
Rumors spoke of extinct crafts encrypted in pollen, waiting for patient interpreters. <words>56</words>
Learning them would free villages from imperial patents, fueling clandestine grassroots movements. <words>68</words>
To prove loyalty, every apprentice had to present a plain plastic bookmark. <words>80</words>
It symbolized humility: colorless, common, unprofitable to monopolize. <words>88</words>
Caelum's bookmark hid between battered strings on his lute's hollow frame. <words>99</words>
Yet trust remained scarce, so the council demanded an impossible confession. <words>110</words>
They asked him to disown the royal ballads he once performed. <words>121</words>
Those songs had glorified the emperor who outlawed manual looms and kilns. <words>133</words>
Caelum clenched his chords, the music vibrating like restrained thunder inside bark. <words>145</words>
He agreed, but on one eccentric condition that amused the mossy jury. <words>157</words>
He would renounce through poetry by decrypting wedding vows that never happened. <words>169</words>
The paradox suited their taste for covert signals and plausible deniability. <words>180</words>
That night, fireflies projected holographic parchments across micro-trunked oaks. <words>189</words>
Caelum plucked minor chords, each note a syllable of forsaken matrimony. <words>200</words>
He spoke of a bride called Autarky and a groom called Dominion. <words>212</words>
Their vows, when reversed and slotted through hexagonal ciphers, unraveled loom patterns. <words>224</words>
Spindles, dismissed for centuries, whirred alive as listeners traced invisible scripts. <words>235</words>
With every revelation, the nano-forest exhaled scents of hot clay and wool. <words>247</words>
Still, Caelum's heartbeat drummed because he felt surveillance woven through shadows. <words>258</words>
Imperial drones hovered, skeptically credulous themselves, recording yet doubting this outlawed liturgy. <words>270</words>
A final stanza remained, the last vow written in a hidden diary. <words>282</words>
Caelum hesitated because finishing meant irreversible betrayal of everything he once sang. <words>294</words>
The crowd sensed his fracture and answered with the quiet fury of hope. <words>307</words>
Their eyes, unarmed yet blazing, urged him toward the unfinished consonants. <words>318</words>
He inhaled resin, flicked the plain plastic bookmark from his sleeve, ready. <words>330</words>
Its transparency caught laser moonlight, scattering it like cheap stained glass prayers. <words>342</words>
Upon that makeshift prism, he projected the diary's last clandestine sentence. <words>353</words>
It read: 'No empire may patent the breath between shuttle and thread.' <words>365</words>
The forest erupted in silent applause, leaves vibrating but refusing audible triumph. <words>377</words>
Caelum lowered his lute and, with angry peace, disowned his gilded past. <words>389</words>
He walked deeper, following newborn loom-chatter, while drones retreated, skeptically credulous still. <words>401</words>
