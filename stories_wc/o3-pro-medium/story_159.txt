Lanterns drifted like patient fireflies above the sandstone labyrinth, their glow mapping corridors that twisted beyond forgetting. <words>17</words>
Amid the warm dusk, a homeless philosopher-king named Rion waited, barefoot, beside the entrance arch. <words>32</words>
He carried a weather-beaten kaleidoscope, its brass dented but its shards of mirror still mischievously bright. <words>48</words>
During readings of forgotten epics, the toy served as his scepter and telescope, the throne of his thoughts. <words>66</words>
Tonight, however, the readings were suspended; he had come to solve the labyrinth once declared unsolvable by stonecutters. <words>84</words>
His motivation glowed inside him like one of the lanterns, modest but impossible to snuff. <words>99</words>
Still, the path required a password only betrayal could provide, and betrayal required witnesses. <words>113</words>
So Rion embraced an earnestly frivolous scheme he had rehearsed between alley fires and academic dreams. <words>129</words>
He would extend his rule, briefly, through confetti-coded proposals at random weddings held in the plazas above. <words>146</words>
Each proposal was a question wrapped in color: accept the kaleidoscope and betray your certainty, or refuse dominion and stay wed. <words>167</words>
Couples laughed, priests scowled, children cheered the floating flecks, and Rion recorded reactions on the inside of his eyelids. <words>186</words>
From patterns of acceptance and rejection, he composed a map whose lines only appeared when the kaleidoscope turned westward. <words>205</words>
The floating lanterns bobbed along, as if eager to illuminate the cartography of heartbeats and hesitation. <words>221</words>
When the final couple, an aging potter and a scholar, accepted with tears, the map flashed entire across the sky. <words>241</words>
Lines of colored fire converged upon a narrow wall where the sandstone seemed to breathe. <words>256</words>
Rion pressed the kaleidoscope against the stone, and the wall sighed open like a book skimmed too often. <words>274</words>
Inside, corridors spiraled in deliberate paradox: every corner led forward yet circled back, a geometry of self-doubt. <words>291</words>
Each step he took triggered a memory of someone who had once trusted him, and whom he had gently misled. <words>311</words>
The betrayal he sowed outside now bloomed within, transforming guilt into directional certainty, sorrow into compass. <words>327</words>
He understood the labyrinth demanded not repentance, but recognition that truth multiplies when fractured like glass. <words>343</words>
Rion lifted the telescope-scepter to each lantern that floated indoors, letting their reflections produce new angles of passage. <words>361</words>
Corridors straightened, ceilings lowered, the maze simplified as complexity yielded to a child's pattern of folding paper boats. <words>379</words>
At the heart, a quiet courtyard held one stationary lantern inscribed with the potter's and scholar's joined names. <words>397</words>
He bowed, set the kaleidoscope beneath its glow, and felt sovereignty pass through him like wind across open cloaks. <words>416</words>
Outside, wedding guests would murmur of a vagrant magician, never knowing their fleeting yeses had redrawn a universe. <words>434</words>
Inside, the philosopher-king finally sat, not on a throne, but on sandstone still warm with lantern breath, simply complete. <words>453</words>
Complex simplicity, he mused, is just the world extending itself to those who agree to be broken beautifully. <words>471</words>
