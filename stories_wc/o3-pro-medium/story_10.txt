Sarik Vale, a cheerless duelist exiled from twelve arenas, crept into the abandoned spaceport customs office at lunar dawn.<words>19</words>
The corridor smelled of ozone and decayed cargo, yet servers still whispered, their fans spinning like distant cicadas amid the hum of server rooms.<words>43</words>
He carried a maggoty wooden chest that rattles with each uneven step, as though disagreeing with his every regret.<words>62</words>
Inside the chest lay the broken foils of opponents who had died discovering his fatal flaws as surely as he had.<words>83</words>
Tonight, Sarik sought neither victory nor escape, but to learn the power of forgiveness that had always dodged his parries.<words>103</words>
In the central data vault, holographic menus flickered, advertising customs-seized recipes from a hundred worlds, each tagged CONFISCATED FOR BIOHAZARD.<words>123</words>
Sarik had once been precisely innovative with food, dueling aristocrats by serving dishes whose flavors parried their boasting.<words>141</words>
Those dinners always ended in blood, because taste, like steel, revealed the hand that wielded it.<words>157</words>
Now, guided by regret, he intended to elasticize one of these quarantined banquets into a balm for his soul.<words>176</words>
He jacked the chest into an ancient port, and the servers projected family recipes he barely remembered from a village lost to orbit debris.<words>200</words>
Lines of code mutated unexpectedly, ingredients rearranging themselves like dueling stances shifting mid-lunge.<words>213</words>
Through unexpected mutations of family recipes, the servers offered a dish called 'Mercy Broth,' rumored to heal the survivor and haunt the killer.<words>236</words>
Sarik followed the holographic instructions, heating contraband spores in a cracked customs kettle while distant alarms coughed but did not wake fully.<words>258</words>
The broth frothed, smelling of childhood and duels at once, a knife and a lullaby in the same steam.<words>277</words>
He poured it into the maggoty wooden chest, letting the broth seep through cracks onto the relic foils.<words>295</words>
Metal hissed, and ghosts of fallen challengers rose as shimmering silhouettes, each holding the final posture that had failed them.<words>315</words>
They surrounded Sarik, not with accusation, but with the aching quiet of possibility undone.<words>329</words>
One by one, he named them, confessed the flourish he should have withheld, the taunt he should have swallowed.<words>348</words>
The silhouettes listened, then dipped their spectral blades into the broth, turning its color from crimson to dawnlight gold.<words>367</words>
Steam drifted toward the ceiling vents, spelling words that only a duelist could read: 'Forgiveness is the final riposte.'<words>386</words>
Sarik knelt, lifted a bowl of the transmuted broth, and drank even though one swallow scalded like cauterized pride.<words>405</words>
Memories recoiled, then aligned, elasticized across years until pain and remorse shared one tensile thread.<words>420</words>
When he opened his eyes, the ghosts were gone, the chest clean, its wood no longer crawling, only quietly breathing.<words>440</words>
Outside, dawnlight filtered through broken loading bay doors, and Sarik walked toward it unarmed, carrying nothing but the aftertaste of bittersweet reckoning.<words>462</words>
