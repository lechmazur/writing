If punctuality were an Olympic event, Florian Derwent, vigilant orchardist and indefatigable volunteer at the national paper airplane test facility, would podium every time.<words>24</words>
Never tardy, he arrived before dawn to mist the corkscrew willows planted beside the wind tunnels, as though topiary mattered in aerodynamics.<words>46</words>
The horticulture soothed him, a brittle consolation since the tractor accident that had shattered both orchard and brother three summers prior.<words>67</words>
Still, sardonic glee crackled in his voice whenever he greeted the engineers, for their prototypes often nose-dived like rotten pears from a storm-shaken bough.<words>91</words>
Florian's other ritual involved polishing an antique letter seal he kept on a lanyard, its copper stamp engraved with a labyrinthine peacock.<words>113</words>
Visitors assumed it sentimental, unaware that the grooves concealed micro-etchings of crop-loss spreadsheets and shipping invoices.<words>129</words>
Florian suspected the facility's grant committee of funneling pesticide-tainted pulp into school cafeteria cartons, and the numbers hidden in his seal were crumbs leading to the bakery of truth.<words>158</words>
Unraveling conspiracies, he often joked, was easier than pruning apricots, because lies rarely threw retaliatory thorns.<words>174</words>
Today he meant to demonstrate the scheme's geometry via the patterns in a peacock's tail, projected onto the massive fan blades that churned the hangar air.<words>200</words>
Each ocellus would correspond to a ghost invoice; together they formed an eye-spangled indictment impossible to redact without plucking the bird bald.<words>222</words>
But first, the weekly volunteer orientation assembled, rookies holding origami gliders like anxious fledglings awaiting a push from the nest.<words>242</words>
Florian, punctual to prophecy, strode in at seven on the dot and addressed them with orchard-hardened authority.<words>259</words>
He explained that throughout volunteering they must log every crash, for paper and truth share a tendency to crumple under sudden impact.<words>281</words>
His sardonic glee surfaced when a latecomer shuffled in, and he quipped that tardiness was acceptable only for funerals one attended as the corpse.<words>305</words>
The room laughed, disarmed, while he slipped the antique seal into soft clay, leaving an emblem he claimed was merely decorative.<words>326</words>
In reality, the imprint marked which boxes of scratch paper contained residue from the tainted pulp, boxes he would later swap with sterile stock.<words>350</words>
Step by patient step, the orchardist cultivated his case like espaliered vines along the hangar wall, training evidence toward sunlight and whistleblowers.<words>372</words>
When the engineers dimmed the lights for turbulence simulations, he projected the peacock pattern, each luminous eye blinking accusation across spreadsheets taped to propellers.<words>396</words>
Gasps fluttered like panicked gulls as rows of forged signatures aligned with tail-feather crescents, outlining a smug silhouette that unmistakably resembled the committee chair.<words>420</words>
Florian felt the old grief loosen its chokehold; by forcing truth into flight, he had finally harvested something that would not bruise.<words>442</words>
