Rain puddles still glossed the cracked pavement outside the depot, but the city called it recovery. [16]  
After the drought ends, every drop looks like a promise both kept and threatened. [30]  
I, Mara Rhys, preventable death investigator, was already cataloging new dangers in old places. [44]  
The mayor wanted assurances that nobody would drown in the renewal. [55]  
Assurances are bargains with chaos, and chaos keeps receipts. [64]  
So I climbed past the yellow tape into the subway maintenance tunnel where yesterday a worker vanished. [81]  
The air smelled of wet iron and hesitant electricity. [90]  
My breath stayed watchfully calm, coached by years spent noting patterns before panic could bloom. [105]  
Motivation sharpened each step: to break free from a controlling influence named Director Havel. [119]  
His office decided which fatalities were 'acceptable', then buried the rest under spreadsheets. [132]  
I meant to gather undeniable evidence that he edited lives like numbers. [144]  
This tunnel, newly flooded despite every inspection, could hand me that proof. [156]  
My flashlight caught a glint near the wall: a brass lantern from underground railroad, its glass intact. [173]  
Touching it sent a static shiver up my arm, as if history exhaled. [186]  
Voices flickered in my head, fragments of entangled memories not my own. [198]  
A girl whispering freedom codes, a conductor humming prayers, a soldier breathing regret—they overlapped like translucent maps. [215]  
The lantern glowed without battery, and ripples of light reverberate along damp concrete. [228]  
I steadied myself through empirical observation: water depth three inches, voltage negligible, exit twenty meters rearward. [244]  
Yet the voices persisted, urging south, toward an auxiliary shaft blocked on today's map. [258]  
Curiosity fought protocol, and curiosity won. [264]  
Crawling under a sagging mesh gate, I felt the city's heartbeat quicken in the pipes. [279]  
The lantern light sharpened until bricks ahead appeared freshly laid, though records dated them 1890. [294]  
An anachronistic imprint, I mused, or maybe sabotage disguised as heritage. [305]  
Water lapped higher, whispering like pages turned too quickly. [314]  
I rounded a bend and saw the missing worker, alive but trapped under a fallen conduit. [330]  
He stared at the lantern as if it condemned him. [340]  
"Cuts weren't my idea," he rasped, recognizing my badge; "Havel made us skip reinforcements to meet deadlines." [357]  
The controlling influence materialized in the confession, no longer abstract spreadsheets but bleeding steel. [371]  
I recorded his statement while levering the conduit with a rusted jack. [383]  
When it shifted, water surged, and the lantern slipped from my pack into the current. [398]  
Light spiraled under, illuminating a low arch I had not noticed. [409]  
I followed because investigation demands completeness, and because the entangled memories tugged with sorrowful insistence. [424]  
Beyond the arch lay a brick chamber dry as bone, despite the seeping world behind me. [440]  
On the floor rested ledgers embossed with the city seal and Havel's forged signature. [454]  
Pages documented every deferred repair, every preventable death forecast, every hush payment. [466]  
The chamber was a mausoleum of intentions, and the lantern's light made ink gleam like bruises. [482]  
I felt both fortified vulnerability and rising fury. [490]  
Here were the chains I meant to break, coiled in data, weighing down every commuter. [505]  
Through empirical observation, I cross-checked dates against my field notes, sealing guilt in objective metrics. [520]  
Then I turned to leave, but the chamber refracted, bricks sliding like puzzle pieces. [534]  
The memories within the lantern sought completion, entangling further, asking me to carry them upward. [549]  
I whispered I would, and their voices quieted to a steady pulse. [561]  
Back at the main tunnel, the worker limped beside me, disbelief mixing with gratitude. [575]  
We surfaced just before dawn, city lights winking like cautious allies. [586]  
I delivered him to paramedics and the ledgers to reporters waiting under the modest cover of umbrellas. [603]  
Evidence began to reverberate across the morning news, louder than any denial Havel rehearsed. [617]  
His influence cracked like brittle glass under collective scrutiny. [626]  
I felt the lantern cool; its job done, it dulled to ordinary brass. [639]  
Still, when I close my eyes, entangled memories hum—a reminder of debts paid forward. [653]  
Freedom, prevention, and truth share a corridor, and I intend to patrol it. [666]  
After all, droughts end, but vigilance must flow. [674]
