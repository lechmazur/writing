Serevin Duskstring, a nervous minstrel whose jokes were rarely sincere, tuned his algae-harp beneath the humming bio-reactors of Lumicene plaza tonight again.<words>22</words>
The bacteria-powered city glimmered with luminous pipes that pulsed like arteries, reminding him how fragile every engineered dawn could be there.<words>43</words>
Tonight's modest crowd demanded drinking songs, but Serevin rehearsed a secret itinerary that pointed beyond alehouse laughter.<words>60</words>
Stuffed in his vest was a crumpled photograph of sky charts drawn by his long-vanished mentor, the astronomer Veyl.<words>79</words>
Veyl had whispered that Lumicene’s true power awaited anyone bold enough to deploy music by following star patterns rather than tavern requests.<words>101</words>
Serevin meant to escape the ordinary before the lonely candle flame at his feet guttered out and returned him to mediocrity.<words>122</words>
He struck a tentative chord, and the plaza lights dimmed, as though granting cautious revelry its prelude.<words>139</words>
Gasps fluttered like pigeons when spectral constellations shimmered above the stage, mapping the forgotten route Veyl had promised.<words>157</words>
Instead of applause, Serevin heard murmurs of fear, for his harmonics nudged the bacterial grid to recycle power away from breweries.<words>178</words>
City marshals in copper masks advanced, ordering him to cease, but he bowed theatrically, still rarely sincere, and riffed into a fugue.<words>200</words>
The bio-reactors trembled, reconfiguring pipes into luminous arrows that pointed past the market towers toward the dark hills.<words>218</words>
Crowds scattered, yet children lingered, their eyes reflecting star-shapes that no dome had projected for decades.<words>234</words>
Serevin followed the arrows, plucking chords that stabilized the faltering power, and small throngs trailed him, intoxicated by possibility.<words>253</words>
At the city gate, marshals tried to block the procession, but luminous vines erupted from the conduits, spelling the same celestial route skyward.<words>276</words>
Recognizing myth in motion, they hesitated, and Serevin slipped past, clutching the crumpled photograph like scripture.<words>292</words>
Beyond walls, the night smelled of brine and rechargeable moss, and the arrow-light converged on an ancient observatory half-buried in tidal sand.<words>314</words>
Inside, gears powered by dormant bacteria awaited melody, and Serevin deployed a final chord that matched the center of the photograph’s pattern.<words>336</words>
The dome unfolded, revealing bare heavens where real stars blinked through the city’s smog for the first time in a generation.<words>357</words>
As candlelight behind him began to gutter, Serevin felt the audience of children light fresh wicks from the starlight, extending the moment.<words>379</words>
He laughed, no longer nervous, finally sincere, sensing that purpose in a world of uncertainty was simply to tune it toward wonder.<words>401</words>
