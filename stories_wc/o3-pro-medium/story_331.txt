<story>
The night after the last mountain erodes, Arin steps into the quantum entanglement garden with excited restraint.<words>17</words>
He is the garden's reserved caretaker, sworn to preserve spiritual practices that flutter between parallel realities.<words>33</words>
Though honestly dishonest about his own past, he never lies to the plants that hum in entangled pairs.<words>51</words>
Each blossom echoes a sister blossom far away, and Arin converses with both at once by writing the future.<words>70</words>
He carries a leather ledger whose pages rearrange themselves according to quantum probabilities, forming sentences he has not yet penned.<words>90</words>
When the ledger glows mauve, he knows a decision must be made before the glow collapses into certainty.<words>108</words>
Tonight, the pages foretell an agitation spreading through the garden, stirred by the flight of bats at dusk.<words>126</words>
The bats, once sacred messengers, have begun to echo wrong timelines, rattling petals and confusing the unseen sisters.<words>144</words>
Arin must pacify them, yet he cannot chase nor curse them, for their wings map chants older than matter.<words>163</words>
He remembers the forgotten music box buried beneath the central lattice, a relic whose lullaby once aligned probabilities.<words>181</words>
However, the ledger warns that opening the box will cost him all memories that make his solitude bearable.<words>199</words>
With excited restraint trembling under his ribs, he decides to be honestly dishonest with himself one more time.<words>217</words>
He tells the ledger he accepts the price, while secretly hoping the future will rewrite the debt.<words>234</words>
The mauve glow sighs into silver, and the soil parts like courteous waves, revealing the tarnished lid of the box.<words>254</words>
Bats wheel overhead in fractal spirals, their sonar notes knitting a temporary hush across multiversal branches.<words>270</words>
Arin lifts the lid; a cracked cylinder begins to spin, leaking a melody that wanders through half-remembered prayer.<words>288</words>
Petals vibrate, entangled sisters align, and the bats fold their wings, landing like punctuation at the edges of pathways.<words>307</words>
Within the ledger, new lines appear, not in ink but in soft absence, promising that his memories merely relocate.<words>326</words>
Relief agitates his calm, yet he binds it with practiced breath, honoring the vow of excited restraint.<words>343</words>
The garden's blossoms now hum in perfect octaves, and Arin hears twin voices thanking him from impossible distances.<words>361</words>
But a final sentence grows across the ledger: 'Caretaker, you must leave before dawn, or the melody will loop forever.'<words>381</words>
Obedient, he pockets the dormant music box, now fragrant with quantum pollen, and walks toward the gate of eroded stone.<words>401</words>
Behind him, bats rise again, carrying the lullaby to galaxies where new mountains dream of someday wearing away.<words>419</words>
Ahead, the path unwritten waits beneath dawning starlight, and Arin quietly begins writing the future with each measured step.<words>438</words>
