At the hush of an empty mailbox at midday, Quillan the skeptical minstrel stepped across cracked concrete toward the condemned disappearing ink factory. <words>23</words>
He had come not to sing, but to out-scheme an immortal trickster rumored to nest among the rusted vats. <words>42</words>
The wager, struck over mead and suspicion, promised Quillan whatever wisdom eternity had denied him, if he dared snatch a single secret first. <words>65</words>
Reckless generosity fueled his lunge into danger; the minstrel would gift that stolen secret to anyone who asked, just to spite the eternal cheat. <words>89</words>
Inside, the factory exhaled acetone ghosts and the impossibly plausible hiss of an ancient steam vent guided him like scandalous flute music. <words>111</words>
Each sulfurous sigh painted messages on the mist that vanished, befitting a place where even ink refused permanence. <words>129</words>
Yet among the skeletal presses he spotted a gleam: a jagged scrap of dragon-scale armor wedged between gears like forgotten royalty. <words>150</words>
Legend swore the trickster crafted disguise from such shards, wearing centuries as costumes, so Quillan pocketed it, feeling fate graze his fingertips. <words>172</words>
A sudden twang echoed: he had stepped on a desk drawer rigged as a slingshot, launching rusty paperclips across the gloom like meteor shrapnel. <words>196</words>
The barrage rang against a distant boiler, and the trickster materialized, applauding with gloved hands stitched from yesterday's newspaper headlines. <words>216</words>
His smile dripped courtesy, yet his eyes tallied every potential humiliation he could levy upon the meddling musician. <words>234</words>
"Give me my scale and bow out, bard," he crooned, voice slick as spilled patent ink, "and I might only erase your shadow." <words>257</words>
Quillan answered with irreverent awe, plucking his lute to produce a chord so off-key it seemed designed by insolent cherubs. <words>277</words>
He proposed a trade: the armor scrap for a single sentence capable of destroying any contract, written or implied. <words>296</words>
Flattered by such reckless generosity, the trickster agreed, inscribing words on nothing with disappearing ink only the desperate could read. <words>316</words>
As the phrase hovered then faded, Quillan snatched it via the hiss of the steam vent, funneling vapor through his throat to capture syllables. <words>340</words>
The trickster, suddenly wordless, realized the minstrel had stolen the promise itself, leaving only the scrap, which crumbled into harmless glitter. <words>361</words>
Outside, Quillan whispered the contract-killing sentence to the midday mailbox, and the empty cavity swallowed every binding oath in earshot, including the trickster's immortality. <words>385</words>
Freed from eternal loops, the former prankster aged fifty centuries in a sigh, then thanked the minstrel with the humility of collapsing dust. <words>408</words>
Quillan, ever skeptical, penned a ballad on borrowed parchment, using ordinary ink, certain that impermanence sometimes sings the longest note. <words>428</words>
