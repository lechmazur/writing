Mist coiled around the high-altitude tea house like a sleepy dragon. <words>11</words>
Inside, Dr. Calyx Marrow, comically serious yet undeniably mad, polished a glass terrarium. <words>24</words>
The terrarium contained three carnivorous orchids that clicked their petals in hunger. <words>36</words>
A worn-out leather belt, once belonging to his vanished mentor, held the lid shut. <words>50</words>
Intermission had been called in the adjacent mountain cinema, and patrons spilled into the teahouse. <words>65</words>
Loyalty to silence proved fickle when gossiping lungs sought warmth and bergamot steam. <words>78</words>
Dr. Marrow barely noticed, for unexplained phenomena flickered across his portable projector. <words>90</words>
He had spliced hidden sections into an old black-and-white film reel stolen from the archives. <words>105</words>
When the reel played, certain frames ionized ambient air, revealing ghostly blue corridors no one else could see. <words>123</words>
Those corridors, he believed, were ancient pathways carved by extinct cloud-dwelling civilizations. <words>135</words>
Finding them would validate years of ridicule and, perhaps, feed his plants fresh mysteries. <words>149</words>
A bored usher announced tea refills, his voice bright as tin yet trembling with altitude nausea. <words>165</words>
The crowd cheered, then rotated like a shoal toward the copper samovar. <words>177</words>
Dr. Marrow seized the moment of distraction. <words>184</words>
He unbuckled the weathered belt, letting orchid mouths gape open, dripping sweet digestive dew. <words>198</words>
The orchids thirsted for whatever lay beyond the ionized frames, sensing nutrients in secrets. <words>212</words>
Marrow threaded the reel through a pocket projector aimed at the fogged window. <words>225</words>
Electric pop, silver flare, and the glass dissolved into a shimmering hallway of clouds. <words>239</words>
Everyone turned, their cups mid-sip, as chairs groaned like doubtful jurors. <words>250</words>
Fickle loyalty surfaced; some patrons edged closer, others bolted for the exit lights. <words>263</words>
Marrow invited the brave with a theatrical bow worthy of silent cinema villains. <words>276</words>
His tone remained comically serious, eyebrows arched like grave accents on a punchline. <words>289</words>
He stepped into the corridor, orchids squelching along his sleeves like carnivorous epaulets. <words>302</words>
Ionized mist licked the teahouse floorboards, turning spilled Earl Grey into tiny sparking galaxies. <words>316</words>
A hesitant mountain guide followed, clutching a teaspoon as if it were a sword. <words>330</words>
Behind him, the usher whispered prayers to gods of altitude and ticket stubs, then stepped through. <words>346</words>
The hallway pulsed, rearranging itself into stairs descending toward thunderheads lit from within. <words>359</words>
Marrow sensed the path slanting toward the rumored Vault of Floraphores, where plants dreamt in language. <words>375</words>
His heart sprinted, but seeds of doubt sprouted as the orchids hissed a warning. <words>389</words>
Unexplained phenomena were rarely kind, and fickle corridors might close like jaws. <words>401</words>
Still, ancient pathways never reveal themselves to cautious souls, he reminded himself with manic cheer. <words>416</words>
He tightened the worn belt around his waist, symbol and tether, then strode downward. <words>430</words>
The projector, forgotten on a windowsill, flickered, threatening to burn out and strand them forever. <words>445</words>
Outside, the tea house bell chimed the end of intermission, but no one remained to listen. <words>461</words>
Only mist and unanswered tickets drifted where once there had been seats and certainty. <words>475</words>
