Nimbus Gallows stood at the lip of the ice cavern, humming cheerful disaster drills into the frozen air.<words>18</words>
Friends called him an overly optimistic doomsday prepper, a contradiction he wore like mittens knit from meteor forecasts.<words>36</words>
Tonight, at the hush as a candle's flame is pinched, he had brought his latest insurance against nothingness.<words>54</words>
It was a quantum entanglement watch band, glittering like ice-flecked circuitry and ticking with paired possibilities.<words>70</words>
Nimbus believed the band could tunnel data between divergent tomorrows and thus notify him before any universe collapsed.<words>88</words>
He balanced hope and dread in politely chaotic rhythms, whistling evacuation routes while rearranging stalagmites into welcoming signposts.<words>106</words>
Yet a deeper purpose pulsed beneath the hum of his optimism: to create a new reality entirely.<words>123</words>
He imagined a timeline where sorrow branched like fractals, beautiful and finite, instead of endlessly drowning hearts.<words>140</words>
To plot the jump, Nimbus analyzed the subtext of lullabies echoing from cavern walls, decoding comfort for hidden alarms.<words>159</words>
He believed nursery tunes archived the colors of the unforeseen, harmonies that painted futures too shy to declare themselves.<words>178</words>
Frost-ruffled wind carried one such melody now, lilting in minor thirds like lanterns searching for doors.<words>194</words>
Nimbus tapped the watch band, threading the tune through its quantum mesh, waiting for entangled seconds to answer.<words>212</words>
The display glowed ultraviolet then bled into shades no spectrum had consented to name.<words>226</words>
Those were the colors of the unforeseen, and each hue twisted sorrow into a different tessellation of maybe.<words>244</words>
Nimbus laughed, the sound bright yet fissured, because confirmation always arrives hand-in-hand with fracture.<words>258</words>
The watch band vibrated, politely chaotic, signaling that collapse and creation were now inseparable twins screaming for birth.<words>276</words>
He knew the protocol: notify the silence, then step through it.<words>287</words>
So Nimbus silenced his breath, a final drill, and whispered the lullaby backward, unraveling its cradle into corridor.<words>305</words>
Ice shattered like applause, opening a prismatic rift whose edges fluttered between cavern and conjecture.<words>320</words>
Beyond flickered a realm forged from halted regrets, every shard of past sorrow arranged into repeating kindness.<words>337</words>
Nimbus tightened his pack of seeds, blankets, and improbable blueprints, supplies for a dawn that had never lost power.<words>356</words>
He stepped inside the rupture, feeling time fold like origami ice, sharp yet promising sculpture.<words>371</words>
Behind him the cavern sighed closed, extinguishing itself exactly when the imaginary candle's flame would have died anyway.<words>389</words>
Fractal sorrow sang in his ears, but each echo contained a note of relentless, rebuilding hope.<words>405</words>
Nimbus Gallows smiled into the unforeseen colors and began sorting them into shelters for everyone still dreaming.<words>422</words>
