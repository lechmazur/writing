<story>Dawn had barely hinted at itself when I eased my skiff into the twilight barge canal. [16]  
Mist lay in bands over the water, cool and luminous as breath made visible. [30]  
I came as an errant legend seeker, driven less by fame than by a private hunger. [46]  
That hunger was, simply, to understand the architecture of lies surrounding this forgotten corridor. [60]  
Generations had spoken of vanished barges, sudden fortunes, and a clockwork sun that guided smugglers. [75]  
All such tales broke off, though, in respectful hush, as if censored by the silence of morning radio. [93]  
No broadcaster mentioned the canal anymore; even the weather forecasts leapt discretely over this strip of water. [110]  
Such omissions sounded louder to me than any bell. [119]  
So I carried only my notebook, an antique pocket sundial, and a coil of thin hemp rope. [136]  
The sundial, brass worn smooth by palms long dead, had belonged to my grandfather, a reputed trickster. [153]  
He claimed it could read shadow even at night, but scoffers never noticed he used reflection instead. [170]  
That slant of thinking suited me; misdirection sometimes lets the truth walk out unguarded. [184]  
The canal narrowed near Lock Nine, where limestone walls sweated cold tears. [196]  
There I cut the engine and poled forward, unwilling to wake echoes beneath the planks. [211]  
The water answered with a hush, a serene upheaval of minute ripples that parted like curtains. [227]  
Something metallic glimmered below, catching first light that seeped between the overhanging birches. [240]  
Instinct whispered, Salvage it before the mud remembers to bite. [250]  
I slipped overboard, water folding around my chest with surprising warmth. [261]  
The object proved to be a rusted strongbox chained to a ring set in the wall. [277]  
Links sighed apart after one persuasive twist of the crowbar I kept taped under the gunwale. [293]  
When I heaved the box aboard, the sundial in my pocket swung like a compass. [308]  
Its gnomon aligned not to the sunless sky but to the dripping lock gate ahead. [323]  
I realized then that my grandfather had built the device to read not hours but intentions. [339]  
By training instincts, he had tuned brass and shadow into a moral weathervane. [352]  
Following its point, I pried open the strongbox. [360]  
Inside lay ledger books, quills sealed in wax, and a stack of unsigned shipping manifests. [375]  
Pages crackled like autumn under my fingers, each line of ink a thin disguise for atrocity. [391]  
The canal company had moved more than silk and spice; they had ferried people sold into silent labor. [409]  
Profits glazed the ledgers, numbers shimmering where names should have been. [420]  
I felt hindsight clarity pour through me, cold as the canal yet bracing. [433]  
Every rumor, every skipped forecast, suddenly arranged itself into a thoughtfully clear mosaic. [446]  
The lies had been architectural indeed, brick upon brick of omission supporting pillars of wealth. [461]  
My boat rocked gently, and I sensed watchers behind shuttered windows along the towpath. [475]  
If I paddled away now, I would vanish like last night’s fog, another rumor unverified. [490]  
Instead I tied the box to the prow, opened my notebook, and began copying the damning columns. [507]  
Ink bled a little in the damp air, but the words held. [519]  
The sundial’s shadow inched across blank metal though the sun remained unseen, urging speed. [533]  
I worked until light spread fully and the mist retreated like a defeated negotiator. [547]  
Footsteps sounded on gravel; a man in a station coat hailed me with practiced casualness. [562]  
Behind his smile waited the old company, reborn as a charity for heritage preservation. [576]  
He asked whether I required assistance, eyeing the strongbox as though it were driftwood. [590]  
I replied that I was merely compiling local weather data, and the sundial confirmed my tone with a steady pointer. [610]  
The man nodded, unsettled by some undercurrent he could not name, then trudged away. [624]  
I realized I had become part of the legend I once pursued, the unpredictable force that bends stories toward justice. [644]  
There was risk, but the canal itself had taught me that silence corrodes more than confession. [660]  
I set course downstream, planning to deliver the ledgers to any microphone still brave enough to crackle aloud. [678]  
The water, finally sunlit, mirrored sky and boat so perfectly that direction seemed an open conspiracy. [694]  
Behind me, the lock gate closed with a slow groan, as if the past itself accepted its unmasking. [712]</story>
