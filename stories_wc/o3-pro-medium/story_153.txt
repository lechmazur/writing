After the last star huffed out its final photon, I descended into the underground city of the mole people to enroll again.<words>22</words>
They alone kept universities lit by bioluminescent fungus, and their registrar welcomed my perpetual transcripts with mundanely glorious indifference.<words>41</words>
I am an eternal college student studying immortality, condemned by curiosity yet fueled by it.<words>56</words>
My latest thesis argues that gifted burdens shape the lattice of consciousness more than time does.<words>72</words>
To test it, I sought artifacts bearing both weight and illumination, and unearthed a coal miner’s headlamp from a collapsed mine near the mole people’s transit shafts.<words>99</words>
The lamp’s cracked lens leaked a steady, sorrowful gleam, neither alive nor dead, perfectly mirroring my own halfway existence.<words>118</words>
Because electricity had become myth after the cosmic blackout, I powered it with memories, telling the lamp stories until it shone brighter.<words>140</words>
Each narrative I surrendered was digitized by the lamp into pulses only I could read against my eyelids.<words>158</words>
Thus the action to digitize became a sacrament, etched in flickers rather than silicon.<words>172</words>
Yet the mole scholars demanded peer review, so I swapped travel journals with tunnel cartographers who mapped abysses deeper than despair.<words>193</words>
Their journeys filled my pages with granular darkness, while mine lent theirs hesitant starlight, and both of us learned new synonyms for silence.<words>216</words>
Through the swapped travel journals, the headlamp recognized cartographic grief as fuel, burning it into spectra that outlined what reality still obeyed me.<words>239</words>
I stood before the fungus-lit faculty and displayed these spectra swirling like domesticated auroras around my unmoving heart.<words>257</words>
Detached devotion governed my voice: I desired no applause, only the right to become a master of my own reality at last.<words>279</words>
The dean, ancient even for a mole, proclaimed that mastery requires accepting every gifted burden without protest, then listening to its directions.<words>301</words>
So I donned the headlamp, which promptly projected the miner’s final scream, followed by a path spiraling inward past language, memory, and light.<words>324</words>
I walked that mundanely glorious spiral for what felt like an office hour, though epochs wheezed by outside my concentric shadow.<words>345</words>
At the core I found not immortality but the syllabus for reality itself, written in coal dust and photon ash.<words>365</words>
Signing my name beside the miner's, I felt the contract seal; the headlamp dimmed, having transferred authorship to me.<words>384</words>
Now, whenever I blink, new corridors appear, and the mole people quietly enroll in courses I have not yet imagined.<words>404</words>
Their trust, another gifted burden, steadies my detached devotion like a metronome tick within the void where stars once sang.<words>424</words>
And so the eternal college student continues, digitizing existence day by day, headlamp aglow, forever revising the syllabus that revises him.<words>445</words>
