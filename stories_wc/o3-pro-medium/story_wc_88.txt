The day after the procedure, I woke in the reclamation ward tasting antiseptic and exile. [15]  
They promised a clean slate, yet memory stains still pulsed behind my eyes like bruised stars. [31]  
I was the program's dirtiest success, the clean slate seeker with a past no solvent erased. [47]  
They let me keep only one belonging, a scuffed baseball signed by a time traveler. [62]  
Its looping autograph read, 'Swing when the pitch is impossible,' which felt like medical sarcasm. [77]  
Discharge papers shoved me toward the subway, but the city above ground sounded too linear. [92]  
So I descended through maintenance tunnels, chasing rumors of an underground bioluminescent lake. [105]  
They said the water illuminated whatever the surgeons had scrubbed away. [116]  
Getting there was a journey wrapped in a labyrinth of choices, each corridor branching like guilt. [132]  
Guidance came by reading between newspaper lines plastered to damp walls. [143]  
I tore page after page, decoding headlines for arrows, obituaries for passwords, classifieds for warnings. [158]  
The ink ran, but patterns emerged, delicately robust like lace forged from engine grease. [172]  
Somewhere between sports scores and scandal, an arrow pointed toward a service hatch labelled 42B. [187]  
I pried it open with the baseball, denting both door and destiny. [199]  
Below, steps spiraled, slick with condensation and moral ambiguity. [208]  
Every echo reminded me who I had been before the clinic rewired my sentiment circuits. [223]  
Arsonist, data thief, empathy bankrupt. [228]  
The pledge now was to kindle empathy where none remains, starting with myself. [241]  
But the more steps I took, the more I sensed the surgeons had only whitewashed my crimes, not absolved them. [261]  
At the stairwell's end, a cavern opened, roof hung with roots sparking electric blue. [275]  
The lake lay beneath like overturned night, its ripples casting constellations onto stone. [288]  
I stepped to the shore, and the water brightened, mapping veins across my shadow. [302]  
Somewhere inside that glow I felt jaded wonder, awe tempered by the certainty of bills coming due. [319]  
Legend said the lake reflected choices not yet made, a fluid maze showing exits and dead ends together. [337]  
I knelt and pitched the baseball high, letting it arc over the glowing surface. [351]  
When it splashed, rings of light radiated outward, etching paths across the labyrinth of choices trembling below. [368]  
Each ring contained a vision, flickering like silent newsreel. [377]  
In one, I returned upstairs, resumed crime under a cleaner alias, profit blooming yet heart hollow. [393]  
In another, I surrendered to authorities, wore orange, and let paperwork erode me to a cautionary footnote. [410]  
But a third vision shimmered: I coached little-league children beneath broken floodlights, teaching patience through impossible swings. [427]  
Their laughter, not coins, paid my rent in something like redemption. [438]  
The lake dimmed, as if waiting for my choice. [447]  
I fished the baseball out; its signature now glowed, delicate yet robust, resisting the water's bleach. [463]  
'Swing when the pitch is impossible,' it reminded, and I realized the message was never about sports. [480]  
It was about empathy, the most unhittable curve in my history. [491]  
To coach those children, I would need to feel them, absorb their skinned-knee dramas without profit motives. [508]  
The surgeons had wiped reflexive cruelty, but empathy still lay in fragments waiting to be soldered. [524]  
I cupped lake water and drank, expecting pain, tasting sparks and distant little cheers. [538]  
Memories not mine surfaced: a boy missing a mother, a girl proud of a bunt, a father struggling to clap. [558]  
Their small sorrows threaded through my synapses, delicately robust enough to hold the weight I could not. [575]  
Jaded wonder cracked into something softer, and for once I let it. [587]  
I pocketed the gleaming ball, marking the third path as chosen. [598]  
Leaving the cavern, I followed fresh newspaper clippings that now rearranged themselves into schedules, teams, and birthday reminders. [616]  
The corridor smelled less of mildew and more of chalk dust and cut grass. [630]  
Halfway up, I hesitated, fearing future relapses, then squeezed the baseball until its glow pulsed like a second heart. [649]  
Impossible pitch, impossible life, still worth the swing. [657]  
When I finally surfaced onto the street, dawn was breaking and so, perhaps, was I. [672]  
Above the fold of a discarded newspaper, a headline now read, 'New Coach Brings Light to South End Diamonds'. [691]  
The edition was tomorrow's. [695]  
I tucked it under my arm and walked toward the diamonds, navigating the simplest labyrinth I'd ever seen: one straight line forward. [717]
