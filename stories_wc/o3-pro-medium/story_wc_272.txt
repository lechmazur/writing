Rain hammered the lantern glass of the lighthouse that rose like a gaunt finger above the cliff. [17]  
Inside, Elias Mara, a crestfallen portrait artist, pressed his palms to the iron door and listened to the sea. [36]  
He had fled here with a single suitcase and a broken tarot card box whose velvet lining bled threads. [55]  
Why did a painter carry divination tools, and why were they smashed? [67]  
Such questions, rhetorical questions, fluttered in his skull like trapped gulls, giving his thoughts their own salt-burn. [84]  
But the lighthouse held another refuge: a forgotten library inside a lighthouse, catalogued by no town record. [101]  
Elias descended the spiral steps, oil lamp ahead, heart behind. [111]  
Shelves curved with the stone, lined with brine-spotted volumes whose titles trembled between languages. [125]  
The air hummed a luminescent ache, as though light itself remembered being a bruise. [139]  
He found a drafting desk beneath a round window and unpacked worn brushes and blank canvas. [155]  
He would redesign his life, he swore, by untangling threads knotted in the tarot and in memory. [172]  
Yet fragmented reality clung to him like wet linen. [181]  
Colors shifted when he blinked; sentences in books rearranged mid-syllable. [191]  
He wondered: Was the world breaking, or merely the threshold of his perception? [204]  
Outside, thunder punched the glass, and the walls seemed to breathe inward. [216]  
It was, unmistakably, the hour when the walls close in. [226]  
He set the broken tarot card box on the desk and spilled its contents: twenty-one intact cards and one missing. [246]  
The absent image, The Moon, had once borne his mother's face in place of the goddess. [262]  
She had vanished into asylum corridors after sitting for that portrait, claiming silver fish spoke from mirrors. [279]  
Elias had painted her, and guilt painted him back ever since. [290]  
Now he asked, his voice soft, 'Mother, did I fracture you, or did you fracture the world?' [307]  
The rhetorical question echoed between marble columns of shelved dust. [317]  
In response, the lantern sputtered and strands of smoke braided upward, forming threads that led toward the stacks. [335]  
He followed, pulling each gray filament like an embroiderer pulling needle trails through cloth. [349]  
By untangling threads, he believed, he might locate the missing Moon, or at least the truth behind its absence. [368]  
Volume after volume slid aside with small sighs, revealing hidden passageways of paper. [381]  
Within one alcove he found a mirror framed by barnacled copper, surface cracked into a spiderweb of reflections. [399]  
Each shard held a version of him painting portraits that bled onto the floorboards. [413]  
Fragmented reality, he realized, meant every decision was simultaneously a wound and a bandage. [427]  
He lifted one mirror shard, and water streamed out of the crack, pooling around his boots. [443]  
With tide rising indoors, he felt the lighthouse tilting, its bookshelves groaning like hull planks. [458]  
He asked another question, almost laughing: 'Is redemption buoyant or does it deliberately drown?' [472]  
No answer arrived, only the door of the library swinging shut as wind shoved the world. [488]  
He understood the walls would indeed close in, but closing could be direction as much as doom. [505]  
To descend into necessary darkness, he stepped into the pooling water and let it guide him downward through a trapdoor. [525]  
Below, a chamber opened where the lighthouse foundation fused with sea caves lit by blue fungus. [541]  
There hung the missing tarot card, The Moon, pinned to a rope of kelp like a tattered flag. [559]  
The painted face of his mother shimmered, alternating between sorrow and fierce invitation. [572]  
Elias reached, but the portrait spilled silver fish that swam upward toward the library ceiling now far above. [590]  
He realized the redesign of his life required surrender, not capture. [601]  
So he let the card drift from its kelp ribbon, and darkness closed like velvet wings around him. [619]  
Inside that luminescent ache, water, memory, and light wove anew, untangling enough threads to show a horizon. [636]  
He did not know if he ascended or descended, only that he moved with purpose where fragments finally fit. [655]  
Somewhere above, the lighthouse lantern calmed, its beam sweeping the storm like a hand over fevered hair. [672]  
Perhaps, he thought, fractured worlds can be art if one accepts the cracks as contours. [687]  
That was his final portrait: not painted, but lived, brushed across water and stone during the hour when the walls close in. [709]  
And if the Moon glimmered behind the fog afterward, who could say whether it was sky or canvas? [727]  
The question remained, deliberate and unanswerable, like a lighthouse turning circles for ships that may never arrive. [744]
