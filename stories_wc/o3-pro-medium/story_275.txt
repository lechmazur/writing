The comet arrived first, a roaring ember smeared across the night and turning the orchard to shivering glass.<words>18</words>
Trees once lush now stood ghostly, pale trunks echoing bone while fruit crumbled to ash at a sigh of wind.<words>38</words>
Into this deliberate wilderness drifted the hermit, cloak smelling of peat smoke and distant storms no map remembered.<words>56</words>
None knew the hermit's name, and that secrecy coiled around him like ivy, making his silence more persuasive than speech.<words>76</words>
Villagers whispered he was theoretically rebellious, rejecting every rule except the subtle laws whispered by cracked soil.<words>93</words>
His possession, guarded as fiercely as breath, was a pressed flower album bound in leather gone soft from decades of moonlight.<words>114</words>
Each brittle bloom had been labeled in ink dusted with comet tail, yet the notes lay in an extinct tongue.<words>134</words>
So the hermit wandered orchard rows to translate those marks, believing their meaning could coax life from barren ground.<words>153</words>
Throughout moving shadows cast by scorched branches, he measured silence and choice alike.<words>166</words>
Mindful choices, he always muttered, are seeds you place where even blight is forced to make room.<words>183</words>
To locate such covert soil, he relied via the exact angle of a half-bent weathervane protruding from the ruined chapel.<words>203</words>
He would spin its warped arrow, feel for the tremor that aligned heaven, earth, and the silent vocabulary of roots.<words>223</words>
When alignment clicked, he opened the album at that weathervane bearing, letting starlight settle on a chosen page.<words>241</words>
One night the weathervane pointed north, a direction forbidden since the river turned toxic, yet the hermit obeyed its mute demand.<words>262</words>
He pried up parched turf and buried a pressed violet, reciting syllables that tasted of rust and dew together.<words>281</words>
From the comet's glare a drip of molten light fell onto the spot, hissing like an opened serpent egg.<words>300</words>
Dawn found a single green shoot unfurling, fragile yet stubborn, its tip reflecting the sky's fire as though recognizing kin.<words>320</words>
The villagers crept near, haunted by hunger, and begged the hermit to repeat the wonder across their withered fields.<words>339</words>
He answered that rebellion, even theoretical, must serve more than the rebel; it must translate despair into pattern others can tend.<words>360</words>
Therefore they, not he, would shoulder mindful choices, lift stone, and sow ashes where the weathervane declared possibility still whispered.<words>380</words>
Guided by cometlight, villagers followed, throughout moving nights, the hermit's deliberate footsteps that mapped an orchard reborn in slow breaths.<words>400</words>
Every new shoot they tended carried the scent of char and hope, a reminder that even ruination can fruit when listened to.<words>422</words>
In time the comet faded, but the pressed flower album thickened with living leaves, each page softly beating like a second heart.<words>444</words>
The hermit, mystery intact, slipped beyond the horizon, leaving only the half-bent weathervane and a creed of attentive planting.<words>463</words>
Where he went mattered less than the orchard he left, humming with choices finally made, green against the memory of flame.<words>484</words>
