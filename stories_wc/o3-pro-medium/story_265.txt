Deputy Mariel Cruz kept her face impassive even as the cathedral's sagging doors moaned open at dawn.<words>17</words>
Officially she was there to supervise routine oil changes for the county's forgotten fleet stored in the nave.<words>35</words>
Unofficially she returned to witness a moment of pure grace, something the maintenance logs would never capture.<words>52</words>
High above, apple branches had burst through shattered glass, weaving a lush orchard spanning the rafters in fragrant defiance.<words>71</words>
Each breeze carried uncharted echoes, whispers of hymns mingling with the rustle of ripening leaves.<words>86</words>
Mariel felt those murmurs press against her breastbone like petitions, yet her personally impersonal demeanor stayed intact.<words>103</words>
She climbed the corroded ladder to the balcony where mechanics kept barrels of oil and coffee mugs.<words>120</words>
From there, the orchard's canopy unfurled before her, ripe globes glowing through dust-mottled sunbeams like lanterns at vigil.<words>138</words>
She removed her badge, a tiny act of cautious bravery nobody below would notice amid the clang of wrenches.<words>157</words>
Then she produced a twisted twist tie she had pocketed from a crime scene long resolved yet never forgotten.<words>176</words>
It was the only thing flexible enough to stretch between two drooping limbs without harming their bark.<words>193</words>
She fastened it, forming an improvised bridge, and the branches quivered like throats clearing before a confession.<words>210</words>
A hush spread, and the echoes changed, shifting from Latin chorales to the secret language of bees.<words>227</words>
Soft clicks, airy vowels, and pollen-thick consonants spiraled around her ears, instructing her where to step next.<words>244</words>
Guided, she walked the rafter, boots balanced on age-bleached beams, until she reached the orchard's heart.<words>260</words>
There, a single blossom remained unopened, its petals straining against dew like fingertips against stained glass.<words>276</words>
The bees' language quieted, waiting for her verdict, and Mariel understood the moment sought her witness.<words>292</words>
She dared not touch; instead, she stood utterly still, letting her breath sync with the blossom's trembling.<words>309</words>
Below, a compressor kicked on and metal rang, but up here time stalled, oil changes pausing for grace.<words>327</words>
The petals unfurled in one silent exhale, releasing a glimmering mist that smelled of engine smoke and spring.<words>345</words>
Mariel felt her pulse hesitate, neither speeding nor slowing, simply acknowledging what the universe could still invent.<words>362</words>
She saluted the blossom with two fingers, deputies' manners meeting pollinators' etiquette, and the bees buzzed approval.<words>379</words>
When she descended, wrench smells replaced perfume, and her expression resumed its official impassivity like a shutter dropping.<words>397</words>
No one asked why a twist tie now linked two upper boughs, and she filed no supplemental report.<words>415</words>
Yet around her clipboard she felt uncharted echoes looping like vines, promising to bloom again during the next oil changes.<words>435</words>
