The scarecrow called Thatchmouth blinked glass eyes as consciousness fluttered like sparrows across sacks of straw.<words>16</words>
He stood impaled in the cracked collarbone of a fossilized giant that served as his watchtower.<words>32</words>
Windless dust seas stretched beneath, etched with pale lines in the earth marking borders only memories obeyed.<words>49</words>
Thatchmouth felt a fervent apathy toward those borders, both burning to defend them and weary of caring.<words>66</words>
His oath, sworn to an emperor long turned to silt, commanded him never to abandon the lines.<words>83</words>
Yet no traveler came unless summoned through the visor gleaming before his stitched mouth.<words>97</words>
The visor was a relic of forgotten engineers, opening corridors between parallel worlds via encounters in virtual reality.<words>115</words>
Whenever its crimson glyphs pulsed, Thatchmouth would plug straw fingers into copper ports and dream elsewhere.<words>131</words>
Tonight, the dream deposited him inside a ballroom coded from frost, chandeliers, and implausibly realistic moonlight.<words>147</words>
A lone woman danced there, waving a forgotten lace fan that shed bytes like drifting petals.<words>163</words>
Her algorithms fluttered toward Thatchmouth, sketching questions he could not answer about purpose and rot.<words>178</words>
He replied with silence, the only language fervent apathy speaks eloquently.<words>189</words>
The woman, avatar of some distant archivist, insisted the lines in the earth were obsolete code needing deletion.<words>207</words>
Thatchmouth felt his oath tighten like twine around his ribs, and he refused.<words>220</words>
Her ballroom shifted to a kitchen, knives hovering; she offered him one, inviting collaboration.<words>234</words>
Instead, he reached for a spit shimmering on the hearth and chose to skewer his own straw heart.<words>252</words>
The virtual pain translated realistically fantastical sensations—sparks, autumn smoke, childlike echoes—into the fossil tower's vacant marrow.<words>268</words>
The visor registered his defiance as a system glitch and abruptly ejected them both into waking shards.<words>285</words>
Now the woman's avatar flickered beside him atop the collarbone, her code degenerating into moths of static.<words>302</words>
She beheld the desert, the fossilized giant, the lines stretching to every horizon, and finally understood scale.<words>319</words>
She asked, almost softly, why he would guard an emperor’s bones when empire itself had logged out.<words>336</words>
Thatchmouth answered that oaths mattered only between parallel worlds, where outcomes cannot be patched after release.<words>352</words>
Hearing this, she folded the lace fan, turned it blade-sharp, and offered it as a replacement heart.<words>369</words>
He accepted, feeling apathetic joy—an oxymoron blossoming—and wind at last whistled through the titan’s hollow skull.<words>385</words>
The moths of static settled onto the earth, tracing fresh luminous lines that merged with the ancient scars.<words>403</words>
Together they watched those lines glimmer, neither hoping nor despairing, simply existing until the next summoning.<words>419</words>
