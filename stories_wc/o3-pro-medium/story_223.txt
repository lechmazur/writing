<story>
I arrive at the crystal fortress gleaming at the end of the rainbow canyon, already nauseous from phantom waves.<words>19</words>
Even on land, I'm a seasick naval officer cursed to feel every remembered tide.<words>33</words>
The assignment is elegantly ridiculous: guard a translucent ghost orchid bulb locked within the star chamber.<words>49</words>
Legend swears the bulb will transform once each century, if touched by moonlight in perfect phase.<words>65</words>
My orders, however, say nothing about transformation; they speak only of traded secrets circulating like dark currency.<words>82</words>
Someone is coming to barter knowledge for the blossom, and I must decide the price.<words>97</words>
I pace the quartz battlements, awkwardly charming the silent gargoyles with jokes to steady my stomach.<words>113</words>
They do not laugh, but their reflective faces remind me why I accepted this lonely post.<words>129</words>
I must confront the mirror before it lies againâ€”with or without allies.<words>141</words>
That mirror, buried beneath the throne room, once showed me my brother when I searched for myself.<words>158</words>
He had vanished during a tempest, carrying the navy's chart of lunar rhythms essential for navigating tides.<words>175</words>
The mirror lied, insisting he betrayed us; I never believed it, yet doubt eroded me like salt.<words>192</words>
Now, in this time-dilated gorge, nights drift across the quiet longing of centuries.<words>205</words>
Each evening I track the moon phases, marking quartz slabs with chalk made from ground shells.<words>221</words>
When the marks align into a silver circle, the bulb will bloom and unveil either truth or treachery.<words>239</words>
On the predicted night, a cloaked figure sails down the canyon on a raft of prismed light.<words>256</words>
He introduces himself with my brother's forgotten nickname, delivered in an accent eroded by stormwater.<words>271</words>
The fortress spins, seasickness surging, yet I keep my saber lowered, enthralled by impossible reunion.<words>286</words>
He claims he survived by transforming with the tides, a trick learned from the orchid's luminous roots.<words>303</words>
In exchange for his life, he traded secrets with moon spirits: the mirror's manufacture and its hunger.<words>320</words>
The mirror, he says, devours stories, then regurgitates them twisted to keep watchers captive.<words>334</words>
To break the cycle, the bulb must be planted inside the mirror at full lunar apogee.<words>350</words>
But once planted, either the mirror shatters or the planter forgets every cherished memory.<words>364</words>
Nostalgic defiance floods me; I'd rather lose my past than let the glass lie again.<words>379</words>
We descend to the throne room, our boots echoing like oars striking hidden seas beneath stone.<words>395</words>
Moonlight threads through the skylight, glancing off the bulb, turning its veins into trembling constellations.<words>410</words>
I press it into the mirror's heart; the glass ripples, swallowing orchid and reflection in one gulp.<words>427</words>
Memories leak from me like seawater through cracked planks, yet the fortress brightens, opalescent and still.<words>443</words>
My brother grasps my shoulders, repeating my name as if anchoring it against the undertow of forgetting.<words>460</words>
I cannot recall his face, but I remember the mission completed, and the mirror finally silent.<words>476</words>
Outside, at the rainbow canyon's edge, dawn forms a new horizon I feel but can't yet picture.<words>493</words>
