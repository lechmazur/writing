The mirrored reflection on the lighthouse prison window warped moonlight into silver blades between the bars. <words>16</words>
Within that glittering pane stood Sir Aldric, a weatherbeaten knight whose armor creaked like tired gulls. <words>32</words>
He had fought tempests and tyrants, yet this glassy echo of himself forced the hardest stare. <words>48</words>
Every breath fogged the surface, sketching fleeting ghosts of impossible choices he had tried to forget. <words>64</words>
Tonight the warden had delivered a brass door knocker, polished and heavy, then locked the cell again. <words>81</words>
Its quiet gleam mocked the rusted bolts, promising exit to any hand brave or foolish enough. <words>97</words>
Aldric knew the offer carried chains heavier than iron, yet he felt a grudgingly sweet tug of hope. <words>115</words>
He glanced around the round chamber where lantern smoke curled over seemingly random items tossed by previous prisoners. <words>133</words>
A cracked sextant, seven marbles, a wilted violet, and a broken quill sprawled like meaningless debris. <words>149</words>
Yet the mirrored window winked, and arrangement shifted in reflection, revealing a hidden compass rose. <words>164</words>
Aldric crouched, aligning each trinket as the phantom image suggested, appreciating the pattern blooming beneath fingertips. <words>180</words>
When the last marble clicked into place, the brass door knocker warmed, pulsing like a captured heartbeat. <words>197</words>
Aldric lifted it, and the mirrored reflection fractured, opening a corridor of turning glass and roaring surf. <words>214</words>
Beyond, he saw the jagged reef beneath the lighthouse, waves smashing like applause soaked in blood. <words>230</words>
The corridor bent time; every panel showed moments he dreaded: comrades fallen, a burning village, a betrayed queen. <words>248</words>
Each memory screamed for acknowledgment, yet he walked, intent on hushing the final cry of regret. <words>264</words>
At the corridor's mouth waited a second Aldric, unmarred by scars, eyes bright with unspent mercy. <words>280</words>
Beside this doppelganger hung two doors, identical save for the knocker placed upon only one. <words>295</words>
A parchment declared that opening the adorned portal would free him but condemn every soul he had failed. <words>313</words>
The bare door promised salvation for them, yet tethered him forever within this reflective labyrinth of sorrow. <words>330</words>
Joyful agony welled as both knights raised gauntlets, mirroring hesitations like dancers nearing a fatal dip. <words>346</words>
Realizing the reflection was his unchosen life, Aldric bowed, appreciating at last the price of every path. <words>363</words>
He pressed the knocker to the doppelganger's chest, and the figure shattered into forgiving light. <words>378</words>
The bare door opened of itself, releasing distant voices newly spared, while the corridor sealed behind him. <words>395</words>
Alone in mirrored dusk, Aldric knelt, tasting the grudgingly sweet silence of redeemed regrets. <words>409</words>
