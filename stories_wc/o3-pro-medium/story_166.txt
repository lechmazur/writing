Moonlit vapor quivered above the frozen orchard that fed off hidden geothermal streams, like breath lingering between planets. <words>18</words>
Since the last wish was granted, silence never entirely settled, stirring gentle chaos among skeletal apple limbs. <words>35</words>
Marrow, the ghostly caretaker, drifted along the rows, humming a solemnly silly lullaby no mortal remembered. <words>51</words>
His transparent fingers clutched a single plastic straw, trophy from a world that once ignored whispers of decay. <words>69</words>
With it he intended to perforate the veil between senses, allowing animal tongues to braid directly with his thoughts. <words>88</words>
The orchard's foxes already watched, their eyes citrine lanterns, curious why a straw mattered more than any blade. <words>106</words>
Marrow answered through a bow, weaving through fate as though it were branches, promising stories knotted in air. <words>124</words>
Yet he required guidance, and guidance could be traveled through forbidden expedition logs buried beneath the orchard's steaming roots. <words>143</words>
Centuries before, explorers charted these geothermal arteries, noting inexplicable paw prints that glowed whenever promises were spoken aloud. <words>161</words>
The council sealed their journals, fearing revelation would tempt farmers to harvest wishes like frostbitten peaches. <words>177</words>
Tonight Marrow thawed the timbers covering that cellar, each creak a ripple that made icicles chime like timid bells. <words>196</words>
Inside, the logs waited, their inked margins crawling with annotations scribbled by raccoons chasing literacy and moonlight. <words>213</words>
Marrow read aloud, and every phrase flapped like a paper-winged crow, inviting the orchard fauna to assemble. <words>230</words>
The foxes arrived first, then stoats, snow hares, and a bear smelling faintly of fermented sap and patience. <words>248</words>
He lifted the plastic straw like a baton, solemnly silly grin bending his translucent cheeks. <words>263</words>
With a precise thrust he perforated his own wavering throat, letting steam and song funnel through the narrow tube. <words>282</words>
Sound burst outward, half chirp, half language, weaving through fate's loose stitches and braiding beast minds with his echo. <words>301</words>
Syllables tasted of snowmelt pears, and every animal understood his desire: not mastery, simply conversation. <words>316</words>
They answered in chorus, the bear reciting geothermal temperatures while foxes debated ethical compost, each revelation tagged by bubbling earth. <words>336</words>
Gentle chaos blossomed: branches iced, burst, refroze, and vibrated like harp strings tuned by mischievous winter bees. <words>353</words>
Within the shimmer, Marrow felt weight again, as though gratitude from hooves and claws quilted him a temporary body. <words>372</words>
He traced circles in snow, marking a pact that animals would guard the logs and steward future wishes responsibly. <words>391</words>
As dawn pinked the orchard, the plastic straw fell, its duty done, humming one last note that promised perennial dialogue. <words>411</words>
