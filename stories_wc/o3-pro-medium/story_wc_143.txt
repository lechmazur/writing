Halina stepped onto the moonlit summit of Mons Vesper, the tallest volcano on outer Luna. [15]  
As the space age stretched into its silver middle years, such climbs were left to specialists. [31]  
Halina was a crater inspector, one of the last remaining, purposefully curious about every scarred basin. [47]  
She had come alone tonight with a camera older than most colonists, bound by a final commission. [64]  
Her employer wanted a photograph of the last ice plume freezing upward from the volcano before sunrise. [81]  
Civil engineers would seed the mantle with heaters tomorrow, ending the natural eruptions forever. [95]  
Halina intended to outlast the bitter wind and capture the plume when dawnlit melancholy colored the sky. [112]  
The summit was quieter than she expected, a dawning hush folding around the domed observation pod. [128]  
It reminded her of childhood mornings on Earth when frost painted windows before her first expeditions. [144]  
She unpacked peculiar instruments, not all standard issue. [152]  
Foremost among them was a crystal vial containing a single nightwatch's hourglass sand grain, stolen from museum storage. [170]  
Legends said the grain once measured the vigil of the first orbital sentry, absorbing centuries of silence. [187]  
Halina believed its resonance could trigger her message system with unearthly precision. [199]  
She was no saboteur, only a historian who preferred chemistry over shouts. [211]  
Using chemical reactions for timed messages, she had programmed flares to bloom along the crater rim at intervals. [229]  
Each flare would illuminate the plume in phases, allowing her camera to catch details otherwise washed by glare. [247]  
The vial was the master trigger; when its lattice sensed moonrise, acids would seep, fire would follow. [264]  
She checked her watch and saw fifty minutes before sun crest, though Earthlight already licked the horizon. [281]  
Plenty of time, she told herself, yet her breath fogged the visor with nervous condensation. [296]  
A low tremor shivered through the basalt, announcing the volcano's final heartbeat. [308]  
Halina steadied the tripod and whispered a benediction to the geologic giant beneath. [321]  
The plume erupted, not violently but like a ghostly banner unfurled by slow-motion parade. [335]  
Crystals glittered inside the vapor, catching starlight and reflecting it onto Halina's suit. [348]  
Her visor HUD recorded temperature spikes and rare isotopes, but her heart recorded something harder to catalogue. [365]  
She pressed the vial into its socket and stepped back. [375]  
The grain shimmered, absorbing the faint seismic song, then cracked with a sound too soft for microphones. [392]  
Chemicals mixed, a hiss coiled through tubing, and a ring of flares ignited around her vantage. [408]  
Sudden umber light carved dragon-scale shadows across the plume, revealing textures like coral drifting in tide. [424]  
Halina's camera whirred, capturing frame after frame, each a relic for archives that might never be opened. [441]  
The dawning hush deepened rather than broke, as though the mountain wanted to listen to its own farewell. [459]  
She felt the same, stunned by quiet where she had expected roaring vents and alarm klaxons. [475]  
Time slid like slow ice; minutes later the sun's rim brightened the eastern void, tinting everything rose-gold. [492]  
The heaters' construction drones appeared as silhouettes on distant ridges, buzzing patiently toward their irreversible task. [508]  
Halina realized she was photographing not just the last plume but the valley's last unmanufactured morning. [524]  
Her purposefully curious mind catalogued details even her lens missed—the mineral smell, the static on her tongue. [541]  
Would the archives convey that sensorial sorrow to children born beneath regulated atmospheres? [554]  
She doubted it, so she spoke aloud, recording a commentary that mingled technical notes with lullaby cadence. [571]  
When the last flare burned out, the plume had thinned to wisps, and the hush finally lifted like curtains. [590]  
Radio chatter from the drones poured into her headset, practical voices slicing through her vigil. [605]  
She packed the camera and the cracked vial, determined to deliver the images before bureaucracy erased context. [622]  
In doing so she hoped to outlast forgetfulness, not by living longer, but by shining longer through memory. [640]  
She took one last look at Mons Vesper where the ice had turned to ordinary steam and vanished. [658]  
The melancholy dawn had passed, but its residue clung to her like frost that refuses to melt indoors. [676]  
Halina descended the slope, carrying within her helmet the silence of the nightwatch's grain and the mountain's goodbye. [694]
