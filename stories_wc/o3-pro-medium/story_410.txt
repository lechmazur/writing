<story>
The elevator dinged, but its doors parted onto an empty floor, a final reminder of topside civilization I had not visited in decades.<words>23</words>
I shuffled back into the cavern cathedral alive with phosphorescent flora, my chosen exile carved beneath the city like a forgotten lung.<words>45</words>
Isolation, I had discovered, can be both a scalpel and a rusted chain, slicing illusions while shackling the heart in echoing doubt.<words>67</words>
Yet the municipal reservoirs above were choking with algae, and someone had to restore the water systems before the city coughed itself dry.<words>90</words>
That someone became me, an astute hermit armed with a map, a toolkit, and a single blunt scissor filched from a janitor decades ago.<words>114</words>
The scissor could not cut rope, but it could pry rusted panels with a persistence that was strangely effective, as though stubbornness sharpened steel.<words>138</words>
Still, every solo attempt to reroute pipes echoed my own parched psyche, so I sought a way to amplify hope in these dripping catacombs.<words>162</words>
Memory supplied an absurd solution: lure motivation via the scent of a fresh loaf of bread, the bakery fragrance that once filled my childhood kitchen.<words>187</words>
So I rigged the ancient air vents to waft simulated yeast and crust through the tunnels whenever my energy flagged, a self-baited trap.<words>210</words>
The aroma would bloom at the moment an elevator arrives to an empty floor, synchronizing my toil with the ghost schedule of commuters.<words>233</words>
Imagining their invisible hunger made me laugh and curse in equal measure, despairing humor echoing off stalactites like cracked bells.<words>253</words>
Each clang of laughter startled the bioluminescent vines, and they brightened, turning the cavern into a neon confessional where even regrets glowed forgivingly.<words>276</words>
Guided by that mercy, I traced corroded valves, used the blunt scissor as a lever, and reopened channels that city engineers had dismissed as lost.<words>301</words>
Water gurgled through the labyrinth again, first a cough, then a hymn, until the cavern cathedral alive with phosphorescent flora hummed like an organ of rain.<words>327</words>
I knelt, soaked to the shins, realizing the city above would taste clarity by morning, never knowing its savior was a subterranean recluse seduced by bread fumes.<words>354</words>
That irony rose with the steam, mixing with the scent until the whole corridor smelled like a bakery drowning in river water.<words>376</words>
I laughed again, the sound oddly buoyant, because I knew isolation had not blunted me after all; it had honed me differently, and difference proved strangely effective.<words>403</words>
As the elevator above shut its doors on no one, I sheathed the blunt scissor, aired out the last crumbs of imagined bread, and walked deeper, already planning the next repair.<words>434</words>
