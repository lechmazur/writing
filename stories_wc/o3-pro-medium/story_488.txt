Rusty twilight bled over the quantum beach, where waves folded into themselves like uncertain equations. <words>15</words>
On the glassy sand waited Imryx, a solitary summoner whose chants tasted of iron and ozone. <words>31</words>
Behind him, the condemned carnival hotel groaned, seconds away from the hush that precedes organized obliteration. <words>47</words>
Imryx watched security crews retreat and felt corroded rapture ripple through his nerves like salt on rust. <words>64</words>
Tonight he would summon not spirits but the spark of invention itself, hoping to outshine his own reflection. <words>82</words>
The only guide he trusted was a map drawn on a leaf, veins threading routes finer than arteries. <words>100</words>
It smelled oddly authentic, as though the tree remembered every footstep that had bruised its ancestral canopy. <words>117</words>
To read it, Imryx had to prowl along the shoreline, matching leaf-vein constellations to shimmering particle crests. <words>134</words>
Each step shifted him through probability, so he left footprints in several futures that immediately eroded. <words>150</words>
His family would have called this adventure a holiday, for they celebrated Equinox Eve by dismantling reality then rebuilding it. <words>170</words>
Their unique method involved trading heirloom memories like ornaments, hanging them on the night until dawn relit the tree of days. <words>191</words>
Imryx, last of that line, intended to hang a brand-new memory tonight, forged alone beside collapsing architecture. <words>208</words>
The leaf map pointed toward the hotel's shadow, where feral light seeped through boarded windows like radioactive honey. <words>226</words>
Time paused, the demolition siren holding its breath, granting Imryx the silent interval scholars called the Hush Gap. <words>244</words>
Inside that gap, equations peeled off the ocean and orbited him, eager to be sculpted into something unprecedented. <words>262</words>
He spoke the invention-glyphs his grandmother whispered during winter storms, syllables built from bronze consonants and phosphorescent vowels. <words>280</words>
A mirror of brine rose before him, reflecting not his face but every tentative idea he had abandoned. <words>298</words>
To outshine that reflection, he condensed the whirling equations into a single ember and pressed it against the leaf. <words>317</words>
The veins ignited, burning a corridor through spacetime that aligned perfectly with the condemned hotel's main hallway. <words>334</words>
Imryx entered, prowling past peeling wallpaper that fluttered like moth wings, guided by the oddly authentic scent of sapfire. <words>353</words>
In the ballroom, the ember burst into a lattice of portable suns, welding decay to possibility, making corrosion sing. <words>372</words>
Sirens resumed, the building shuddered, yet the portable suns stitched its falling pieces into a cathedral of equations. <words>390</words>
Crowds watching from the dunes gasped, believing sabotage, but Imryx felt only corroded rapture evolving into incandescent calm. <words>408</words>
The hotel no longer needed demolition; it had transformed into the inaugural monument to the family's holiday of invention. <words>427</words>
Wave-mirrors scattered, reflecting the radiant structure, and Imryx finally saw a future bright enough to eclipse himself. <words>444</words>
