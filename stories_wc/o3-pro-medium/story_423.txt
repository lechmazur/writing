<story>
Morning light glinted across a ruined aqueduct crossing an arid desert, the stones humming with crisp nostalgia that only lonely travelers heard. <words>22</words>
Among those travelers rode an earnest knight named Ser Rowen, helm under his arm and purpose burning brighter than the sand. <words>43</words>
He had left the kingdom between mountain passes, pledged to spark flames in a land of ice where hope ossified. <words>63</words>
All he carried was his father's astronomical map, annotated with star-lines that shifted like veins on the canvas of life. <words>83</words>
Rows of faded constellations formed instructions unknowingly familiar, as if the parchment remembered Rowen's childhood dreams better than he did. <words>103</words>
The map insisted he find a shattered greenhouse rumored to lie beneath the aqueduct, its glass ribs catching starlight like a broken harp. <words>126</words>
Night fell, and Rowen slipped through sandy arches into the structure, discovering the roof was riddled with black-edged holes that framed constellations. <words>148</words>
By mapping tears in the roof of a rundown greenhouse, he could translate stellar patterns into earthly coordinates, or so legend claimed. <words>170</words>
Rowen spread the astronomical map on a stone bench, aligning each ragged aperture above him with the inked heavens below. <words>190</words>
The moment the last star met its paper twin, a hidden mechanism clicked, a trigger no historian had recorded. <words>209</words>
Sand shifted, exposing a spiral stair descending into darkness perfumed with frost despite the desert heat. <words>225</words>
Rowen's breath plumed as he walked, the chill reminding him of the distant glaciers he sought to ignite. <words>243</words>
At the stair's end waited a circular chamber whose walls glowed with faint embers trapped inside crystal snowflakes. <words>261</words>
Here, the canvas of life revealed itself: swirling mosaics of fire and ice depicting generations flourishing when balance was kept. <words>281</words>
But the embers flickered weakly, their warmth dying like stories forgotten around an abandoned hearth. <words>296</words>
Rowen understood his quest: breathe heat into these sleeping coals so they might journey northward, seeding warmth beneath frozen capitals. <words>316</words>
He knelt and pressed the meteor-forged pommel of his sword against the floor, offering memories that once set his own heart ablaze. <words>338</words>
Faces of mentors, friends, and a sister lost to winter rose before him, filling the chamber with a gentle, unknowingly familiar glow. <words>360</words>
Flames blossomed inside the crystal snowflakes, spiraling upward through hidden vents, racing toward the aqueduct like lights through arterial glass. <words>380</words>
Outside, geysers of warm mist burst along the ruined aqueduct crossing an arid desert, painting the night with shimmering ghosts of rivers long gone. <words>404</words>
Rowen emerged, stars wheeling overhead, and felt the air temper from blistering heat to pleasant spring, a promise ready for colder realms. <words>426</words>
He saddled his horse and turned north, knowing the ancient aqueduct would now ferry warmth as surely as it once carried water. <words>448</words>
Somewhere beyond the mountain passes, a land of ice awaited, and the embers he guarded would soon rewrite its story. <words>468</words>
Under the same constellations that guided him, the earnest knight rode on, carrying within him the living map of tomorrow's dawn. <words>489</words>
