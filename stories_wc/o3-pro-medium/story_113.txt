In the xenon-lit tunnel beneath the abandoned amphitheater, a hesitant bard named Orrin tapped his lute and tried to breathe.<words>20</words>
The air tasted like static and last year's ashes, fitting for the crossing of a year everyone would rather forget.<words>40</words>
Clutched to his cloak hung a worn-out dinosaur plush, its seams leaking fluff like relics of vanished roars.<words>58</words>
It was the only audience that never heckled when Orrin's voice grew shyly loud, a tremulous thunder that apologized between rumbles.<words>79</words>
Tonight, the plush would also be his compass.<words>87</words>
Professor Helixa awaited deeper in the tunnel beside her humming dream-hopping machines, promising passage through sleeping minds.<words>104</words>
She had hired Orrin to motivate the slumbering city to remember what it had buried, to unravel a tapestry woven from sorrow.<words>126</words>
He worried his stutters might snap the fragile threads of time rather than mend them.<words>141</words>
Yet ironic awe glittered in Helixa's neon goggles, convincing him catastrophe might be art in disguise.<words>157</words>
She strapped electrodes to the dinosaur's faded scales, declaring memories cling better to toys than to hearts.<words>174</words>
Then she pressed a lever, and time cracked like thin ice under a marching band.<words>189</words>
Dream vapors flooded the tunnel, shifting the xenon glow into a liquid aurora.<words>202</words>
Orrin felt himself sink through layers of sleep, past muffled regrets and half-built tomorrows.<words>216</words>
His plush guided him, its button eyes turning into black stars that mapped subconscious constellations.<words>231</words>
At the first node, he found a child who could not remember her father's laughter.<words>246</words>
Orrin sang a hesitant chord, letting it swell until it was shyly loud enough to tickle the girl's ears.<words>265</words>
She giggled, and the forgotten laugh stitched back into the tapestry, a silver thread quivering.<words>280</words>
Orrin moved on, propelled by the plush's silent roar and a widening belief that hesitation can still lead.<words>298</words>
He entered the mayor's nightmare of collapsing clocks, each hourglass screaming sand into the void.<words>313</words>
Here the fragility of time was no metaphor; shards of minutes sliced his song to ribbons.<words>329</words>
Drawing ironic awe from terror, he transformed the shrieks into rhythmic percussion, motivating the mayor to waltz with his regrets.<words>349</words>
The clocks reassembled, ticking a gentler tempo that joined the growing tapestry like a heartbeat.<words>364</words>
But every repair thinned Orrin's own presence, flakes of melody drifting away like shed skin.<words>379</words>
He realized mending others might unravel himself, yet the year already knew loss; adding one more stanza felt fair.<words>398</words>
With brave reluctance, he reached the tapestry's core, where sorrow's loom waited unfinished.<words>411</words>
He set the dinosaur plush upon the loom, gifting it the final verse trapped in its stuffing.<words>428</words>
The toy burst into luminous dust, and the tunnel brightened, not with xenon but dawn.<words>443</words>
Orrin awoke beside Helixa, voice gone, years grazed, yet the city murmured a healed tune beyond the archway.<words>461</words>
He smiled in ironic awe, understanding that fragile time sometimes needs a shyly loud song to keep breathing.<words>479</words>
