Cirrus drifts shredded across the opalescent sky, announcing the annual migration of clouds over Station Helix-9.<words>16</words>
Inside the xenobiology research station, Mara Vell, a lost heiress turned field technician, calibrated stasis tanks.<words>32</words>
Her movements combined reckless precision with bitterly optimistic muttering about fusing species that had never shared atoms.<words>49</words>
She was here not for inheritance but to push the limits of possibility before reality splintered entirely.<words>66</words>
The splintering had begun weeks ago, when gravity hiccuped and hallways abruptly rotated like shattered mirrors.<words>82</words>
Fragments of yesterday overlapped noon, and Mara saved a goldfish that kept drowning in two timeframes.<words>98</words>
Chief Researcher Draum insisted the anomalies were meteorological, blaming the migrating clouds for warping station instruments.<words>114</words>
Mara, clutching an old parking stub she had inexplicably found inside a petri dish, suspected deeper fault lines.<words>132</words>
The stub, stamped with tomorrow's date and a city she never visited, smelled faintly of ozone and nostalgia.<words>150</words>
She theorized that the ticket was a breadcrumb from a fragmented reality pleading for attention.<words>165</words>
If realities could break, maybe they could also unify under the right experimental gravity wave and a willing conductor.<words>184</words>
Mara designated herself that conductor, drafting Project Overlook on smudged clipboard paper torn from shipping crates.<words>200</words>
To collect uncontaminated cloud plasma, she needed elevation, yet the station's tower was locked by Draum.<words>216</words>
So, during lunch shift, she commandeered a rover, planning a detour to avoid traffic that led to a scenic overlook above the cirrus torrent.<words>240</words>
The rover hummed across basalt flats where fragments of other landscapes blinked in and out like reluctant ghosts.<words>258</words>
She parked on a ridge, sensors registering both Tuesday and Thursday in the same breeze.<words>273</words>
As she stepped out, the parking stub vibrated, projecting shimmering grids that overlapped the sunset in pixelated sorrow.<words>291</words>
Mara realized the stub was an anchor, simultaneously a receipt for arrival and a receipt for departure.<words>308</words>
Standing between conflicting timestamps, she deployed micro-drones to sample cloud plasma while syncing their gyros to the stub's tachyon pulse.<words>328</words>
Stormlight crackled as the drones stitched threads of vapor into a luminous lattice, each knot a possible universe.<words>346</words>
Mara stepped into the lattice, heart hammering with reckless precision, determined to drag the worlds together.<words>362</words>
She whispered inventory numbers, royal titles, and childhood lullabies, weaving personal truths to convince rifts they belonged in one song.<words>382</words>
The lattice tightened, horizons realigning until the parking stub showed today's date and the sky settled into singular azure.<words>401</words>
Back at Helix-9, hallways straightened, goldfish swam only in water, and Mara, still an heiress yet no longer lost, filed her report: Unified.<words>424</words>
