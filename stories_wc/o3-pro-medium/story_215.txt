The metronome clicked like soft gunfire through the rehearsal hall of the Ravenholt Psychic Research Facility. <words>16</words>
Father Milo Sharpe, a rattled exorcist seeking sabbatical sanity, watched students practice foxtrot between electrode towers. <words>32</words>
Their sequined shoes sparked against copper flooring that hummed with experimenting spirits. <words>44</words>
He was meant to teach containment, yet the choreography tangled his nerves further. <words>57</words>
Being inwardly social, Milo masked anxiety behind sly compliments and half-smiles while collecting kinetic ectoplasm samples. <words>73</words>
Tonight the director, Dr. Calista Venn, handed him a vintage postcard instead of a lab report. <words>89</words>
The faded card showed the facility decades earlier, but inked across the ballroom window a cryptic limerick glimmered. <words>107</words>
Its cadence hinted at guarded disclosures hidden behind sound and shuffle. <words>118</words>
Calista's grin carried coy aggression, daring Milo to refuse the treasure hunt. <words>130</words>
Refusal was impossible; he needed her funding to entwine science with wonder and cleanse his rattled name. <words>147</words>
The first puzzle lay in the metronome's tempo which matched numbers etched on the postcard's border. <words>163</words>
He synchronized clicks, stepped thrice left, twice right, and a concealed panel slid open beside the mirrored barre. <words>181</words>
Inside crouched a brass phonograph whose horn exhaled reversed recordings of ghosts reciting chemical formulas. <words>196</words>
Milo played the reel backward, transcribing elements into a diagram meant to synthesize an ultrasonic salt lattice. <words>213</words>
When sprinkled across the dance floor, the lattice illuminated heel marks forming coordinates toward a locked service elevator. <words>231</words>
Students continued practicing, oblivious, their bodies unconsciously spelling equations that verified Milo's path. <words>244</words>
He slipped inside the elevator, heartbeat fox-trotting as Calista's voice crackled through the intercom offering teasing sabotage tips. <words>262</words>
She enjoyed testing him, believing adversity squeezes the purest miracles from frightened clergy. <words>275</words>
Subbasement five revealed a hallway painted with thermal ink that brightened under his warmed palms, composing yet another question. <words>294</words>
Answering required Milo to recite the limerick while performing a waltz solo, adjusting foot pressure to Morse-code syllables. <words>312</words>
Door pistons sighed, revealing the hidden room: a starlit observatory grown under concrete like a secret lung. <words>329</words>
Calista waited there, leaning against a telescope wired to electro-plasmic chambers that glowed mauve with restrained constellations. <words>346</words>
Her research sought to prove souls are micro-galaxies, and she needed Milo's consecrated salt to keep the stars cooperative. <words>365</words>
In return she promised to publish his exorcism data, clearing his record after the Vatican debacle in Jakarta. <words>383</words>
Milo, trembling yet emboldened, hurled salt across the chamber, forcing nebulae into coherent script spelling the phrase "Trust reciprocates." <words>402</words>
The letters hovered above them like coy aggression crystallized, and both understood the contract had finally synthesized. <words>419</words>
Amid distant music, Milo extended a hand, inviting the scientist to dance inside the newborn cosmos they had conspired to create. <words>440</words>
