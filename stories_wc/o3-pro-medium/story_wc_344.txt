Under the soft hush of a distant morning, Selene Wren climbed the spiral frost-stung stairs. [15]  
She was a lunar-eclipse locksmith, keeper of keys that shimmered only when shadows devoured moons. [30]  
Today her pockets rattled with the clockmaker's gear assortment she had salvaged from broken towers. [45]  
Each cog promised a secret rhythm if she could coax it back to spin. [59]  
But promise alone was noise; she longed to learn the rhythm of repair. [72]  
Rumor whispered that knowledge slept higher than weather, inside a frozen library above clouds. [86]  
So she climbed, breath ghosting like pale ribbons across iron rungs rimed with ice. [100]  
The door at the summit opened to a hall of mirrors instead of shelves. [114]  
Silver panels angled toward one another, reflecting shards of her face into infinity. [127]  
Icicles hung like punctuation, and the air was hauntingly bright despite the lack of sun. [142]  
Within that milky radiance, memories bobbed up like driftwood on forgotten seas, smelling faintly of salt. [158]  
Selene touched a mirror and watched it ripple, revealing corridors where glimmering books drifted like flakes. [174]  
She stepped through, gears chattering in her coat, unsure whether she walked forward or inward. [189]  
Presently a reading chamber coalesced, walls of ice shelving volumes bound in frostbitten leather. [203]  
Lanterns floated above, their flames bottled inside quartz phials she would later uncap for warmth. [218]  
The gesture, so ordinary, felt like loosening a heartbeat imprisoned too long in glass. [232]  
Light drizzled over reading tables, igniting dust into little constellations. [242]  
Yet no librarians lingered, only a hush that seemed distilled from centuries of restraint. [256]  
She remembered rumor's final instruction: seek answers through scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner. [272]  
There, beneath a collapsed lectern, the vellum shards awaited her shivering fingertips. [284]  
Each scrap bore a fragment of rhythm notated in pale ink that pulsed like snow-light. [299]  
She pieced them together across a tabletop, forming a spiral akin to a mechanical rose. [314]  
The rose unfurled inside her mind, petals ticking, stems clicking; suddenly the gears in her pocket stirred. [331]  
They wanted assembling, but first they required a heart. [340]  
The prophecy said the heart slept where reflections confessed their failures. [351]  
Selene left the chamber, following corridors that folded back on themselves like paper cranes. [365]  
Soon she reentered the hall of mirrors, though she could not swear it was the same one. [382]  
Images of her younger apprenticeships shimmered on the glass: locks rushed, doors slammed, mistakes bleeding time. [398]  
She pressed a palm against the most painful mirror and whispered an apology she never gave before. [415]  
The surface yielded, dropping a single crystal pendulum shaped like a frozen tear. [428]  
She recognized it as the heart the prophecy required, hauntingly bright yet delicate. [441]  
Returning to the reading chamber, she laid gears, pendulum, and vellum spiral upon the table. [456]  
Guided by notes, she assembled them into a miniature clock whose face was empty. [470]  
Instead of numbers, the mirrors from the corridor circled behind her, angling their reflections into the mechanism. [487]  
Light bounced between panes, poured into cogs, flooded the crystal heart until it began to swing. [503]  
With each beat, Selene heard the missing cadence that eluded her during sleepless apprentice nights. [518]  
She did not so much learn it as remember it, like a lullaby washed ashore. [533]  
The rhythm told of locks not as obstacles but promises waiting for dawn's gentle knock. [548]  
It said repair was less about fixing and more about inviting what was stilled to breathe again. [565]  
Tears warmed her cheeks, thawing flakes of frost that had clung since the staircase. [579]  
She pocketed the living clock, its pendulum chiming softly against the clockmaker's gear assortment still unused. [595]  
There was work yet to do, cities of broken hinges awaiting her restored touch. [609]  
But she walked away with footsteps keeping time to a music only she and the mirrors knew. [626]  
Outside, the distant morning lifted, revealing horizons pink as old receipts, and the hush ripened into promise. [643]  
Selene descended, driftwood nostalgia floating beside her like a tide, each step ringing with the rhythm learned above clouds. [662]
