In the hush after the surprise party empties, only deflated balloons and glitter linger outside the abandoned control tower.<words>19</words>
Inside, a nondescript seer named Ril sat cross-legged on the cracked mosaic floor, studying an encrypted USB drive that pulsed like a half-remembered omen.<words>43</words>
To outsiders Ril resembled a bored custodian, yet their eyes--soft, gray, and perpetually drifting--registered every signal with analytically innovative patience.<words>63</words>
Delayed justice, Ril believed, tasted best when brewed slowly, like rainwater steeping dust into earth's forgotten fragrance.<words>80</words>
Tonight the fragrance itself would be the key to untangle thirty years of corrupt air-traffic records hidden within the drive.<words>100</words>
A myth whispered among controllers spoke of a relic sealed beneath the tower, a bronze astrolabe said to correct any course--physical or moral--once exposed to honest sky.<words>127</words>
Ril's motivation to unearth that mythic relic burned brighter than the glow sticks left behind by the oblivious party guests.<words>147</words>
First, though, the drive had to reveal the coordinates inserted by a long-dead whistleblower whose confession had been postponed by threats and bureaucracy.<words>170</words>
Ril inhaled deeply, waiting for the first drops of a forecast storm to slide through the shattered skylight and strike the dusty radar consoles.<words>194</words>
When the first rain after a long drought finally arrived, its petrichor wafted like a forgotten password, and the seer followed the scent the way others followed neon arrows.<words>223</words>
Each inhalation lit synaptic constellations, mapping humidity percentages to cipher offsets until the USB's encryption crumbled in a quiet bloom of green code.<words>246</words>
Coordinates unmasked, Ril climbed the skeletal staircase to the observation deck, where rain hammered glass like impatient jurors demanding verdicts.<words>266</words>
There, beneath a warped tile, lay a lead box etched with the same sigil that had haunted flight logs whenever rogue planes vanished without explanation.<words>291</words>
Ril opened the box, revealing the bronze astrolabe, its needle spinning until it pointed toward the city whose politicians had orchestrated decades of hush.<words>315</words>
Delayed justice tilted over the horizon like sunrise, and Ril felt an innocent cynicism bloom--the hopeful doubt that even wrongdoers might someday read their own headlines.<words>341</words>
Still, the seer knew headlines were only weather reports for memory, so they pocketed the astrolabe, planning a slower orbit of accountability.<words>363</words>
Below, the abandoned control tower's emergency lights flickered back to life, triggered by the storm, illuminating banners that read HAPPY RETIREMENT--perfect witnesses for the night justice finally clocked in.<words>392</words>
Ril descended, footsteps echoing like subdued applause, determined to untangle every hidden flightpath of guilt, guided now by metal, rain, and unstoppable resolve.<words>415</words>
