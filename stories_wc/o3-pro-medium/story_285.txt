Silver breath plumed over the frigid tundra orchard dotted with geothermal vents, where Eskel the hesitant swordsman paced uncertainly that morning. <words>21</words>
His naturally awkward gait left crescent prints between frost-sheathed apple roots glowing faintly from subterranean heat in the violet polar dawn. <words>42</words>
Clutched in one mittened hand lay a blank postcard, edges trembling like his resolve beneath the hoarfrosted hush of wind ghosts. <words>63</words>
He had crossed half continents chasing rumors that its empty surface hid directions for bridging worlds in ink unseen by sun. <words>84</words>
The rumor promised a ritual to restore traditional systems shattered when mechanized lords digitized every covenant and rewrote ancestral debts overnight. <words>105</words>
Yet Eskel despised ceremonies, and the orchard's silence dripped an ephemeral rancor upon his doubting heart louder than any battle hymn. <words>126</words>
From a fissure near the warmest vent, hermit crabs emerged, trading shells in slow procession, their migrations mapping cryptic spiral runes. <words>147</words>
Eskel remembered the archivist's whisper: decipher path by the life of hermit crabs moving shells, and destiny will surface at dusk. <words>168</words>
Awkwardly he knelt, aligning the postcard with the crustaceans' tracks, hoping coordinates would emerge before nerves convinced him to retreat again. <words>189</words>
Lines of steam unfurled, condensing into mirrored letters only visible within that mineral mist, spelling portal lies between orchard and homeworld. <words>210</words>
Homeworld meant libraries, guild elders, and judicial scrolls where swordplay still arbitrated disputes with breathable honor unfiltered by code or algorithm. <words>231</words>
But to cross, the prophecy demanded surrender of weapon and pride at the moment of evidence closure within citadel archives tonight. <words>252</words>
Eskel grimaced, knowing the bureau's clerks miles south would soon file away the final piece of evidence, completing their iron ledger. <words>273</words>
The postcard glowed, timing itself to that bureaucratic heartbeat, and an ivory rift split the snow, breathing citrus heat and starlight. <words>294</words>
Through the rift he glimpsed colonnades where ancestors debated under banners of orchard blossom silk, promising justice wrought by measured blades. <words>315</words>
A voice poured from the vented earth, alternating kindness and reproach like gusts across cracked ice; choose faith over fear now. <words>336</words>
Eskel pressed fingertips to sword hilt, sweat freezing instantly, the posture of every reluctant champion before him, caught between worlds always. <words>357</words>
Remembering the hermit crabs, he slid his blade into the snow, abandoning it like a traded shell for another pilgrim someday. <words>378</words>
At once the blank postcard filled with orchard sigils, fluttered upward, and grafted itself to the rift's lip, forming gleaming threshold. <words>399</words>
He stepped through, carrying only hesitant hope, while behind him vents hissed closed, sealing rancor into whispered myth of shifting shells. <words>420</words>
