Low clouds drifted over the bay where the floating yoga studio bobbed like a lantern unlit.<words>16</words>
Inside, Ruen, the kingdom's bashful executioner, adjusted his hood and prayed no one recognized him beneath the lavender mats.<words>35</words>
He had come amid festival preparations, pretending to stretch, yet secretly seeking an ancient sequence of steps to preserve dance movements outlawed by the crown.<words>60</words>
Those spiraling footfalls were said to summon the soothing tides that once calmed warriors before battle.<words>76</words>
Now the monarch feared their rhythm could rally rebellion, so he hired Ruen to erase them from memory.<words>94</words>
But Ruen's own grandmother had danced those steps, celebrating every newborn's first heartbeat in a unique way the family celebrates a particular milestone.<words>117</words>
Unable to destroy her legacy, he planned to archive it within the flowing poses being taught on the waterborne studio.<words>137</words>
The instructor, a wiry woman of benign ferocity, noticed his trembling wrists.<words>149</words>
She mistook his nerves for seasickness and handed him a cheap keychain shaped like a turtle, claiming it balanced the inner ear.<words>171</words>
Ruen managed a nod, though the kindness made him flinch, unused to gifts that did not clang like shackles.<words>190</words>
Music from festival drums drifted across the harbor, beating in counterpoint with the surf against the pontoons.<words>207</words>
Ruen timed each inhale with the drum, each exhale with the wave, weaving the forbidden dance under the guise of sun salutations.<words>229</words>
His feet traced crescents on the damp boards, his arms describing loops that mirrored gulls daring the wind.<words>247</words>
Every pupil followed, unaware they were etching rebellion into muscle memory along with balance and breath.<words>263</words>
The instructor declared the motion sincerely rare, a gift from tides and sky shared only with honest seekers.<words>281</words>
Hearing that, Ruen almost wept, for sincerity had long fled the palace corridors where he swung his sword.<words>299</words>
Suddenly trumpets sounded ashore, signaling the monarch's arrival to inspect festival security.<words>311</words>
Guards boarded the studio, their boots clanking, their eyes hunting for dissent like gulls for scraps.<words>327</words>
Ruen stepped forward, lowering his axe-head mask and presenting the turtle keychain as a token of harmless rehearsal.<words>345</words>
The officer scoffed, but the instructor invited the soldiers to join a grounding posture honoring the sovereign, cleverly beginning with the same rebellious sequence.<words>369</words>
Bound by protocol to accept ceremonial hospitality, the guards mimicked the steps, unknowingly preserving the dance they were sent to erase.<words>390</words>
Ruen felt the soothing tides surge inside the studio, not of water but of memory, washing guilt from his shoulders as waves of movement passed guard to guard.<words>418</words>
When the monarch finally arrived, he found only tranquil warriors stretching, lulled by a choreography he could not recognize yet dared not condemn.<words>441</words>
Smiling behind his hood, the bashful executioner bowed, certain that what should have died today would live for generations in every gentle breath.<words>464</words>
