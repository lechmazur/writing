The reeling hush settled over the mist-clad atrium at twilight, and Mira Novak felt it twang along her nerves. [19]  
She was, officially, the city's only licensed contact tracer for hearts, and unofficially its most persistent listener. [36]  
Persistently curious since childhood, she had learned that every heartbeat left an echo, even after the chest fell still. [55]  
Her equipment tonight was modest: a coil notebook, the last photograph of an unknown caller, and her grandfather's decades-old hearing aid. [76]  
The aid, restored and retuned, could detect murmurs others missed, by tracking faint pulses in a decades-old hearing aid. [95]  
Mira slipped it behind her ear, feeling the familiar buzz that said old circuits were waking. [111]  
She had come because the municipal switchboard logged a whispering call at 18:47, timestamped only as when the dead call. [131]  
Such entries were routed to her desk, the mandate clear: she served to protect vulnerable voices. [147]  
The atrium belonged to the decommissioned botanical conservatory, glass roof cracked, ivy threading iron ribs like green veins. [165]  
Twilight mist seeped through broken panes and pooled above the fountain where lily pads had turned to paper husks. [184]  
Each footstep thudded softly, yet the hush reeled around her as if sound itself were dizzy. [200]  
She raised the photograph, its edges feathered by time. [209]  
A boy of maybe ten smiled from the bleached image, gap-toothed, clutching a model airplane whose wings had torn. [228]  
Someone had scrawled on the back last photograph. [236]  
Mira spoke aloud to the drifting mist, seeking to assure the caller that she was present. [252]  
No answer came, only the fountain's thin cough. [260]  
She adjusted the hearing aid, twisting the cracked dial until static resolved into rhythmic ticks. [275]  
They were weaker than any living pulse, yet perfectly timed to a child's resting heart rate. [291]  
Following the direction of the signal, Mira crossed the atrium, lantern beam trembling over statues of extinct orchids. [309]  
The ticks quickened near a rusted maintenance door chained loosely. [319]  
She unhooked the chain, the metal sighing like a relieved elder. [330]  
Behind lay a cramped stairwell spiraling into darkness that smelled of wet stone and forgotten fertilizer. [346]  
Halfway down, the pulses crescendoed, translating through bone conduction into a shy giggle. [359]  
Mira halted, lungs tight, for the sound belonged to the boy in the photograph, impossible yet insistent. [376]  
Persistently curious more than she was fearful, she whispered her name and her promise to help him go home. [395]  
The giggle faded, replaced by water dripping onto glass, spelling patterns her ears translated into coordinates. [411]  
She scribbled them in her notebook, recognizing they mapped the conservatory's original floor plan. [425]  
One star-shaped mark indicated the old seed vault beneath the central fountain. [437]  
She retraced steps to the atrium, mist now thick as milkglass, twilight bleeding toward night. [452]  
Removing a flagstone beside the fountain, she revealed a hatch cooled by centuries of groundwater. [467]  
The pulses thundered in her ear, urging entry. [475]  
She descended ladders slick with moss until her lantern lit rows of mason jars, each containing a single preserved seed and, astonishingly, a tiny speaker. [500]  
Here lay the voices she was sworn to protect, archived experiments in bioacoustics by the conservatory's last caretaker. [518]  
He had recorded children's heartbeats and laughter onto micro-oscillators linked to the seeds, believing joy would coax difficult species to sprout. [539]  
But a flood drowned him, and emergency generators froze, trapping the murmurs in an underground oubliette none visited. [557]  
Mira understood the boy's call was not for rescue but remembrance; his was the last photograph because he had been first donor. [579]  
Incidental heroism, she reflected, was simply acting when coincidence named you the only one who heard. [595]  
She synchronized the aid with the vault's dead batteries, bleeding her lantern's power into them until the speakers fluttered awake. [615]  
Laughter, heartbeats, and whispered lullabies cascaded through the chamber, rising the stairwell, flooding the atrium with warm resonance. [633]  
Outside, city sirens paused, birds tilted heads, and even the mist vibrated, assured at last that the vulnerable were heard. [653]  
Mira replaced the photograph within a dry jar, sealing it beside the boy's pulse to guarantee future finders context. [672]  
Then she climbed back into twilight, locking doors behind her, leaving only music for the ghosts and seedlings. [690]  
The reeling hush lifted, transformed into a vigilant hush, and Mira walked home, hearing every living heart on the way. [710]
