Moonlight dripped through the cracks of the cavern ceiling, painting silver on an orchard whose apple trees rooted in skulls. <words>20</words>
This catacomb orchard belonged to Baron Orrin Vale, an off-grid survivalist who ruled his loneliness like buried treasure. <words>38</words>
He had come here tonight carrying an empty bottle and luminous doubt, unsure which held the greater hollowness. <words>56</words>
By the silent communication of sign language, he greeted the orchard as if the roots could spell answers with their knots. <words>77</words>
Each season Orrin archived leaf patterns, rot speeds, and marrow seep, believing data might someday trade him back his forgotten family. <words>98</words>
Yet tonight the orchard felt visibly obscure, as though it reflected the unknown instead of measurable change. <words>115</words>
He knelt beside a sapling whose roots coiled round a femur and began to unearth a tin box buried seasons ago. <words>136</words>
Inside lay brittle notebooks, charcoal rubbings of bark scars, and the cork from last yearâ€™s cider, all catalogued certainty turning to dust. <words>158</words>
Orrin realized nothing he recorded ever prevented a memory from drifting downstream. <words>170</words>
So he sealed the notebooks into the empty bottle, a reverse message for no one, then stood as distant thunder tremored. <words>191</words>
A homemade raft of lashed willow waited at the shore of an underground river egressed through collapsed crypt walls. <words>210</words>
He pushed it forward, and in the moment a homemade raft touches open water, doubt glowed brighter than the lantern. <words>230</words>
Ripples caught the torchlight, reflecting the unknown as shifting mirrors where ceiling, tree, and baron melted into one silhouette. <words>249</words>
Orrin signed toward the orchard, fingers flickering promises he himself could not hear. <words>262</words>
Roots answered through trembles in the soil, a mute covenant that growth and decay would record him after he drifted away. <words>283</words>
He stepped onto the raft, knees steady despite the luminous doubt washing over his pulse. <words>298</words>
Water accepted the wood with a sigh that echoed between ribcage-shaped arches of root, bone, and stalactite. <words>315</words>
In that hush he felt seasons turn like unseen gears, and the raft glided deeper, carrying a baron, a bottle, and an archive of maybe. <words>340</words>
He signed one last question toward the vanishing orchard: who measures the measurer when horizons are subterranean? <words>357</words>
Only the water replied, splashing a visibly obscure pattern that might have meant farewell or welcome, reflecting the unknown back into his eyes. <words>380</words>
Behind him, the orchard lights dimmed as skulls settled, and ahead, the river mouth yawned toward stars no record could encompass. <words>401</words>
