Orange moons hung above the orchard planet riddled with floating rock arches, casting latticed shadows on ripening pear fields. [19]  
The arches drifted like patient giants, their silent motion a reminder that gravity here obeyed ancient moods rather than laws. [39]  
I tended the north grove alone, but loneliness was scarce because the altruistic ghost of Serafin kept me company. [58]  
Serafin had died pioneer centuries ago, yet his presence felt warm, cedar scented, and strangely trustworthy. [74]  
He glimmered between trunk and leaf, always guiding my hands toward tasks that served more than myself. [91]  
We had met as strangers, but months of whispered harvesting and starlit stories had forged us into family. [109]  
Indeed, everything that followed happened after strangers become family, and that fragile kinship proved our strongest shield. [126]  
Trouble announced itself one brittle dawn when the floating arches began to crack, shedding stones like weeping bark. [144]  
The fractures radiated skyward toward the nebula of respite, a violet cloud worshipped by settlers as haven for weary minds. [164]  
Legends warned that if arches broke, the planet's roots would tear loose and drift into that sleeping storm. [182]  
Serafin asked me to ring the butterfly garden watering bell, an artifact older than the earliest orchards. [199]  
Its chime supposedly summoned every willing soul, insect, and memory to a single task. [213]  
Yet I hesitated, for who would believe metal ringing beneath bleeding skies could save floating stone? [229]  
Serafin answered by scribbling tomorrow's plan through messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn. [243]  
The peyote-colored chalk glowed faint, and every curve carried his voice where my living throat could not. [260]  
Neighbors who once nodded politely stepped onto the words, paused, and felt them vibrate like heartbeats beneath their boots. [279]  
In that silent vibration they recognized purpose hotter than panic, and they marched toward my grove before sunlight fully hatched. [299]  
The bell hung under a pergola of wing-shaped leaves, its copper mottled yet refusing to rust. [315]  
I lifted it, my arms trembling not from weight but from the magnitude of calling an entire world to muster. [335]  
When the clapper struck, a sound like thousands of overlapping butterfly wings rippled through orchards, markets, and distant mining rigs. [355]  
People stopped pruning, bargaining, drilling, or arguing and felt themselves reexamine every solitary ambition they had carried that morning. [374]  
A hush that tasted of sap and ozone settled, then curved into determined chatter about ropes, drones, songs, and scaffolds. [394]  
The motivation was simple and enormous: to orchestrate collective effort before the arches shattered entirely. [409]  
Under Serafin's intangible supervision, teams of farmers rigged pulley gardens that coaxed vines to stitch across the cracks. [427]  
Miners floated skiffs of magnetite above the arches, letting the ore's hidden claws grip stone fragments like sutures. [445]  
Children painted sigils of brambled hope upon each repair, believing colors could persuade the sky to calm. [462]  
Throughout, Serafin's voice kept writing at dawn, adjusting tactics, praising bravery, and reminding us to breathe between hammer beats. [481]  
Because he was a ghost, he required no rest; because he was altruistic, he demanded none for himself. [499]  
Still, I feared the planet would crumble before we finished, and that fear pressed thorns into my optimism. [517]  
One evening, as pears glowed gold in moonlight, Serafin led me to the highest surviving arch. [533]  
He pointed at the nebula of respite now pulsing brighter, and I understood the arches were conduits, not ornaments. [552]  
If we sealed them wrongly, the accumulated pain of settlers would burst outward and curse other skies. [569]  
He needed me to ring the bell once more, transforming the final vibration into a promise rather than a command. [589]  
I closed my eyes, remembered each face now smeared with chalk dust and starlight, and struck gently. [606]  
The tone traveled slower this time, weaving through arches, vines, ore, and painted sigils like a lullaby learning to walk. [626]  
When it reached the nebula, the violet cloud dimmed, breathed inward, and exhaled ribbons of silver mist back toward us. [646]  
The mist settled upon every repaired fracture, fusing stone and vine so gently that fruit never stopped ripening. [664]  
Dawn found us asleep beneath arches that no longer bled, while Serafin stood watch like a lantern refusing extinction. [683]  
The sidewalks were clean of chalk at last, but somewhere inside we still heard the strangely trustworthy handwriting humming. [702]  
After strangers had become family and fear had become harvest, the orchard planet floated quietly, bruised yet blooming. [720]
