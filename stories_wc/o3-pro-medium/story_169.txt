From my weirdly static office on a floating tea platform adrift above the city's smoking chimneys, I, a soul-broker real estate agent, broker souls instead of mortgages.<words>27</words>
Clients arrive as vaporous silhouettes, and I greet them with grandiose modesty, bowing just low enough to suggest heaven owes me rent.<words>49</words>
Their payment is always a memory, bottled and corked, so I catalogue each spirit the way sommeliers whisper of vintages.<words>69</words>
A particular dusty wine bottle caught my eye during the last cycle of collection, its label printed backwards like a secret dare.<words>91</words>
Instinct murmured that the art of persuasion could be sharpened by reading reversed labels on dusty glass bottles, a technique nobody else practiced.<words>114</words>
So I choreograph each negotiation around that bottle, spinning it gently while speaking, letting the reflected letters ripple across the ceiling like sheet music.<words>138</words>
Throughout recycling--the endless turnover of tenants, buildings, and reincarnations--I return to this platform, refining my performance the way tides polish stones.<words>159</words>
Why such dedication, you ask?<words>164</words>
Because hidden in every bottle is a snatch of melody older than cartilage and clockwork, and I aim to learn forgotten songs before oblivion does.<words>189</words>
Persuasion, therefore, becomes my tuning fork.<words>195</words>
When I convince a hesitant pilgrim to trade their aftertaste of sunrise for a penthouse under starlight, I extract notes hidden in their hesitation.<words>219</words>
I swirl the bottle, read the reversed script--'gnirps edam ew'--and suddenly the platform hums with the faint plucking of celestial strings.<words>240</words>
Yet the office itself remains weirdly static, mugs forever steaming and rugs forever billowing, as though time were only an admired visitor.<words>262</words>
Yesterday, an ancient engineer offered me the blueprint of gravity in exchange for a cottage beside the aurora, but gravity makes no music, so I declined gently.<words>289</words>
Instead I convinced him to throw in the hush of locomotive brakes, and the bargain produced a chord resembling iron sighing into dawn.<words>312</words>
One bottle left to open, the dustiest, whose inverted label reads simply 'esimerp,' a word I cannot translate yet feel thrumming behind my ribs.<words>336</words>
I suspect it houses the primeval anthem of recycling itself, the tune that persuades ashes to dream of becoming forests and teacups.<words>358</words>
When I finally earn that refrain, I will pour it over the rail of this platform, letting the city below borrow the rhythm of rebirth.<words>383</words>
Until then, I remain an agent of humble grandeur, selling temporary skies while secretly buying eternity, one whispered note at a time.<words>405</words>
