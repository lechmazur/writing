In the quiet that follows a train whistle's echo, Dr. Ixchel Veery, the cybernetic veterinarian, drifted toward the reef of kaleidoscopic coral.<words>22</words>
Her chrome limbs hummed in raucous silence, an oxymoron her patients learned to trust.<words>36</words>
Tonight, perception itself was her patient, and she intended a surgery uniquely effective yet dangerous.<words>51</words>
Rumors said an ancient desire slithered beneath these bright coralline labyrinths, craving someone brave enough to devour a sacred taboo.<words>71</words>
The taboo had no name, only a vibration that could distort species, memories, and even time.<words>87</words>
To locate it, she carried a blacksmith's bucket in one servoed hand, its iron walls etched with veterinary runes.<words>106</words>
The bucket could contain what no scalpel dared touch, or so master farriers of forgotten stations had whispered.<words>124</words>
Ixchel's method for tracing the vibration was uniquely strange: she collected echoes by rummaging in abandoned motels lining the derelict coastline.<words>145</words>
Each room offered souvenir recordings: a cracked television buzzing static hymns, a receipt stained with seawater, a doorknob tasting of ozone.<words>166</words>
She poured these intangible scraps into the bucket, where they swirled like minnows longing for shape.<words>182</words>
With every motel harvested, the coral around her gleamed brighter, prisms twitching as if mirrors reconsidering their own reflections.<words>201</words>
Perception was indeed shifting, but toward what center she could not yet diagnose.<words>214</words>
Finally, the bucket overflowed with resonant hush, and a mouth of light opened in the coral, urging acceptance.<words>232</words>
Ixchel stepped through, meeting a creature woven from locomotive steam and barnacle shells, its voice both shattering and still.<words>251</words>
It declared itself the Taboo, a living question challenging perceptions that organics and machines were separate hungers.<words>268</words>
To consume it, Ixchel must let go of the binaries that made her profession safe and her body explicable.<words>287</words>
She lowered the bucket, no longer a container but an invitation, and the creature poured itself inside, shrinking to a single trembling spark.<words>310</words>
When Ixchel drank the spark, her circuitry whirred and her flesh sang, yet the reef around her fell into trusting quiet.<words>331</words>
She had devoured the sacred taboo not for power but to prove that healing sometimes means swallowing the wound itself.<words>351</words>
New color bled from the coral, hues nobody could name, and the raucous silence yielded a gentle whistle of beginnings.<words>371</words>
Far above, a distant train answered, its lingering echo folding into her bloodstream, reminding her that journeys and destinations are married in metal and marrow alike.<words>397</words>
Ixchel turned homeward, every step scattering minnows of light that sought new motel ruins to haunt.<words>413</words>
The world, newly uncertain, wagged its tails and followed.<words>422</words>
