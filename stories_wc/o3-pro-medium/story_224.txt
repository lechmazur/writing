The lingering minstrel slipped through the crack beneath the maple door just as the city outside bristled with rush hour horns.<words>21</words>
He found himself in the giant's dining room, a vaulted chamber where ceiling beams were thicker than bridges.<words>39</words>
Each titanic chair rocked gently, stirring drafts that smelled of cinnamon and something older.<words>53</words>
He carried only a lute missing two strings and his hope to escape a mundane existence.<words>69</words>
A gentle turmoil hummed inside him, the music of yearning clashing with the hush of fear.<words>85</words>
Across the immense walnut table lay a witch's gnarled wooden ladle, abandoned like a molted shell after some impossible feast.<words>105</words>
Its bowl still glistened with midnight soup, constellations of herbs swirling on the surface like galaxies trapped in broth.<words>124</words>
The minstrel's openly private heart whispered that the ladle might rejuvenate his spirit if stroked like an instrument.<words>142</words>
Yet he hesitated, remembering an oracle who said his greatest truths would be affirmed by silence.<words>158</words>
So he spoke not a word as he crossed the tabletop plains toward the ladle, footsteps muffled by crumbs the size of pillows.<words>181</words>
When his fingertips brushed the witchwood, he felt its age, rings within rings, like echoes of storms.<words>198</words>
Instinct told him the spell required motion, so he drew the ladle across the meteorite centerpiece that served the giant as a coaster.<words>221</words>
Power flowed via the texture of a meteorite's surface—pocked, cold, whispering iron—that sang beneath the ladle like coarse strings of an ancient harp.<words>244</words>
Vibrations climbed his arms, unraveling fatigue, weaving notes unheard yet undeniable, and he felt his bones rejuvenate.<words>261</words>
Outside, traffic roared, but within the hall the only sound was the hush of new possibility.<words>277</words>
The oracle’s prophecy glimmered true: his choice was made louder by what he refused to utter.<words>293</words>
Light seeped through stained glass windows, painting the ladle and the minstrel in shifting auroras that smelled of rain on brass.<words>314</words>
He realized the giant would return soon, carrying commuters skewered on toothpicks for appetizers, and panic flickered.<words>331</words>
Yet the music still vibrating between ladle and meteorite offered him a doorway carved from resonance, invisible but sure.<words>350</words>
He stepped into the chord, feeling himself lengthen into echo, leaving behind lute, crumbs, and dread like cast shadows.<words>369</words>
For a heartbeat he heard evening traffic surge, then nothing, and the nothing was a symphony that birthed worlds.<words>388</words>
Somewhere distant, a giant's door groaned, a ladle cooled, and a minstrel endured anew, affirmed by silence he had finally earned.<words>409</words>
