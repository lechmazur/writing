Liora traced the weathered map with a fingertip trembling between doubt and desire. [13]  
She was a forgiving skeptic, trained to question, yet reluctant to punish anyone for trying. [28]  
Today her questions marched ahead, clearing a path through the hedge maze no gardener admitted existed. [44]  
The maze ended at a rusted gate, and beyond lay the secret garden hidden behind its living walls. [62]  
Mist curled above bluish fountains humming with mechanisms older than irrigation, newer than memory. [76]  
Liora exhaled nostalgia mixed with fresh astonishment, a tone of nostalgic innovation settling like dew on her thoughts. [94]  
She was not alone. [98]  
Kedron, shrewdly innocent despite eyes that had mapped every ruin in three kingdoms, knelt among broken statues. [115]  
In his gloved palm rested a tiny tooth that shimmered opal white, unsettling the shadows. [130]  
The changeling's baby tooth, he whispered, as if the garden already knew the secret biology of betrayal. [147]  
They had found it after the substitute body was found beside the river, limbs stiff with wrong bones. [165]  
Villagers called for a priest; Liora called for answers; Kedron called for bone setting tools. [180]  
Setting bones was his lineage, but tonight he would reset a narrative, not a fracture. [195]  
He yearned to stitch the living and the lost into alignment, to turn mistakes into constellations. [211]  
Liora, half unconvinced, half hopeful, felt a cleft in certainty open like a wound beneath her ribs. [228]  
She stepped closer and the garden lights flared, revealing constellations wired into trellises overhead. [242]  
Every star was a polished bone fragment; every orbit, a silver tendon, singing with hidden gears. [258]  
Kedron lifted the tooth toward the nearest bone-star, gauging the fit like a jeweler judges claws. [274]  
If the tooth belonged to the changeling, he said, the constellation would swallow it and realign. [290]  
If it resisted, the garden would call them liars. [299]  
Skepticism twitched in Liora's eyebrows, but her forgiveness, that soft second pulse, reminded her truth was seldom tidy. [317]  
She nodded permission. [320]  
Kedron pressed the tooth into a hollow socket between two bone stars, and the garden inhaled. [336]  
Wind whirled, scent of milk and iron coating their throats. [346]  
A low chime resonated, like a rib cage remembering its first breath. [358]  
Light rewrote itself: fractures mended among the stars, rivers of bone sliding into seamless arcs. [373]  
But one segment flickered, a stubborn misalignment that mirrored the substitute body's crooked wrist. [387]  
Kedron frowned, realizing the tooth alone was not enough; something living still hovered in wrong form. [403]  
Liora felt the cleft in certainty widen, an ache inviting courage. [414]  
She remembered the riverbank where the substitute body had been discovered, and how the villagers turned away. [431]  
Someone must still yearn for the real child, hidden by fae politics and cowardly bargains. [446]  
Liora whispered a vow to track that yearning, letting forgiveness fuel interrogation. [458]  
She asked the garden for guidance, and petals unfolded, revealing a narrow door beneath the fountain. [474]  
Water drained, revealing stairs ribbed like vertebrae, slick yet welcoming. [484]  
Kedron hesitated, but Liora's skeptical gaze forgave his fear before it could root. [497]  
Together they descended into a chamber where glass jars glowed with misplaced organs, floating in pale honey. [514]  
At the center floated a heart the size of a plum, beating a rhythm out of step with time. [533]  
Kedron understood: the changeling's body could not settle because its heart remained captive here. [547]  
Bone setting was pointless without heart setting; every constellation needs a pulse to keep spinning. [562]  
Liora cupped the jar, warm glass against her palms, and spoke gentle skepticism at the beat inside. [579]  
You might be illusion, she told it, but even illusions deserve the chance to correct themselves. [595]  
The heart pulsed harder, as though forgiving her doubt. [604]  
Glass cracked, honey spilled, and the heart floated free, rising like a lantern toward the stairwell. [620]  
They followed, guided by its glow back into the garden where constellations waited like hungry sockets. [636]  
Kedron placed the heart within the flickering segment, and the stars locked together with a satisfied click. [653]  
Light cascaded outward, illuminating the maze, the riverbank, even the village steeple beyond distant hills. [668]  
Somewhere a cradle creaked, a real baby stirring where the changeling had slept moments before. [683]  
The garden dimmed to moonlit hush, its work finished, its mistakes charted now as permanent starlight. [699]  
Liora felt the cleft in certainty knit closed, not by answers, but by earned wonder. [714]  
Kedron smiled that shrewdly innocent smile, wiping honey from his cuffs like pollen from a pilgrim. [730]  
They left the garden still humming, determined to map new constellations from every error they might yet make. [748]
