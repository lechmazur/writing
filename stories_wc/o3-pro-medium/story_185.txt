A thin rain drummed on the skylights of the Probability Mapping Center when the peculiar collector arrived.<words>17</words>
He moved with fractured grace, an infuriatingly calm ripple through corridors humming with statistical storms.<words>32</words>
Under his arm sat an old pencil stub wrapped in velvet as though it were imperial jewelry.<words>49</words>
I, chief cartographer of timelines, greeted him beside the panorama of swirling futures.<words>62</words>
Without introduction he asked to see the millennial strata, claiming he had come across millennia to tweak destiny one last time.<words>83</words>
His motive, he murmured, was to make a final stand against an abyss we had not yet graphed.<words>101</words>
Curiosity overruled protocol, so I guided him past servers that glittered like constellations trapped in ice.<words>117</words>
At the observation dais he laid the pencil stub upon the console and whispered numbers my instruments refused to display.<words>137</words>
Then he opened an antique piano bench that none of us had ever noticed among the data cabinets.<words>155</words>
Inside, wooden keys were arranged in cryptic tiers, ivory scars spelling out frozen harmonic equations.<words>170</words>
He said the universe had hidden its buried talents there, waiting for someone patient enough to listen.<words>187</words>
The collector invited me to read them by decoding the arrangement of keys left in a piano bench.<words>205</words>
Each note corresponded to a probabilistic vein, and each silence to a wound our models never healed.<words>222</words>
As I translated the patterns, the center's holographic atlases bent, revealing shadow realms where outcomes coiled like sleeping serpents.<words>241</words>
With every discovery the collector remained infuriatingly calm, his eyes reflecting collapsing galaxies as though they were mild weather.<words>260</words>
Soon I found a branch where humanity survived only if a single quaver of probability was raised by one percent.<words>280</words>
The adjustment required the slightest pressure, like shifting a feather on a cathedral scale.<words>294</words>
The collector handed me the pencil stub, its graphite worn but steady, and said the instrument remembered every hand that dared hope.<words>316</words>
I poised it over the master console, realizing my buried talents for pattern and rhythm had been the reason he chose me.<words>338</words>
With a breath I drew a single new vector, letting the graphite flicker like lightning across glass.<words>355</words>
The system shuddered, and probability realigned like choir voices finding the same impossible note.<words>369</words>
Alarms flared, yet the collector remained serene, watching futures bloom and die in spirals of translucent fire.<words>386</words>
He nodded once, satisfied that our final stand had been etched into the cosmos with quiet conviction.<words>403</words>
Before fading into a scatter of probabilities, he thanked me for lending fractured grace to the universe's song.<words>421</words>
Left alone amid settling silence, I placed the pencil stub back in velvet, ready for whoever might arrive next millennium.<words>441</words>
