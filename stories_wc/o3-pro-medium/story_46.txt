I tapped the first arpeggio, and the orchard of giant ferns shivered. <words>12</words>
Waterfalls poured silver veils above the leaves, masking the metronome's dry click. <words>24</words>
It was piano practice, yet no conservatory knew this place existed. <words>35</words>
My teacher was a blank-faced performer who never blinked between cadences. <words>46</words>
His cheeks reflected nothing, but his gloves dripped with the moss's reflected rainbows. <words>59</words>
He whispered that every rumor in the valley needed a guardian, and I had been selected. <words>75</words>
Confusion pressed my ribs, but curiosity struck the keys with sharper rhythm. <words>87</words>
To approve my appointment, he produced a plain plastic ring, dull as dishwater. <words>100</words>
He slipped it onto the piano's middle C, where it circled like a mute halo. <words>115</words>
Its ordinariness glowed, uniquely typical, the very definition of impossible camouflage. <words>126</words>
I asked what rumors required such sober jewelry. <words>134</words>
He answered by tracking moon paths across an opened score. <words>144</words>
Finger by finger, he pointed to crescendos that matched each lunar loop. <words>156</words>
Some moons slurred into darkness, carrying whispers of kings who drowned chasing echoes. <words>169</words>
Others were staccato crowns for beggars whose names blew off receipts. <words>180</words>
All required listening ears, and ears required dream-grammar, he insisted. <words>190</words>
Thus my motivation grew: to learn the language of dreams before dawn closed rehearsal. <words>204</words>
The ring thunked softly with each chord, translating sound into rumor, rumor into smoke. <words>218</words>
I inhaled that smoke and felt histories coil behind my sternum like patient serpents. <words>232</words>
Precise madness guided my fingers; they pecked the ivories as cartographers carve coastlines. <words>245</words>
Every new contour revealed another secret that begged for custody. <words>255</words>
The performer finally blinked, and waterfalls hushed as if awaiting verdict. <words>266</words>
He asked if the orchard could trust me never to repeat what I inhaled. <words>280</words>
I answered with a G-sharp that vibrated the ring into levitation. <words>291</words>
The ring spun, shedding plastic until only a thin line of night remained. <words>304</words>
From that line dripped syllables no throat had spoken, yet I understood. <words>316</words>
They meant, simply, yes, and the blank face softened in tragic relief. <words>328</words>
He approved my guardianship with a nod that bent moonlight around our bench. <words>341</words>
Immediately, rumors rooted themselves among the fern trunks, chirping like crickets made of parchment. <words>355</words>
Their pages fluttered, turning each rest in the music into a gossip's wingbeat. <words>368</words>
I kept playing, following the moon paths the performer had mapped on silence. <words>381</words>
The orchard leaned closer, waterfalls composing counterpoint until dream and rumor merged inside melody. <words>395</words>
When the final chord dissolved, I heard no applause, only the anxious hush of secrets finally safe. <words>412</words>
I removed the last echo from the air, slipped it on my finger, and walked away custodian of the valley's breathing silence. <words>434</words>
