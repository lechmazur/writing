A canopy village shimmered high above the Peruvian rainforest, its rope bridges swaying like guitar strings plucked by invisible parrots. <words>20</words>
In the platform clinic's waiting room, whose uncertain silence mimicked a held breath, sat Lazaro Quispe, a reformed con artist reputed for being dishonestly honest. <words>45</words>
Today, he sought the village elder's diagnosis not of body but of soul, hoping certification to become the guardian of tomorrow's flame. <words>67</words>
Clutched between ink-smudged fingers was a crumpled sheet music he had once swindled from a maestro before repentance found him. <words>87</words>
Outside, a patient nervous yodel spiraled through the buttress roots, a customary signal that the elder would soon emerge. <words>106</words>
Lazaro remembered reaching the village only after a detour to avoid a construction zone where loggers hammered a road toward the river, an omen of fragile tomorrows. <words>133</words>
Since that detour, gradual revelations had unfolded like fern fronds, each exposing a hidden chamber of his own motives. <words>152</words>
His version of honesty still wore disguises; he confessed sins in ways that earned favors, a carnival barker selling sincerity at half price. <words>175</words>
The stolen composition, rumored to summon living fire when sung true, was both proof of guilt and ticket to redemption. <words>195</words>
The door of woven palm parted, and Elder Nuna glided out, her gaze keen as a harpy eagle's. <words>213</words>
She summoned Lazaro, who rose so abruptly the waiting room creaked, uncertain silence replaced by heartbeats drumming panicked rhythms. <words>232</words>
Inside her hollow-barked chamber, Nuna asked why a man of scams dared seek sacred guardianship. <words>247</words>
Lazaro unfolded the sheet, its creases like past lies, and answered that only someone who understood darkness could nurture tomorrow's flame against it. <words>270</words>
He then attempted the fire-calling melody, but years of street patter cracked his voice, producing a half-yodel, half-sob that fluttered uselessly among the rafters. <words>294</words>
Nuna smiled, for failure was the first spark of truth, and motioned him to follow a spiral stair ascending into the open sky. <words>317</words>
Atop the tallest kapok, a glass lantern hung unlit beside a perch where toucans listened like gossiping cousins. <words>335</words>
Nuna explained that the flame would ignite only when the singer believed their own dishonest honesty could shelter others, and in that instant Lazaro's cracked yodel resolved into a clear note that burst the lantern aflame. <words>371</words>
The canopy village cheered, bridges humming with footfall, while the former con artist accepted his fiery charge amid a doctor's waiting room silence that at last felt certain. <words>399</words>
Tomorrow, the rainforest exhaled brighter, trusting its new guardian. <words>408</words>
