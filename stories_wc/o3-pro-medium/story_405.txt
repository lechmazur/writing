The air in the underground mushroom farm smelled of damp earth and faint electricity, a paradox of frantic peace that unnerved Dominic Hale.<words>23</words>
Dominic, a skeptical gambler whose debts outweighed his confidence, had not come here seeking fungi but directions for strangers he had never met.<words>46</words>
An anonymous conductor of the late-night Q train had promised him forgiveness of chance if he guided lost travelers to safety through these gloom-lit corridors.<words>71</words>
The payment, improbably, was a crusted velvet pouch containing a collection of dried petals, each brittle as a kept secret.<words>91</words>
Dominic suspected the petals were worthless tokens from a rigged game, yet their fragrance stitched memories of an uncharted grief he dared not name.<words>115</words>
He had lost nothing and everything at the same time, truthfully lying to himself that the ledger of sorrow showed even columns.<words>137</words>
Now, amid recipe testing for a rumored glow-in-the-dark risotto, the farmers bustled around vats of mycelium like white-coated bees.<words>156</words>
Dominic wove between them, pretending to audit the harvest while actually scanning walls for the next clue the subway scrawler had promised.<words>178</words>
He found it on a splintered support beam: green chalk hieroglyphs of turnstiles, arrows, and a tiny handcuff around a mushroom cap.<words>200</words>
Interpreting cryptic scrawls on subway seats had been his side hustle between poker tables, so the syntax of graffiti felt perversely comforting.<words>222</words>
The message directed him to impound any batch of violet-stemmed cremini before dusk, for inside their gills slept tomorrow's map.<words>242</words>
Seizing a crate, he dashed to the curing room, heart thudding dice, while farmers shouted about inventory and contamination protocols.<words>262</words>
There, under ultraviolet lamps, spores spilled like constellations, and the gambler felt the cosmos bend, urging him to open the petals.<words>283</words>
When the pouch loosened, the withered colors fluttered into the air, arranging themselves into a compass rose of fragile, aromatic paper.<words>304</words>
At the compass's center appeared the face of a tired woman he recalled only from blurred photographs, his mother before the addiction.<words>326</words>
Her lips moved without sound, but the petals translated: 'They wander like you did; deal them hope and fold your grief.'<words>347</words>
Dominic trembled, understanding that the uncharted grief was a route, not a wound, and the travelers were versions of himself.<words>367</words>
He hurried back, scattering spores like snowfall, and released the crate where wandering subway drifters would soon arrive, guided by phosphorescent arrows.<words>389</words>
In the dim hallway he posted a new scrawl, truthfully lying again: 'House winnings aheadâ€”follow the light,' knowing the promise meant safety, not profit.<words>413</words>
For the first time the odds felt fair, and the frantic peace inside him stopped dealing cards long enough to let him breathe.<words>436</words>
