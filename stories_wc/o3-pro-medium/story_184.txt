<story>
In the vacuum chamber garden, where chrysanthemums levitated beside laboratory tubing, a scrappy tavern-hand named Brindle wiped grimy knuckles on an apron that cracked like parchment. <words>26</words>
He worked while the sands of time flow backward, the hourglass mounted above the door spilling grains skyward in a smug defiance of gravity. <words>50</words>
Between orders of briny stew, he guarded a collection of seashells, broken yet iridescent, arranged on the counter like a shipwreck mapped in miniature. <words>74</words>
The tavern’s patrons mocked his seashell shrine, unaware that each shard hummed with inescapable callings only Brindle could hear, voices coaxing him beyond ale-soaked walls. <words>99</words>
Those voices were predictably unpredictable, crooning lullabies one moment then cracking jokes about cosmic entropy the next. <words>116</words>
To keep sane, Brindle would randomize the tavern’s music box gears nightly, hoping a shuffled melody might drown the shells’ relentless whispering. <words>138</words>
Yet the whispers only crescendoed, insisting he follow their instructions through the fossilized footprints in a dried-up riverbed behind the laboratory annex. <words>160</words>
They promised that if he obeyed, he would catapult imagination beyond known realms, birthing tavern tales so wild they would ferment reality itself. <words>183</words>
One reverse-midnight, when clocks chimed twelve ascending to eleven, Brindle pocketed the broken shells and crept out, laughter and dread sharing equal weight in his gut. <words>209</words>
The dried riverbed looked like a cracked tongue of the earth, its fossilized footprints glowing teal, as though rehearsing their comeback tour for extinct beasts. <words>234</words>
Standing barefoot in the foremost print, Brindle felt vacuum chamber air spill around him, transplanting the garden’s levitating chrysanthemums into the canyon of moonlit silt. <words>259</words>
Petals spun like lazy comets, and the shells aligned themselves along his forearm, forming an exosleeve of nacreous circuitry that ticked louder than any heart. <words>284</words>
With a shrug of flippant solemnity, he saluted the drunk constellations overhead and let the footprints tow him backward along time’s rippling sandstream. <words>307</words>
Every step rewound a tavern brawl, unsmashed bottles, unslurred curses, and unspilled dreams, until Brindle stood before his earlier self still polishing mugs in the garden. <words>333</words>
The future Brindle whispered, "Pour them stories instead of ale," then shattered into motes that scattered like fizzy starlight into the music box’s gears. <words>357</words>
Suddenly the tavern erupted in audiences, not customers, each patron catching floating syllables, sipping them, burping giggles, and departing with eyes wide as unopened doors. <words>382</words>
Brindle, both versions now synchronized, realized the inescapable callings had always been his own yearning to randomize reality just enough to make everyone notice its seams. <words>408</words>
He returned the broken collection of seashells to the bar, no longer guardians but colleagues, and toasted them for catapulting imagination beyond known realms and back again. <words>435</words>
The shells clinked without touching, a predictably unpredictable encore that promised tomorrow would arrive yesterday, exactly on time. <words>453</words>
