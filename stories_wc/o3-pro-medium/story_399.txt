Garrick, the grumpy crypt caretaker, scowled as midnight incense curled under the door of the witch's crystal scrying room.<words>19</words>
He disliked being summoned anywhere, but being summoned upward, away from his beloved mossy vaults, felt multiply singular.<words>37</words>
The witch, Nyssara, gestured toward a low table where a fresh sand mandala shimmered like starlit dunes.<words>54</words>
A cataract of constellations projected from her crystals, so the entire chamber breathed cosmos, meant for their stargazing ritual.<words>73</words>
Throughout stargazing, she explained, one could read fate through the patterns in a sand mandala, if patience prevailed.<words>91</words>
Garrick grunted, his voice gravel rubbing iron, but he held out the unmarked cardboard tube she had requested.<words>109</words>
Inside, he knew, lay ashes scraped from every coffin he'd ever sealed, wrapped in silence darker than pitch.<words>127</words>
They were the residue of other people's endings, yet each fleck whispered memories of shovels, sobs, and Garrick's own buried nights.<words>148</words>
Nyssara poured the ashes, coaxing them to jiggle into the mandala's grooves, where sand welcomed soot like lost kin.<words>167</words>
She told Garrick that an uprising rumbled inside him, a legion of unopened griefs pushing at the vault of his heart.<words>188</words>
To quell an uprising within, she intoned, one must face the importance of trauma rather than board it up like coffins.<words>209</words>
Garrick scoffed at the sermon, yet the mandala's constellated grains began rearranging themselves into shapes only he recognized.<words>227</words>
There was the bent staircase where he saw his brother fall, the lantern drop, the fire spread, the screams evaporate.<words>247</words>
The sand glowed; the ash smoldered; stars above mirrored every granule, multiplying singular moments into a celestial reckoning of responsibility.<words>267</words>
Nyssara bade him kneel, head tipped back, so his tear-dilated eyes could reconcile horizon and zenith simultaneously.<words>284</words>
Throughout stargazing, she whispered, the sky does not forget darkness; it arranges it into guidance.<words>299</words>
Garrick exhaled, and decades of formaldehyde, frost, and guilt rose like steam, threading into the mandala's spinning galaxies.<words>317</words>
The patterns accepted his confession, then collapsed, leaving a single spiral of soot pointing toward the unmarked tube now emptied.<words>337</words>
Nyssara sealed the spiral with beeswax, murmuring a vow that pain, once named, need not remain nameless.<words>354</words>
Garrick found the uprising within had quieted, like a bell after its final toll, resonant yet obedientfully stilled.<words>372</words>
He rose, still grumpy, but the edge of his scowl had been sanded into something resembling dawnlight humility.<words>390</words>
Nyssara allowed herself a victory smirk, grandiose subtlety incarnate, as the crystals dimmed and the cosmos folded its tents.<words>409</words>
She handed Garrick the now wax-sealed tube, instructing him to return it to the crypt as a lantern of lessons.<words>429</words>
Outside, constellations wheeled on, multiply singular in their brilliance, and Garrick felt, for once, perfectly, silently, jarringly alive.<words>447</words>
