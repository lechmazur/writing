Sirena Mallory patrolled the urban orchard sprawled across the repurposed Highway Nine overpass.<words>13</words>
She was the last and most overzealous park ranger the city council could tolerate.<words>27</words>
Orderly rows of pear trees tangled with graffiti-kissed vines, reflecting her own chaotic organization of mind.<words>43</words>
Ever since the calendars stopped, she marked hours by how the fermented figs fluctuated in fragrance.<words>59</words>
That fluctuation whispered the date: after the last human dream is dreamt.<words>71</words>
Dreams were outlawed relics, now harvested like pollen for unknown archives buried beneath municipal ruins.<words>86</words>
Sirena's real assignment, however, burned hotter than ordinance: to catch the echo of a goddess.<words>101</words>
Her grandmother had whispered of that echo on her deathbed, fingers clutching a plain notebook.<words>116</words>
The notebook, worn soft as plum skin, contained ink that erased itself whenever Sirena looked away.<words>132</words>
Grandmother called its contents familiarly unknown, truths so intimate they felt foreign to any reader.<words>147</words>
Sirena flipped pages nightly, always discovering blankness where revelations had previously bloomed like jasmine.<words>161</words>
She concluded the notebook guided her only through chance encounters, not deliberate inquiry.<words>174</words>
So she roamed the orchard, bumping into echoes the way wind bumps into chimes.<words>188</words>
One dusk, a cracked traffic mirror dangled from a cherry limb, reflecting someone who was not there.<words>205</words>
The reflection mouthed syllables that rippled the concrete sky, and Sirena tasted thunderberries on her tongue.<words>221</words>
She scribbled the tasted word—“Echelyn”—into the notebook, which immediately penned further lines without her hand.<words>236</words>
They read: “Follow the pigeon whose shadow wears antlers; there the goddess reverberates.”<words>249</words>
Chaotic yet organized, the instruction stitched itself into Sirena’s cartilage like a moral compass.<words>263</words>
Moments later, a soot-gray pigeon descended, its shadow indeed sporting delicate ivory antlers.<words>276</words>
Sirena pursued, vaulting planters, startling apples into orbit, her ranger whistle shrieking like broken sirens.<words>291</words>
The pigeon’s route fluctuated between manic zigzags and serene glides, mimicking heartbeat irregularities.<words>304</words>
Every change aligned with a pulse of invisible music only cracked pavement seemed to hear.<words>319</words>
The chase ended beneath a rusted exit sign where a fountain once sprayed exhaust into roses.<words>335</words>
There, the bird dissolved into echo, and the notebook grew heavy as wet clay.<words>349</words>
Sirena opened it and found her grandmother’s secrets at last: recipes for summoning absence.<words>363</words>
Absence, the goddess herself, could only be caught by cooking silence with orchard wind and pigeon dust.<words>380</words>
Sirena gathered ingredients, measuring them in heartbeats, and the overpass began humming with newborn hush.<words>395</words>
When she poured the mixture onto the fountain basin, space around her folded like orchard origami.<words>411</words>
An echo, unmistakably feminine and infinitely distant, kissed her eardrums, saying, “Ranger, you have remembered everyone.”<words>427</words>
Sirena saluted the vanishing sound, knowing the orchard would keep dreaming now, even without dreamers.<words>442</words>
She closed the plain notebook, which this time stayed written, and let herself finally sleep.<words>457</words>
