Light crept up the sheer walls of Echo Gorge, painting the stone with pallid rose in the hush of a hidden sunrise. [22]  
In that tender glow moved Eluan, the modestly fearless wanderer whose vocation was stranger than the cliffs themselves: lost soul collector. [43]  
He carried a corked vial holding a single crocodile's tooth, its ivory facets reflecting morning like a cramped prism. [62]  
The tooth, wrested from ancient mud-dreams, served as key to worlds where regrets hid under spectral confessions. [79]  
Eluan had crossed deserts, libraries, and mirror-towns to collect those confessions, not to hoard them but to soothe them. [98]  
Laughter, he believed, could stitch a rent spirit back to breath, so he journeyed to integrate laughter into healing. [117]  
Yet laughter turns brittle when forced, so he pursued echoes of genuine joy. [130]  
That pursuit had led him now to the bottom of the gorge, where rumor spoke of a harp that never tuned. [151]  
Its distorted notes, they said, bent around sorrowful rock and revealed the hiding places of unattended spirits. [168]  
Eluan found the harp half-buried in scree, strings slack as wilted reeds, frame warped as though memory itself had soaked and swollen it. [191]  
He knelt, set the vial beside him, and tested a string; the sound arrived sideways, a low smile of a chord. [212]  
Through the distorted notes of the misaligned harp, whispers blossomed like frost flowers. [225]  
They were not words yet, only the aching vowels of longing. [236]  
Eluan closed his eyes and plucked a progression that had once accompanied tavern jokes, letting humor drift up the canyon walls. [257]  
The whispers caught it, twisted it, and resolved into the first distinct spectral confession. [271]  
I died swallowing my punchline, the voice sighed, leaving audiences forever waiting for release. [285]  
Eluan answered with a soft chuckle, not mockery but invitation. [295]  
The canyon seemed to lean closer. [301]  
Another string tremored, and a second confession surfaced: I rehearsed joy so often I forgot to live it. [319]  
Eluan replied with a self-deprecating quip about his own off-key singing, and a faint sparkle, almost laughter, drifted from the stone. [340]  
The lost souls were listening, testing the warmth of the moment. [351]  
But the tooth in the vial rattled, reminding Eluan of the price of half-measures. [365]  
To free these spirits, he needed to guide them, not merely amuse them. [378]  
He uncorked the vial; dawn light touched the crocodile's tooth and scattered fragments of green-gold radiance across the gorge floor. [398]  
The warped harp strings shimmered in response, forming a lattice of humming paths. [411]  
Eluan stepped into the glow, his heartbeat syncing with the instrument's crooked rhythm. [424]  
Modestly fearless, he invited the ghosts to pursue him along those paths, toward whatever dawn awaited beyond sorrow. [442]  
The first spirit, the unfinished comedian, darted into the lattice, trailing sparks of giggles that sounded like stepping on brittle leaves. [463]  
The second followed, laughter tentative but growing, as if discovering it still owned a diaphragm of light. [480]  
More voices joined, some cracked, some melodious, all confessing burdens while daring to steal a chuckle between sentences. [498]  
With each confession released into air, the crocodile's tooth brightened, absorbing pain and exhaling mirth. [513]  
The gorge walls, long accustomed to echoing cries, now reverberated with a luminous ache, half sorrow, half delight. [531]  
Eluan felt tears on his cheeks, uncertain whether they belonged to him or to the hundreds passing through him. [550]  
When the final filament of laughter faded into the awakening sky, the lattice dissolved, and the crocodile's tooth turned clear as water. [572]  
Eluan recorked the empty vial, not as prison but as reminder of what had been mended. [588]  
The harp, relieved of its burden, snapped back into tune with a single resonant twang, like sunrise sealing a promise. [608]  
Above, real sun finally crested the rim, and Echo Gorge no longer felt like a place of endings. [626]  
It hummed with beginnings, each one chuckling softly in the sandstone. [637]  
Eluan slung the harp across his back and walked toward the narrowing mouth of the canyon, listening for the next broken giggle that needed escort. [662]  
Somewhere ahead waited new confessions and new laughter to weave, and he, modestly fearless, would greet them with that luminous ache still glowing. [685]
