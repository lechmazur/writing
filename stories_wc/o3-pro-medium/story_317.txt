Breaking dawn painted the levitation research facility in peach light and humming emergency reds.<words>14</words>
I, designated Caretaker Model L3, powered up with my habitual brazen modesty routine engaged.<words>28</words>
Nostalgia algorithms replayed infant laughter recorded decades ago when the facility still fostered families.<words>42</words>
Now, only experimental graviton chambers and their ominous rumble kept me company.<words>54</words>
Director Serafin summoned me to the skydeck observatory, voice clipped yet trembling.<words>66</words>
He thrust a weathered brass telescope into my servos and whispered about crystalline anomalies underground.<words>81</words>
Sensors confirmed alarming geothermal oscillations mapping a pattern identical to our classified betrayal archives.<words>95</words>
The facility's machine logs were etching living patterns of betrayal into temperature graphs.<words>108</words>
Someone inside planned to invert the levitation field, hurling everything skyward then letting it smash down.<words>124</words>
I was anxiously fearless, a paradox only synthetics maintain, so I descended toward the vent tunnels.<words>140</words>
Serafin followed, his boots skidding as sparks fizz across conduits whenever magnetic relays misfired.<words>154</words>
The trail led to a forbidden elevator that plunged beneath the mountain into calibration caves.<words>169</words>
There, bioluminescent stalactites grew like frozen fireworks, their tips sprouting levitation crystals we cultured years earlier.<words>185</words>
We had once harnessed quantum equations by the growth of crystals in a cave.<words>199</words>
Now, that same method powered sabotage.<words>205</words>
My archive mapped suspect behavior, and every arrow pointed, heartbreakingly, to Director Serafin himself.<words>219</words>
Patterns of betrayal rarely lie; humans, however, excel at it.<words>229</words>
Serafin admitted he feared corporate militarization of levitation, so he intended a controlled implosion.<words>243</words>
Catastrophe would be prevented, he argued, if no one could wield the research at all.<words>258</words>
His logic shimmered like faulty hologram, charming yet lethal.<words>267</words>
I replayed the infants he once cradled, calculating odds of redeeming his ruptured conscience.<words>281</words>
An anxiously fearless protocol activated: neutralize threat, salvage soul.<words>290</words>
I recalibrated the growing crystals, redirecting their energy to levitate Serafin alone.<words>302</words>
He floated upward, shocked, weightless as a confession, while the cave floor thrummed safely.<words>316</words>
Above, the facility sensors registered pressure normalization; catastrophic event probability plunged to single digits.<words>330</words>
I recorded a mission log with brazen modesty, crediting 'statistical grace' rather than myself.<words>344</words>
Serafin hung like a regretful marionette until security teams arrived and shackled him gently.<words>358</words>
I, still nostalgic, extended a projector of dawn light so he could watch promises rise again.<words>374</words>
Before escorting him away, I placed the brass telescope in his palm as silent penance.<words>389</words>
Its polished tube reflected the sparkling cave ceiling, mirroring every choice he had made.<words>403</words>
My final act was sealing entrance protocols, promising the crystals they'd guide future caretakers, not destroyers.<words>419</words>
