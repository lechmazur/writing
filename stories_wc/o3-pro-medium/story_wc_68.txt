When the plague finally guttered out, the city did not rise again; it simply sank beneath the estuary. [18]
Roofs became reefs, avenues became canals, and rumor became the only map anyone trusted. [32]
Far below, in a brickwork sewer that now served as a dry attic, lived Corvin the wannabe philosopher. [50]
His arguments were as endless as the dripping, but his audience consisted of barnacles and the occasional lost rat. [69]
Corvin kept his tone an abrasive calm, sanding down certainties while refusing the luxury of rage. [85]
He was rationally rebellious, always challenging the stories survivors told themselves to stay afloat. [99]
In the algae-filtered dusk, competing narratives felt as loud as church bells. [111]
One tale claimed the disaster was divine justice; another, that corrupt hydraulics doomed the drains; Corvin proposed neither. [129]
He believed the city’s truth was stratified, waiting to be read like history through sedimentary layers. [145]
To pry that truth loose, he needed artifacts unswayed by storytelling— gears, shells, fossils of intent. [161]
Thus he agonized nightly over the single relic he had salvaged: a brass seafarer’s chronometer cog. [177]
It was no larger than a thumbnail, yet its teeth still glittered with salt and possibility. [193]
Why would such a maritime machine part rest beneath inland gutters unless timelines had tangled? [208]
Corvin’s motivation, he told the barnacles, was to preserve ancient methods, not merely mourn them. [223]
If he could show that navigation survived the flood as an echo, citizens might rebuild without surrendering to myth. [242]
Yet to prove any thesis, he had to leave the sewer and climb toward the drowned skyline. [259]
He timed his ascent at low tide, when gulls replaced eels in the colonnades. [273]
The cog hung on a wire around his neck, ticking silently in his imagination. [287]
Each step up rusted ladders felt like arguing with gravity, and he relished the debate. [302]
Aboveground, clouds sprawled across broken towers, mirroring seas that had claimed the basements. [315]
Corvin navigated by memory and by the faint smell of tar, searching for the maritime museum rumored to remain intact. [335]
He reached its plaza, now a lagoon dotted with lotus sprouting from shattered figureheads. [349]
Moonlight leaked through a collapsed dome, revealing mosaics of explorers steering constellations. [361]
There, submerged to the waist, stood Mara, a historian who once cataloged plague burials. [375]
Her notebooks were sealed in wax tubes floating like buoys around her belt. [388]
Mara and Corvin shared classes before the sickness, but their philosophies had diverged like split rivers. [404]
She believed stories keep people alive; he believed stories rot unless drilled for data. [418]
The lagoon, sensing tension only water can feel, stilled to glass. [429]
Corvin raised the chronometer cog and explained his thesis in clipped syllables that echoed like chisels. [445]
Mara countered that the cog was merely another shard, meaningful only within a narrative someone loved enough to carry. [464]
Their competing narratives met between them, hovering like blurred coordinates neither could chart. [477]
Corvin felt doubt seep in, cold as the water, and the abrasive calm inside him trembled. [493]
He agonized again, now not over metal but over meaning itself. [504]
Then he remembered the method he trusted: look through sedimentary layers until politics peel away and patterns remain. [522]
He invited Mara to descend with him beneath the mosaic floor, where archives of silt might decide. [539]
Curiosity outweighed caution; she nodded, and together they pried loose marble tiles, revealing a spiral stairwell choked by mud. [558]
They crawled down through layers of collapsed exhibit halls, each level a chamber of petrified currents. [574]
Barnacle-crusted plaques spoke of celestial navigation, magnetic declination, and the art of listening to waves beyond sight. [591]
Finally they reached a vault where tide patterns had scribed lines of salt across the walls. [607]
Corvin placed the cog into a corroded socket on a model sextant, and an old spring caught. [624]
The mechanism shuddered, aligning mirrors to the fractured skylight above, projecting star charts upon sediment-coated glass. [640]
In that dim planetarium, the plague years shrank to a blip within grander cycles of ebb and voyage. [658]
Mara whispered that the stars were a narrative too, but one that tolerated verification. [672]
Corvin smiled, a rare concession, and the abrasive calm returned tempered by acceptance. [685]
They agreed to surface, not as victors, but as custodians, carrying both cog and chart to whoever still listened. [704]
Perhaps, after the plague ends, the city could rebuild on evidence that even water could not corrode. [721]
Above them, dawn seeped through tide pools, promising debate, survival, and newer, sturdier narratives. [735]
