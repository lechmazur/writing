At the hush of a deserted intersection late at night, I slipped through the unmarked door beneath the traffic light.<words>20</words>
Inside waited the secret agent center, its corridors refrigerated to discourage lingering thoughts.<words>33</words>
Sir Calder, a cold-natured knight I was assigned to shadow, emerged like mist from steel doors.<words>49</words>
He upheld crowned statutes yet bent every bylaw to shelter the powerless, a lawfully rebellious paradox I admired.<words>67</words>
Tonight our covert mission was to collect folk remedies rumored to cure frost-bite in glacial kingdoms.<words>83</words>
The first clue, curiously, was a child's lost mitten sealed within an evidence bag on Calder's belt.<words>100</words>
Pink yarn peeked through the plastic like a heartbeat trapped under ice, nagging him with unexpected warmth.<words>117</words>
Though famed for marble composure, he stroked the mitten as if it were ember and sighed.<words>133</words>
That sigh opened a crack, and through it drifted his long-buried hunger for colors, for brushstrokes, for song.<words>151</words>
I recognized artistic awakening the way spies sense poison--subtle, fragrant, immediately dangerous to the mission's timing.<words>167</words>
Nevertheless, protocol demanded support via incomplete family altars hidden across the city, each altar unfinished until gifted truth.<words>185</words>
We located the first altar in a broom closet behind the surveillance servers, candles absent, only dust and slots.<words>204</words>
Calder placed the mitten where a votive should stand, and the cold air softened around us.<words>220</words>
A holographic map flared, revealing the next remedy source: an herbalist's stall abandoned beneath river columns.<words>236</words>
We rode stolen bicycles through alley starlight, his cloak snapping like a flag sworn to invisible nations.<words>253</words>
At the riverside altar he added pennyroyal leaves beside the mitten, and steam spiraled into pictographs.<words>269</words>
The images told his childhood: chapels unheated, parents lost to war, sketches scraped on frost-laced windows.<words>285</words>
I felt distance close, as if my breath whispered inside his visor, confirming why he feared warmth.<words>302</words>
Yet law demanded we return with remedies, not memories, or risk charges of sentimental treason.<words>317</words>
At the final altar--a traffic island ringed by mute cameras--Calder hesitated, mitten trembling in armored hand.<words>333</words>
He could complete the ritual, earn clearance, freeze again; or break protocol, paint future on city asphalt.<words>350</words>
I whispered that rebellion is lawful when the law forgets the living, and I backed his choice.<words>367</words>
He ripped open the evidence bag, slid the mitten over a nearby child-sized traffic statue, and knelt.<words>384</words>
Color pulsed from the statue, repainting billboards with folk-remedy recipes--nettle syrup, snowmoss tea, ember salve--free for every passerby.<words>402</words>
Central servers recorded the act as contraband, but citizens miles away already brewed warmth against winter tyranny.<words>419</words>
Calder stood, the chill inside his armor melting into breath, and thanked me with a painter's silent bow.<words>437</words>
In the hush he once served, a new canvass of remedies, rebellion, and tenderness now glittered.<words>453</words>
