Levon Vey, a quiet deserter from three wars and two families, slipped into the greenhouse.<words>15</words>
Here, a secret university study listened for whispers passing between philodendrons, asters, and weary moss.<words>30</words>
The job suited him; plants never asked about medals or reasons for abandoned posts.<words>44</words>
Still, he felt existence spin like loose gears, dizzyingly grounded yet threatening to launch outward.<words>59</words>
He wanted a place to belong, even if the coordinates mapped an empty nowhere.<words>73</words>
Professor Anahita, his only correspondent, claimed the answer hid inside a cracked mirror beside the compost.<words>89</words>
She believed mirrors remembered what faced them, calcifying regrets the way trunks hold storms.<words>103</words>
Together they designed an experiment: break the mirror, carbonize its splinters, then feed ash to seedlings.<words>119</words>
Whatever story the glass carried would move through roots and rise as chlorophyll confession.<words>133</words>
Yet Levon sensed another cycle beginning, identical to the ones he perpetually fled.<words>146</words>
Breaking the cycle, he told himself, required breaking the story before it hardened again.<words>160</words>
That night, moonlight riddled the lab like puzzle pieces still searching for their cardboard picture.<words>175</words>
Time itself seemed arranged throughout jigsaw puzzles, edges done, center uncertain.<words>186</words>
Levon gathered the porcelain masks that volunteers had worn to prevent breath from disturbing acoustic sensors.<words>202</words>
Each mask, once pristine, now lay spiderwebbed and discarded like mute confessions.<words>214</words>
He smashed them fully, reconstructing stories from shattered porcelain masks as if editing fractured diaries.<words>229</words>
Fragments formed mosaics of faces he might have worn had he stayed anywhere longer.<words>243</words>
He whispered apologies, then torched the tableaux until they carbonized into brittle constellations.<words>256</words>
The soot he scattered across the soil like midnight snow on spring furrows.<words>269</words>
Leaves quivered, and a low static hummed through speakers tuned to the plants' minute voltages.<words>284</words>
Amid the crackle, Levon heard a single phrase: "You are nowhere, therefore everywhere."<words>297</words>
The message was noble foolishness, exactly the compass he lacked but understood.<words>309</words>
He recorded the phrase onto a tape, then shattered the tape housing to join the ash.<words>325</words>
Professor Anahita arrived at dawn, expecting graphs, but found only a charred mosaic of possibilities.<words>340</words>
Levon stood among the whispering fronds, lighter, as if the war medals had vaporized with the soot.<words>357</words>
"I broke the mirror, the mask, the puzzle edge," he said, voice soft as compost steam.<words>373</words>
"If nowhere is home, let the roots remember me wherever they drink."<words>385</words>
The plants replied with a rising chorus, dizzyingly grounded, cycling upward yet refusing the old orbit.<words>401</words>
Listening, Levon finally belonged to their endless, broken-and-rebuilt conversation, and the greenhouse felt boundless.<words>415</words>
Outside, dawn caught the remaining shards and scattered them like harmless stars on the path behind him.<words>432</words>
