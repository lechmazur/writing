My great-grandmother Evangeline Cortez, the first flamboyant mortician of our lineage, documented everything inside the social network archive she secretly curated.<words>21</words>
Her posts overflowed with jubilant remorse, celebrating life while apologizing to the dead for the bright sequins on her mourning gowns.<words>42</words>
I, Lucian Cortez, now serve as the family's glamorous undertaker, scrolling those entries each dawn while the crematory paint shop rattles awake.<words>64</words>
The shop doubles as an art studio; during paint mixing I stir pigments for caskets and copy Evangeline's digital whispers onto fresh walls.<words>87</words>
Today's coral-rose batch swirls lusciously, and I feel her directive thrumming: measure, elongate, remember.<words>101</words>
The brass measuring tape she bequeathed hangs from my belt like a ribbon of metallic honey, cool but insistent.<words>120</words>
Its increments are engraved with tiny skulls marking inches, a macabre flourish only our bloodline understands.<words>136</words>
According to tradition begun by Evangeline's pirate-embalmer father, we must stretch—never cut—the cloth that shrouds the departed.<words>153</words>
This ritual mocks the myth of ordinariness, asserting that even the plainest villager warrants a farewell garment longer than their regrets.<words>174</words>
So I hook the shining tape to linen, elongate the weave with fruitlessly patient tugs, and log each extra inch online.<words>195</words>
Followers, spectral and living, send heart-shaped emojis, yet I ache because no measure resurrects the storytellers I'm trying to honor.<words>215</words>
Still, the jubilation inside the archive bubbles louder than my remorse, coaxing me to continue the flamboyant calculus of grief.<words>235</words>
Mid-mix, a notification pings: a descendant of our first client wants a cloth measured for her grandmother, who feared extravagance.<words>255</words>
I message her a video of the swirling coral paint, promising that the hue mirrors sunset on the day the old woman eloped.<words>278</words>
Evangeline once wrote that color is a second eulogy, audible to eyes; my client replies with tears rendered in glittering GIFs.<words>299</words>
While the pigment thickens, I recall Evangeline insisting that our labor exists to preserve ancient practices, claiming patience is fruitless unless it seeds defiance.<words>323</words>
I broadcast the stretching ceremony live, narrating each pull of linen, each click of brass teeth, each confession of longing.<words>343</words>
Viewers marvel as the fabric surpasses the tape's end, a visual proof that remembrance can outrun measurement.<words>360</words>
Suddenly the reel of posts, colors, and skull-etched inches feels like a river, and I like its glitter-smeared ferryman.<words>379</words>
I sign off with Evangeline's motto, "Lengthen love until it drapes eternity," hearing her laugh inside the humming paint mixer.<words>399</words>
The mixer replies in pink splatters, blessing the vow anew.<words>409</words>
