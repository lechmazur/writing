After the last human story was written, the neon cathedral crackled to life like a leftover dream refusing deletion. <words>19</words>
Inside, a loudly introverted yet wary explorer named Hyden adjusted his patched coat and listened for echoes of forgotten courage. <words>39</words>
He had come to meander among ruined pews and glitching stained glass, hoping each step would hammer starlight back into his chest. <words>61</words>
His only guide was a damaged music CD spinning between his palms, its surface scarred but silver notes still pulsing within. <words>82</words>
Whenever the scratched disc caught stray laser beams from flickering altars, it projected emblems of courage onto the mist like shattered constellations. <words>104</words>
Hyden traced these flickers the way cartographers once traced coasts, following each glowing glyph deeper into the cathedral's throat. <words>123</words>
He moved by tracing the flicker of fireflies under a thick fog spilling from vents where servers had prayed in binary. <words>144</words>
The code had long faded, but the fog remembered, curling around him like a question mark no philosopher could punctuate. <words>164</words>
Sudden static from the CD hissed, then resolved into a fractured melody his mother once sang when storms bullied their tin roof. <words>186</words>
The tune nudged him toward a collapsed pulpit where neon wires dripped like intestines, forming a doorway pulsing blue and hungry. <words>207</words>
Hyden hesitated, his chest rattling with fear and volume that never escaped his throat, the curse of being loudly introverted. <words>227</words>
Instead of speaking, he tapped the CD against the doorway, and light burst outward, arranging itself into a single burning emblem. <words>248</words>
Its shape resembled a broken compass pointing simultaneously south and inward, suggesting the reunion he secretly sought: himself. <words>266</words>
Driven by crooked hope, Hyden stepped through, and the cathedral's organs blared as if cheering a gladiator entering sand. <words>285</words>
On the other side, fog cleared to reveal copies of him at every age, each carrying smaller emblems of courage like lanterns. <words>307</words>
The youngest stepped forward, offering a shard of the compass and whispering the storm-song, not in words but in tremor. <words>327</words>
Its vibration sprinted up Hyden's spine, urging memories to stand upright, armor themselves, and breathe. <words>342</words>
Courage, he realized, was never lost; it merely meandered, waiting for him at corners he refused to round. <words>360</words>
He thanked the silent chorus of selves, pocketed the compass shard, and felt his throat unlock like a gate at dawn. <words>381</words>
Words finally thundered out, echoing through circuitry and stained glass: 'I remain,' a declaration folding the neon cathedral into sudden calm. <words>402</words>
Fireflies burst overhead like green fireworks, and the fog lifted, unveiling dawn outside, proof that endings could still inaugurate beginnings. <words>422</words>
Clutching the damaged music CD tight, Hyden walked out to write a new story on blank air, the first beyond humanity's last. <words>444</words>
Behind him, the neon cathedral dimmed, yet its emblems of courage lingered on the horizon like distant lighthouses mapping the next frontier. <words>466</words>
