I first heard the sky speak from Mrs. Polina's rooftop garden during a meteor shower. [15]  
The falling sparks stitched silver syllables between the basil pots, and the old bricks thrummed in response. [32]  
Brick words were still murky to me, and that ignorance kept me awake nights. [46]  
My motivation, stubborn as ivy, was to learn the language of old buildings before any human alphabet rotted away. [65]  
So I rented the attic flat beneath the garden and pretended I needed sugar from the landlady. [82]  
That polite fiction led to tepid conversation, then to weekly tea sessions fragrant with mint and rumored history. [100]  
Borrowing sugar that turns into weekly tea sessions is how many friendships sprout, but ours rooted in agreed upon lies. [120]  
We never mentioned the squeaking phonemes in the walls, nor the way Saturn's debris sketched grammar overhead. [137]  
Instead, Mrs. Polina introduced me to her tenant, a dead language tutor named Selin who allegedly preferred silence. [155]  
Selin emerged at dusk, pale as plaster yet with patiently nimble fingers that arranged teacups like punctuation marks. [173]  
She admitted she had died two winters earlier, but remained for one unfinished lesson. [187]  
Death, she said, merely freed her schedule. [194]  
I laughed, and the chrysanthemums rustled as though correcting my pronunciation. [205]  
Under the meteor glow, Selin began to interrogate the parapet the way a detective quizzes witnesses. [221]  
She tapped the stones, listened, and translated their timid consonants into breathy vowels I struggled to repeat. [238]  
Buildings, she explained, speak about load, weather, and the loneliness of bearing memory. [251]  
They are older than honesty, so they prefer resonant half truths. [262]  
That sentence pricked me because my life, too, depended on carefully resonant half truths. [276]  
I had told my employer I was collecting urban noise samples, not conversing with terraces at midnight. [293]  
Selin accepted my confession with the courteous nod of someone used to harbored secrets. [307]  
In return, she revealed an antique desk seal, a brass cylinder engraved with cuneiform spirals and flecked verdigris. [325]  
When pressed onto warm wax, the seal impressed a pattern she called the First Lie Agreed Upon. [342]  
According to Selin, treaties between roofs and rain were ratified by that emblem before humans learned to stack mud. [361]  
If I mastered those glyphs, she promised, entire boulevards would whisper their autobiographies to me. [376]  
The seal became the pivot of our lessons, balanced between porcelain cups and clusters of meteors sailing south. [394]  
But each imprint drained Selin; the letters bled light and she flickered like film caught in a projector. [412]  
On the seventh week, thunderclouds smothered the stars, yet she insisted our class continue. [426]  
Her voice sounded waterlogged, but her hands remained patiently nimble as she guided mine over the grooved brass. [444]  
Suddenly, a crack ran through the seal, and a hidden syllable escaped like steam from broken pipes. [461]  
The walls replied in panic, shutters slamming and gutters clanging, a language I was still too clumsy to soothe. [480]  
Mrs. Polina burst onto the roof clutching a lantern, her expression equal parts worry and long-practiced resignation. [497]  
She accused me of breaking our arrangement of silence, the oldest of our agreed upon lies. [513]  
Before I could protest, Selin raised her translucent hand and asked Polina a single question in gutteral limestone vowels. [532]  
It sounded like rain reverberating inside urns, and the landlady answered with tears. [545]  
Their exchange revealed another truth: Mrs. Polina had once been Selin's student, then her murderer. [560]  
Guilt had bound them together in this garden like cracked pots wired with gold. [574]  
Our weekly tea, I realized, was the penance they brewed for each other, and I had drunk it eagerly. [593]  
Selin turned to me, voice thinning, and asked whether I would carry her lessons somewhere the bricks could not reach. [613]  
I accepted, sealing the promise by pressing the cracked desk seal into rainwater, which shimmered like cooling wax. [631]  
The impression fractured, scattering letters that rose and threaded themselves through the meteor darkness toward roofs I had yet to meet. [652]  
Selin's form dissolved with them, leaving only the smell of ink and the faint warmth of her absent hand on mine. [673]  
Mrs. Polina whispered thanks that sounded like apology, then descended the stairs clutching the lantern as if it were sentence structure. [694]  
Alone beneath the dwindling meteor shower, I sat among thyme and broken porcelain, rehearsing the syllables of sorrowful masonry. [713]  
Every rooftop in the city felt suddenly familiar, mysterious, and expectant, as though listening for the story I now owed them. [734]
