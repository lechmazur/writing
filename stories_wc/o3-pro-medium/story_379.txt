My hamstrings burned as I stretched beneath the pearlescent ceiling of the biodome farm.<words>14</words>
Rows of hydroponic wheat shimmered like rivers of chrome, but I watched the doors for pursuers.<words>30</words>
A trickster lawyer on the run learns to limber up between subpoenas and security drags.<words>45</words>
My name, once etched on courthouse plaques, now flitted across bounty manifests like an unclaimed echo.<words>61</words>
Every breath tasted of engineered ozone, yet purpose kept me steady with ghostly resolve.<words>75</words>
I was chasing whispers, cataloguing languages vanishing faster than the gene-edited locusts outside this shell.<words>90</words>
Each dialect recorded meant another chosen path preserved from permanent digital silence.<words>102</words>
Still, progress depended on diverting hunters sent by firms whose patents I had once twisted into Moebius knots.<words>120</words>
That knack for diversion began in high school, where rivals baited me with cryptic dares scrawled on locker doors.<words>139</words>
They still write, only now the dares arrive encrypted, pulsing through my sleeve-computer like mischievous heartbeats.<words>155</words>
Yesterday's dare had guided me here, promising a dialect spoken by the dome's elder irrigation android.<words>171</words>
Today's message flashed while I touched my toes: Leave a leftover gift tag where truth germinates.<words>187</words>
I pocketed the tiny paper square, its blank side shimmering with latent possibilities like an unwritten verdict.<words>204</words>
The tag, a relic from some abandoned holiday, would become proof of my route, or bait.<words>220</words>
Footsteps echoed, so I extended the stretch into a lunging arc, appearing casual yet ready to sprint.<words>237</words>
Security drones zipped past, distracted by a hack I triggered to divert their optics toward malfunctioning sprinklers.<words>254</words>

Chosen paths, I reminded myself, are often guarded by mirrors reflecting what we fear becoming.<words>284</words>
I threaded between shimmering wheat to the central control tree, a tower of algal glass and pulses.<words>301</words>
There, the irrigation android waited, its body half root, half circuitry, speaking in hisses reminiscent of windblown ash.<words>319</words>
I activated my lingual spectrograph, recording each spectral phoneme as the being recounted myths of pre-carbon rain.<words>336</words>
When the story ended, I affixed the leftover gift tag to the trunk, honoring the dare.<words>352</words>
Ink appeared of its own accord, spelling another challenge: 'Next tongue lies where roots feel stars' heat'.<words>369</words>
Even messages teased by ghosts obeyed contracts, and I, ever the lawyer, respected the fine print.<words>385</words>
I closed my journal, muscles finally warm, resolve colder than vacuum yet luminous as harvested starlight.<words>401</words>
Stretching ended, pursuit resumed, and chosen paths unfolded like bioengineered petals promising both refuge and reckoning.<words>417</words>
I stepped into the corridor's late-day glow, ghostly resolved to archive every syllable before silence won.<words>433</words>
Behind me, wheat whispered in newborn dialects, blessings for an impatiently patient outlaw and his pending trials.<words>450</words>
