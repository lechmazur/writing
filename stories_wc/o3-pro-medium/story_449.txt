Time slid like treacle on the time dilation observation deck, and Rowan felt vertigo bloom.<words>15</words>
He was the awkward champion nobody expected to save meaning itself, yet here he swayed.<words>30</words>
Outside the crystalline dome, galaxies pirouetted at mismatched speeds, a haunting delight that hummed in marrow.<words>46</words>
Under his arm he cradled a slim jar rumored to trap a thunderstorm in a bottle.<words>62</words>
Each crackling filament inside pulsed with blue-white longing, eager to be loosed upon a word.<words>77</words>
But the word was still forming, individually general, specific enough for cosmos yet roomy for hearts.<words>93</words>
Rowan's task, assigned by unseen curators of eras, was to birth an entirely new philosophy.<words>108</words>
He could only accomplish it through cryptic doodles on concert tickets collected during countless stalled seconds.<words>124</words>
Those scrap-paper melodies carried quiet benedictions, syllables that folded like origami prayers around lightning.<words>138</words>
Throughout baking sessions in the galley below, he inked, waited, rewrote, letting aromas tangle with thunder.<words>154</words>
Cinnamon, ozone, and existential dread simmered together, a recipe no cookbook dared index.<words>167</words>
The observation deck's chronometers hiccupped, minutes stretching into soft ribbons he could braid into hypotheses.<words>182</words>
Rowan sensed that to fuse storm and blessing, he must unclench his lifelong stage fright.<words>197</words>
After all, an awkward champion who never spoke could not shepherd a chorus of galaxies.<words>212</words>
So he rehearsed spoken silence, whispering vowels into dough while kneading, every bubble a budding universe.<words>228</words>
When the bread rose, so did courage, perfuming the deck with fermenting possibility.<words>241</words>
Night-side of the station glimmered, and he finally uncorked the thunderstorm in a bottle.<words>255</words>
Forked brilliance spiraled upward but paused, as though waiting for a concluding note.<words>268</words>
Rowan scattered the concert tickets across the viewport like neon confetti from extinct tours.<words>282</words>
Their doodles ignited, glyphs glowing foxfire green, and the storm read them like sheet music.<words>297</words>
Thunder became rhythm, lightning became melody, rain became hush, composing a symphony of quiet benedictions.<words>312</words>
The deck vibrated not with violence but with tender applause from pockets of slowed time.<words>327</words>
Every observer, past and future, felt the applause ripple backward into their own hesitations.<words>341</words>
Rowan spoke the philosophy aloud, words both individually general and luminously precise: 'Wonder is a shared solitude.'<words>358</words>
The storm folded itself into a single raindrop, resting on his tongue like sacramental dew.<words>373</words>
Taste rewrote the vector of history, threading empathy through empires, curiosity through creeds, laughter through voids.<words>389</words>
Then the chronometers snapped back, bread finished baking, and Rowan knew the philosophy was already everywhere.<words>405</words>
He offered the loaf to the deck's silence, and silence answered with the warm aroma of tomorrow.<words>422</words>
Though still awkward, the champion bowed, fused at last with the cadence of the cosmos.<words>437</words>
Quiet benedictions drifted like crumbs behind him, nourishing whoever dared observe time at an odd angle.<words>453</words>
