The glacial orchard hung like an upside-down cathedral above the bottomless ribbon of blue ice, swaying with every mournful wind.<words>20</words>
There, after the last human set foot on earth, a guarded druid named Breccia kept watch over saplings that glimmered like frozen lanterns.<words>43</words>
Breccia was fiercely ambivalent about his lonely stewardship, finding dour amusement in both the orchard's beauty and his own dread of speaking to it.<words>67</words>
Silence weighed thicker than the glacial branches, yet every year he felt an itch to break it the way fruit skin finally splits.<words>90</words>
That itch arrived now, on what would have been his hundred-and-sixth birthday, the only day his family had ever allowed themselves a special meal.<words>114</words>
The recipe required him to gather three frost-apples, one icicle marrow, and the tiny metallic seed they once pierced with a dull safety pin for luck.<words>140</words>
The safety pin, found rusting in an ancestor's cloak, no longer pierced anything cleanly, but tradition cared little for sharpness.<words>160</words>
Breccia removed it from a pouch of woven lichens, its bent point reflecting auroras that no eyes save his remembered.<words>180</words>
He laughed, a gravel sound startling a roost of snow-doves, and the orchard responded with a creak like bones thawing after a joke.<words>203</words>
The silence, once holy, now felt staged, and he resolved to break it utterly by cooking the birthday feast aloud.<words>223</words>
First he climbed a ladder of braided roots that arched over the crevasse, muttering instructions his mother used to whistle between her teeth.<words>246</words>
The words echoed down the blue ice, bounced back mangled, and he answered their distortions with equally crooked jokes, half cringing, half grinning.<words>269</words>
Each reply chipped at his crippling fear of his own voice, as though conversation were sculpting a tunnel to daylight.<words>289</words>
When the frost-apples dropped into his satchel, they chimed like crystal bells, and he shouted thanks so loud shards of rime rattled loose.<words>312</words>
The icicle marrow resisted until he sang the lullaby his aunt had invented to tease glaciers, a tune that promised catastrophic naps.<words>334</words>
Finally he pricked the metallic seed, though the dull safety pin bent further, and a single bead of silver sap glistened like surrendered armor.<words>358</words>
With ingredients gathered, he built a brazier of frozen twigs and lit it by rubbing two shards of lightning glass, narrating every spark.<words>381</words>
The stew simmered, releasing scents of pears and steel, and Breccia kept talking, describing clouds he had only read about in fossils of air.<words>405</words>
When the meal thickened, he poured it into a hollowed frost-apple, raised it toward the orchard, and whispered, 'To family long silent yet still hungry.'<words>430</words>
The crevasse answered with a low, satisfied burp of shifting ice, and Breccia, startled, laughed until the silence finally cracked beyond repair.<words>452</words>
