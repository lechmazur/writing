Rain pixelated against neon windows as Lark, an uncertain druid, unlocked the hologram repair shop for another shift. <words>18</words>
The morning smelled of overheated circuits and lethargic excitement, an aroma he had grown to find uniquely common. <words>36</words>
He carried his dented lunch tin like a reliquary, its lid rattling with herb sachets and half-forgotten hopes. <words>54</words>
Clients rarely arrived before noon, so Lark would wander between flickering projectors, nursing doubts about roots, runes, and usefulness. <words>73</words>
His grandmother’s voice, woven from stern oak wisdom, whispered ties of obligation louder than any buzzing console. <words>90</words>
According to her, a druid served the wild wherever it sprouted, even in alleys paved with holographic debris. <words>108</words>
Yet Lark feared his magic was a weed, unruly and pointless, until beauty itself asked for maintenance. <words>125</words>
At eleven, a call arrived from the municipal library, complaining that archived star-maps had begun projecting anarchic constellations. <words>143</words>
Repairs were only permitted throughout library hours, a bureaucratic dictum that sounded like cosmic joke to Lark’s tired ears. <words>162</words>
He packed tools, pocketed the lunch tin, and set off through back-alley theater auditions that stitched the districts together. <words>181</words>
Jugglers tossed holographic skulls while directors screamed for tragedy, yet none questioned the druid slipping past their prop sheds. <words>200</words>
Every courtyard he crossed offered stray sparks of disorder, and he tasted in them the possibility to forge beauty from anarchy. <words>221</words>
Still, doubt lingered like static until a stray audition poster fluttered, spelling his name in dust and orbital glyphs. <words>240</words>
Taking it as omen, he inhaled, exhaled chlorophyll dreams, and let roots of resolve crease his palms. <words>257</words>
Inside the library’s planetarium annex, malfunctioning projectors sprayed meteors across reading tables, sending scholars ducking beneath floating indexes. <words>275</words>
Lark knelt, opened the dented lunch tin, and released fragrant mist that settled over wires like mossy calm. <words>293</words>
His fingers coaxed circuits, not by force but by reminding them of their earliest forest of copper roots. <words>311</words>
Star-maps reorganized, constellations realigning into symmetrical gardens, and silence blossomed among stacks as patrons watched in half-awed lethargic excitement. <words>330</words>
The head archivist, a woman crusted with microfiche dust, thanked him with a crisp voucher stamped ties of obligation fulfilled. <words>350</words>
Lark smiled, realizing obligations could sprout fruits as easily as shackles, provided someone believed weeds were simply gardens awaiting choreography. <words>370</words>
He wandered back to the shop before closing, the voucher tucked inside the lunch tin, its dent now glimmering like a deliberate constellation. <words>393</words>
Behind him, directors still auditioned ghosts, unaware their alley had been seeded with tiny luminescent spores that would script midnight blossoms. <words>414</words>
