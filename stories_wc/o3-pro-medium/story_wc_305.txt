Simeon pressed his palm against the mossy slab that sealed the umbral grotto above the clouds. [16]  
The air carried a vineyard hush, the muted resonance vines know when dawn still hesitates. [31]  
He had tended this hidden refuge for pilgrims of weary spirit since the age of fifteen. [47]  
That vow made him a committed caretaker, kindly decisive even when the winds screamed for abandonment. [63]  
Yet today his heart hammered, for his journey was no longer about tending others, but about himself. [80]  
Weeks earlier he had forgiven the unforgivable: the murderer who ended his sister's life in a drunken quarrel. [98]  
That act should have freed him, but instead it left a hollow he could not name. [114]  
So he climbed higher than ever, seeking the rumored Source of Contentment whispered by winter larks. [130]  
Tradition said the Source revealed itself only after a soul completed the cycle of rebirth without clinging to pain. [149]  
Simeon secretly feared he still clutched shards of resentment. [158]  
He entered the grotto, lantern dimmed to respect the silence that pooled like ink between stalactites. [174]  
A gentle chime greeted him, resonating from the antique hairpin he wore on a cord about his neck. [192]  
It had belonged to his sister, and its soft vibrato reminded him why forgiveness had mattered. [208]  
Yet the note also beckoned deeper, as though the pin itself navigated labyrinths of duskstone. [223]  
He followed, sandals brushing scalloped edges of limestone he himself had once promised to scallop smooth. [239]  
Promises felt lighter now; decisions came as swiftly as kind rain. [250]  
At the cavern's heart rose an ash tree, its crown piercing a broken skylight of clouded quartz. [267]  
Simeon had planted it years ago, believing roots could remember what minds forgot. [280]  
Whenever doubt gnawed, he climbed the branches to think better, letting altitude sharpen thought like whetstone. [296]  
He did so now, lantern looped to his belt, hairpin tapping his chest in rhythmic counsel. [312]  
Fog drifted through the quartz aperture, catching light and refracting faint halos around him. [326]  
He perched where trunk thinned into sky and closed his eyes. [337]  
Memories rose unbidden: his sister laughing, shards of glass, the crimson spill, the prisoner's ragged apology. [353]  
He inhaled until the pictures blurred, then exhaled them into the tumbling cloudbank below. [367]  
A thunderless rumble answered, and the tree shivered as if acknowledging release. [379]  
Within the bark, a seam opened, revealing a pool of water flat as silver glass. [394]  
Simeon peered, and in the reflection saw not his face but countless faces, each a life he had nurtured. [413]  
They flickered like lanterns in wind, extinguishing, then reigniting elsewhere, illustrating the cycle of rebirth with radiant clarity. [431]  
Contentment, he realized, was not a spring to be found but a river to be joined. [447]  
Joining required movement, and movement required letting go of the riverbank of identity. [460]  
He touched the hairpin to the water, gifting the last tangible echo of his sister to the flow. [478]  
Light burst upward in soft arcs, neither blinding nor loud, but tender as first grape skin split for wine. [497]  
The grotto answered with perfume of autumn vineyards, soothing and wordless. [508]  
For a heartbeat Simeon heard every pilgrim he had guided whisper the same serene note. [523]  
He felt neither above nor below the clouds, only within, and his lungs filled without urging. [539]  
When the light dimmed, the hairpin had dissolved, leaving a small scalloped indentation in the bark. [555]  
He climbed down, steps balanced, mind clear as rain-polished slate. [565]  
Outside, dawn finally committed, spilling gold across cloud tops like harvested wheat. [577]  
Simeon paused at the grotto mouth and listened; the vineyard hush remained but now hummed with quiet joy. [595]  
He started down the mountain, no longer searching, but ready to guide the next wanderer upward. [611]  
Contentment, at last, traveled with him, light enough to fit in a breath, vast enough to eclipse regret. [629]
