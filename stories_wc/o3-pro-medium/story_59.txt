I arrived at the abandoned echo chamber testing site just after dusk, guitar case knocking softly against my knee.<words>19</words>
Its circular corridors still smelled of ozone and applause, though no voice had sung there for twenty winters.<words>37</words>
I, a mournful troubadour exiled by my own refrains, accepted the emptiness like an expected chord.<words>53</words>
The mission was strangely predictable, as if fate had mailed me sheet music annotated with tomorrow's echoes.<words>70</words>
Pinned inside my coat pocket lay an embroidered collar I once tore from my brother's dog during our last argument.<words>90</words>
The collar's forgotten stitches were the map of guilt I hoped to demystify tonight.<words>104</words>
I tuned my guitar, and the strings shimmered like distant star trails guiding a shipwrecked mind toward old coordinates.<words>123</words>
By following star trails etched in those resonances, I trusted the chambers would answer questions the world refused.<words>141</words>
Each footstep produced a faint echo, but the reverberation ended abruptly, as if sound itself endured amid silent struggles.<words>160</words>
I recognized that hush; it was the same void that settled after my brother's song eclipsed mine at festivals.<words>179</words>
Confronting the past, I fastened the embroidered collar around my own neck, declaring myself both hound and hunter of memory.<words>199</words>
Then I played the forbidden progression, the one Mother said would summon the heartbeat of nothingness and silence every lie.<words>219</words>
Notes spiraled up, struck the curved concrete, and returned as luminous pulses that sketched a door across the darkness.<words>238</words>
Through that echo door stepped the memory of my brother, young and unharmed, wearing the coat I donated to flames.<words>258</words>
He did not accuse; instead he traced the collar with phantom fingers, whispering that every melody descends into forgiveness.<words>277</words>
Intimate detachment settled between us, a quiet treaty stitched from distance, grief, and an understanding only echoes articulate.<words>295</words>
I asked whether the nothingness truly had a heartbeat, or whether we invented it to mask our own faltering rhythms.<words>315</words>
He smiled with the strangely predictable certainty of dreams, then dissolved, leaving a single resonant thrum inside my chest.<words>334</words>
The chamber lights flickered, aligning like constellations, and I followed their star trails out, carrying the demystified silence within me.<words>354</words>
Outside, dawn glimmered, yet I heard only the pulse of vacancy, proof that discovering nothing can fill everything.<words>372</words>
I unclasped the embroidered collar and buried it beneath a thorn bush, sealing the past where roots remember better than men.<words>393</words>
As I walked away, each footfall echoed a lullaby, neither mournful nor triumphant, simply awake.<words>408</words>
