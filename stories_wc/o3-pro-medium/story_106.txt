<story>
Cal Morley, a sullen farmer from the rain-struck uplands, never expected destiny to surface beneath drowned towers. <words>17</words>
Yet the letter his grandmother left, stitched to a passed-down quilt, crackled with mismatched patches like coded constellations. <words>35</words>
Each patch hid a used postage stamp, canceled in distant eras, saturated by brine but still whispering smugglers' routes. <words>54</words>
Collecting stamps had been her private rebellion, her objective bias against borders, an eccentric cartography of erased boundaries. <words>72</words>
Cal, shackled to failed soil and mounting debts, read the water-blurred ledger sewn beside them: 'Find power where cities sink.' <words>92</words>
The directive sounded like borrowed valor, courage stolen from legends he had mocked between furrows and broken plow teeth. <words>111</words>
Still, zest surged through him during a moment of pure inspiration, fierce as unforecast thunder over his desiccated fields. <words>130</words>
He sold the last bale, bribed a diver, and descended inside a rusted elevator cage toward the forgotten underwater city power station. <words>152</words>
Phosphorescent algae smeared the cracked panorama windows, painting emerald ghosts over toppled arcades and collapsed amphitheaters on the ocean bed. <words>172</words>
Generators the size of granaries slept, but Cal traced quilt patches to a maintenance door emblazoned with the same stamps' silhouettes. <words>193</words>
Inside, a mural flaked across damp concrete, depicting continents dissolving into one another, rivers rerouted, flags unthreaded into common waves. <words>213</words>
Grandmother's lore was clear: energy here flowed not through wires but through memories willing to forget where they began. <words>232</words>
Cal pressed each stamp against a corroded console, aligning perforations with pitted circuits as if sealing epistolary kisses to the abyss. <words>253</words>
With the last adhesive sigh, turbines coughed awake, drawing thermal currents, erasing boundaries between saltwater and stalled electrons. <words>271</words>
Lights flickered across boulevards outside, illuminating coral-claimed statues; the city inhaled after decades of suffocating myth. <words>287</words>
The diver radioed panic, claiming pressure gauges danced objectively biased numbers no equation could justify, begging retreat. <words>304</words>
But Cal felt the dead end of land-bound life crumble; borrowed valor matured into his own pulse. <words>321</words>
He rerouted the station's restored power up collapsed shafts, promising to electrify parched farms, orphan lighthouses, and villages that maps forgot. <words>342</words>
Silt quivered as streetlamps bloomed, and in that glow he saw boundaries, national, personal, maritime, bleach into mere ripples. <words>361</words>
The stamps peeled off, drifting like spent petals, duty done, while the quilt absorbed new patterns of current and courage. <words>381</words>
Cal climbed back toward daylight, no longer a sullen farmer but a conduit, carrying the city's humming heart in calloused hands. <words>402</words>
Behind him, turbines thrummed a promise that every boundary could be erased if someone dared stitch mismatched worlds together. <words>421</words>
