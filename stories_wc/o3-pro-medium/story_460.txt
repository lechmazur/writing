Needles of ochre rain hissed through the broken canopy like whispered curses from the dead cities.<words>16</words>
Beneath that prickling downpour trudged Lira, unassuming monarch of nothing but her own stubborn pulse.<words>31</words>
The crown she once hid had rusted away, yet the weight still pressed gently behind her temples.<words>48</words>
She carried a dented tin box of mismatched puzzle pieces, relics scavenged from the skeletal toy aisles.<words>65</words>
Every shard of cardboard held storm stains, but she believed they might assemble tomorrow's missing scripture.<words>81</words>
Her companion, the lethargically energetic crow named Patch, flapped in languid spirals then darted like fury.<words>97</words>
Patch was messenger, jester, and occasionally map, reading corroded signage the way poets taste thunder.<words>112</words>
Lira could perceive the world via the texture of a feather clutched between two fingers.<words>127</words>
Smooth meant shelter nearby; barbed meant toxins pooled; broken shafts whispered unseen footsteps following, hungry for story.<words>144</words>
Today the feather rasped like sand, telling her choice itself smoldered ahead, small yet capable of wildfire.<words>161</words>
She called that omen the ember of choice, and it glowed behind her sternum, insistent.<words>176</words>
If tended, it could reignite minds; if ignored, it would sputter into ash like everything else.<words>192</words>
So Lira sought a cradle for wisdom in her rough, calloused hands, because hands remember warmth.<words>208</words>
The acid rain forest parted around a collapsed observatory whose silver dome lay half dissolved, reflecting sickly rainbows.<words>226</words>
Inside, books had fused into slag, yet the planetarium's mechanical star wheel still clicked, stubbornly tracing ruins.<words>243</words>
She emptied the puzzle pieces among those brass constellations, hoping fragments might converse across their broken languages.<words>260</words>
Patch perched atop Orion's tarnished belt and cawed like a cracked bell tower striking forgotten midnight.<words>276</words>
At the crow's cry, gears awoke, spinning star patterns across the scattered cardboard islands on the floor.<words>293</words>
Edges that never belonged together suddenly aligned beneath artificial meteors, as though the cosmos itself offered blueprints.<words>310</words>
Lira felt the feather in her pocket soften, its barbs knitting smooth, confirming the direction of becoming.<words>327</words>
She knelt, lethargically energetic—body weary, spirit surging—and fitted the final moonlit fragment into place.<words>341</words>
The assembled picture was not a toy scene but a diagram detailing seeds engineered to cleanse acid.<words>358</words>
Pressing the cardboard blueprint against her chest, she perceived roots drinking rain, turning poison into tender moss.<words>375</words>
The ember of choice blazed, and for the first time since collapse, the air smelled almost green.<words>392</words>
Patch ruffled his feathers, satisfied, while distant thunder applauded their humble coronation of possibility.<words>406</words>
Unseen crowds of tomorrow bowed before the unassuming monarch who had chosen to gather scattered wonder and plant it in darkness.<words>427</words>
