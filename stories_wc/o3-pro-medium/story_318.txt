Shivering lanterns hung above the memory crystal library, casting prismatic shadows that looked celebratory yet anxious.<words>16</words>
Inside, Aloysius Quill, an aloof inventor, kept his distance from the hushed scholars and their glittering recollections.<words>33</words>
He cradled a plain wooden spoon as though it were a fragile conduit rather than an ordinary utensil.<words>51</words>
For weeks, he had been halfheartedly committed to decoding the spoon's grain, convinced mnemonic sap seeped between its rings.<words>70</words>
Today, a gloomily cheerful resolve tingled through him like sour candy melting over a bruise.<words>85</words>
He meant to nourish a final stand with raw determination, even if no one else believed an eating tool could save memories.<words>107</words>
At the library's heart, crystalline shelves spiraled like frozen hurricanes, each shard storing lifetimes etched in shimmering runes.<words>125</words>
However, many archives lacked warmth, the stories clinical, impossible to humanize despite their accuracy.<words>139</words>
That sterility birthed Quill's mission: recover forgotten lullabies and translate them so emotions might breathe again inside the glass.<words>158</words>
He touched spoon to a glowing blue crystal labeled 'Storm-Born Infancy' and murmured, 'Wood remembers sap, sap remembers wind.'<words>177</words>
The library lights dimmed, then a lilting ancient lullaby wafted out, first in sparks, then in audible syllables that soothed the air.<words>199</words>
Children's laughter materialized as floating motes, narrating storms as gentle adventures aboard cloud-cradles, and scholars gasped at the sudden intimacy.<words>219</words>
Witnessing their wonder, Quill felt his old apathy crack, and renewed pledges surged through veins he once believed purely mechanical.<words>239</words>
Yet applause threatened distraction, blurring the fragile song, because curiosity without devotion can fracture memory like careless hands drop crystal.<words>259</words>
So the aloof inventor raised the spoon like a baton and called for silence, his voice polite but ironclad.<words>278</words>
He reminded them that the lullaby was still translating, still stitching humanity into brittle recollections, and still judging their worthiness.<words>298</words>
Inside the architecture of the mind, time puddled, allowing Quill to tease out each verse, tasting its salt, testing its sorrow.<words>319</words>
He noticed the lullaby's final measure lacked closure, a gap where courage should resonate, so he poured his own heartbeat into the tune.<words>342</words>
Memories shimmered brighter, reflecting not only storms but the will to survive them, and the scholars sensed approaching catastrophe beyond the library walls.<words>365</words>
They begged Quill to weaponize the song, yet he recalled legends of songs turned swords and worlds ruined by sharp refrains.<words>386</words>
Instead he invited them to share custody, each guardian humming a stanza so the melody stayed round, never pointed, forever communal.<words>407</words>
Their voices quavered but grew, halfhope and halffear braiding into gloomy cheerfulness that filled rafters and reinforced resolve.<words>425</words>
When the final chord settled, crystals glowed warm as hearths, and every present mind felt nourished for the looming stand outside.<words>446</words>
Quill slipped the plain wooden spoon into his coat and walked away, aloof again, yet secretly smiling at his restored allegiance to wonder.<words>469</words>
