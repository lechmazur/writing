I, the small-town gossip columnist once confined to whispers, was now sealed inside an amber prison that glowed like fossilized dusk. <words>21</words>
The warden thought isolation would silence my columns, yet solitude only sharpened my ink and abandoned caution fueled every phrase. <words>41</words>
My sole companion was a lonely stuffed toy ear, torn from some forgotten plush rabbit the day the riots began. <words>61</words>
I kept it propped beside the stove where prison gruel simmered, because even ruins of comfort can listen when nobody else will. <words>83</words>
Throughout cooking, I executed my gentle rebellion by unraveling ephemeral news bulletins from the future, each line appearing in steam above the pot. <words>106</words>
The bulletins spoke of sidewalks that would crack unless neighbors shared spices, of friendships that would deteriorate unless someone seasoned them with truth. <words>129</words>
I was dutifully defiant, jotting these vaporous headlines on scraps of onion skin, then folding the notes into pastry shells smuggled to the cafeteria. <words>153</words>
Inmates bit through crust, tasted salt and prophecy, and passed whisper-recipes to guards who carried them home like contraband hope. <words>173</words>
Soon the town beyond the walls replaced evening sirens with clattering pans, neighbors trading thyme for stories instead of insults for silence. <words>195</words>
I reported every aromatic truce in my next column, scratching headlines on the inside of my cell door where varnish peeled like burnt sugar. <words>219</words>
The warden read the door, frowned, but left it, as if erasing sweetness would stain him with the bitterness he heard rumored outside. <words>242</words>
Nightly, while onions hissed, the lonely stuffed toy ear absorbed sizzling forecasts, its threadbare cup holding futures my own ears could scarcely contain. <words>265</words>
The ear reminded me that listening is half a meal, and I felt compelled to mend a fractured community before more plates broke. <words>288</words>
So I stirred broth with my pen, letting ink spiral into soup, flavoring each ladle with verbs that urged doors to open like ovens. <words>312</words>
Bars began to glow softer, their fossil dusk warming into dawn, as if the amber prison itself realized it could be recast into windowpanes. <words>336</words>
When parole finally arrived, it felt redundant; the walls had already crumbled in hearts, and I merely walked through their remembered outlines. <words>358</words>
I left the lonely stuffed toy ear on the stovetop altar, certain new inmates would need its silence the way flour needs water. <words>381</words>
Outside, I resumed my column at the town diner, distributing future bulletins folded inside recipes, still dutifully defiant, still cooking alliances that refused to deteriorate. <words>406</words>
