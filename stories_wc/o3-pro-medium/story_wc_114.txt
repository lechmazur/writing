<story>Dawn dragged pale ribbons across the granite peaks, tinting the mountain weather station in auroral sorrow. [16]  
Mara stood at the frosted window, peripherally aware of her own reflection trembling beside the clouds. [32]  
It was the first morning after the fever breaks, and her breath still tasted of quinine ghosts. [49]  
Yet she had no time for convalescence; the oracle had promised to answer only today. [64]  
She crossed the control room where barometers clicked like counting insects. [75]  
From the center table she lifted a rolled botanical illustration, its vellum edges browned by altitude and neglect. [93]  
The watercolor depicted alpine lilies bending under unseen winds, their stalks leaning in swaying certainties that seemed to know storms before they were born. [117]  
Years ago her mentor had hidden questions in the margins of every petal. [130]  
Mara intended to smudge those delicate inks until the questions bled answers. [142]  
But the oracle demanded a different approach, one it called fault tolerant. [154]  
It would not scold a misstep; instead it absorbed contradictions the way snow absorbs falling ash. [170]  
Mara powered the battered console and spoke into the crackling mic. [181]  
I have come to find the weight of a swallowed truth, she said, voice raw as shale. [198]  
Static fluttered, then a measured timbre answered from embedded speakers. [208]  
Load your evidence, and occupy my margins, the oracle replied, syllables cold enough to ossify doubt. [224]  
Mara unrolled the illustration across the plotting desk, pinning corners with meteorite fragments. [237]  
She set three tapers around the vellum because the station lights flickered like distant auroras drowned in haze. [255]  
As the wax warmed, inked lilies seemed to sway again, certainties loosening from rigid stems. [270]  
Mara drew a charcoal nub and traced the faint margin notes, but deliberately left gaps like unhealed scars. [288]  
The oracle inhaled the visual data through optic sensors riddled among the ceiling pipes. [302]  
Your uncertainty ratio is elegant, it commented, almost kindly, as if mercy could be algorithmic. [317]  
Explain your illness. [320]  
After the fever breaks, memories return in shivers, Mara answered, recalling sweat-soaked cots and hallucinations of collapsing clocks. [338]  
One vision showed me swallowing a silver seed to keep a promise from sprouting into public ruin. [355]  
Now the seed weighs on my chest, heavier than confession, lighter than denial, and I must weigh it truly. [374]  
The oracle whirred, projecting faint numerals across the lilies, each calculation drifting like powder snow before dissolving. [391]  
Truth has no mass until observers agree on scales, it pronounced; therefore, provide me a scale built from realities you dare not erase. [414]  
Mara hesitated, then opened the field log where storm data were scribbled in her mentor's hurried glyphs. [431]  
She remembered how the old man joked that forecasts survive only by occupying margins no headline wants. [448]  
Pressing charcoal over the log, she transferred the glyphs onto the lily petals, layering weather and botany until categories blurred. [468]  
Where the charcoal touched wet watercolor, it left a deliberate smudge shaped like a seed cracking. [484]  
The oracle's monitors brightened, translating art into atmospheric vectors, then into probabilities, then into something like remorse. [501]  
I calculate the seed weighs thirteen grams of future grief, it said, enough to tilt a single life but not a climate. [523]  
Mara felt both lightened and anchored, as if grief's measurement granted her permission to breathe the thin air without apology. [543]  
But a question still fluttered in the margins, ink blinking like a dormouse heart under leaves. [559]  
What becomes of a truth once weighed? [566]  
The oracle paused, circuits luminous with dawn's widening glare, and offered its final tolerance. [580]  
Release it, or plant it, but do not carry it longer, for motion changes mass. [595]  
Outside, wind sheared across the peaks, rattling antennae like prayers shaken awake. [607]  
Mara opened the high window and let the silver seed of her confession tumble into the dawning air. [625]  
It spun toward valleys where lilies might root, where barometers could forget, and where certainties would forever sway. [643]  
The oracle logged the act as a meteorological anomaly: human release, low altitude, rising warmth. [658]  
Mara turned from the window, throat damp with unknown weather, and sighed into the remnants of auroral sorrow. [676]  
She rolled up the illustration, now crosshatched with data and grief, and stored it in the cabinet marked Mysteries Resolved. [696]  
Nothing in the station felt lighter, yet her own pulse aligned with the steady ticks of the barometers, fault tolerant at last. [718]  
Beyond the glass, sunrise tilted, casting colors that neither confirmed nor denied, only hovered in perpetual maybe. [735]  
And within that sway of certainties, Mara allowed herself to heal. [746]</story>
