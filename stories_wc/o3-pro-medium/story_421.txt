I arrived at the mountain village's flower pressing workshop exactly in the hush after a coin toss decided fate.<words>19</words>
The apprentices still hovered, breathless, around the spinning copper penny, as though noise might fracture possibility.<words>35</words>
I, a nomadic dreamer whose journeys followed the migrating constellations, had come under ferociously polite invitation.<words>51</words>
Master Petalus, bowing with razorback courtesy, whispered of a secret mission entrusted to a select group.<words>67</words>
He led me past racks of pansies flattened like vibrant regrets and locked the cedar door behind us.<words>85</words>
Only then did he reveal the object's outline beneath a velvet shroud: a battered mariner's wheel.<words>101</words>
Its spokes were braided with seaweed, yet orchids sprouted between them, as if tides had learned botany.<words>118</words>
The coin had named me helmsman of this paradox.<words>127</words>
My role was to steer existence toward equilibrium, navigating unseen currents of human longing and forest sighs.<words>144</words>
Yet masked intentions corroded the room like hidden rust.<words>153</words>
Petalus wanted harmony with nature, but also permanence, an immortality pressed like petals against unyielding glass.<words>169</words>
The wheel, he confessed, could still the seasons if guided into the earth's magnetic heart.<words>184</words>
In anguished joy he begged me to intervene, to freeze bloom and decay in perfect symmetrical truce.<words>201</words>
His ferociously polite smile quivered like a wolf wearing lace.<words>211</words>
I sensed the peril: without winter's hush, spring's music would deafen, and gardens would drown in themselves.<words>228</words>
So I spun the wheel gently, aligning the orchid spoke with the coin's portrait of Liberty.<words>244</words>
Pollen flickered off like golden static, and the workshop walls widened into vistas of migrating constellations I knew.<words>262</words>
There, valleys bowed beneath balanced weather: rivers slowed for nesting fish, storms sang but never struck, petals aged gracefully.<words>281</words>
I saw also futures where Petalus's desire triumphed, and flowers petrified into eternal, scentless murals.<words>296</words>
Masked intentions peeled back then, raw and luminous, revealing his dread of death rather than love of life.<words>314</words>
I let the vision settle like dust and chose the narrower path of living rhythm over frozen symmetry.<words>332</words>
With a mariner's certitude I turned the wheel once more, this time toward ebb instead of stasis.<words>349</words>
Orchids folded into seeds, seaweed loosened, and somewhere distant a glacier exhaled long-held tears.<words>363</words>
Petalus collapsed among the pansy racks, weeping at beauty he could never imprison yet still adored.<words>379</words>
I knelt, ferociously polite even in refusal, and pressed a single wild daisy into his trembling palm.<words>396</words>
Let it live, I urged, and let yourself drift with seasons as sailors drift with shifting stars.<words>413</words>
In the quiet that followed, the coin finally stopped spinning, tail-side up, signaling chance had surrendered to choice.<words>431</words>
I slung the wheel across my back, its petals shedding into the wind like notes of unfinished songs.<words>449</words>
My nomadic dreaming resumed, anguished with memory, joyous with the road, steering toward the ever-blooming horizon.<words>465</words>
