The abandoned repair bay still hummed with phantom vibrations when the clandestine watchman unlatched the side door. <words>17</words>
He arrived moments after the cast had taken their final bow on stage, the applause fading into echoing dust. <words>36</words>
Tonight's pageant had only been camouflage for his truer performance. <words>46</words>
Optimally observant and analytically free, he stalked shadows that refused to stay still. <words>59</words>
His gloved hand tightened around a battered briefcase, its surface speckled with braille-like bumps that guarded instructions. <words>76</words>
Through those bumps he would acknowledge unseen allies and ignite an impossible continuation. <words>89</words>
The cracked ceiling panels rattled as a low-altitude airship drifted above, jettisoning sparks like impatient stars. <words>105</words>
Somewhere within its gondola, the retired captain's goggles waited, fogged by decades of silence. <words>119</words>
The watchman needed those lenses because legend swore they refracted time's terminal curve and bent endings into thresholds. <words>137</words>
He advanced, boot soles crunching through rivet shavings and wilted playbills from forgotten matinees. <words>151</words>
Wilderness wisdom guided each step, though the nearest tree stood miles away. <words>163</words>
He had learned long ago that forests teach discipline, not geography. <words>174</words>
Discipline let him map predators in any habitat, metal or moss. <words>185</words>
A rusted catwalk sagged under his weight, singing a warning to lurking stagehands turned scavengers. <words>200</words>
He crouched and tapped the briefcase, sending a coded ripple that told the scavengers their curtain had fallen. <words>218</words>
Silence answered; they respected the authority of endings even while he conspired to revoke them. <words>233</words>
Past a luminous oil puddle he spotted the goggles dangling from a hook beside a gutted autogyro engine. <words>251</words>
They gleamed like insect eyes, reflecting futures not yet scheduled. <words>261</words>
He lifted them carefully, and the world warped into prismatic corridors where finality flinched. <words>275</words>
In that shimmer he saw himself returning tonight, again and again, always moments after applause, always earlier than before. <words>294</words>
To test the vision, he fastened the goggles and marched back to the bay's entrance, rewinding footsteps with stubborn certainty. <words>314</words>
The air rippled, scenery peeling backward like damp wallpaper, until the catwalk straightened and the rivet shavings flew upward. <words>333</words>
He realized the law he meant to defy was not death, but the quiet decree that stories must finish. <words>352</words>
By refusing the last page, he could stretch wonder into a living prickle that never dulled. <words>368</words>
Yet wilderness wisdom also warned that infinite loops grow thorns, and thorns crave blood. <words>382</words>
So he slid the goggles into the briefcase, feeling each braille-like bump rearrange itself to a new directive. <words>400</words>
If endings could be postponed, they could also be chosen, and choice, he thought, was sweeter than infinity. <words>418</words>
He stepped outside, acknowledging the dawn that waited to debut, and allowed the bay's door to finally close. <words>436</words>
Behind him, applause began anew, but this time it belonged to the future he had chosen to watch. <words>454</words>
