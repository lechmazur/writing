Lenore Stills, a professional cuddler of legendary discretion, inhaled metallic dusk inside the abandoned spaceport hangar. <words>16</words>
Awards banners dangled like dormant nebulae, and the audience murmurs were fading toward the ceremonial hush before an acceptance speech begins. <words>37</words>
Amid the hush, Lenore’s pocket warmed around the phantom train ticket punch she never surrendered since childhood. <words>54</words>
The punch’s dial still clicked for tickets no conductor could see, a relic of circuitry, rumor, and decay. <words>72</words>
Its strangely comforting rasp reminded her of the unspoken rules governing touch, distance, and hearts afraid of themselves. <words>90</words>
Lenore was here to receive the Nebular Compassion Laureate, yet she dreaded the sea of skeptical dignitaries. <words>107</words>
Many still believed professional cuddling was sophistry, a velvet con, unworthy of galactic laurels. <words>121</words>
Their prejudice echoed her father’s old warning that closeness diluted dignity. <words>132</words>
She had vowed tonight to overcome that deep-seated prejudice—hers and theirs—without uttering a single defensive word. <words>148</words>
Beside the dais, a temporary farmer's market had been arranged to showcase agritech donors, its stalls fragrant with lunar basil. <words>168</words>
Lenore wandered there, hiding nerves beneath a study of squash patterns and comet-plum jams. <words>182</words>
A stooped vendor offered her a tasting spoon, and the chance encounter at the farmer's market shifted everything. <words>200</words>
His hands trembled from isolation syndrome; he flinched when her fingers brushed his palm in thanks. <words>216</words>
Instinctively, she opened her arms, inviting contact according to the guild’s unusually usual protocol—familiar, gentle, never forced. <words>233</words>
The vendor hesitated, then stepped forward, letting sorrow leak, letting wonder settle, as if decades cracked in one embrace. <words>252</words>
Around them, disgruntled delegates witnessed shoulders straighten, eyes brighten, prejudices decay like old posters curling off steel. <words>269</words>
Someone whispered, 'Maybe the cuddler is medicine,' and silence spread wider than any marketing slogan. <words>284</words>
At that moment, the event coordinator signaled her: the dais awaited, the hush complete, anticipation antique yet electric. <words>302</words>
Lenore walked back, carrying the vendor’s lingering warmth like a ceremonial torch forged from skin instead of flame. <words>320</words>
Before stepping onstage, she pressed the phantom train ticket punch against the microphone, letting it click once—bright, ghostly. <words>338</words>
The click reverberated through speakers like a forgotten timetable arriving, reminding everyone that journeys begin with permission to be held. <words>358</words>
Then she embraced the podium itself, wooden and cold, until the lights felt body-warm and the hall exhaled. <words>376</words>
Words finally flowed, not as defense but as invitation, every syllable carrying the vendor’s tremor and newfound ease. <words>394</words>
Under ancient novelty’s spell, the audience accepted, and prejudice departed like a phantom train nobody wished to ride again. <words>413</words>
