The hush of a lonely streetlamp flickering out draped midnight velvet over the hedge maze behind the abbey.<words>18</words>
Within its spiraling green corridors lay a mystic orchard garden whose ripe moonsilver pears glowed like bottled sighs.<words>36</words>
Sir Brannon, the cleverly naive yet stubbornly hopeful knight, tiptoed through dew, armor cushioned beneath burlap to mute clinks.<words>55</words>
He had journeyed here to sabotage the Machine that Cycles Regrets, a brass monolith rumored to drink despair.<words>73</words>
If he neutralized it, he believed, forgotten joys would unspool across kingdoms like sunrise over frostbitten roofs.<words>90</words>
Yet the monolith accepted no sword, shield, or prayer; legend insisted only cryptic frequencies might lull its grinders.<words>108</words>
So Brannon carried a seemingly worthless stray jigsaw edge, scavenged from a pauper’s attic, whose serrated cardboard hummed unheard.<words>127</words>
Old hospice children had told him the piece once completed a cosmic puzzle mapping regret’s melody, then was lost.<words>146</words>
Reclaiming the lost, Brannon felt, was his secret calling, even if he barely understood what reclamation meant.<words>163</words>
He arrived at the garden’s heart, where pears swung like censers above a circular dais etched with sorrowful runes.<words>182</words>
There, the Machine towered, gears gnashing, exhaling an odor of burnt letters and nursery lullabies forgotten by adults.<words>200</words>
The knight’s heart throbbed with agonizing bliss, for each metallic sigh mirrored his own buried failings now resurfacing as hope.<words>220</words>
He studied the grinding rhythm, sensing silent vacancies between clacks, intervals that the jigsaw edge vibrated in sympathy.<words>238</words>
Remembering a minstrel’s advice that naivete can hear what knowledge ignores, he closed his eyes and matched breath to hum.<words>258</words>
Gradually his lungs pumped at cryptic frequencies, syncing pulse, sorrow, and orchard wind into one trembling continuum the Machine noticed.<words>278</words>
Its gears staggered, as though the newly tuned air insinuated a forgotten lullaby that lulled teeth of brass.<words>296</words>
Seizing the pause, Brannon pressed the stray jigsaw edge into the whirring hub where unsolved shapes demanded their missing silhouette.<words>316</words>
Cardboard met metal, and an almost tender shriek rippled outward, scattering pears, scattering memories, scattering lamplight beyond the maze.<words>335</words>
Regret seemed to freeze, then unravel, threads reversing through centuries until laughter long extinct danced again among the trees.<words>354</words>
But joy bit back, overwhelming Brannon with images of paths never taken, an ecstasy so raw it seared conscience.<words>373</words>
In that blaze he remained cleverly naive, trusting the hurt, knowing bliss without ache would be hollow as unplayed notes.<words>393</words>
The Machine shuddered, neutralized, its regrets dissolved into orchards of possibility now blooming within every survivor’s chest.<words>410</words>
Brannon opened his eyes to see the streetlamp beyond the hedge rekindle, no longer flickering, but steady as dawn.<words>429</words>
He pocketed the now silent puzzle edge, certain it would wander again when another heart misplaced its final piece.<words>448</words>
Hope, reclaimed and restless, guided the knight out of the maze, humming a tune that even darkness dared remember.<words>467</words>
