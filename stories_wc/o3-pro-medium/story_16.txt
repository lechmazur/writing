In the hush after the final guest leaves the wedding, Orrin Foltz lingers beside the vacant buffet, notebook ready. <words>19</words>
He is a freelancer who freelances everything, from cataloguing ballroom gossip to repairing dirigible pistons, but tonight his commission is stranger. <words>40</words>
The bride's grandmother hired him to chronicle elder wisdom before memory slips anchor and drifts into untold fog. <words>58</words>
Following her whispered map, Orrin descends a brass ladder to the steampunk airship engine room humming beneath the ballroom floor. <words>78</words>
Copper gears spin like wedding band reflections, and steam sighs through valves in scattered harmony with the distant string quartet packing up. <words>100</words>
At the chamber's center waits an antique automaton recorder, its single jeweled eye an amber ring glowing with stored voices. <words>120</words>
Grandmother believes the machine holds her family's last good intention, captured decades ago when airships still charted new continents. <words>139</words>
Yet she fears her feuding heirs will erase the recording to outwit each other over the estate. <words>156</words>
Orrin's task is to retrieve and transcribe the wisdom before sunrise, then hide the cylinder where greed cannot reach. <words>175</words>
He studies the machine's clockwork heart, counting rotations with the rhythm of waves against a cliff, letting chaos form patterns. <words>195</words>
An inadvertently profound thought dawns: wisdom is simply machinery tuned to compassion instead of efficiency. <words>210</words>
He adjusts one gear by a hair's breadth, and the recorder exhales a thin ribbon of magnetic tape like a sigh of relief. <words>233</words>
A hush deeper than the ballroom's settles as a frail voice begins recounting cures for loneliness learned over ninety turbulent years. <words>254</words>
While the machine speaks, metallic footsteps echo above; the heirs, drunk on champagne and entitlement, are searching. <words>271</words>
Orrin must outwit them without confrontation, because conflict bruises stories and he is paid to preserve, not to fight. <words>290</words>
He lowers the engine room pressure, coaxing extra hiss so every step sounds everywhere, a misleading symphony of steam. <words>309</words>
The heirs scatter toward phantom noises, their curses mingling with violin cases thumping upstairs, and Orrin smiles at the choreography. <words>329</words>
He finishes transcribing just as boilers flicker, rolls the tape around the amber ring, and seals it inside his hollow pen. <words>350</words>
To the heirs he will hand a politely blank cylinder, explaining that the past sometimes chooses silence, an answer both true and deceptive. <words>373</words>
Later, aboard a dawn tram, Orrin will upload the recording to the communal aether, fulfilling the grandmother's final request and his own roaming creed. <words>397</words>
He keeps no souvenirs, yet the inadvertently profound cadence of that frail voice will pulse within him, the last good intention kept alive. <words>420</words>
Outside the tram window, city spires glint like untouched cake knives, and he hears waves crashing far below cliffs no map records. <words>442</words>
Their rhythm reminds him that freelancing everything means belonging nowhere, but carrying pieces of everywhere until they assemble a scattered harmony. <words>463</words>
