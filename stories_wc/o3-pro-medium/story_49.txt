The lukewarm mage Saffron Grey leaned against a porthole of the lunar base, his temper neither hot with zeal nor cold with apathy, basking instead in charred serenity. <words>28</words>
Outside, jagged towers of regolith shimmered under Earthlight, yet his attention rested on the torn doormat corner he kept folded like a talisman in his pocket. <words>54</words>
That scrap was the last relic of Old Theatres back on drowned Manila, and he found himself clinging to echoes of applause that once defined his magic. <words>81</words>
He was a loyally peculiar friend to memory, admitting no new affection unless it harmonized with the ghost chords of that lost audience. <words>104</words>
Tonight, in the hush before someone opens a private journal stored in the compound archives, Saffron rehearsed a showdown that could rewrite his gentle middling flame. <words>130</words>
The journal belonged to Commander Rhea, whose secret fears about evacuating the base threatened the collective dream to paint a future free from fear. <words>154</words>
If her dread surfaced, the colonists would scatter, budgets would dry, and the Moon would return to silence more absolute than space. <words>176</words>
Saffron therefore prepared a clash not of fists but of visions, determined to smother dread with wonder. <words>193</words>
He would conduct the duel via ephemeral silhouettes cast by swirling stage fog vented from the air scrubbers during maintenance. <words>213</words>
The plan was simple: manifest Rheaâ€™s nightmare as a looming shadow, then cut it in half with a beam of muted starlight, proving the fragility of fear. <words>240</words>
As ventilation rumblers paused, he stepped into the amphitheater dome, scattering salt to anchor the spell, the torn doormat corner fluttering like a burnt pennant. <words>265</words>
Stage fog coiled upward, and silhouettes unfolded -- miners coughing crimson dust, children adrift in faulty hatches -- every echo Rhea had scribbled in trembling graphite. <words>291</words>
The phantoms lunged, and in reflex her own subconscious entered the scene, a translucent woman armored in annotation margins who met the shadows in mid air clash. <words>318</words>
Saffron poured his tempered heat into the woman, and she cleaved the nightmare open, releasing sparks that sketched gardens, greenhouses, libraries, and children laughing under silver sunrise. <words>345</words>
When the fog settled, Rhea, standing unseen behind the dome glass, pressed her unopened journal to her chest, tears reflecting newborn hope, while the lukewarm mage simply pocketed the relic and exhaled gentle smoke. <words>379</words>
He felt no triumph, only a steady ember of responsibility, as if the Moon itself had entrusted him to keep its fragile first dreams from freezing. <words>405</words>
