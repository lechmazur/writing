The endless corn maze stretched across a haunted plain, rustling like restless bones beneath an unthinking, pre-sentient sky. <words>18</words>
Here wandered Ser Hadrian, a listless noble whose boots dragged uncertainty into furrows older than language. <words>34</words>
He traveled not to escape duty but to discover the power of intention whispered by unripe stars. <words>51</words>
His only adornment was a faded scarf, its once-vibrant threads dulled like forgotten coronations. <words>65</words>
Even the ghosts of wheat seemed brighter than his hereditary ennui. <words>76</words>
Then an unexpected invitation to a spontaneous event fluttered from the maze on papery husk, stamped with moonlight ink. <words>95</words>
It requested a rendezvous at the kernel-heart where stalks curved into an impossible amphitheater. <words>109</words>
Hadrian, naively sophisticated, assumed etiquette required acceptance, though no courier remained to judge him. <words>123</words>
He followed murmured directions, each turn accompanied by a crow's ironic awe, as though amused by formality. <words>140</words>
At the amphitheater, cornstalks parted to reveal a fireless glow and three figures woven entirely of shadow-silk. <words>157</words>
They bowed with exaggerated grace, their silhouettes flickering like candle etiquette manuals passed down to no one. <words>174</words>
Shared laughter rose between them, fragile yet echoing louder than any articulated word this epoch could muster. <words>191</words>
The sound startled maize spirits, who trembled but dared not evolve into sentience before the punchline finished. <words>208</words>
Hadrian offered his faded scarf as tribute, wondering if intention required tangible sacrifice. <words>221</words>
The shadow trio twined the cloth among themselves, each thread glowing with possibilities unchosen by civilized eras. <words>238</words>
From the braided loops erupted images of futures where cornstalks penned sonnets and crowns apologised for gravity. <words>255</words>
Hadrian felt purpose flutter like moth wings, sudden yet delicate, inside the stale chambers of lineage. <words>271</words>
He asked, in tones polished by court but dulled by boredom, whether thought alone could tilt whole horizons. <words>289</words>
The shadows replied through moving absence, shaping the maze walls into letters spelling yes and maybe simultaneously. <words>306</words>
Ironic awe pulsed through Hadrian; never had uncertainty sounded so affirmative. <words>317</words>
They invited him to plant an intention like a seed, promising the plain would remember before memory existed. <words>335</words>
Kneeling, he pressed two fingers into soil, letting yearning pour, uncomplicated, naively sophisticated in its earnest arch. <words>352</words>
Around him the stalks rearranged, scripting silent runes, while primordial winds chuckled at the aristocrat discovering humility. <words>369</words>
Shared laughter returned, not his alone now, but belonging to every grain that might one cycle awaken. <words>386</words>
The invitation, satisfied, dissolved, and the shadow figures folded into dusk, carrying the scarf toward nascent millennia. <words>403</words>
Ser Hadrian stood upright, maze dimming, and felt the haunted plain wait politely for its first thinker. <words>420</words>
He realized intention did not need an audience, only space, and the cosmos, ironically, had endless corridors. <words>437</words>
With listlessness evaporated, he smiled into the cornstalk dusk, awaiting nothing yet prepared for everything. <words>452</words>
Somewhere far ahead in time, his small rendezvous would bloom into civilization, forever colored by that exquisite awe. <words>470</words>
