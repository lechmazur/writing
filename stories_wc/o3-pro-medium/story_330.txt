Silver motes drifted like rebellious prayers inside the zero-gravity dance hall, swirling between pillars of cracked marble and stuttering neon. <words>20</words>
Amid the floating debris hung Sir Corbin, once a celebrated champion, now a dejected knight clutching only memory and regret. <words>40</words>
His gauntleted fingers toyed with a jagged trident prong from a sunken realm, its metal whispering brine-soaked secrets into his palm. <words>61</words>
Each secret gnawed at him like unfinished oaths, promising deepening horizons beyond the collapsed empire he once served. <words>79</words>
Yet those horizons seemed mockingly distant, because all motion here was normally abnormal, danced by physics that forgot direction. <words>98</words>
Corbin drifted in slow spirals, waiting for the instant when an old watchtower clock, salvaged as decor, would strike an unexpected hour. <words>120</words>
That clang, rumored to bend time, served as the only doorbell to forces willing to quicken a dying purpose. <words>139</words>
He had traced their pulses through forgotten paths stitched between ruined cathedrals and comet-scarred citadels, following rumors of vows older than language. <words>161</words>
Now, suspended among wobbling chandeliers and weightless masqueraders, he rehearsed the phrase he must finally voice, though it had never touched air. <words>183</words>
I pledge the rise of drowned kings, he mouthed without sound, and the prong throbbed like a heart hearing its own prophecy. <words>205</words>
Suddenly the ancient clock’s hands convulsed, slipping from midnight to thirteen with a metallic gasp that rattled bones and beams alike. <words>226</words>
The dance hall inverted, floor becoming ceiling, music reversing into silences shaped like bells, and gravity considered returning but changed its mind. <words>248</words>
In that sacred disorder, Corbin felt a corridor rip open, paved with shards of tide-glass pointing toward a moonlit abyss. <words>268</words>
He gripped the trident fragment, its edges singing, and propelled himself through the breach before the next heartbeat could reconsider courage. <words>289</words>
Outside lay a void corridor where constellations formed murals of battles forgotten even by ghosts, and every step he took echoed backwards. <words>311</words>
The horizon ahead kept deepening, unfolding like nested cathedral doors, each revealing vaster doubts and brighter ferocities. <words>328</words>
Corbin’s pace quickened, for the vow inside his chest had found resonance in the corridor’s breathing walls and now insisted on incarnation. <words>350</words>
At the corridor’s end waited a throne forged of anchor-chain and coral, vacant yet humming, as if expecting the knight’s tremoring syllables. <words>372</words>
He knelt, letting the zero-gravity peel away, and pressed the prong into the throne’s core, forging circuitries of salt, rust, and dawn. <words>394</words>
Then, aloud at last, he voiced the silent vow that had echoed through ages, and the void itself replied with tides of rising light. <words>418</words>
Behind him, the dance hall, the clock, and the masqueraders faded like shed cocoons, while ahead, horizons deepened until they became beginnings. <words>440</words>
