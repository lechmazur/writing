<story>The bronze grotto under starlight glimmered like a hollowed bell, its ribs ringing with a whalebone reverie. [17]  
It was just after the first snowmelt, when the air still tasted of crushed ice and thawed secrets. [35]  
Into that hushed chamber stepped Olivine, the fractal weaver, her cloak patterned like infinite coastlines seen from the sky. [54]  
She carried a kerosene lamp burner without its glass, preferring flame to breathe freely in the mineral gloom. [72]  
Olivine had come to collect the weights of different burdens, a task she alone could measure and weave. [90]  
Each burden would become a thread in her lacy mathematics, spiraling outward until meaning resurfaced in living color. [108]  
Yet the grotto spoke first, exhaling a shingled hush, layer upon layer of silenced waves settling over her ears. [127]  
Under that weight, most visitors grew boundary-lessly trapped, unable to feel the edge between their skin and the bronze walls. [147]  
Olivine welcomed the sensation; boundaries blurred make easier weaving, or so the old guild scrolls claimed. [163]  
She placed the lamp on a slick stalagmite and let the flame climb upward like an eager surveyor. [181]  
By orienting properly, she believed, even fire could reveal invisible loadstones lodged in mortal hearts. [196]  
She rotated the burner a single degree east, then another north, mapping constellations onto the cave floor. [213]  
Where the light struck, droplets hardened instantly, as if the grotto wished to calcify its own tears for inspection. [232]  
Olivine touched one new crystal and felt a yank behind her sternum, the first burden announcing itself. [249]  
A memory surfaced: a shepherd who feared night because wolves echoed inside his skull louder than wind. [266]  
His intangible dread weighed precisely three drams, yet had bent his spine for decades. [280]  
She siphoned the weight, spinning it into a translucent filament that curled around her wrist like moonlit twine. [298]  
More crystals burst forth whenever the lamp realigned, each burst a silent confession from people she had never met. [317]  
Grief of a bride who lost her name at the altar, seven drams. [330]  
Shame of a potter whose jars collapsed before firing, five. [340]  
Loneliness of a child who could pronounce stars but not friends, nine. [352]  
The grotto grew brighter, bronze turning rose where flame and sorrow mingled. [364]  
Yet a darker seam waited beneath, something neither droplet nor confession could unlock. [377]  
Olivine inhaled, letting the shingled hush settle fully until even her heartbeat took its cadence. [392]  
By orienting properly, she turned the burner upside down, flame licking downward like a question mark. [408]  
Bronze plates on the floor separated, revealing a small pit lined with mirrored ore. [422]  
Within shivered her own burden, long postponed: the cost of weaving others while leaving her patterns empty. [439]  
She was suddenly boundary-lessly trapped, not by rock but by the absence of anyone who could weave her. [457]  
The realization threatened to calcify her fingers, paralysis creeping like frost returning for revenge. [471]  
Remember the method, she whispered, and she reoriented the flame once more, this time toward her own shadow. [489]  
Light penetrated the mirrored ore, bounced into her chest, and the burden measured itself at twelve drams, heavy but moveable. [509]  
She spun it into a filament thicker than the rest, letting it braid with the other sorrows now orbiting her lamp. [530]  
The grotto exhaled satisfaction, and the shingled hush peeled away like opened shutters revealing dawn. [545]  
Starlight reached deeper, turning bronze to pale gold, while the flame dimmed into a well-behaved ember. [561]  
Olivine gathered the braided burden-threads, arranging them in concentric polygons across the cavern floor. [575]  
By orienting properly once again, she tugged a hidden axis, and the polygons tightened into a luminous tapestry. [593]  
The weights balanced each other, and the grotto ceased dripping, its grief now suspended in harmonious geometry. [610]  
She extinguished the lamp by pinching flame between two metal petals, a farewell that sounded like a muted bell. [629]  
Outside, dawn waited, but she lingered to listen; the hush remained, yet now it folded gently like wings, not shingles. [649]  
Her mission was unfinished, she knew, but with her own burden gauged she could leave the grotto without splintering. [668]  
Each collected filament would one day be woven into a quilt vast enough to roof the sky, easing those beneath. [688]  
That hope rang inside her footsteps as she ascended, a quiet percussion keeping time for the burdens she now carried. [708]  
And so the bronze grotto receded behind her, its starlight choir dimmed yet content, while Olivine walked on into thawing fields. [729]  
Snowmelt streamed alongside, whispering that even ice can be woven anew when burden and weaver finally agree on weight. [748]</story>
