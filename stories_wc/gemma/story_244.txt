The neon sign flickered, casting a sickly green glow across the cluttered workbench.  <words>23</words>
Elara, her face obscured by the shadow of the tribal mask, traced the labyrinthine carvings with a calloused thumb. <words>46</words>
The mask, a relic from a forgotten tribe, hummed with a faint energy, a constant reminder of the door she sought. <words>71</words>
The door of release. <words>83</words>
It was said to exist beyond the veil of reality, a gateway to the unknown, accessible only to those who possessed the key - the mask. <words>113</words>
But the path to the door was shrouded in whispers and half-truths, guarded by historians who spoke in riddles and veiled their knowledge in layers of obfuscation. <words>151</words>
Elara, a swordswoman burdened by a past she couldn't outrun, was reservedly bold. <words>175</words>
She wouldn't let their evasiveness deter her. <words>190</words>
She had to find the door. <words>204</words>
It was her only hope for redemption. <words>221</words>
The old rosebush outside the neon sign repair shop had finally succumbed to time, its last petal falling just as Elara had arrived. <words>249</words>
A sign, perhaps? <words>259</words>
She pushed open the door, the bell above it jingling a discordant tune. <words>281</words>
The air inside was thick with the scent of ozone and burnt solder. <words>303</words>
Behind the counter, a man with eyes as faded as the neon tubes he repaired looked up, his expression wary. <words>331</words>
"Can I help you?" he rasped, his voice gravelly from years of inhaling fumes. <words>355</words>
Elara placed the mask on the counter, its intricate carvings catching the dim light. <words>378</words>
"I'm looking for information," she said, her voice low and steady. <words>399</words>
"About this." <words>410</words>
The historian, for that's what he was, despite his unassuming appearance, raised an eyebrow. <words>433</words>
He knew. <words>443</words>
He had to know. <words>454</words>
Elara had gleaned that much from the whispers in the taverns, the hushed conversations in dusty libraries. <words>483</words>
"The door," she continued, her voice barely a whisper. <words>498</words>
"The door of release." <words>512</words>
The historian's eyes narrowed. <words>524</words>
He studied the mask, his gaze lingering on the labyrinthine carvings. <words>546</words>
"Knowledge comes at a price," he finally said, his voice a low growl. <words>568</words>
Elara met his gaze, her own eyes unwavering. <words>581</words>
She was prepared to pay. <words>593</words>
She had to be. <words>603</words>
The door awaited. <words>613</words>
