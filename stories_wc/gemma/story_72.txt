The envoy, his face a mask of sneering indifference, stood at the threshold of the greenhouse. His eyes, however, betrayed a flicker of something else, something akin to anticipation. He was furiously tranquil, a paradox embodied. <words>29</words>
The domed vineyard, a fragile bubble of life on the barren alien plain, hummed with a quiet energy. Outside, the sky was a bruised purple, the air thick with the metallic tang of a dying sun. Inside, the air was heavy with the scent of overripe fruit and damp earth. <words>71</words>
He stepped inside, his boots crunching on the gravel path. The envoy sifted through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse, his long fingers delicately parting the foliage. He was searching for something, a whisper of a clue hidden amongst the tangled vines. <words>109</words>
He had come to this desolate world on a mission, a mission whispered across the hush of a possibility just born. A prophecy, some called it. A fool's errand, others scoffed. But the envoy, driven by a desire to cup starlight in mortal palms, believed. <words>156</words>
He found it nestled amongst the roots of a withered grapevine, a folded note, its edges browned with age. He unfolded it carefully, his touch surprisingly gentle. The paper crackled, a sound like a sigh in the stillness. <words>193</words>
The note was written in a language both familiar and strange, its script a swirling dance of symbols. It spoke of a hidden path, a trail of whispers leading to a place where the veil between worlds thinned. A place where dreams took flight and destinies were forged. <words>241</words>
The envoy traced the symbols with his finger, his mind racing. This was it, the key to unlocking the prophecy, the thread that would lead him to his goal. He had followed paper trails across galaxies, deciphered ancient riddles, and braved treacherous landscapes. <words>288</words>
But this, this felt different. This felt like the culmination of a lifetime's work, the moment when the rambling destiny he had always felt tugging at him would finally take shape. <words>326</words>
He tucked the note into his pocket, a newfound determination hardening his features. The sneering envoy was gone, replaced by a man consumed by purpose. He would follow this trail, no matter where it led, no matter the cost. <words>365</words>
For he knew, with a certainty that burned like a supernova, that the starlight he sought was within his grasp. <words>390</words>
