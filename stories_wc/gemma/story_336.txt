The car backfired, a sharp crack in the otherwise silent street.  <words>16</words>
Darius, the weary undertaker, barely flinched. <words>29</words>
He was used to the jarring intrusions of the modern world into the hushed stillness of his ancient Persian palace, reimagined as a funeral home. <words>61</words>
His work demanded a certain detachment, a placid ferocity that allowed him to face death with a calm gaze and steady hands. <words>91</words>
But tonight, even his practiced serenity was strained. <words>111</words>
The silence that followed the backfire was heavier than usual, pressing down on him like a shroud. <words>139</words>
It was the silence of absolute darkness, the kind that threatened to swallow hope whole. <words>168</words>

He needed to anchor himself, to find a point of light in the encroaching gloom. <words>194</words>
His gaze fell on the astronomical clock, a magnificent contraption of brass and ivory that dominated the far wall of his workshop. <words>225</words>
It was rarely practical, more a testament to the ingenuity of his ancestors than a useful timepiece. <words>256</words>
But it held within its intricate gears and celestial charts the accumulated wisdom of generations, a repository of tribal knowledge passed down through centuries. <words>297</words>

Darius knew the clock's secrets, the way its hands danced to the rhythm of the sun, charting the passage of time with unwavering precision. <words>333</words>
He knew how to imprison the sun's path within its gears, to hold onto a sliver of daylight even as night threatened to consume the world. <words>370</words>
Tonight, he needed that sliver more than ever. <words>388</words>

He moved with the practiced grace of a man who had spent a lifetime tending to the dead, his hands tracing the familiar contours of the clock's face. <words>423</words>
He adjusted a tiny lever, aligning a celestial pointer with the setting sun. <words>451</words>
The clock whirred, its gears grinding into motion, and a shaft of golden light pierced the gloom. <words>482</words>
It was a small light, a fragile beacon in the vast darkness, but it was enough. <words>509</words>
Enough to remind Darius that even in the deepest night, there was always a promise of dawn. <words>538</words>

He stood before the clock, bathed in its golden glow, and felt the weight of the silence lift. <words>566</words>
The car backfire seemed a distant memory, a fleeting disturbance in the eternal rhythm of the cosmos. <words>597</words>
He was an undertaker, yes, but he was also a keeper of time, a guardian of hope. <words>626</words>
And as long as the astronomical clock ticked, he would continue to hold onto the light. <words>654</words>
