Bartholomew adjusted his spectacles, the lenses catching the faint, ethereal glow emanating from the salt crystals lining the chamber walls. <words>28</words> He smoothed down his velvet waistcoat, a nervous habit he'd developed since being assigned to this peculiar post. <words>54</words>  As the understudy sorcerer, his duties were mostly menial: tending to the crystal growth, ensuring the laundry cycles ran smoothly, and, most importantly, listening. <words>86</words>

He wasn't listening to the hum of the machinery or the rhythmic drip of condensation, though. <words>114</words> No, Bartholomew was eavesdropping on the whispers of the ancient oak grove that bordered the chamber. <words>142</words> It was said the grove held the echoes of forgotten languages, the murmurs of civilizations long gone. <words>170</words> Bartholomew, with his obnoxiously polite demeanor and insatiable curiosity, was determined to track the evolution of culture through these whispers. <words>204</words>

He held a small cardboard box close, its lid slightly ajar. <words>226</words> Inside, nestled amongst cotton wool, lay a delicate crystal microphone, a prototype designed to amplify the faintest of sounds. <words>254</words> It was his secret weapon, his tool for unlocking the secrets of the past. <words>282</words>

But lately, the whispers had grown fainter, almost inaudible. <words>306</words> Bartholomew suspected something was amiss. <words>328</words> He'd tried adjusting the crystal microphone, repositioning it closer to the grove's edge, even offering polite apologies to the trees for any disturbance he might be causing. <words>364</words> Nothing worked. <words>376</words>

Then, during a particularly loud laundry cycle, a new sound emerged from the grove. <words>404</words> It wasn't a whisper, but a low, guttural growl, a sound that sent shivers down Bartholomew's spine. <words>432</words> He pressed his ear closer to the cardboard box, his heart pounding in his chest. <words>458</words>

The growl intensified, accompanied by a rustling of leaves and the snapping of twigs. <words>486</words> Bartholomew's playful dread morphed into genuine fear. <words>512</words> He realized, with a sinking feeling, that he wasn't just listening to the whispers of the past. <words>540</words> He was hindering something ancient, something powerful, something that was now very, very angry. <words>570</words>

He slammed the lid shut on the cardboard box, the growl echoing ominously through the chamber. <words>598</words> Bartholomew knew he had to act fast. <words>612</words> He had to find a way to appease whatever he had awakened, before it decided to break free from its slumber. <words>640</words>
