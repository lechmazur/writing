The rusted gate groaned like a dying beast, its hinges protesting the intrusion.  <words>22</words>
Lila, all elbows and knees and a tangle of dark braids, slipped through the opening, her eyes adjusting to the gloom of the lost orchard temple. <words>51</words>
Fruit-laden vines, heavy with the weight of forgotten harvests, draped over crumbling stone walls, their sweetness a cloying perfume in the stagnant air. <words>81</words>
She clutched the cameo brooch in her pocket, its cool metal a comfort against her skin. <words>106</words>
It was a family heirloom, passed down through generations of her streetwise lineage, each inheritor burdened with the same whispered warning: "Beware the echo." <words>141</words>
Lila had always dismissed it as superstition, a bedtime story to frighten children. <words>166</words>
But now, standing in the heart of this forgotten place, a place that felt both familiar and utterly alien, she wasn't so sure. <words>195</words>
The air hummed with a distant echo, a faint vibration that seemed to emanate from the very stones themselves. <words>223</words>
It wasn't a sound, not exactly, but a feeling, a prickling awareness that something was watching, waiting. <words>254</words>
Lila pressed on, her footsteps muffled by the thick carpet of fallen fruit. <words>278</words>
The temple was a labyrinth of overgrown paths and crumbling arches, each turn revealing a new vista of decaying grandeur. <words>310</words>
She followed a pattern, a reversed pattern, her intuition guiding her through the maze. <words>336</words>
It was a method she'd learned on the streets, a way of navigating the chaos, of finding order in the seemingly random. <words>367</words>
Here, in this place where time seemed to have stopped, it felt strangely appropriate. <words>393</words>
The echo grew stronger, a persistent thrumming that resonated deep within her bones. <words>420</words>
Lila reached a clearing, a circular space dominated by a single, ancient tree. <words>445</words>
Its branches, heavy with fruit, reached towards the sky like supplicating arms. <words>471</words>
And at its base, nestled amongst the roots, lay a pool of shimmering water. <words>496</words>
Lila knelt, her reflection wavering in the still surface. <words>518</words>
She saw not her own face, but a vision, a fleeting glimpse of a woman with eyes as dark as the night sky. <words>546</words>
The woman smiled, a sad, knowing smile, and then she was gone. <words>571</words>
Lila understood. <words>583</words>
The echo wasn't a threat, but a whisper from the past, a plea for remembrance. <words>610</words>
The cameo brooch, she realized, wasn't cursed, but a key, a conduit to this lost world. <words>638</words>
And she, the streetwise orphan, was the one chosen to harvest hope from the darkness. <words>666</words>
