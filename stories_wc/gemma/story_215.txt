Father Michael clutched the vintage postcard, its edges frayed and the image of a swirling nebula faded. He was a rattled exorcist, more accustomed to the guttural screams of the possessed than the hushed whispers of a psychic research facility. <words>44</words>
He'd been invited here, to this sterile, white-walled haven of science, to "synthesize" his experience with their research. <words>71</words>
The facility director, a woman with eyes as sharp as scalpels, had promised him guarded disclosures, a glimpse behind the curtain of their work. <words>106</words>
But so far, all he'd seen were charts, graphs, and machines that hummed with an unsettling energy. <words>135</words>
He longed for the tangible, the visceral, the undeniable proof of the supernatural that he'd encountered countless times in his years of exorcisms. <words>166</words>
The postcard, a memento from a past life, a life before the seminary, before the demons, felt like a lifeline to that world. <words>194</words>
It depicted a grand ballroom, chandeliers dripping with crystals, couples waltzing in a blur of silk and satin. <words>222</words>
He remembered the thrill of those nights, the intoxicating music, the stolen glances across the crowded room. <words>251</words>
He'd been a different man then, inwardly social, eager to connect, to lose himself in the swirling energy of the dance floor. <words>280</words>
Now, he was a man of shadows, haunted by the things he'd seen, the things he'd fought. <words>308</words>
The postcard, however, held a secret. <words>320</words>
On the back, scrawled in faded ink, was a series of seemingly random numbers and symbols. <words>348</words>
He'd shown it to the director, hoping for some insight, some connection to the research they were conducting. <words>376</words>
She'd merely smiled, a coy aggression in her eyes, and told him it was a key. <words>404</words>
A key to what? <words>415</words>
He'd been led to a room, a stark white space devoid of furniture except for a single, heavy door. <words>443</words>
The director had explained that the numbers and symbols on the postcard were a series of puzzles that would unlock the hidden room. <words>475</words>
"Entwine science with wonder, Father," she'd said, her voice a low purr. <words>498</words>
He looked at the postcard again, the nebula swirling like a vortex, pulling him in. <words>524</words>
He was a man of faith, but even he couldn't deny the pull of the unknown. <words>551</words>
He began to decipher the code, his mind racing, his fingers tracing the faded ink. <words>578</words>
Amid the dance lessons and scientific jargon, he found himself drawn into a world of hidden meanings and ancient secrets. <words>606</words>
