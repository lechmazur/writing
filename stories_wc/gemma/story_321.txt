The infernal kitchen shimmered, heat radiating off the obsidian countertops and licking at the edges of the swirling, crimson smoke that perpetually rose from the stove.  <words>55</words>
Grog, the guard, stood hunched over a table, his massive frame dwarfing the space. <words>81</words>
His eyes, usually sharp and alert, were glazed over, focused on a partial spool of crimson ribbon that lay on the table before him. <words>121</words>
It was a strange thing to find in this place, a place where the air itself seemed to crackle with unspoken apologies and the weight of regret. <words>168</words>
Grog idly picked at the ribbon, his thick fingers clumsy and uncoordinated. <words>194</words>
He was distracted, his mind a battlefield of swirling thoughts and half-formed memories. <words>223</words>
He had been tasked with guarding the hourglass, a monstrous, dreamlike contraption that pulsed with an eerie, internal light. <words>260</words>
Its sands, a swirling vortex of crimson and gold, seemed to hold the very essence of time, each grain a whispered apology waiting to be spoken. <words>308</words>
But Grog couldn't focus on his duty. <words>325</words>
His thoughts kept returning to the incident, the one that had landed him in this infernal kitchen in the first place. <words>361</words>
He had made a mistake, a terrible one, and the price of forgiveness seemed impossibly high. <words>395</words>
He had tried to apologize, but the words had caught in his throat, choked by the sheer weight of his guilt. <words>431</words>
Now, he was trapped in this purgatory, surrounded by the ghosts of his past, the silence deafening. <words>466</words>
He needed to outmaneuver this cosmic silence, to find a way to break free from the chains of his regret. <words>503</words>
He looked at the ribbon again, its crimson hue mirroring the swirling patterns inside the hourglass. <words>536</words>
An almost radical idea began to form in his mind. <words>559</words>
He would displace the ribbon, weave it into the hourglass, a physical manifestation of his apology. <words>592</words>
Perhaps, by clarifying the swirling patterns inside the dreamlike hourglass, he could finally find the words he needed to speak. <words>631</words>
Perhaps, he could finally earn his forgiveness. <words>652</words>
