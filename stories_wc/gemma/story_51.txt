The static electricity garden hummed with a low, constant thrum.  <words>22</words>
Tiny sparks danced between the metal sculptures, illuminating the gathering dusk in a series of fleeting, ethereal flashes. <words>49</words>
Marco stood amongst the sculptures, his hands shoved deep in his pockets, his gaze fixed on the horizon. <words>75</words>
He was waiting. <words>82</words>
Not for a person, not exactly. <words>96</words>
He was waiting for a feeling, a shift in the air, a moment of recognition. <words>123</words>
He was waiting for the second a new silhouette appeared on the horizon, a silhouette that would trigger a cascade of memories, a flood of regret. <words>161</words>

Marco was an apologetic thug, a contradiction in terms, a man perpetually haunted by the ghosts of his past. <words>190</words>
He'd spent years trying to outrun them, to bury them under layers of good deeds and forced smiles. <words>220</words>
But the past had a way of clinging on, like burrs on a coat. <words>243</words>
He'd tried everything to break free: therapy, meditation, even a stint in a monastery. <words>271</words>
Nothing worked. <words>279</words>
The guilt, the shame, the gnawing sense of responsibility, it all remained. <words>307</words>

Then, he'd stumbled upon a new method, a rationally subjective approach to confronting his demons. <words>339</words>
He would stage accidental meetings in museums, places where the past felt tangible, where history whispered from the walls. <words>377</words>
He'd leave a plain wooden crate slat, a symbol of his former life, in a discreet location, hoping it would draw out the silhouette, the embodiment of his past. <words>421</words>

He believed that by outlasting his past, by refusing to be consumed by it, he could finally learn the true meaning of resilience. <words>461</words>
He wasn't sure if it would work, but it was the only plan he had left. <words>486</words>
The static electricity garden, with its charged atmosphere and sense of anticipation, felt like the perfect setting for this confrontation. <words>524</words>

And then, in the second a new silhouette appeared on the horizon, a figure shrouded in shadow, Marco felt a jolt, a surge of electricity that mirrored the garden's hum. <words>566</words>
He knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that this was it. <words>589</words>
This was the moment he'd been waiting for. <words>606</words>
