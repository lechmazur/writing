The arcade pulsed with the neon thrum of a thousand games, a symphony of blips and bloops that bounced off the grime-coated walls.  <words>34</words>
Jax, the blacksmith, leaned against a pillar, his gaze drifting past the flashing screens and joystick-wielding teenagers. <words>61</words>
He wasn't here for the games. <words>74</words>
His calloused fingers traced the worn leather of his satchel, where a collection of botanical drawings lay nestled. <words>101</words>
Each one, a meticulous rendering of a plant he'd never seen in this concrete jungle, a whisper of a world lost to steel and circuitry. <words>136</words>
He longed to weave those whispers into reality, to reclaim the wild that had been swallowed by the city's insatiable hunger. <words>171</words>

Above him, a single skylight pierced the gloom, a circular portal to the polluted sky. <words>196</words>
Dust motes danced in the sliver of sunlight, swirling in a silent ballet. <words>221</words>
Jax closed his eyes, his mind's eye tracing the patterns, mapping the chaos into order. <words>249</words>
He imagined vines creeping along the arcade's grimy walls, blossoms bursting from cracked concrete, a verdant rebellion against the sterile cityscape. <words>284</words>

His blacksmithing was more than just hammering metal; it was about shaping dreams, about imbuing the mundane with a touch of the fantastical. <words>318</words>
He'd learned to kindle that spark, to coax life from the most unlikely of places. <words>346</words>
He'd seen the way a single wildflower, blooming defiantly in a forgotten alleyway, could stop a passerby in their tracks, a flicker of wonder in their jaded eyes. <words>385</words>

He wasn't naive. <words>394</words>
He knew the city was a beast that devoured beauty, that crushed anything that dared to grow wild. <words>421</words>
But he also knew that even the smallest seed could crack through concrete, that even the faintest whisper could become a roar. <words>457</words>

He opened his eyes, the dust motes still swirling, a miniature galaxy in the dim light. <words>484</words>
He pulled out a drawing, the delicate lines of a moonflower, its petals unfurling towards the nonexistent moon. <words>515</words>
A wistful smile touched his lips. <words>526</words>
He would start small, a single bloom in the heart of the arcade, a subtle rebellion against the neon glare. <words>557</words>
He would kindle the spark, and let the wild reclaim its own. <words>580</words>
