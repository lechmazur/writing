The salt-crusted wind whipped at Sir Kaelen's weathered face, the spray stinging his eyes as he stared at the brass door knocker. <words>26</words>
It was shaped like a snarling wolf, its teeth bared in a perpetual snarl, a cruel mockery of the beast he'd once been. <words>52</words>
He'd been a knight, once, sworn to protect the realm, but now he was a prisoner, trapped in this lighthouse prison perched precariously on a jagged reef. <words>81</words>
His crime? An impossible choice, a decision made in the heat of battle that had saved countless lives but cost him his honor. <words>111</words>
He'd been forced to choose between his king and his love, and the echo of her final cry of regret still haunted him, a phantom pain that gnawed at his soul. <words>145</words>

He reached out, his calloused fingers tracing the cold metal of the knocker. <words>161</words>
It was a strange thing to find on a lighthouse, a symbol of violence on a beacon of hope. <words>185</words>
But then, this entire prison was a paradox, a place of confinement that offered a breathtaking view of the endless ocean. <words>211</words>
He'd spent years studying the patterns of the waves, the ebb and flow of the tides, searching for a way out, a way to silence the echoes of his past. <words>241</words>

One day, he'd discovered a set of seemingly random items scattered around his cell: a shard of mirror, a piece of driftwood, a smooth, white stone. <words>271</words>
At first, he'd dismissed them as the whims of the warden, but something about their arrangement, their placement within the mirrored reflection of his cell, sparked a flicker of hope. <words>306</words>
He began to study them, to trace their contours, to feel their textures. <words>328</words>
Slowly, a pattern emerged, a sequence of symbols that seemed to whisper of a hidden truth. <words>354</words>

The pattern led him to the door knocker, the snarling wolf. <words>372</words>
He pressed his ear against the cold metal, listening intently. <words>389</words>
And then he heard it, a faint whisper, a voice from beyond the veil of time. <words>410</words>
It spoke of forgiveness, of redemption, of a chance to make things right. <words>432</words>

A grudgingly sweet ache bloomed in his chest, a bittersweet symphony of pain and hope. <words>458</words>
He understood now. <words>466</words>
The impossible choice he'd made, the regret that had haunted him for so long, it was all part of a larger design, a tapestry woven by fate. <words>495</words>
He raised his hand and knocked, the sound echoing through the lighthouse, a sound of acceptance, of surrender, of a heart finally at peace. <words>528</words>
The final cry of regret was silenced, replaced by a joyful agony, the bittersweet pang of a soul finally free. <words>559</words>
