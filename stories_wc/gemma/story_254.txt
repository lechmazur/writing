Barnaby Buttons, a man whose face was perpetually stuck in a grimace of mock seriousness, stared at the dried-out inkwell. <words>25</words> It was a gift, of course, from his well-meaning but utterly clueless aunt Mildred. <words>48</words> He’d received it on his birthday, a day he usually marked by retreating to the deserted playground at the edge of the wilderness, a place where the hush of time’s unraveling tapestry seemed to muffle the world’s incessant noise. <words>89</words>

He’d tried to explain to Mildred, in his usual deadpan delivery, that he didn’t write. <words>114</words> He was a comedic actor, after all, his humor as dry as the Sahara and twice as unforgiving. <words>140</words> But Mildred, bless her heart, had insisted. <words>154</words> “Every artist needs an inkwell, Barnaby,” she’d chirped, oblivious to the irony. <words>180</words>

Barnaby sighed, the sound a weary gust of wind rustling through the skeletal branches of a nearby oak. <words>205</words> He picked up the inkwell, its once-gleaming brass now tarnished and dull. <words>228</words> It felt heavy in his hand, a physical manifestation of the unwanted gift’s weight on his soul. <words>259</words>

He closed his eyes, and the playground around him dissolved. <words>276</words> He was no longer Barnaby Buttons, the humorless comedian. <words>298</words> He was a stargazer, perched on a craggy peak, his gaze fixed on the dying breath of a distant star. <words>329</words>

He could almost feel the star’s fading light, a whisper of cosmic energy brushing against his skin. <words>359</words> He wanted to bottle it, to capture its essence in something tangible, something real. <words>385</words>

And then he saw it, the dried-out inkwell, shimmering in his hand. <words>408</words> It wasn’t just an inkwell anymore. <words>424</words> It was a vessel, a conduit, a way to hold onto the star’s last gasp. <words>449</words>

He dipped his finger into the emptiness, and a single drop of starlight, impossibly bright and impossibly cold, materialized. <words>480</words> He carefully placed it in the inkwell, a tiny, luminous pearl against the brass. <words>506</words>

He opened his eyes, back in the deserted playground. <words>524</words> The inkwell was still dry, but something had shifted within him. <words>547</words> He had conceded, not to Mildred’s gift, but to the persistent daydream loops that had woven themselves into his reality. <words>578</words>

He smiled, a genuine smile, for the first time in years. <words>596</words> Maybe, just maybe, he could learn to write after all. <words>616</words>
