The disused railway station was a cathedral of rust and ivy, sunlight filtering through the skeletal remains of the roof, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air.  <words>48</words>
Elias, a poet whose words were spun from moonlight and melancholy, stood before the rusted platform, a brass sundial clutched in his hand. <words>81</words>
It was a relic from a time when trains still thundered through this forgotten place, a time before the whispers of the past had become his only companions. <words>123</words>
He traced the intricate carvings on the sundial, his fingers lingering on the worn inscription: "Time waits for no man." <words>159</words>
But time, Elias knew, could be bent, twisted, even undone. <words>181</words>
He had spent years deciphering the cryptic shapes in the wax seal of an unopened letter, a letter that had arrived on the day the last train left this station. <words>221</words>
Each shape, a riddle, a piece of a puzzle that led him deeper into the labyrinth of the past. <words>253</words>
The letter, he knew, held the key to a truth long buried, a truth that compelled him to stand by the unremembered. <words>286</words>
He had been formally rebellious in his youth, a thorn in the side of convention, but now, his rebellion was quiet, a whisper against the wind. <words>320</words>
The sundial, a symbol of time's relentless march, felt heavy in his hand. <words>345</words>
He closed his eyes, the brass cool against his palm, and saw the shapes in the wax seal dance before him. <words>373</words>
They were not just shapes, he realized, but fragments of a story, a story that needed to be told. <words>404</words>
He opened his eyes and looked at the overgrown tracks, the rusted rails stretching into the distance like veins of forgotten memories. <words>437</words>
He would tell the story, he decided, even if it meant unraveling the very fabric of time. <words>464</words>
He would stand by the unremembered, their voices echoing in his poems, their stories woven into the tapestry of his soul. <words>497</words>
The brass sundial glinted in the fading light, a silent witness to his vow. <words>524</words>
He took a deep breath, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and forgotten dreams, and began to write. <words>553</words>
The words flowed from him, a torrent of grief and longing, a testament to the delicate undoing of time. <words>586</words>
He wrote until the last sliver of sunlight disappeared, the disused railway station bathed in the soft glow of the moon. <words>619</words>
And as the stars emerged, one by one, Elias knew that the story, like the sundial, would continue to mark the passage of time, a reminder that even in the face of oblivion, some things are worth remembering. <words>658</words>
