The rusted gate groaned like a dying beast, its hinges protesting the intrusion.  <words>22</words>
Jax, his boots crunching on the gravel path, ignored the sound. <words>40</words>
He was too focused on the object clutched in his hand: a pressed four-leaf clover encased in glass, a talisman of luck he hoped would grant him passage. <words>71</words>
The air hung heavy with the scent of decay and cotton candy, a sickly sweet reminder of the park's former glory. <words>98</words>
This wasn't just any amusement park; it was the Funhouse, a labyrinth of twisted mirrors and distorted reflections, rumored to be haunted by the ghosts of forgotten laughter. <words>131</words>
But Jax wasn't here for thrills. <words>143</words>
He was here for acceptance. <words>155</words>
The Crows, a notorious smuggling ring, had set up shop within the Funhouse's decaying walls, their territory marked by a tattered map that tore at the very spot Jax stood. <words>190</words>
Beyond the tear lay the unknown, a realm ruled by the Crows, a world Jax desperately wanted to be a part of. <words>223</words>
He'd heard whispers of their rituals, their synchronized watch alarms, a symphony of ticking that signaled their unity. <words>255</words>
Jax, a reckless smuggler with a heart full of yearning, had devised a plan. <words>277</words>
He'd bring them the clover, a symbol of luck, a token of his desire to join their ranks. <words>305</words>
He'd dramatize his entrance, make a spectacle of his arrival, hoping to impress them with his audacity. <words>335</words>
He took a deep breath, the air thick with the ghosts of laughter and the promise of danger. <words>366</words>
His hand trembled as he reached for the worn leather strap of his watch. <words>388</words>
He'd set it to chime at the same time as theirs, a gesture of solidarity, a plea for acceptance. <words>419</words>
His heart pounded against his ribs, a frantic drumbeat against the silence. <words>444</words>
He stepped across the tear in the map, the world around him shifting, distorting, as if reality itself was bending to his will. <words>476</words>
The air grew colder, the shadows deeper. <words>489</words>
He could hear the faint ticking of watches, a chorus of timepieces echoing through the decaying corridors. <words>519</words>
His own watch chimed, a single, clear note that cut through the silence. <words>542</words>
He held his breath, his eyes scanning the darkness, searching for a sign, a flicker of recognition. <words>573</words>
Then, from the depths of the Funhouse, a single watch chimed in response. <words>596</words>
A jubilant despair washed over him, a bittersweet symphony of hope and fear. <words>623</words>
He was in. <words>629</words>
