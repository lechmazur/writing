The worn leather of the plain cloth bag dug into Kaelen's shoulder, a familiar weight that mirrored the weariness in his bones. He slumped against the cool stone wall of the breakroom, the silence after Brother Eldrin's resignation echoing in the cavernous space. <words> 48</words>
Kaelen, the monastery's most fiercely apathetic swordsman, felt a flicker of something akin to regret. Not for Eldrin's departure, but for the quiet that now settled over the once lively space. <words> 85</words>
He knew he should be relieved. Eldrin's constant chatter about the virtues of discipline and self-sacrifice had grated on Kaelen's nerves for years. Yet, the silence felt wrong, a gaping hole in the fabric of their routine. <words> 128</words>
Kaelen reached into the bag, his fingers brushing against the smooth, cool surface of a polished meteorite. It was a gift from his father, a reminder of a promise made under a sky ablaze with falling stars. <words> 165</words>
"Follow the meteor showers," his father had said, his voice raspy with age, "and you'll find your spark." <words> 190</words>
Kaelen had scoffed then, dismissing it as the ramblings of a dying man. But now, staring at the dull grey stone of the monastery walls, he felt a strange pull towards the night sky. <words> 222</words>
He had spent years honing his swordsmanship, becoming a weapon of the monastery, a shield against the encroaching darkness. But somewhere along the way, he had lost sight of himself, his own spark extinguished under the weight of duty and apathy. <words> 270</words>
Eldrin's departure, though unexpected, had cracked open a window in Kaelen's carefully constructed apathy. He saw the flicker of defiance in the eyes of the younger monks, the yearning for something more than the rigid confines of their existence. <words> 318</words>
And he realized, with a jolt, that he felt it too. The spark, long dormant, was beginning to glow. <words> 345</words>
He rose, the meteorite heavy in his hand, a tangible reminder of his father's words. Tonight, he would follow the meteor shower. Tonight, he would find his spark. <words> 380</words>
He walked out of the breakroom, leaving behind the silence and the weight of expectation. The night sky beckoned, a canvas of infinite possibilities. <words> 413</words>
As he climbed the winding stairs to the monastery's rooftop, the first streaks of light pierced the darkness. The meteor shower had begun. <words> 445</words>
Kaelen closed his eyes, feeling the cool night air against his face, the wind whispering promises of change. He took a deep breath, the spark within him growing brighter with each passing moment. <words> 482</words>
He would overcome. He would find his own path, guided by the light of the falling stars. <words> 511</words>
