The midday sun beat down on the abandoned ink factory, baking the rusted metal siding until it shimmered.  <words>26</words>
Finn, a minstrel with a voice like gravel and a heart full of doubt, crouched beside a cracked mailbox, its red paint peeling like sunburned skin. <words>59</words>
He held a scrap of dragon-scale armor, impossibly plausible in its iridescent sheen, and aimed it at the hissing steam vent spewing from the factory's bowels. <words>91</words>
Finn wasn't a believer in magic, not really. <words>109</words>
He'd seen too much trickery, too many illusions spun by the immortal trickster, Loki, who delighted in toying with mortals. <words>136</words>
But this scrap, this impossible artifact, felt different. <words>154</words>
It hummed with a power that resonated deep in Finn's bones, a power that whispered of ancient battles and forgotten gods. <words>181</words>
Loki had challenged him, dared him to prove his worth. <words>198</words>
"Prove your generosity," Loki had cackled, his voice a slithering whisper in Finn's ear, "give away something precious, something irreplaceable." <words>230</words>
Finn scoffed. <words>238</words>
Generosity? <words>246</words>
From a man who'd spent his life scraping by, who'd lost more than he'd gained? <words>273</words>
But the scrap, the dragon-scale, it pulsed in his hand, urging him forward. <words>299</words>
He loaded it into his slingshot, a contraption cobbled together from scavenged wood and twine. <words>326</words>
It felt absurd, ludicrous even, to launch a piece of dragon armor with a child's toy. <words>354</words>
But Finn, fueled by a reckless generosity he didn't fully understand, aimed at the hissing vent. <words>382</words>
The steam, thick and pungent, billowed out, carrying the scrap into the factory's depths. <words>409</words>
Finn watched, his heart pounding, as the scrap disappeared into the swirling mist. <words>436</words>
He waited, the hush of the empty mailbox amplifying the silence. <words>461</words>
Then, a low rumble echoed from within the factory, growing louder, more insistent. <words>488</words>
The ground trembled beneath his feet. <words>505</words>
Finn, his skepticism momentarily forgotten, stared in awe as a plume of iridescent smoke erupted from the vent, swirling and coalescing into the shape of a magnificent dragon. <words>543</words>
It roared, a sound that shook the very foundations of the factory, and then, with a beat of its shimmering wings, it soared into the sky, carrying the scrap of dragon-scale armor with it. <words>589</words>
Finn, the skeptical minstrel, stood there, bathed in the dragon's fading light, a smile slowly spreading across his face. <words>622</words>
He had out-schemed the trickster, not with cunning or wit, but with a reckless generosity that even he hadn't known he possessed. <words>659</words>
And in that moment, as the dragon disappeared into the azure expanse, Finn felt a flicker of something new, something akin to hope. <words>693</words>
