The scent of rosemary and thyme clung to Finnigan's flannel shirt as he pedaled through the twilight. <words: 22>
He'd just finished his shift at The Bone & Barrel, the ancient ossuary turned gourmet restaurant where he worked as a lumberjack-turned-waiter. <words: 51>
It was a strange juxtaposition, he knew, but the pay was good, and the owner, a wizened woman named Esme, had a way of making even the most macabre setting feel strangely comforting. <words: 86>
Finnigan wasn't sure why he'd taken the job. <words: 101>
Maybe it was the promise of learning Esme's healing traditions, whispered to be passed down through generations. <words: 128>
Or maybe it was the nightmares. <words: 139>

They'd started a few months ago, vivid and unsettling, filled with images of a future war and a coded letter clutched in a gaunt hand. <words: 170>
The letter, he knew, held the key to understanding the nightmares, but he couldn't decipher its strange symbols. <words: 196>
He'd tried everything - books, online forums, even a visit to the local university library - but the code remained stubbornly elusive. <words: 225>

His only clue was a recurring image in his dreams: a gnarled oak tree, its branches reaching towards a blood-red sky. <words: 251>
He'd spent his bike rides scouring the countryside, searching for a tree that matched the description. <words: 275>
Today, he thought he'd found it. <words: 286>

The oak stood on a hill overlooking the town, its branches twisted and ancient. <words: 308>
As Finnigan approached, a sense of unease washed over him. <words: 324>
The air grew heavy, the silence broken only by the rustle of leaves. <words: 345>
He reached out to touch the rough bark, and a jolt of energy surged through him. <words: 367>

Suddenly, the nightmares flooded back, clearer than ever. <words: 381>
He saw the war, the devastation, the coded letter clutched in the hand of a dying soldier. <words: 404>
And he understood. <words: 413>

The letter wasn't a message from the future; it was a warning. <words: 430>
A warning about the hidden agendas that fueled the conflict, the greed and ambition that threatened to consume the world. <words: 457>
Finnigan knew what he had to do. <words: 468>

He had to find a way to share the warning, to expose the truth. <words: 484>
He had to use his awkwardly graceful strength, honed from years of felling trees, to fight for a future free from war. <words: 511>
He had to learn Esme's healing traditions, not just for himself, but for the world. <words: 535>
He had to revamp his life, his purpose, his very being. <words: 553>

The nightmares, once a source of fear, now fueled his resolve. <words: 570>
He would face them head-on, armed with the knowledge they held. <words: 587>
He would be the bridge between the past and the future, the lumberjack who saved the world. <words: 609>
