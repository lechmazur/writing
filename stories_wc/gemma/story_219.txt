The island was a place where time forgot to tick. The brittle hush of a broken clock hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the stillness that permeated everything.

Elara clutched a dried corn husk in her hand, its rough texture a stark contrast to the smooth, worn surface of the origami swan she held in her other hand.
