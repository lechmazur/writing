The flickering candlelight danced across the rough-hewn walls of the giant mushroom house, casting elongated shadows that writhed like phantoms.  <words>38</words>
Roric, the edgy tradesman, sat hunched over a table carved from a single, luminous fungus, his face illuminated by the wavering flame. <words>70</words>
He traced the jagged edge of a torn flyer with a calloused thumb, the paper brittle and yellowed with age. <words>96</words>
It depicted a windmill, its sails blurred and indistinct, as if seen through a veil of smoke. <words>123</words>
Roric knew this windmill. <words>135</words>
He knew it intimately, knew the groan of its gears, the creak of its timbers, the rhythmic thump of its blades against the wind. <words>164</words>
But the windmill in the flyer was different. <words>177</words>
It was wrong. <words>184</words>
Distorted. <words>191</words>
As if his memory itself had been warped and twisted. <words>210</words>

He remembered the windmill's final rotation, the slow, agonizing death rattle as its gears ground to a halt. <words>236</words>
He remembered the despair that had settled over the village, the chilling realization that their world was ending. <words>263</words>
But the flyer... the flyer showed the windmill still turning, its sails catching the wind, a beacon of hope in a dying world. <words>295</words>

Roric sighed, a deep, weary sound that echoed through the cavernous room. <words>316</words>
He was a comfortingly pessimistic man, accepting the darkness that clung to the edges of his memories. <words>345</words>
But this... this was different. <words>358</words>
This was a lie. <words>365</words>
A lie that threatened to unravel the fragile tapestry of his past. <words>386</words>

He clutched the torn flyer tighter, the paper crinkling in his grip. <words>403</words>
He had to know the truth. <words>414</words>
He had to vectorize the image, break it down into its component parts, expose the lie at its core. <words>441</words>

He glanced at the synchronized watches on the table, their hands aligned perfectly, ticking down the final moments of the windmill's rotation. <words>473</words>
Time was running out. <words>484</words>
He had to act now. <words>494</words>

With a trembling hand, he reached for his tools, the metal glinting in the candlelight. <words>516</words>
He would carry the flickering candle through the endless void, guided by the distorted memory of the windmill, until he found the truth. <words>546</words>
Even if it consumed him. <words>558</words>
