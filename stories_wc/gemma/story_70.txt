Bartholomew clutched the glass bulb, its filament a delicate, unlit promise. <words>20</words>
He ran a fingertip along its smooth surface, the cool glass a stark contrast to the humid air of the greenhouse. <words>41</words>
He was an uptight scribe, more comfortable with the precise order of ledgers than the chaotic beauty of this place. <words>65</words>
Yet, here he was, in a witch's greenhouse clinging precariously to a hill of gravestones, holding a prototype light bulb from Tesla's workshop. <words>95</words>
It was certainly uncertain how he'd gotten here, how this artifact had fallen into his possession. <words>121</words>
He remembered the envelope, the strange, almost iridescent adhesive that had sealed it. <words>146</words>
He'd analyzed it, of course, his meticulous nature demanding an explanation for its unusual properties. <words>174</words>
The analysis had led him here, to this place of whispering leaves and the scent of potent herbs, to this witch who claimed to understand the secrets of the universe. <words>206</words>
He'd come seeking answers, seeking to understand the bulb's purpose, its potential. <words>232</words>
But as he looked at the bulb now, bathed in the dappled sunlight filtering through the greenhouse glass, he realized he was seeking something more. <words>260</words>
He was seeking a way to bridge the chasm between his ordered world and this world of magic and mystery. <words>288</words>
He wanted to cradle empathy in the arms of steel, to find a way to understand the world beyond the confines of logic and reason. <words>318</words>
The witch, a woman with eyes as green as the moss clinging to the gravestones, watched him silently. <words>345</words>
She had told him the bulb held a spark of Tesla's genius, a spark that could illuminate not just the physical world but the world of the soul. <words>375</words>
He had scoffed, of course, his uptight nature resisting such fanciful notions. <words>399</words>
But now, holding the bulb, feeling its weight in his hand, he felt a shift within him. <words>424</words>
It was a subtle shift, a quiet transformation, like the slow unfurling of a fern frond. <words>451</words>
He looked at the witch, her face etched with ancient wisdom, and for the first time, he understood. <words>476</words>
He understood that the world was not just black and white, that there was room for both logic and magic, for both reason and empathy. <words>506</words>
He took a deep breath, the air thick with the scent of earth and herbs, and he bellowed, a sound that echoed through the greenhouse and out into the graveyard beyond. <words>536</words>
It was a sound of release, of acceptance, of a heart finally opening to the possibilities. <words>563</words>
In that moment, the puzzle piece finally fit. <words>580</words>
