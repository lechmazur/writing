Bartholomew Grumbly, the accidental mayor of Bogbottom, scowled at the sunrise. <words>21</words> It wasn't the sunrise itself that bothered him, mind you, but the fact that it heralded the departure of the carnival. <words>46</words> The cacophony of laughter, the smell of fried dough, the twinkling lights - all gone, leaving behind the usual symphony of croaking frogs and buzzing insects. <words>81</words> Bartholomew sighed, a sound like a rusty hinge protesting its movement. <words>104</words> He missed the excitement, the distraction from the monotony of his self-imposed exile in this polluted swamp orchard. <words>133</words>

He was supposed to be tending the ancient, gnarled trees, their branches heavy with fruit that tasted of mud and regret. <words>161</words> The monks who had entrusted him with this task were reclusive, their wisdom whispered on the wind, their faces hidden behind moss-covered hoods. <words>192</words> Bartholomew, with his lovably grumpy demeanor and penchant for complaining, was an unlikely caretaker. <words>221</words>

He shuffled towards the orchard's edge, his boots sinking into the muck. <words>246</words> The carnival had set up camp on the outskirts, a riot of color and noise that had momentarily pierced the gloom of Bogbottom. <words>275</words> As he passed the remnants of their tents, he overheard a snippet of conversation. <words>298</words>

"The clockwork beetle," a voice hissed, "it holds the key to the water's wisdom." <words>321</words>

Bartholomew stopped dead in his tracks. <words>339</words> Water wisdom? <words>349</words> He'd heard whispers of it, legends passed down through generations of monks. <words>371</words> A hidden knowledge, a way to cleanse the swamp, to restore its lifeblood. <words>394</words>

He strained to hear more, but the voices faded into the morning mist. <words>417</words> The clockwork beetle. <words>427</words> What was it? Where could he find it? <words>443</words>

A sudden urge, a burning desire, took hold of him. <words>460</words> He had to find it. <words>468</words> Not for himself, but for the monks, for the orchard, for Bogbottom. <words>489</words> He had to change the course of fate. <words>507</words>

He looked at his reflection in a puddle, his face creased with determination. <words>530</words> Bartholomew Grumbly, the accidental mayor, was about to embark on a quest. <words>556</words>

He didn't know where to start, but he knew he had to start somewhere. <words>580</words> As the carnival wagons rumbled away, leaving behind a trail of dust and fading laughter, Bartholomew Grumbly, the lovably grumpy accidental mayor, metamorphosed into Bartholomew Grumbly, the reluctant hero. <words>621</words>
