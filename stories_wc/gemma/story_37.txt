The crumpled sheet music felt rough against Finn's calloused fingers. <words>15</words>
He smoothed it out, the faded ink blurring further under his touch. <words>30</words>
It was a yodel, a jaunty, almost defiant tune that seemed out of place in the uncertain silence of the doctor's waiting room. <words>54</words>
Finn, a reformed con artist, wasn't sure why he'd kept it all these years. <words>74</words>
Maybe it was the melody, a reminder of a simpler time, before his life had become a tangled web of half-truths and elaborate schemes. <words>98</words>
Or maybe it was the inscription scrawled on the top, "For Finn, may your voice always carry the truth." <words>122</words>
Truth. <words>126</words>
A word that had always felt foreign to him, a concept he'd twisted and manipulated to his advantage. <words>149</words>
But lately, something had shifted. <words>161</words>
He'd found himself drawn to this rainforest canopy village, a place where life seemed to hum with an ancient, untainted rhythm. <words>184</words>
He'd come seeking solace, a chance to escape the ghosts of his past. <words>206</words>
But the village elder, a woman with eyes as deep and knowing as the rainforest itself, had seen through his facade. <words>230</words>
She'd told him of a prophecy, a legend of a guardian, someone who would protect the village's sacred flame, the source of their life force. <words>256</words>
And she'd said, with a knowing smile, "You, Finn, have the potential to be that guardian." <words>280</words>
Finn had scoffed, his dishonestly honest nature bubbling to the surface. <words>303</words>
"Me? A guardian? I'm a con artist, a liar, a cheat!" <words>324</words>
But the elder had simply placed a hand on his arm, her touch surprisingly strong. <words>346</words>
"The flame needs someone who understands darkness," she'd said, "someone who can see the shadows and bring them into the light." <words>370</words>
Finn had been skeptical, but something about her words resonated deep within him. <words>393</words>
He'd agreed to stay, to help the village in any way he could. <words>414</words>
And now, here he was, in the doctor's waiting room, clutching a crumpled sheet of music, waiting for news about his ailing friend, the village healer. <words>438</words>
The doctor had mentioned a detour, a construction zone blocking the usual path. <words>461</words>
Finn had taken the detour, a winding path through the dense rainforest, and stumbled upon a clearing. <words>484</words>
In the center, a single, flickering flame danced in the wind. <words>506</words>
The village's sacred flame. <words>519</words>
Finn felt a surge of protectiveness, a fierce determination to keep this flame alive. <words>542</words>
He took a deep breath and began to yodel, the melody filling the clearing, a song of hope and resilience. <words>565</words>
He yodelled for the healer, for the village, for himself. <words>583</words>
He yodelled for the chance to become the guardian of tomorrow's flame. <words>604</words>
