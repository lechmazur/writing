The rusted metal groaned beneath his boots, each step a jarring reminder of the spaceport's abandonment.  <words>26</words>
Jax, his face a mask of perpetual irritation, jogged along the cracked flight deck, the single chopstick clutched in his hand a stark contrast to the decaying grandeur around him. <words>61</words>
He wasn't sure why he kept coming back to this desolate place, this graveyard of forgotten starships. <words>85</words>
Maybe it was the silence, a welcome respite from the cacophony of the black market he navigated. <words>113</words>
Or maybe it was the ghosts, the whispers of past voyages and daring escapes that seemed to linger in the air. <words>145</words>
Today, though, Jax had a different purpose. <words>161</words>
He wasn't here for the echoes of the past, but for a glimpse into the future. <words>187</words>
He stopped, his breath ragged, and knelt beside a cracked viewport, the cityscape below a sprawling tapestry of decay. <words>215</words>
He pulled a battered tin from his pocket, its contents a jumble of dried leaves and fragrant herbs. <words>242</words>
This wasn't just any tea. <words>255</words>
This was a ritual, a desperate attempt to commune with the one thing that had always eluded him: peace. <words>282</words>
His heart, a rebellious beast, had been a constant source of turmoil, a storm of yearning and discontent. <words>311</words>
He'd tried everything to quiet it: booze, brawls, even the fleeting solace of illicit affairs. <words>340</words>
Nothing worked. <words>349</words>
The chopstick, a memento from a long-forgotten smuggling run, was his only anchor to a semblance of control. <words>380</words>
He used it to stir the tea, the swirling patterns in the murky liquid a language he was slowly learning to decipher. <words>412</words>
Each swirl, each leaf that settled at the bottom, was a clue, a whisper from the universe. <words>441</words>
Today, the patterns spoke of hidden waterfalls, cascading down forgotten canyons, their waters imbued with a serenity he craved. <words>476</words>
Jax felt a flicker of hope, a spark of something akin to excitement. <words>499</words>
Maybe, just maybe, this was the answer. <words>517</words>
Maybe these waterfalls held the key to silencing the storm within. <words>539</words>
He rose, the chopstick tucked securely in his pocket, a newfound determination hardening his features. <words>570</words>
He would find these waterfalls. <words>585</words>
He would find peace. <words>596</words>
