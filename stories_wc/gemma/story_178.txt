The fluorescent lights hummed, casting a sickly green glow over the rows of kelp tanks. Elias, the overburdened clerk, adjusted his spectacles, the lenses thick enough to distort the shimmering coral outside the viewport. <words>44</words> He was supposed to be cataloging the latest shipment of bioluminescent algae, but his mind was elsewhere, lost in the intricate patterns of a vintage stamp collection. <words>81</words> Each stamp, a portal to a different world, a different time. <words>102</words>

Tonight was trivia night at the Reefside Tavern, a chance to escape the monotony of his underwater existence. <words>130</words> Elias wasn't there for the competition, though. <words>147</words> He was there for the whispers, the rumors of a hidden knowledge, a way to quantize the ephemeral pause of a breath, to weave between worlds, to find a cure for the disease ravaging his sister. <words>204</words>

The tavern was a cacophony of laughter and the clinking of bioluminescent mugs. <words>229</words> Elias sat hunched over a table, his gaze fixed on the worn leather-bound book in his hands. <words>255</words> It was a collection of maritime lore, filled with tales of lost civilizations and forgotten magic. <words>281</words>

Suddenly, a voice cut through the din. <words>294</words> "The answer is... the Bermuda Triangle!" <words>313</words> A woman with eyes as blue as the abyss stood triumphantly, her team cheering. <words>336</words> Elias barely registered the commotion. <words>350</words> His eyes were drawn to a symbol on her necklace, a stylized anchor entwined with a serpent. <words>376</words> It was the same symbol he'd seen on a rare stamp in his collection, a stamp depicting a lost city beneath the waves. <words>408</words>

He approached her cautiously, his heart pounding. <words>425</words> "Excuse me," he stammered, "that symbol... where did you get it?" <words>448</words>

The woman smiled, her eyes twinkling with an unsettling knowingness. <words>471</words> "It's a family heirloom," she said, her voice a low, melodic hum. <words>492</words> "Passed down through generations. <words>506</words> It's said to hold the key to a world beyond our own, a world where time and space are absolutely relative." <words>538</words>

Elias felt a shiver run down his spine. <words>553</words> Could this be it? <words>560</words> The answer he'd been searching for? <words>573</words>

He took a deep breath, the air thick with the scent of brine and seaweed. <words>591</words> In the ephemeral pause of that breath, he knew what he had to do. <words>614</words>

He had to find the lost city. <words>628</words>
