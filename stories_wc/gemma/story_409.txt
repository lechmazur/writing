The first blow of the chisel against the cool marble sent a tremor through the dusty attic.  <words>22</words>
Elias, perched precariously on a rickety stool, winced. <words>36</words>
He wasn't sure why the sculptor's work resonated so deeply within him, but it did. <words>56</words>
Perhaps it was the raw, unyielding nature of the stone, mirroring the stubbornness that clung to him like a second skin. <words>83</words>
Or maybe it was the sculptor's focused intensity, a stark contrast to Elias's own skillfully incompetent existence. <words>115</words>

He glanced down at the clay pot shard clutched in his hand, its inscription worn smooth by years of anxious thumbing. <words>140</words>
"Stand for something," it read, a mocking reminder of his failures. <words>161</words>
He'd spent his life drifting, a bruised fighter perpetually on the ropes, never landing a decisive blow. <words>188</words>
He'd tried to convince himself it was a choice, a rejection of the world's petty battles. <words>214</words>
But deep down, he knew it was cowardice, a fear of truly engaging with life. <words>241</words>

The attic, crammed with the sculptor's discarded clockwork animals, seemed to hum with a forgotten energy. <words>268</words>
Each automaton, frozen in mid-gesture, held a silent plea for movement, for purpose. <words>295</words>
Elias felt a kinship with them, these abandoned creations, yearning for a spark to ignite their gears. <words>322</words>
He, too, longed to break free from the inertia that held him captive. <words>348</words>

He closed his eyes, focusing on the inscription on the shard. <words>365</words>
"Stand for something," it whispered, the words echoing through the dusty silence. <words>390</words>
And then, a memory surfaced, a forgotten dream from his childhood. <words>414</words>
He saw himself, small and fearless, rescuing a trapped bird from a thorny thicket. <words>439</words>
He remembered the fierce joy of that act, the sense of purpose that had filled him. <words>465</words>

He opened his eyes, a new resolve hardening his gaze. <words>482</words>
He would stand for something. <words>495</words>
He would extinguish the last vestige of self-deception. <words>519</words>
He would abduct the sculptor's latest creation, a magnificent silver falcon poised for flight, and set it free. <words>546</words>
It wouldn't be a grand gesture, but it would be a start. <words>568</words>
A small act of defiance against the inertia that threatened to consume him. <words>594</words>
He would stand for the forgotten dreams, for the dormant potential within himself and the clockwork creatures around him. <words>628</words>
