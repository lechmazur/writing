The steam from the chamomile tea curled around Caius's face, momentarily obscuring the bustling marketplace of Nova Roma.  <words>28</words>
He inhaled deeply, the scent a familiar comfort in the chaos. <words>45</words>
His fingers traced the worn grooves of the broken rake handle, each tiny inscription a whisper from the past. <words>68</words>
Each one, a name. <words>79</words>
Each one, a life erased. <words>92</words>
Caius, a hacker with a moral code as rigid as the Roman aqueducts, had dedicated his life to retrieving these lost names, these forgotten souls. <words>126</words>
He wasn't interested in the grand narratives, the emperors and senators whose names echoed through history. <words>153</words>
He sought the whispers, the murmurs of the rarely common, the laborers, the artisans, the mothers who birthed empires but whose names were lost to the sands of time. <words>195</words>
His latest quarry was a simple inscription: "Lucius, the Cap Maker." <words>219</words>
Lucius, whose craft had adorned the heads of legionnaires and senators alike, whose name had been scrubbed from the records, his legacy reduced to a collection of bottle caps, each one a tiny testament to his skill. <words>271</words>
Caius had found the caps in a dusty corner of the marketplace, a forgotten treasure trove. <words>295</words>
He had spent weeks deciphering the intricate designs, the subtle variations in the metalwork, each one a clue to Lucius's life, his personality, his very essence. <words>338</words>
Now, as the tea steeped, Caius felt a surge of confidence, tinged with uncertainty. <words>364</words>
He had traced Lucius's lineage through the intricate network of data streams that flowed beneath the surface of Nova Roma, a digital underbelly mirroring the ancient city above. <words>408</words>
He had found Lucius's descendants, living in the shadows, their own names barely a whisper in the digital wind. <words>445</words>
He had a plan, audacious and risky, to weave Lucius's name back into the fabric of history, to give him back his voice, his identity. <words>486</words>
He would use the bottle caps, these tiny relics of Lucius's craft, to create a digital mosaic, a testament to his life and work. <words>524</words>
He would project it onto the Colosseum, a beacon of light in the digital night, a monument to the rarely common. <words>559</words>
As the tea cooled, Caius rose, a newfound determination hardening his gaze. <words>586</words>
He would adopt Lucius, not as a pet, not as a possession, but as a brother, a fellow traveler on the long road of history. <words>621</words>
He would ensure that Lucius's name, like the inscription on the broken rake handle, would never be forgotten. <words>655</words>
