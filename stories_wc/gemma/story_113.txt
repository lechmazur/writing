The worn-out dinosaur plush, its stuffing leaking out like forgotten memories, felt heavy in Elara's hands. <words>25</words>
It was the only thing she had left of him, a relic from a time before the world fractured, before the year that tasted like ash and regret. <words>55</words>
The xenon lights of the tunnel hummed, casting an eerie glow on the rows of dream-hopping machines, each one a portal to a different year, a different reality. <words>86</words>
Elara, a hesitant bard with a voice that could be shyly loud, clutched the plush tighter. <words>111</words>
She was here to unravel a tapestry woven from sorrow, to find a thread of hope in the year everyone would rather forget. <words>141</words>

The year the world had lost its laughter. <words>153</words>
The year the music died. <words>163</words>
The year her brother, Finn, had vanished. <words>176</words>

Elara had heard whispers of these machines, rumors of their ability to traverse time, to pluck moments from the past and present them like fragile butterflies pinned to velvet. <words>213</words>
She had scoffed at first, dismissing them as the ramblings of dreamers. <words>234</words>
But desperation, like a persistent vine, had wound its way around her heart, squeezing out logic and reason. <words>263</words>

Now, she stood before the machine, its metallic surface reflecting her own hesitant gaze. <words>286</words>
She placed the dinosaur plush on the platform, its faded green scales catching the xenon light. <words>311</words>
It was a beacon, a guide, a reminder of the joy she was searching for. <words>334</words>

Taking a deep breath, Elara activated the machine. <words>348</words>
The air crackled with energy, and the tunnel pulsed with a blinding white light. <words>371</words>
Then, silence. <words>379</words>

When Elara opened her eyes, she was no longer in the sterile tunnel. <words>399</words>
She was standing in a sun-drenched meadow, the air alive with the scent of wildflowers and the sound of laughter. <words>428</words>
Children chased butterflies, their voices ringing out like silver bells. <words>449</words>
And there, in the center of it all, was Finn, his face alight with joy, a mischievous glint in his eyes. <words>476</words>

He was holding the dinosaur plush, its green scales gleaming in the sunlight. <words>498</words>
He looked up, saw Elara, and his smile widened. <words>516</words>
"Elara!" he called, his voice echoing through the meadow. <words>531</words>
"You found me!" <words>541</words>

Elara's heart soared. <words>549</words>
The tapestry of sorrow began to unravel, thread by thread, replaced by the vibrant colors of memory. <words>576</words>
The year everyone would rather forget was, for a moment, a year of laughter and light. <words>603</words>
And Elara, the hesitant bard, found her voice, shyly loud, singing a song of hope and remembrance. <words>631</words>
