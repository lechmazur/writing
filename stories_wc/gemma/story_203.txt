The silence of orbital debris was never usual. It wasn't the vacuum, the lack of air to carry sound, but a deeper hush, a stillness that pressed against Elias's eardrums like a physical weight. <words>54</words>
He clutched the pressed wildflowers, their brittle petals whispering against his palm. A legacy from his grandmother, a woman who'd claimed to be an exorcist, a woman who'd died surrounded by the ghosts of her own making. <words>98</words>
Elias, inheritor of her lies, her tools, and her crippling stage fright, was about to perform his first exorcism. <words>131</words>
He was surrounded by the disassembled parts of a child's toy, a jumble of plastic and metal amidst the floating wreckage of a long-dead satellite. <words>163</words>
His grandmother had always said that exorcisms were best performed amid the mundane, the ordinary, the things that grounded the spirit world to the physical. <words>199</words>
But here, in the cold, silent expanse of space, surrounded by the detritus of a forgotten future, nothing felt ordinary. <words>231</words>
He took a deep breath, the recycled air tasting metallic in his mouth. He had to do this. Not for his grandmother, not for the ghosts, but for himself. <words>264</words>
He had to sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never." <words>286</words>
He began to assemble the toy, his hands trembling slightly. Each click of plastic, each twist of metal, was a prayer, a plea for strength, a defiance against the silence that threatened to consume him. <words>325</words>
As he worked, he felt a presence, a cold whisper against the back of his neck. It wasn't malicious, not yet, but it was there, watching, waiting. <words>358</words>
He finished the toy, a small, brightly colored spaceship, and held it up. The wildflowers, tucked into its cargo bay, seemed to glow with an inner light. <words>391</words>
And then he heard it, the sound of a key turning in a lock. <words>413</words>
The silence shattered. The presence surged forward, a wave of icy fear that threatened to drown him. <words>439</words>
But Elias stood his ground. He held the toy aloft, the wildflowers a beacon in the darkness. <words>463</words>
He closed his eyes, took another deep breath, and began to speak. His voice, small at first, grew stronger, steadier, until it filled the void. <words>491</words>
He spoke of hope, of possibility, of the resilience of the human spirit. He spoke of the power of love, of the beauty that could be found even in the darkest of places. <words>526</words>
He spoke until the silence was gone, replaced by a fragile peace. He spoke until the presence retreated, fading back into the shadows. <words>558</words>
He opened his eyes. The wildflowers in the toy's cargo bay seemed to shimmer, their colors brighter, their petals unfurling as if in response to his words. <words>591</words>
He had done it. He had faced his fear, his inheritance, and emerged victorious. He had sculpted possibility from the ashes of "never." <words>625</words>
And in the silence of orbital debris, a new sound arose: the soft whirring of a child's toy spaceship, soaring through the void. <words>656</words>
