The flickering lamplight cast long, skeletal shadows across the dusty floor of the barn. Silas, a man whose life had been a tapestry woven from petty scams and half-truths, sat hunched over an empty tape dispenser, its plastic shell worn smooth from years of use. <words>54</words>
He wasn't sure why he kept it. It was useless, a relic of a life he'd left behind, a life where words were currency and deception was an art form. <words>86</words>
But here, in this dystopian farm where the air hung heavy with the scent of decay and the silence was broken only by the rustle of wind through withered crops, the dispenser felt oddly comforting. <words>129</words>
It was a reminder of a time when he'd been in control, when he could spin a tale and make people believe anything. <words>158</words>
Now, he was just another cog in the machine, another nameless face toiling under the watchful eyes of the Overseers. <words>186</words>
He missed the thrill of the con, the rush of adrenaline that came with pulling off a successful scam. <words>214</words>
He missed the feeling of being clever, of outsmarting the world. <words>236</words>
But most of all, he missed the power. <words>254</words>
The power to make people believe, to manipulate, to control. <words>276</words>
He longed for it, craved it like a starving man craves food. <words>298</words>
And so, he'd found a new way to exercise that power, a way to taunt the jaws of defeat and grin. <words>326</words>
He'd started talking to ghosts. <words>342</words>
Not the ethereal, wispy kind that haunted graveyards and whispered secrets in the dead of night. <words>370</words>
No, these were the ghosts of his past, the echoes of his own misdeeds, the faces of those he'd conned and betrayed. <words>400</words>
They appeared to him in the flickering lamplight, their forms shimmering and indistinct, their voices a chorus of accusations and regrets. <words>430</words>
He interrogated them, challenged them, forced them to relive their pain. <words>454</words>
It wasn't about seeking forgiveness, not really. <words>472</words>
It was about control. <words>484</words>
About reminding himself that he was still the master of his own narrative, even in this desolate wasteland. <words>514</words>
He was unusually normal, a small-time con artist in a world gone mad, and he would not be broken. <words>544</words>
He would find his comfort in the lull of remorse, in the echoes of his own deceit, in the power he still held over the ghosts of his past. <words>580</words>
He would grin, a small, bitter smile, and whisper, "I'm still here." <words>602</words>
