The elevator doors wheezed open, revealing an empty floor bathed in the eerie green glow of phosphorescent fungi clinging to the cavern walls.  <words>28</words>
A sigh, dry as dust, escaped the hermit's lips.  <words>42</words>
Another day, another empty floor.  <words>56</words>
He hadn't seen another soul in what felt like centuries, though it had only been a decade since the Cataclysm.  <words>81</words>
A decade of silence, punctuated only by the drip-drip-drip of water seeping through the cavern ceiling.  <words>111</words>
He'd been tasked with restoring the water systems, a task that seemed as futile as trying to mend a shattered moon.  <words>143</words>
Still, he persisted, driven by a sliver of hope, a desperate need to believe that life could bloom again in this subterranean world.  <words>181</words>
His only companions were the phosphorescent flora, their ethereal glow casting dancing shadows on the damp stone walls.  <words>211</words>
And his blunt scissors, a strangely effective tool in this strange new world.  <words>238</words>
He used them to prune the phosphorescent vines, coaxing them to grow in patterns that mimicked the constellations he vaguely remembered from his childhood.  <words>280</words>
He used them to cut strips of moss, weaving them into makeshift bandages for his blistered hands.  <words>311</words>
And sometimes, when despair threatened to consume him, he'd use them to snip off a piece of the phosphorescent fungi, inhaling its earthy, musky scent.  <words>351</words>
The scent, strangely, had the power to amplify his memories.  <words>373</words>
Memories of his wife's laughter, the warmth of the sun on his skin, the taste of fresh bread.  <words>404</words>
The memory of bread, so vivid, so real, it was almost unbearable.  <words>428</words>
He closed his eyes, the scent of the fungi filling his nostrils, and he could almost taste the crusty warmth, the yeasty aroma.  <words>461</words>
He could almost hear the clatter of the bread knife against the wooden cutting board.  <words>490</words>
He could almost feel the soft, yielding texture beneath his fingers.  <words>516</words>
A sob escaped his lips, a sound lost in the vast emptiness of the cavern.  <words>540</words>
He was alone.  <words>549</words>
Utterly, irrevocably alone.  <words>568</words>
The elevator doors hissed shut, plunging the floor back into darkness.  <words>593</words>
He was alone, but the scent of bread lingered, a bittersweet reminder of a world lost, a world he might never see again.  <words>631</words>
