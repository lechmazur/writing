The old man sat slumped against the well's moss-covered stone, his eyes half-closed, a picture of serene indifference. <words>22</words>
He was the wishing-well attendant, though no one wished anymore. <words>40</words>
Not since the whispers started. <words>52</words>
He didn't mind. <words>62</words>
The silence suited him. <words>74</words>
It was the weight of the whispers, the echoes of judgments from ghosts long gone, that he carried like a shroud. <words>100</words>
He was intensely relaxed, almost languid, but his eyes, when they opened, held the glint of a hawk. <words>125</words>
He knew their secrets, the ghosts', the town's, his own. <words>143</words>
He knew the paths they walked, the unwritten paths that crisscrossed the town like veins of ancient magic. <words>170</words>
He knew where they hid, the secrets, the regrets, the unspoken truths. <words>194</words>
And he knew how to find them, how to follow the shadows they cast, the patterns they wove into the fabric of the town. <words>225</words>
He was the keeper of the crossroads, the guardian of the unspoken. <words>246</words>
Today, a new shadow had fallen across his well. <words>262</words>
A shadow that smelled of rain and gunpowder, of distant lands and hidden agendas. <words>288</words>
A shadow that carried a collection of foreign coins, clinking softly in a leather pouch. <words>314</words>
The coins were a message, a code only he could decipher. <words>332</words>
They spoke of a secret agent, an escape route, a rendezvous at the crossing of two unwritten paths. <words>360</words>
The old man smiled, a slow, knowing smile. <words>374</words>
He had been waiting for this. <words>386</words>
He had been waiting for someone to challenge the silence, to break the hold of the ghosts. <words>412</words>
He rose, his joints creaking like ancient hinges, and walked towards the edge of the town, towards the shadows. <words>438</words>
He would corroborate the message, guide the agent through the labyrinthine paths, out-face the silent judgments of the old ghosts. <words>470</words>
He would show them that even in the deepest shadows, there was still light. <words>492</words>
He would show them that even the most ancient scars could be healed. <words>514</words>
He was the wishing-well attendant, and he held the key to the town's secrets. <words>538</words>
He was the keeper of the crossroads, and he would not be silenced. <words>560</words>
He was the inheritor of the mystery, and he would unravel it, one shadow at a time. <words>586</words>
