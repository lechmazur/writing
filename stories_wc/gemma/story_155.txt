The flickering neon sign outside the "Cosmic Carousel" cast a sickly green glow on Kai's face as he adjusted his welding mask. <words>26</words> He hated the way the light made his skin look, but he needed this job. <words>45</words> Underwater welding wasn't exactly glamorous, but it paid the bills, and right now, bills were all that mattered. <words>70</words>

The Cosmic Carousel wasn't your typical nightclub. <words>86</words> It was housed in the gutted shell of a once-grand planetarium, its celestial murals now obscured by graffiti and peeling paint. <words>115</words> The dome, once a window to the stars, was now a cracked mirror reflecting the city's neon decay. <words>141</words>

Kai navigated the labyrinthine corridors, the air thick with the scent of stale beer and desperation. <words>170</words> He found his station, a makeshift booth tucked away in a corner, and began setting up his equipment. <words>197</words>

He was patiently impatient, a contradiction he'd learned to live with. <words>221</words> He craved the solitude of the deep, the quiet hum of his welding torch, the weightlessness of being submerged. <words>251</words> But he also yearned for something more, a sense of purpose beyond the mundane. <words>276</words>

That's why he frequented the Cosmic Carousel. <words>290</words> Not for the music, which was a cacophony of synthesized noise, nor for the company, which was a parade of lost souls. <words>318</words> He came for the mirrors. <words>329</words>

The vintage store that occupied the planetarium's former gift shop was a treasure trove of forgotten relics. <words>358</words> Among the dusty trinkets and faded photographs, Kai had discovered a collection of antique mirrors, each reflecting a different facet of time. <words>390</words>

He'd found himself drawn to one in particular, its ornate silver frame tarnished with age. <words>416</words> Gazing into its depths, he'd glimpsed fleeting images, fragments of a life he couldn't quite grasp. <words>443</words>

One image, however, had stayed with him: a woman with eyes the color of the sea, holding a small, velvet-lined box. <words>473</words> Inside, nestled amongst faded lace, lay a collection of vintage buttons, each one a tiny portal to a forgotten memory. <words>505</words>

Kai knew he had to find that box. <words>518</words> He felt an inexplicable pull towards it, a sense that it held the key to unlocking the mysteries he'd glimpsed in the mirror. <words>546</words>

He believed it held the power to bridge the gap between timelines, to mend the fractured reality he felt himself teetering on the edge of. <words>580</words>

He just needed to find the woman in the mirror. <words>594</words>

And he was willing to do whatever it took. <words>610</words>
