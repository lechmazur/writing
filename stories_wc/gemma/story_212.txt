The wind, a constant, mournful sigh across the ethereal plains, carried the scent of salt and decay. Elias, his hands calloused and cracked, knelt amongst his withered crops, the last vestiges of a world ravaged by the last resource war. He was an atypical farmer, this Elias, for he didn't till the earth for sustenance, but for song. <words> 69</words>

He bred seeds, each one a vessel for a melody, a whisper of the world before the war, before the boundaries between life and death blurred. Each seed, when planted, would sprout a plant that hummed a unique tune, a fragment of the song of boundaries, the song that held the world together. <words> 139</words>

But Elias was weary. The song, once a source of solace, now felt like a cage, a melody dictated by the whispers of the past. He yearned to escape, to find his own song, a melody born not from the echoes of what was, but from the dreams of what could be. <words> 199</words>

He clutched a worn deck of cards, a magician's deck, a relic from a time when laughter and wonder still existed. Each card, a portal to a different world, a different possibility. He shuffled them, the worn edges whispering against each other, a counterpoint to the mournful wind. <words> 259</words>

One card, the Queen of Hearts, caught his eye. It depicted a woman with eyes the color of the sea, her lips parted as if about to sing. An idea, as wild and improbable as the ethereal plains themselves, bloomed in his mind. <words> 309</words>

He would send his song out into the world, not through the earth, but through the sea. He would weave his melodies into messages, tuck them into bottles, and cast them upon the waves. Perhaps, somewhere beyond the horizon, someone would hear his song, someone who understood the language of boundaries, someone who could help him find his own melody. <words> 380</words>

He began to jabber, his words a torrent of sound, a chaotic symphony of hope and despair. He poured his longing, his frustration, his yearning for freedom into the cards, imbuing them with the essence of his song. <words> 431</words>

He carefully placed the cards into bottles, sealed them with wax, and carried them to the shore. The waves, restless and hungry, crashed against the ethereal plains, their foam tinged with the colors of a dying sunset. <words> 481</words>

With a final, desperate prayer, Elias cast the bottles into the sea. They bobbed on the surface for a moment, then disappeared into the churning water, carrying with them the song of boundaries, the song of a farmer seeking solace, the song of a soul yearning to be free. <words> 541</words>

He watched them go, a single tear tracing a path down his weathered cheek. The wind, as if sensing his sorrow, softened its mournful sigh, and for a moment, Elias thought he heard a faint echo of his song, carried on the breeze, a whisper of hope on the ethereal plains. <words> 599</words>
