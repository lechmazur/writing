The rusted tracks groaned beneath her feet, a symphony of forgotten laughter and screams.  <words>25</words>
Elara pressed her back against the cold steel, the antique brass key heavy in her pocket. <words>48</words>
Just seconds ago, she'd been soaring above the city, a silent observer, her astral form drifting through the night. <words>75</words>
But the vision, sudden and sharp, had ripped her back to her physical body, a cold sweat clinging to her skin. <words>104</words>
They were coming. <words>113</words>

She didn't know who "they" were, only that the feeling of dread that had accompanied the vision was as tangible as the wind whipping through the skeletal remains of the abandoned carnival. <words>151</words>
Elara had always been different. <words>160</words>
Sometimes always, she could slip out of her body, her consciousness a wisp of smoke, free to roam the world unseen. <words>191</words>
It was a gift, a burden, a secret she guarded fiercely. <words>211</words>

But this time, the gift had become a warning. <words>225</words>
She had to flee. <words>233</words>
Her survival depended on it. <words>246</words>

The sun was setting, casting long, skeletal shadows across the rusted tracks. <words>270</words>
Elara knew she couldn't stay here. <words>282</words>
The carnival, once a place of joy and wonder, was now a trap. <words>304</words>
She had to find somewhere safe, somewhere hidden. <words>323</words>

She remembered the old stories her grandmother used to tell, tales of ancient paths hidden in plain sight, revealed only by the movement of the sun. <words>360</words>
Tracking sun shadows, she could find her way. <words>374</words>

Elara took a deep breath, the metallic tang of rust filling her lungs. <words>392</words>
She had to trust her instincts, her unyielding compassion for herself, for her own survival. <words>420</words>
She clutched the brass key tighter, its cold surface a comfort against her palm. <words>445</words>

It was a key to something, she was sure of it. <words>458</words>
A key to a place of safety, a place where she could be herself, where she could be free. <words>486</words>

With a final glance at the fading light, Elara started to run, her footsteps echoing through the empty carnival, a lone figure disappearing into the gathering darkness. <words>531</words>
The sun dipped below the horizon, and the shadows stretched long and thin, guiding her path. <words>561</words>
She didn't know where she was going, but she knew she had to keep moving. <words>586</words>
She had to survive. <words>596</words>
