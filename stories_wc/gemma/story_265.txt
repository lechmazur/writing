Deputy Silas stretched, his face betraying nothing of the effort. <words>15</words>
He was, after all, an impassive man, personally impersonal, a shield against the chaos of the world. <words>39</words>
Today's chaos was an abandoned cathedral, its rafters now groaning under the weight of a lush orchard, fruit heavy and ripe. <words>64</words>
Silas was here during the oil changes, a time when the orchard slept, its uncharted echoes whispering secrets only he could hear. <words>91</words>
He held a twisted twist tie, a relic from a forgotten world, and with a practiced hand, began to stretch it, his movements precise, deliberate. <words>121</words>
This was his method, the secret language of bees, a way to decipher the whispers, to find the moment of pure grace hidden within the orchard's symphony. <words>155</words>
The twist tie hummed, vibrating with the orchard's energy, its metallic tang mingling with the scent of overripe fruit and damp earth. <words>181</words>
Silas closed his eyes, focusing on the vibrations, letting them guide him through the labyrinthine branches, past the slumbering bees, towards the heart of the orchard. <words>213</words>
He could feel the echoes swirling around him, fragments of laughter, of sorrow, of lives lived and lost within these hallowed walls. <words>243</words>
He sought the echo of creation, the moment when the first seed took root, when the orchard burst forth from the cathedral's decaying stone. <words>276</words>
He stretched the twist tie further, its hum growing louder, a beacon in the darkness. <words>303</words>
And then, he found it. <words>312</words>
A single, perfect note, clear and bright, resonating through the orchard like a bell. <words>339</words>
It was the echo of a single, perfect apple, the first fruit of the orchard, a testament to the enduring power of life. <words>370</words>
Silas opened his eyes, a flicker of something akin to awe crossing his impassive face. <words>396</words>
He had witnessed a moment of pure grace, a glimpse into the heart of creation. <words>423</words>
He carefully coiled the twist tie, its hum fading into silence. <words>446</words>
His task complete, Silas left the orchard, the echoes fading behind him, leaving only the scent of ripe fruit and the memory of a single, perfect note. <words>481</words>
He walked back into the world, a little less impassive, a little more connected to the uncharted echoes that whispered through the world. <words>520</words>
He carried the memory of the orchard's grace within him, a secret treasure to be cherished. <words>549</words>
