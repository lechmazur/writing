The old mage, his beard a tangled thicket of frost, shuffled through the arctic research greenhouse, his gaze fixed on the fragment of a pharaoh's coffin clutched in his gnarled hand. <words>38</words>
He wasn't sure why he'd come here, to this sterile, humming space amidst the playground's joyous cacophony. <words>65</words>
Perhaps it was the uncharted frontier of the arctic, a blank canvas upon which he could inscribe his own arcane will. <words>95</words>
Or maybe it was the fragment itself, whispering promises of forgotten magic, of a power that resonated with the ancient, primal fear that thrummed beneath his skin. <words>135</words>

He stopped before a wall of shimmering glass, the greenhouse's boundary against the biting wind. <words>162</words>
His reflection stared back, a spectral echo of his own weariness. <words>184</words>
He raised the coffin fragment, its surface cold against his palm, and pressed it against the glass. <words>211</words>
The reflection rippled, the image of the old mage dissolving into a swirling vortex of sand and starlight. <words>241</words>

A chill, deeper than the arctic air, seeped into his bones. <words>261</words>
He saw himself, younger, his eyes burning with a fervent ambition, standing before a towering pyramid, the desert wind whipping at his robes. <words>294</words>
He was surrounded by others, acolytes and apprentices, their faces alight with awe and trepidation. <words>324</words>
They were attempting to open the pharaoh's tomb, to claim the secrets hidden within. <words>353</words>

The memory faded, replaced by another, this one fragmented and hazy. <words>378</words>
He saw a flash of gold, a glimpse of a sarcophagus, and then darkness. <words>404</words>
He felt a searing pain, a betrayal that cut deeper than any blade. <words>429</words>
He stumbled back, his breath catching in his throat. <words>452</words>

The greenhouse shimmered back into focus, the children's laughter a jarring counterpoint to the dread that coiled in his gut. <words>484</words>
He looked down at the coffin fragment, its surface now dull and lifeless. <words>511</words>
He had been so close, so close to unlocking the pharaoh's secrets. <words>536</words>
But something had gone wrong, something he couldn't quite grasp. <words>561</words>

He clutched the fragment tighter, a desperate need to understand, to reclaim what he had lost, surging through him. <words>592</words>
He would find the answers, even if it meant wandering through these ephemeral encounters with his own reflection, through the fractured memories of a past he could barely remember. <words>630</words>
He would claim the uncharted frontier, not of land or sky, but of his own forgotten history. <words>661</words>

He closed his eyes, seeking solace in the cold embrace of the arctic air, and cuddled the fragment against his chest. <words>692</words>
The playground's laughter faded, replaced by the whisper of the wind, a mournful song that echoed the sanctified dread that had become his constant companion. <words>728</words>
