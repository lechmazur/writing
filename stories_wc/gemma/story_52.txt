The marketplace bustled with the usual cacophony of bartering and gossip, a symphony of haggling and laughter echoing off the worn cobblestones.  <words>38</words>
But Finn, perched precariously on a stack of dusty crates, barely registered the noise. <words>62</words>
His gaze was fixed on a woman across the square, her fiery red hair a beacon in the fading light. <words>88</words>
She was the reason he was here, the reason he'd risked everything to enter this time-worn marketplace inside a giant hourglass, a place where time itself seemed to slip through your fingers like sand. <words>136</words>
He clutched the broken pencil sharpener in his pocket, a pathetically inadequate token of his affection. <words>164</words>
It was a reminder of their shared childhood, of stolen moments spent sharpening pencils and dreaming of a world beyond the hourglass. <words>198</words>
He'd been a hopeful pickpocket then, nimble fingers always reaching for something more, something better. <words>230</words>
But she, with her tastefully offensive wit and a heart that burned brighter than any star, had shown him the depths of devotion. <words>266</words>
Now, the chalk lines on the sidewalk were fading, a sign that their time was running out. <words>294</words>
He had to tell her, to share the secret that seared his soul, a truth so profound it could shatter the very fabric of their reality. <words>328</words>
But how? <words>335</words>
His voice, usually quick with a joke or a lie, caught in his throat. <words>360</words>
Then, a melody drifted through the marketplace, a melancholic tune that tugged at his heartstrings. <words>390</words>
It was a song they used to sing together, a duet that had once filled their days with laughter and hope. <words>422</words>
An idea, audacious and reckless, materialized in his mind. <words>447</words>
He scrambled down from his perch, his heart pounding a frantic rhythm against his ribs. <words>475</words>
He would sing. <words>482</words>
He would pour his soul into every note, every word, and hope that she would understand. <words>511</words>
He pushed through the crowd, his eyes fixed on her, and as the music swelled, he began to sing. <words>540</words>
His voice, rough and untrained, rose above the din, a raw expression of his love and longing. <words>572</words>
And then, miraculously, she joined in. <words>588</words>
Their voices intertwined, a tapestry of shared memories and unspoken desires. <words>616</words>
In that moment, time seemed to stand still, the hourglass frozen, the world outside fading away. <words>646</words>
There was only them, their voices echoing through the marketplace, a testament to the depths of their devotion. <words>680</words>
