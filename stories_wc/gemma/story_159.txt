The sandstone walls hummed with the soft glow of floating lanterns, casting intricate shadows that danced and shifted with the breeze.  <words>28</words>
King Oberon, once ruler of a prosperous kingdom, now a homeless philosopher-king, sat cross-legged in the heart of the labyrinth. <words>59</words>
His crown, a tarnished silver circlet, rested beside him, a relic of a life he'd willingly abandoned. <words>86</words>
He clutched a weather-beaten kaleidoscope, its brass casing worn smooth by years of handling. <words>115</words>
It was his only companion in this desolate, yet strangely beautiful, sandstone maze. <words>143</words>
Oberon wasn't lost, not in the traditional sense. <words>161</words>
He knew the labyrinth's paths intimately, every twist and turn, every dead end and hidden alcove. <words>191</words>
But he was lost in a labyrinth of his own making, a labyrinth of thought, of memory, of betrayal. <words>222</words>
He sought a way out, not from the physical maze, but from the prison of his own mind. <words>251</words>
The kaleidoscope, a gift from his beloved queen before her untimely demise, was his tool. <words>279</words>
He believed its fractured reflections held the key to unlocking the labyrinth's secrets. <words>308</words>
His method was earnestly frivolous, bordering on absurd. <words>330</words>
During the nightly readings held within the labyrinth, Oberon would extend his hand, offering confetti-coded proposals to couples about to be wed. <words>361</words>
Each proposal, a kaleidoscopic burst of color, represented a different path through the labyrinth, a different interpretation of its meaning. <words>394</words>
The couples, initially amused, would often indulge him, their laughter echoing through the sandstone corridors. <words>425</words>
But Oberon wasn't seeking amusement. <words>439</words>
He was searching for a pattern, a resonance, a clue that would lead him to the heart of the labyrinth and, perhaps, to the truth behind his queen's betrayal. <words>471</words>
He believed that by observing the choices made by these couples, by witnessing their hopes and dreams reflected in the confetti, he could decipher the labyrinth's hidden language. <words>504</words>
Each confetti-coded proposal was a gamble, a desperate attempt to find meaning in the chaos. <words>533</words>
And with each passing night, with each new couple, Oberon felt himself inching closer to the truth, closer to understanding the labyrinth, and perhaps, closer to forgiving his queen. <words>566</words>
The sandstone walls seemed to whisper encouragement, the floating lanterns casting a warm glow on his weathered face. <words>597</words>
He was no longer just a homeless philosopher-king, but a seeker, a pilgrim on a journey of self-discovery. <words>628</words>
And in the heart of the labyrinth, surrounded by the echoes of laughter and the soft glow of lanterns, he felt a flicker of hope. <words>659</words>
