Father Michael, his collar long since traded for a threadbare scarf, jogged through the orchard.  <words>22</words>
Each step crunched on the frost-covered ground, the sound swallowed by the unnatural hush that had settled over the world. <words>46</words>
He wasn't sure how long he'd been running, time seemed to have lost all meaning in this place. <words>71</words>
The giant beanstalks, their leaves tinged with the dull radiance of a dying sun, stretched impossibly high, their tops lost in the swirling clouds. <words>104</words>
He followed the intricate patterns in the snow, a labyrinthine trail that seemed to shift and change with every blink. <words>133</words>
He clutched the abacus in his hand, its smooth wood cold against his palm. <words>155</words>
Several beads were missing, their absence a constant reminder of the price he'd paid for his complacency. <words>183</words>

He'd been a man of faith once, a shepherd guiding his flock. <words>203</words>
But doubt had crept in, slowly at first, then with a vengeance. <words>225</words>
He'd turned away from his calling, seeking solace in the mundane, in the comfort of routine. <words>253</words>
And then the world had changed. <words>266</words>
The sky had bled crimson, the earth had groaned, and the whispers of fate had become deafening. <words>294</words>

He'd been given a choice: accept his fate, or fight for something more. <words>319</words>
He'd chosen the latter, driven by a sudden, unapologetically confused yearning for something he couldn't quite grasp. <words>351</words>
The abacus, a relic from his past, had been his only guide. <words>371</words>
Each missing bead represented a decision, a moment where he'd chosen comfort over courage. <words>399</words>

He wasn't sure where the path led, but he knew he had to keep moving. <words>424</words>
The hush of fate unraveling pressed down on him, a suffocating blanket of inevitability. <words>452</words>
But somewhere, deep within him, a spark flickered. <words>468</words>
A spark of defiance, a refusal to be a pawn in a game he didn't understand. <words>494</words>
He would step beyond fate's design, even if it meant walking into the unknown. <words>522</words>

He quickened his pace, the snow crunching under his feet, the abacus a cold weight in his hand. <words>551</words>
He was a lapsed priest, a man lost in a labyrinth of his own making. <words>577</words>
But he was also a man determined to find his way back to the light. <words>602</words>
