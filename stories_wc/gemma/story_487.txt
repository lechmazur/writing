The air throbbed with the relentless pulse of drums, a primal rhythm that vibrated through the humid air of the greenhouse.  <words>28</words>
Boris, a mountain of a man with hands the size of shovels, stood unfazed, his face a mask of disturbingly calm. <words>55</words>
He was a docile bruiser, a contradiction in terms, but one that fit him perfectly. <words>81</words>
Around him, the labyrinthine paths of the greenhouse teemed with life, but not the kind that bloomed in sunshine. <words>108</words>
Giant Venus flytraps snapped their jaws, their crimson tongues glistening with dew and something darker. <words>139</words>
Vines thick as pythons slithered across the ground, their thorns glinting like obsidian daggers. <words>168</words>
Boris navigated this botanical nightmare with the grace of a dancer, his massive frame somehow weaving through the deadly foliage with ease. <words>201</words>
He was searching, driven by a purpose that transcended the immediate danger. <words>228</words>
He sought the conductor’s baton, a legendary artifact rumored to hold the power to raise the dead. <words>259</words>
The map, a tattered and fragmented thing, had been his only clue. <words>283</words>
He’d found it tucked beneath the floorboards of his grandmother’s attic, a relic from a life she’d never spoken of. <words>313</words>
Piece by piece, he’d painstakingly reconstructed it, the faded ink whispering of a hidden chamber within the greenhouse. <words>346</words>
The drums grew louder, their insistent beat echoing through the glass walls, a symphony of chaos. <words>378</words>
Boris pressed on, his eyes scanning the dense foliage for any sign of the entrance. <words>406</words>
He understood the language of this place, the silent communication of predator and prey. <words>435</words>
He knew the rhythm of the vines, the snap of the traps, the rustle of unseen creatures in the shadows. <words>466</words>
He was a man of few words, but his actions spoke volumes. <words>490</words>
He was a sculptor, molding a myth from the mud of reality. <words>517</words>
He wanted to prove the legend true, to bring back what was lost, to bridge the chasm between life and death. <words>549</words>
And then he saw it, a barely perceptible shift in the pattern of the leaves, a subtle change in the air. <words>581</words>
He reached out, his massive hand parting the foliage, revealing a narrow opening in the wall. <words>612</words>
He stepped through, the drums fading behind him, replaced by a silence so profound it felt like a physical presence. <words>644</words>
In the center of the chamber, bathed in a shaft of moonlight, lay the baton. <words>670</words>
It was simple, unassuming, a slender piece of polished wood. <words>694</words>
But in Boris’s hands, it felt alive, pulsing with a power that sent shivers down his spine. <words>724</words>
He raised it high, the moonlight catching the smooth surface, and with a twist, he unleashed the power within. <words>754</words>
The air crackled with energy, the silence shattered by a sound that was both beautiful and terrifying. <words>785</words>
The dead were coming. <words>798</words>
