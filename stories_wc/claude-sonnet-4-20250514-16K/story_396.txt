Margot shuffled through the underground science fair beneath the Palais des Invalides, her weathered canvas bag containing yet another forgotten treasure—a thirteenth-century stained-glass fragment she'd plucked from demolition rubble weeks ago. <words>30</words>

The subterranean champagne vault, repurposed for this annual exhibition of preservation technologies, echoed with the distant strains of a quartet's final performance filtering down from the streets above. <words>56</words>

She paused at a booth displaying molecular stabilization techniques, her fingers absently tracing the glass shard's azure edge while pretending to read about crystalline preservation methods. <words>79</words>

"Excusez-moi, madame," came a precise voice behind her, tinged with what sounded like Japanese inflection. <words>95</words>

Margot turned, blinking owlishly at a young man in an expensive suit who was studying her fragment with uncomfortable intensity. <words>113</words>

"That piece," he said, switching to careful English, "it appears to be from Sainte-Chapelle's original windows, oui?" <words>130</words>

She instinctively clutched the bag tighter, her forgetfulness about mundane things sharply contrasted by her photographic memory for Paris's architectural wounds. <words>148</words>

"Perhaps," she replied with studied indifference, though her pulse quickened. <words>158</words>

"My corporation specializes in repatriating cultural artifacts to their proper institutional homes," he continued, producing an elegant business card. <words>175</words>

The performance above crescendoed, violin notes weeping through limestone and mortar as Margot considered his proposition with the same detached interest she might show a particularly unremarkable dandelion. <words>198</words>

"This little fragment," she murmured, "has survived seven centuries of wars, revolutions, and urban planning committees." <words>214</words>

She watched him calculate its market value, his corporate efficiency clashing against her intuitive understanding that some treasures were too fragile for institutions with their climate controls and security systems. <words>238</words>

"We could offer substantial compensation," he pressed, misreading her hesitation as mercenary consideration. <words>251</words>

Margot almost laughed at the cultural chasm between them—he saw profit and provenance, while she saw a wounded creature requiring unconventional sanctuary. <words>270</words>

"Non," she said finally, her voice carrying the weight of someone who'd spent decades witnessing Paris devour itself and regurgitate sanitized versions. <words>288</words>

The music above reached its final movement, each note a reminder that beautiful things ended, were lost, were found again by those willing to wander forgotten spaces. <words>309</words>

She began walking toward the vault's exit, leaving him standing beside his booth of preservation technologies that couldn't preserve the essential wildness of discovery. <words>329</words>

"At least consider—" he called after her. <words>336</words>

"I already have," Margot replied without turning back, the glass fragment warm against her palm like a small, breathing thing she'd rescued from yet another well-intentioned destruction. <words>359</words>

Above ground, the final notes faded into Parisian twilight, and she disappeared into the labyrinth of streets where true preservation happened quietly, stubbornly, one forgotten treasure at a time. <words>382</words>

The young businessman stood alone in the champagne vault, surrounded by technology designed to freeze history in perfect, lifeless amber. <words>400</words>
