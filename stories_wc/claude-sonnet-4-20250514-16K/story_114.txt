Kira drummed her fingers against the rustic coffee grinder, its weathered bronze surface cool beneath her touch in the abandoned dream recording studio. <words>21</words> Three months had passed since the Ocean God's final breath dissolved into sea foam, leaving the coral reefs as brittle bone fragments scattered across the ocean floor. <words>43</words> She should have felt urgency, desperation even, but instead she yawned and settled deeper into the plush recording chair, embracing what she proudly called her "enthusiastic laziness." <words>68</words>

The shared dream studio hummed with residual psychic energy, its crystalline walls still echoing with the last recorded dreams of dying sea creatures. <words>88</words> Kira had been summoned here by the Reef Council, though she'd arrived fashionably late and immediately complained about the uncomfortable furniture. <words>107</words> "There has to be an easier way," she muttered, examining the matching empty frames hanging throughout the deserted hall that connected the recording chambers. <words>128</words>

Each frame once held portraits of the Ocean God's memories, but now they gaped like hollow eyes, waiting for new visions to unfold within their borders. <words>150</words> Kira's mentor had spoken of river wisdom—ancient knowledge that flowed from mountain springs to ocean depths, carrying secrets of regeneration and growth. <words>172</words> The coffee grinder wasn't for coffee at all, but for grinding the crystallized tears of the river spirits, creating a powder that could bridge the gap between water memories. <words>199</words>

With a theatrical sigh that would have impressed drama critics, Kira began turning the grinder's handle with deliberately slow, precise movements. <words>218</words> The crystalline dust sparkled as it fell, and she sprinkled it across the threshold of the first empty frame. <words>236</words> "If I'm going to save the world, I'm doing it from a comfortable position," she announced to no one in particular. <words>256</words>

The frame shimmered, and suddenly river wisdom began to unfold before her—streams of silver knowledge flowing through the air, showing her exactly how coral polyps could be coaxed back to life through dream-song frequencies. <words>288</words> Each frame revealed another piece of the puzzle: the precise harmonic resonance needed, the lunar timing required, the specific emotional wavelengths that would call new life from dead calcium. <words>313</words>

Kira smiled with gentle sharpness, her apathy dissolving into something resembling professional interest. <words>325</words> The dying god's final gift hadn't been despair, but rather the clearing away of old methods, making space for newer, more efficient approaches. <words>346</words> She wouldn't need to dive into freezing waters or perform elaborate rituals—just record the right dreams and broadcast them to the sleeping ocean floor. <words>368</words>

"Sometimes the laziest solution is the most elegant," she murmured, already planning how to automate the entire reef restoration process from the comfort of the studio's reclining chairs. <words>390</words> As the frames continued to unfold their aquatic secrets, Kira began her work with characteristic efficiency disguised as effortless ease. <words>406</words>
