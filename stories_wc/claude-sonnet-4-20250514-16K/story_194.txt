Marcus swung his axe with the same gracefully awkward precision he used to navigate the crystal stemware at Memento Mori, the ancient ossuary turned gourmet restaurant where he'd been working nights. <words>30</words> The spirited lumberjack had stumbled into this macabre establishment three months ago, drawn not by its reputation for serving truffle risotto among centuries-old skulls, but by whispered rumors of the chef's knowledge of forgotten healing traditions. <words>60</words>

Throughout his evening bike rides home, pedaling past moonlit forests toward his cabin, Marcus wrestled with reawakened nightmares that seemed to unlock fragments of memory and purpose. <words>82</words> In these dreams, he saw himself not just as a tree-feller, but as someone meant to revamp an ancient practice of forest medicine his grandmother had taught him before the cancer took her voice. <words>108</words>

Tonight's shift had been different. <words>113</words> While polishing bone fragments embedded in the restaurant's walls, Marcus discovered a coded letter wedged behind a medieval femur, its contents written in symbols that made his blood run cold. <words>138</words> The message spoke of a future war, one where traditional healing knowledge would become humanity's last hope against biological weapons that conventional medicine couldn't touch. <words>162</words>

The letter revealed hidden agendas that connected the restaurant's eccentric owner, Dr. Corvina, to a network of healers secretly preserving old wisdom. <words>181</words> Marcus realized his "accidental" hiring had been orchestrated—they'd been watching him, knowing about his bloodline's connection to the lost healing arts. <words>201</words>

As he pedaled harder through the darkness, Marcus felt the harsh tenderness of truth settling into his bones like winter cold. <words>220</words> Dr. Corvina hadn't just been teaching him to identify medicinal herbs growing in the restaurant's hidden garden; she'd been preparing him for something larger. <words>241</words> The nightmares weren't random—they were genetic memories awakening, passed down through generations of healers who'd disguised their knowledge as folklore and superstition. <words>263</words>

His gracefully awkward movements in the refined restaurant suddenly made sense; he'd been learning to bridge two worlds, to carry ancient forest wisdom into modern spaces where it would be needed most. <words>290</words> The coded letter had been a test, planted for him to find when Dr. Corvina deemed him ready. <words>306</words>

Marcus coasted to a stop outside his cabin, understanding finally why his dreams had grown more vivid with each bike ride, each shift among the bones. <words>328</words> Tomorrow, he would return to Memento Mori not as a confused lumberjack playing at sophistication, but as a guardian of knowledge that would someday save lives. <words>349</words> The restaurant's ancient walls had whispered their secrets to him through reawakened nightmares, and now he knew his true purpose—to revamp the healing traditions before the future's darkness arrived. <words>375</words> In the distance, his axe gleamed in the moonlight, no longer just a tool for felling trees, but an instrument for harvesting the medicines hidden within them. <words>398</words>
