Maya looked unremarkable enough that airport security never bothered with a second glance, which made her the perfect seer for this particular job. <words>23</words> The abandoned control tower still reeked of stale confetti and cheap champagne from the surprise party that had cleared out an hour ago, leaving behind only scattered plastic cups and the encrypted USB drive she'd been waiting three years to obtain. <words>62</words> She plugged the drive into her laptop with fingers that trembled despite her analytically innovative approach to problems that stumped conventional investigators. <words>82</words>

The encryption was military-grade, layers upon layers of digital knots that would take months to untangle using traditional methods. <words>99</words> But Maya had never been traditional. <words>105</words> She closed her eyes and inhaled deeply, catching the first whisper of petrichor drifting through the tower's broken windows as storm clouds gathered after weeks of drought. <words>128</words>

That scent—earth awakening, secrets surfacing—triggered something ancient in her bloodline. <words>139</words> Her grandmother had called it "seeing through the rain's memory," though Maya preferred to think of it as pattern recognition enhanced by atmospheric pressure changes. <words>161</words> Either way, the encrypted files began to shimmer in her mind's eye like hieroglyphs made of light. <words>177</words>

The mythic relic hidden within the data wasn't gold or jewels, but something far more valuable: financial records proving that Senator Holbrook had been selling weapons to insurgents for over a decade. <words>207</words> Maya's parents had died in one of those attacks, their tour bus blown apart by American-made explosives that somehow found their way into enemy hands. <words>229</words> The official investigation had concluded it was "death by misadventure," a phrase that still made her laugh bitterly whenever she heard it on the news. <words>252</words>

As the rain began to fall in earnest, each droplet seemed to unlock another layer of the encryption. <words>268</words> Bank transfers, shipping manifests, coded communications—all of it flowing together in a web of delayed justice that had taken years to weave. <words>289</words> Maya's innocent face had gotten her close to people who never suspected that the quiet girl with the forgettable features was actually documenting their crimes with photographic precision. <words>316</words>

She saved the decrypted files to seven different secure servers, then leaned back in the dusty control chair and watched lightning illuminate the tower's empty windows. <words>339</words> Tomorrow morning, every major news outlet would receive an anonymous package containing enough evidence to bring down not just Holbrook, but his entire network of accomplices. <words>364</words> 

The scent of rain-washed earth filled her lungs as she smiled that same innocent smile that had fooled so many corrupt officials. <words>384</words> Sometimes justice moved slowly, but it moved nonetheless, and Maya had learned to be very, very patient. <words>400</words>
