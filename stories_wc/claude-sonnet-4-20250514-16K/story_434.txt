Marcus adjusted the recording equipment in his cramped ghost story booth, the red velvet curtains muffling the carnival sounds outside. <words>18</words> As the lonely ringleader of Meridian's Traveling Circus, he had discovered that people's most haunting confessions emerged not under the big top, but in this intimate space between whispered admissions of supernatural encounters. <words>52</words>

The stained napkin lay folded beside his microphone, its yellowed fabric bearing the rusty imprint of his great-grandmother's blood from the night she'd first encountered the flame. <words>76</words> According to ancestral wisdom passed down through five generations of circus families, this seemingly ordinary cloth was the key to controlling spirits that commonly individual mediums could never handle alone. <words>104</words>

"Tell me about the shadow in your kitchen," Marcus prompted his current visitor, though his attention remained fixed on the napkin's peculiar warmth. <words>124</words>

Between whispered confessions, when clients paused to gather courage or wipe away tears, Marcus had learned to watch for the signs. <words>144</words> The recording booth's temperature would drop, electronics would flicker, and then—impossibly—a small flame would materialize above the booth, dancing in perfect zero gravity as if the laws of physics held no meaning here. <words>173</words>

Tonight felt different. <words>176</words> The woman across from him trembled as she described her haunted farmhouse, but Marcus sensed something else listening, something hungry that the napkin's protection might not be enough to outmaneuver. <words>204</words>

"It wants something from me," the woman whispered, her voice cracking. <words>215</words>

The flame appeared suddenly, spinning lazily above their heads in its impossible weightless dance, casting shadows that moved independently of its light. <words>235</words> Marcus gripped the napkin tighter, feeling his ancestors' wisdom pulse through the stained fabric like a heartbeat. <words>251</words>

"Don't look up," he warned softly, his ringleader's instincts taking over as he calculated their options. <words>266</words> The spirit feeding on the woman's fear was growing stronger, but Marcus had learned to use the flame's hypnotic movements as a weapon, drawing malevolent entities into its gravitational impossibility until they became trapped in its endless orbit. <words>303</words>

The playful dread that always accompanied these sessions intensified as the napkin grew hot against his palm. <words>319</words> He began to move it in subtle patterns, mirroring the flame's dance, weaving his great-grandmother's protective ritual into the air between them and the hungry darkness pressing against the booth's walls. <words>347</words>

"Keep talking," Marcus instructed, his voice steady despite the supernatural chaos brewing above. <words>361</words> "Tell me about the first time you saw it." <words>371</words>

As the woman continued her confession, Marcus danced the ancient steps with practiced precision, the stained napkin flowing like a banner in his hands, guarding them both against the inexplicable artifact of terror that sought to claim another soul. <words>406</words>

The flame spun faster, and Marcus smiled grimly, knowing he would outmaneuver death itself if necessary. <words>421</words>
