Kenjiro set down his blade beside the sorting conveyor, watching the last crimson stroke dry on the mural that now adorned the recycling center's eastern wall. <words>24</words> The street artist had vanished into the neon-lit corridors of Neo-Tokyo's industrial district, leaving behind only scattered collage scraps in the waste bin. <words>43</words> 

He approached the discarded fragments with the same lovingly detached precision he'd once reserved for sword forms, understanding that some sacred work required different tools entirely. <words>67</words> The piece of sea pottery in his palm—smooth, translucent green from decades of oceanic tumbling—caught the artificial dawn filtering through the center's glass dome. <words>89</words>

The secret weavers had chosen him for this task, though they never spoke directly, never revealed their faces. <words>106</words> They communicated through coincidence and intuition, through the careful placement of objects that only those with eyes to see would recognize as messages. <words>128</words> The pottery shard was such a message, discovered that morning among the recyclables, bearing the microscopic etch-mark that meant "begin." <words>148</words>

Kenjiro began to meddle with the artist's discarded vision, lifting paper fragments and digital print-outs from the bin with surgical care. <words>167</words> His impossible vow echoed in his mind: to consecrate the boundary between creation and destruction, to prove that endings could become beginnings without losing their essential nature. <words>192</words>

Each scrap told part of a story—a child's drawing of waves, a photograph of cherry blossoms, strips of poetry in languages both ancient and invented. <words>214</words> He arranged them on the concrete floor, guided by the pottery's subtle warmth against his skin, feeling the invisible threads the weavers spun between discarded things. <words>237</words>

The recycling center hummed around him, its massive machines processing the city's creative detritus with industrial indifference. <words>253</words> Yet here, in this space between disposal and renewal, Kenjiro worked with playful seriousness to birth something unprecedented. <words>270</words>

As he positioned the final fragment—a torn corner bearing half a signature—the sea pottery pulsed once with gentle light. <words>287</words> The collage before him had become a mandala of urban memories, each piece connected to its neighbors by invisible lines of meaning that only the secret weavers could fully comprehend. <words>314</words>

He lifted his sword again, not to cut but to consecrate, touching its tip to each corner of the reassembled artwork. <words>331</words> The impossible vow settled into possibility as the boundaries dissolved: destruction became creation, waste became wonder, detachment became the deepest form of love. <words>352</words>

In the distance, another mural began taking shape on another wall, another artist unconsciously preparing tomorrow's sacred scraps. <words>370</words> Kenjiro smiled, understanding his place in the endless cycle the weavers tended so carefully, so invisibly, with such lovingly detached devotion. <words>388</words> The pottery grew warm once more, signaling completion, and he pocketed it gently before walking back into the neon maze of the waking city. <words>408</words>
