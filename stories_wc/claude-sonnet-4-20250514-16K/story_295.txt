Marcus the sellsword stumbled through the witch's herb garden, his usually jovial demeanor cracking like ancient parchment as moonlight danced across rows of nightshade and belladonna. <words>26</words>

The astronomical telescope tucked under his arm felt heavier with each step, its brass surface reflecting the chaos of overturned planters and scattered sage leaves in his wake. <words>52</words>

He was boldly reluctant to admit the truth—that the withering vow binding him to this cursed quest was slowly draining his very essence, transforming him from a cheerful mercenary into something hollow and desperate. <words>84</words>

"Another bloody family tradition," he muttered, kicking aside a ceramic pot that had once contained precious starflower, now reduced to ash by his deteriorating touch. <words>107</words>

The witch had explained it clearly: his grandfather's time capsule, buried beneath the celestial observatory, contained the only treasure that could dethrone doubt from his mind and break the vow that was eating him alive. <words>138</words>

But throughout this transformation, as his skin grew paler and his laugh became forced, Marcus treasured the irony more than the potential salvation. <words>158</words>

His family's tradition of burying time capsules had seemed quaint when he'd first learned about it—each generation hiding artifacts for the next to discover. <words>179</words>

Now, as thorns seemed to reach for him with malevolent intent and the very air around him withered plants into brown husks, he understood the cosmic joke. <words>202</words>

The telescope wasn't just a tool for stargazing; it was the key to finding the exact burial spot, aligned with constellations that only appeared during the vow's final stages. <words>227</words>

Marcus laughed, a sound like breaking glass among the dying herbs, as he realized his jovial nature had been his armor against the family curse all along. <words>250</words>

The garden erupted in elegant mayhem around him—roses blooming black, mint growing wild and sharp as razors, lavender turning to smoke. <words>270</words>

He raised the telescope to his eye, finding the North Star through the chaos, then traced the pattern his grandfather had described in faded letters. <words>291</words>

There, beneath the gnarled roots of an ancient elderberry bush, the brass instrument's lens caught a glint of buried metal. <words>308</words>

As Marcus dug with hands that crumbled soil to dust, he treasured each moment of doubt leaving his mind, replaced by the certainty that some family traditions were worth the elegant mayhem they created. <words>338</words>

The time capsule emerged, sealed with wax and marked with celestial symbols, and the withering vow finally released its grip. <words>356</words>

Throughout the transformation back to his true self, Marcus felt his jovial spirit returning, no longer boldly reluctant but boldly grateful for the chaos that had led him home. <words>381</words>

The herbs around him began to bloom again, as if celebrating the dethronement of doubt, and Marcus treasured the moment when fear became wisdom in a witch's garden under starlight. <words>404</words>
