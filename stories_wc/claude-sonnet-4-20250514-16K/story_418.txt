The old record player wheezed its final, scratchy note into the radioactive wind, and Lyra knew the time had come. <words>18</words> She stood among the twisted apple trees that somehow flourished in this wasteland orchard, their fruit glowing with an eerie phosphorescence that mocked the gray sky above. <words>42</words> The headstrong mage clutched the stained glass box closer to her chest, its rainbow fragments catching what little light filtered through the perpetual dust storms. <words>64</words>

For months, she'd been tenuously certain about what needed to be done—not just to restore color to this bleached world, but to finally reveal the truth she'd buried beneath layers of masculine illusion. <words>92</words> The box contained her most precious secret: remnants of glitter from a costume she'd worn in the before-times, when the world still sparkled and people still danced. <words>117</words>

With bitter laughter that somehow carried notes of genuine joy, Lyra opened the box and let the ancient glitter spill across her palms. <words>136</words> "Oh, what a ridiculous way to save the world," she murmured, but her magic responded eagerly to the shimmering particles. <words>153</words> The glitter began to glow, drawn by her power, and she felt the familiar tingle of transformation magic awakening in her bones. <words>173</words>

She'd spent years projecting masculine strength to lead the other survivors, hiding her true self behind gruff spells and practical robes. <words>191</words> But now, as the glitter swirled around her like a miniature aurora, she allowed her magic to feminize her appearance, softening her features and lengthening her hair into cascading waves of silver-blue. <words>218</words>

"I confess," she whispered to the listening orchard, to the ghosts of the old world, to herself. <words>235</words> "I confess that I am not who you thought I was, and I confess that maybe—just maybe—authenticity is the missing ingredient in every color-restoration spell I've ever attempted." <words>259</words>

The apple trees shivered, their leaves rustling with what sounded almost like applause. <words>272</words> As Lyra stood there, finally herself, the glitter began to spread from her skin to the air around her, painting streaks of rose and gold across the perpetual twilight. <words>296</words> The bitter irony wasn't lost on her—that it took the end of everything for her to find the courage to begin being honest. <words>316</words>

But as color slowly began to seep back into the world, bleeding from her transformed form into the bark of the trees and the soil beneath her feet, Lyra's merry laughter echoed through the wasteland. <words>341</words> The stained glass box now lay empty, but her heart felt fuller than it ever had, even as radioactive winds howled their ancient songs of destruction and renewal. <words>363</words> She was finally ready to paint this gray world with all the colors of her true self. <words>378</words> And perhaps, she thought with characteristic stubbornness, that would be enough to bring back the dawn. <words>394</words>
