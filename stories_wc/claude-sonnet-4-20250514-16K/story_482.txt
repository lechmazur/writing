Mira had not slept in seventy-three hours, her paintbrush trembling as dawn crept through the empty classroom windows below her arboreal workshop. <words>20</words> Suspended among the colossal spotted mushrooms that had sprouted overnight in the abandoned school courtyard, her treehouse studio swayed in the morning breeze, peacefully chaotic with canvases depicting children's faces wreathed in artificial joy. <words>54</words> 

The tapered wizard's hat with its telling bullet hole sat perched on her easel, a reminder of Professor Blackwood who had worn it during every art lesson before the incident. <words>80</words> Behind the painted smiles of her portrait series lay the truth she could never speak aloud—how the beloved teacher had shielded his students from the gunman, how his whimsical hat had taken the fatal shot meant for little Sarah in the front row. <words>118</words>

Mira's method of divination had grown strange in her sleepless state; each midnight found her peering into puddles that formed in the mushroom caps, scrying for glimpses of the children's real faces beneath their protective masks of manufactured happiness. <words>153</words> The visions would devour her remaining energy, but she painted them anyway, compelled by memories that refused to fade. <words>172</words>

Tonight would mark the anniversary, her final obstacle to outlast before she could finally rest. <words>186</words> The school board planned to demolish the building, erasing the last physical connection to that terrible Tuesday when laughter had died in room 12B. <words>206</words> 

She dipped her brush in cerulean blue, the same shade as Blackwood's eyes, and began adding tears to Jenny Morrison's portrait—tears that had been there all along, hidden beneath the girl's rehearsed grin. <words>234</words> The mushrooms pulsed with bioluminescent sympathy, their soft glow illuminating the workshop's organized chaos of paint tubes, sketches, and coffee-stained memories. <words>253</words>

By scrying at midnight, she had learned that some smiles were shields, some teachers were heroes, and some bullets found their mark in fabric rather than flesh. <words>277</words> The children had survived, but their innocence lay buried beneath layers of forced normalcy, much like the paint that obscured their honest expressions in every official school photograph taken since. <words>304</words>

As first light touched the classroom's broken windows, Mira felt the wizard's hat calling to her, its bullet hole a portal to understanding. <words>323</words> She placed it gently on her head, feeling Professor Blackwood's gentle spirit settle around her shoulders like a paint-stained smock. <words>340</words> 

The final portrait—her own reflection in the puddle—revealed a young woman whose insomnia had become a guardian's vigil, whose art preserved truth when memory failed. <words>362</words> With frolicsome regret, she smiled genuinely for the first time in months, knowing she had outlasted the darkness and could finally, peacefully, close her eyes. <words>385</words> The mushrooms swayed like mourners-turned-celebrants, cradling their artist as she drifted into well-earned dreams. <words>400</words>
