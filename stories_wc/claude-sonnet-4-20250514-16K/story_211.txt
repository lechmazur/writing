Marcus flipped his lucky coin in the dusty air of the abandoned schoolhouse, its silver surface catching phantom sunlight that typically never reached this forgotten corner of the ghost town. <words>28</words> The botanical diary lay open on a child's desk, its pressed flowers crumbling like the dreams that once filled these empty classrooms in the hush of the unremembered future. <words>56</words>

"Another round?" he called cheerfully to the circle of shadows he'd arranged around the overturned bottle, his voice echoing with manufactured joy that couldn't quite mask the despair underneath. <words>85</words>

The bottle spun wildly, pointing at nothing, demanding confessions from ghosts who'd long since stopped caring about truth. <words>102</words> Marcus had discovered the diary three days ago, filled with meticulous notes about plants that could duplicate memories, written by some long-dead botanist who'd experimented with power beyond comprehension. <words>128</words>

"I confess," he laughed bitterly, addressing the empty air, "I came here to defy the gravity of hopelessness, but I'm just another fool chasing shadows." <words>150</words> The coin landed heads-up again, as it typically never failed to do since he'd started using the diary's peculiar recipes. <words>169</words>

Each spin-the-bottle confession revealed another layer of corruption seeping through his once-pure intentions. <words>183</words> He'd wanted to bring life back to this place, to duplicate the joy that children's laughter once created within these walls. <words>203</words> Instead, the botanical experiments had twisted his luck into something unnatural, a grotesque parody of fortune that fed on the town's collective sorrow. <words>227</words>

The diary's pages fluttered in a breeze that smelled of forgotten lessons and wilted dreams. <words>242</words> Marcus traced the faded ink with trembling fingers, reading instructions for duplicating hope itself—but the cost was always corruption, always the slow poisoning of everything good. <words>269</words>

"I confess," he whispered to the bottle's pointed accusation, "I've become exactly what I sought to heal." <words>286</words> His lucky streak had transformed into a curse that duplicated his worst impulses, magnifying his greed until even his desire to help had rotted into something selfish. <words>313</words>

The schoolhouse creaked around him like a dying organism, and Marcus realized that his power had never been about luck at all—it was about taking what belonged to the dead and calling it salvation. <words>348</words> He closed the botanical diary with a snap that echoed like breaking bones, his cheerful mask finally cracking to reveal the despair he'd been nurturing all along. <words>374</words>

In the hush of the unremembered future, the lucky gambler finally understood that some forms of hope were too dangerous to duplicate, and some kinds of power too corrupt to wield. <words>402</words>
