Marcus arranged his tools with atypically typical precision in the witch's abandoned incantation chamber, the morning light filtering through cracked windows as he prepared for another day of his forbidden trade. <words>29</words> The chipped ceramic bowl that served as his centerpiece held fragments of obituaries and eulogies, collected during his morning walks through the cemetery district where grieving families discarded their painful memories. <words>58</words> As a black market genealogist, he specialized in reconstructing family histories that others wanted erased, but the weight of unearthing buried secrets had carved guilt deep into his bones. <words>87</words>

Today felt different though, as if he stood on the brink of renewal rather than drowning in another client's desperate need to escape their bloodline. <words>109</words> He picked up his magnifying glass and began to zoom in on the latest eulogy, searching for the subtext that would reveal the truth about the Blackwood family's mysterious disappearance three generations ago. <words>141</words>

The speaker had described the patriarch as "a man who understood sacrifice," but Marcus knew this really meant he had sold his children to settle gambling debts. <words>166</words> Each coded phrase in the carefully worded tribute told a story of shame wrapped in religious platitudes and social respectability. <words>184</words>

Marcus had learned to read between these lines with brazen modesty, never claiming to be more than a simple researcher while knowing his skills rivaled those of the most celebrated historians. <words>213</words> He could trace bloodlines through wedding announcements that omitted crucial details, through birth certificates with suspicious dates, through the careful omissions in death notices. <words>239</words>

But this morning, as he worked in the chamber where desperate souls once sought magical solutions to their problems, Marcus felt something shift within his own chest. <words>266</words> Perhaps it was the way the sunlight caught the chipped edge of his working bowl, or how the dust motes danced like spirits finally finding peace. <words>290</words>

He realized that while he helped others escape their histories, he had trapped himself in his own cycle of guilt over the families his revelations had destroyed. <words>316</words> The Blackwood case might be his last, he decided, setting down his tools with hands that no longer trembled. <words>334</words>

On his next morning walk, instead of collecting discarded eulogies, he would visit the graves of those whose secrets he had exposed. <words>353</words> Not to gather information, but to offer his own kind of eulogy, one that acknowledged both their sins and their humanity. <words>374</words> In that chamber where others had once sought transformation through magic, Marcus finally understood that his path to self-forgiveness lay not in analyzing the dead, but in learning to speak truthfully about the living. <words>404</words>
