Eleanor moved through the brass-laden dining hall with hyperactively serene precision, her fingers trailing along steam pipes that throbbed with mechanical heartbeats. <words>22</words> The patient librarian had waited decades for this moment, when the clatter of gears and hiss of pressure valves would finally drown out the voices that haunted her. <words>45</words> In the hush of a memory reclaimed, she clutched the wrinkled sticker sheet—remnants of childhood treasures that had survived her brother's cruelty. <words>64</words>

The forgotten mixtapes lay scattered across the copper-inlaid table, their plastic cases cracked but labels still legible in her careful script. <words>82</words> "Songs for Marcus" read one, its edges yellowed with time and regret. <words>94</words> Her brother had mocked these musical offerings years ago, crushing her twelve-year-old heart with savage laughter before disappearing into the war machine's grinding appetite. <words>114</words>

Now she arranged the tapes with savage grace, each placement deliberate as clockwork. <words>126</words> The dining hall's automated servers whirred around her, their bronze arms extending meals to phantom guests who would never come. <words>143</words> Eleanor's pulse began to throb against her collar as she peeled away the first sticker—a silver star meant for Marcus's favorite song. <words>164</words>

Steam billowed from ornate vents as she pressed play on the mechanical phonograph, its brass trumpet amplifying forgotten melodies that once carried her love. <words>185</words> The irony cut deep: Marcus had returned from battle three months ago, hollow-eyed and seeking forgiveness, only to find Eleanor's hatred had crystallized into something beautiful and terrible. <words>209</words>

She methodically placed each sticker on the appropriate tape case, recreating the gift she'd planned to give him before everything shattered. <words>229</words> The dining hall's elaborate chandelier cast fractured light through its crystal gears, illuminating her work with cathedral solemnity. <words>246</words> Her hyperactively serene demeanor masked the trembling satisfaction of finally completing what had been broken. <words>261</words>

When the last sticker found its home, Eleanor surveyed her hollow victory. <words>274</words> The mixtapes sat perfect and purposeless, their recipient too damaged by war to appreciate the childhood innocence they represented. <words>292</words> Her old hatred hadn't been buried—it had been transformed into something more refined, a crystal poison that would outlast them both. <words>312</words>

The steam engines throbbed their eternal rhythm as she gathered the completed collection. <words>325</words> Tomorrow she would deliver these musical time capsules to Marcus, watching his face crumble as he realized what his mockery had cost them both. <words>346</words> The patient librarian had learned that some victories taste of ash and copper, their sweetness corrupted by the very perfection of their execution. <words>367</words>

In the savage grace of the steampunk dining hall, surrounded by mechanical ghosts and forgotten dreams, Eleanor finally understood that burying hatred only meant planting it deeper. <words>390</words> The throbbing steam pipes sang her lullaby of revenge, a symphony only she could hear. <words>405</words>
