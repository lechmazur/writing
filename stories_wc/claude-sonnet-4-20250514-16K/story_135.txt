Kestra adjusted the plain metal straw in her leather satchel, its cold surface a reminder of the sacred task ahead. <words>18</words> The ambitious brewer had spent decades perfecting ales that loosened tongues, each recipe crafted to preserve the dying dialects of the wandering caravan folk who sheltered in this frozen harbor. <words>43</words> Steam rose from the mechanical contraptions that powered their wheeled homes, creating an ethereal fog that danced between the ice-locked vessels. <words>63</words>

Her breath crystallized as she approached the weathered carnival poster plastered against an abandoned storefront, its edges curled like ancient parchment. <words>80</words> The faint bruises across its surface told a story that only she had learned to read—a skill passed down through generations of brewers who served as unofficial historians. <words>103</words> Each discoloration marked where desperate fingers had pressed against the paper, tracing routes to settlements that no longer existed. <words>120</words>

The poster advertised attractions from before the great migration, when the wheel's invention had scattered communities across the frozen wasteland. <words>137</words> But Kestra saw more than faded promises of entertainment; she deciphered coordinates hidden in the bruised impressions, pathways to lost enclaves where ancient tongues still whispered. <words>159</words>

Her peculiar faith in these forgotten routes had never wavered, even when skeptics dismissed her linguistic pursuits as folly. <words>176</words> She traced her weathered finger along a particularly deep impression near the poster's corner, feeling the phantom pressure of countless souls who had sought these same lost paths. <words>201</words>

"Another dead end," muttered Joren, her fiercely loyal apprentice, his mechanical cart clanking behind them. <words>215</words> But Kestra shook her head, extracting the metal straw from her satchel and using it to measure the precise depth of each bruise. <words>234</words>

The measurements revealed a pattern—a dialect map encoded in desperation. <words>244</words> She had learned to withstand the harsh skepticism of her peers, understanding that preserving these dying languages required faith in methods others couldn't comprehend. <words>266</words>

"Here," she whispered, pointing to where the deepest impressions converged. <words>275</words> "The Kelvorian speakers went this way. <words>282</words> Their words for 'hope' and 'journey' were the same—'threshka.'" <words>292</words>

Joren's expression softened as understanding dawned. <words>298</words> The mechanical caravans around them hummed with different dialects, each community clinging to fragments of their linguistic heritage while adapting to their mobile existence. <words>321</words>

Kestra carefully documented the coordinates in her journal, adding another piece to the vast puzzle of scattered peoples. <words>337</words> Tomorrow, she would brew a commemorative ale using techniques from the Kelvorian tradition, ensuring their words lived on in liquid memory. <words>356</words>

The frozen harbor stretched endlessly before them, but she knew that somewhere beyond the ice, other communities waited with their own dying tongues. <words>378</words> Her metal straw glinted in the pale light as she packed it away, ready for the next poster, the next set of bruised coordinates leading to forgotten paths. <words>402</words>
