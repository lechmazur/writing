The morning stretching routine had become Kira's only anchor in the biodome's artificial dawn, her lawyer's mind cataloguing each Quechua phrase she whispered while her muscles remembered freedom. <words>26</words> The leftover gift tag crinkled in her pocket—another cryptic dare from Marcus, her old high school rival who'd somehow tracked her to this vertical farm sanctuary floating above the poisoned earth. <words>52</words> "Find the ghost tongue before the harvest moon," it read in his familiar scrawl, and Kira felt that impatiently patient ache return, the same feeling that had driven her to spend three decades defending indigenous language rights before everything went wrong. <words>89</words>

She moved through her stretches with ghostly resolve, each motion deliberate yet urgent, knowing that Marcus's games always had teeth. <words>107</words> The biodome's hydroponic towers hummed around her, their bioluminescent crops casting an ethereal glow that made her feel like she was dancing with specters. <words>128</words> Somewhere in this maze of engineered agriculture, Marcus had hidden clues to the location of the last speaker of Awakatek, a language the corporate tribunals had declared "economically extinct." <words>151</words>

Kira's phone buzzed—another message, another choice point in the labyrinth of chosen paths that had led her here. <words>168</words> The government wanted her for exposing how language extinction laws were being used to steal indigenous lands, and Marcus, now a corporate lawyer, was apparently helping her evade capture while playing his twisted games. <words>194</words> She had to divert suspicion from the biodome workers who'd been harboring her, which meant playing along with his riddles. <words>212</words>

The stretching session ended, but Kira remained motionless, studying the gift tag's edges where Marcus had written coordinates in Cherokee syllabics—a language he'd learned just to torment her during their law school debates. <words>238</words> Her impatiently patient nature warred with itself: rushing might save the Awakatek speaker's recordings, but haste could expose the underground network protecting dozens of other linguistic refugees. <words>261</words> The biodome's recycled air tasted of growing things and hidden purposes, and Kira realized that Marcus's latest dare wasn't just about finding one speaker—it was about choosing which path would define the rest of her fugitive life. <words>293</words>

She pocketed the tag and moved toward the communication hub, where her linguistic database hummed with the voices of the disappeared. <words>310</words> The ghost tongues whispered through her speakers, urgent and fading, and Kira understood that some chosen paths led not to destinations but to the courage to keep walking into the unknown darkness. <words>337</words> Marcus could play his games, but she would divert them into something larger—a final act of preservation before the corporate dawn consumed the last words of the world's forgotten peoples. <words>365</words> The biodome's artificial sun rose higher, and Kira began to run, carrying her catalog of dying voices toward whatever trap or salvation awaited in the vertical gardens ahead. <words>388</words>
