Ranger Kowalski patrolled the apple trees with militant precision, her worn boots echoing against the concrete of Highway 95's abandoned overpass. <words>20</words> In this world after the last human dream faded into silence, she maintained the urban orchard with an intensity that bordered on religious fervor. <words>40</words> Her plain notebook, inherited from her grandmother three decades ago, contained cryptic entries about "the goddess who walks between falling petals." <words>60</words>

The entries fluctuate between lucid observations and fevered prophecies, describing chance encounters with beings that seemed familiarly unknown—like forgotten relatives glimpsed in peripheral vision. <words>83</words> Today, as morning light filtered through the canopy, Kowalski spotted movement near the Honeycrisp section. <words>98</words>

A translucent figure drifted between the branches, its form shifting like heat waves rising from summer asphalt. <words>114</words> Kowalski's heart hammered as she flipped through her grandmother's pages, finding the entry dated exactly forty years ago: "She appears when the city sleeps forever, tending orchards in the sky." <words>143</words>

The apparition paused, turning toward Kowalski with eyes that held the depth of vanished seasons. <words>158</words> "Grandmother always said you'd come," Kowalski whispered, her voice cracking like autumn leaves. <words>171</words> The figure's response came not as words but as a sensation—the memory of soil beneath fingernails, of seeds planted in hope. <words>191</words>

Through these chance encounters, scattered across months of vigilant watching, Kowalski had slowly assembled the truth. <words>206</words> Her grandmother hadn't been the orchard's first guardian; she had been chosen by something older, something that existed in the spaces between cultivation and wilderness. <words>230</words> The notebook's seemingly chaotic entries actually formed a pattern—a instruction manual for catching echoes of divinity in a world stripped of dreams. <words>252</words>

As the goddess-figure began to fade, petals from impossible flowers rained down, each one humming with frequency that made Kowalski's bones resonate. <words>272</words> She scribbled frantically, documenting the encounter with the same obsessive detail that had driven her grandmother. <words>287</words> The orchard demanded this vigilance, this careful cataloging of the supernatural that flourished in humanity's absence. <words>303</words>

When the last petal settled, Kowalski stood alone among her trees, understanding finally why her grandmother had chosen this life of beautiful isolation. <words>323</words> The highway overpass groaned softly in the wind, its repurposed concrete now serving as holy ground where the mundane world touched something infinitely larger. <words>347</words> She closed the notebook, already planning tomorrow's patrol route, knowing that the goddess would return when the conditions aligned properly. <words>367</words> In this organized chaos of post-human existence, Kowalski had found her purpose: guardian of the threshold between earth and whatever lay beyond human comprehension. <words>387</words> The orchard hummed with secrets, and she would faithfully tend them all. <words>399</words>
