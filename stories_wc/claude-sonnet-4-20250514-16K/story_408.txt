Marcus had refused to fight overseas, earning him the title of conscientious objector, but now he found himself valiantly bored in his storm-battered orchard hanging precariously over Willow Ravine. <words>30</words> Every autumn, during the county's craft fairs, he maintained what neighbors called his "watch" - though they didn't understand its true purpose. <words>52</words> With xenial charm, he welcomed visitors who wandered down the treacherous path to his hanging gardens, offering fresh cider and warm conversation. <words>74</words> "Family tradition," he'd explain with a disarming smile, gesturing toward the ancient apple trees that his grandfather had planted decades ago for the harvest festival. <words>99</words> But Marcus wasn't simply continuing a wholesome legacy. <words>107</words> Each visitor received his hospitality while he carefully noted their origins, destinations, and travel patterns in a leather-bound journal hidden beneath loose floorboards. <words>130</words> Throughout the craft fair season, a steady stream of tourists, artisans, and seasonal workers passed through his orchard, unknowingly contributing to his meticulous mapping of human migration routes. <words>157</words> He'd discovered that people revealed the most intimate details about their journeys when offered kindness by a seemingly harmless former soldier who'd chosen peace over violence. <words>183</words> The rusty nail he'd driven into the gnarled trunk of the oldest apple tree served as his marker - each visitor's information was recorded relative to their proximity to that weathered point. <words>215</words> Storm damage from the previous winter had made his orchard appear even more innocent and struggling, which only enhanced his cover. <words>235</words> "Where are you folks headed after the fair?" he'd ask while pouring cider, his voice carrying just the right mix of neighborly curiosity and genuine care. <words>261</words> Marcus had learned that his conscientious objection to war didn't preclude him from gathering intelligence for those who paid well for such detailed information. <words>285</words> The migration patterns he documented weren't for wildlife research or academic study - they were sold to parties interested in tracking movement across state lines for reasons he preferred not to examine too closely. <words>319</words> His valiantly bored demeanor masked a methodical patience that served him well in this work. <words>333</words> As autumn winds rattled the storm-damaged branches above him, Marcus prepared for another day of xenial deception, knowing that each craft fair weekend brought new opportunities to expand his carefully maintained surveillance network. <words>364</words> The neighborhood watch had never suspected that their most helpful member was the very threat they should have been watching for. <words>384</words> His grandfather's harvest tradition had become something far darker, though the apples still tasted sweet and the cider still warmed visitors' hearts before Marcus quietly catalogued their secrets. <words>410</words> Looking out over the ravine as morning mist rose through the damaged orchard, he smiled with coy satisfaction, already anticipating the day's first unsuspecting guest. <words>434</words>
