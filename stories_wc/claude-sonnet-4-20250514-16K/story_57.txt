Lord Pemberton had always been the sort of aristocrat who preferred polishing doorknobs to commanding servants, which explained why he found himself quite content trimming hedges around the MI6 suburban workshop while actual agents plotted inside. <words>32</words>

His unusually perceptive nature—a trait that made him terrible at dinner parties but excellent at noticing when sparrows nested in the rain gutters—had led him to this peculiar employment arrangement. <words>58</words>

As he snipped away at an overgrown boxwood, the building's curious acoustics carried voices through the ventilation system like whispers in a cathedral. <words>78</words>

"The lab rabbit knows too much," Agent Morrison's voice echoed from somewhere within the maze of concrete corridors. <words>94</words>

Pemberton paused, hedge clippers suspended mid-snip, as the unplanned eavesdropping session revealed a most distressing plot. <words>108</words>

"Midnight termination," came another voice. <words>114</words>

"Poor little Duchess," Pemberton murmured, recognizing the name of the workshop's remarkably intelligent test subject who had somehow learned to operate the coffee machine. <words>134</words>

His silent empathy for the creature sparked immediate action, though admittedly action of the most Pemberton-esque variety. <words>149</words>

Abandoning his gardening duties with characteristic decisive submissiveness, he slipped through the service entrance armed only with his grandfather's embarrassingly dull letter opener—a tool so pathetically blunt it couldn't slice butter on a warm day. <words>182</words>

The echo chambers that had betrayed the agents' conversation now guided him through the labyrinthine basement toward the laboratory. <words>198</words>

"Well, this is rather like a gothic novel, isn't it?" he whispered to himself with that peculiar combination of genuine concern and inappropriate levity that defined his approach to crisis. <words>222</words>

Finding Duchess cowering in her cage while a timer counted down nearby, Pemberton examined the sophisticated lock mechanism with growing dismay. <words>241</words>

Then his perceptive eye caught something others had missed: the lock's housing was held together by a peculiar adhesive that would liquify under heat. <words>263</words>

"Terribly sorry about this, old girl," he murmured, using the letter opener to short-circuit the cage's heating element, redirecting the warmth precisely where needed. <words>283</words>

The adhesive melted obligingly, and Duchess bounded free with what Pemberton swore looked like gratitude. <words>298</words>

"Now then, I believe the garden shed needs a new tenant," he announced cheerfully, scooping up the rabbit as alarms began wailing throughout the facility. <words>320</words>

By morning, the official report would mention a "systems malfunction," while Pemberton resumed his hedge-trimming with a small hutch discretely hidden among the tool shed's shadows. <words>343</words>

Agent Morrison never did discover why the coffee machine started working perfectly again, or why Lord Pemberton hummed quite so contentedly during his gardening duties thereafter. <words>366</words>

Sometimes silent empathy required the most delightfully absurd acts of rebellion. <words>378</words>
