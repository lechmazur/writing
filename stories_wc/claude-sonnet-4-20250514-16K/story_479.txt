Vivian DeLacroix adjusted her pearl necklace as she scrolled through the genealogy forum, the glow of her laptop screen reflecting off her perfectly applied crimson lipstick. <words>25</words> While the cerulean paint swirled in the mason jar beside her, she searched the digital archives for traces of her great-great-grandmother Evangeline, the eccentric undertaker who had supposedly invented their family's most sacred ritual. <words>57</words> The myth of ordinariness had always plagued their profession—people assumed death work was merely technical, failing to grasp its profound artistry. <words>76</words> But Evangeline had understood that every corpse deserved to be elongated beyond its earthly confines, stretched into eternity through precise measurement and ceremonial paint. <words>97</words>

Vivian's manicured fingers traced the brass measuring tape that lay coiled beside her computer, its surface worn smooth by generations of DeLacroix hands. <words>117</words> According to family legend, Evangeline had used this very instrument to measure not just bodies, but the spaces between heartbeats, the distance between breath and silence, the gap between life and whatever came after. <words>147</words> The online forum buzzed with amateur genealogists sharing mundane census records and marriage certificates, but Vivian sought something far more elusive. <words>166</words>

She had been fruitlessly patient for months, waiting for someone, anyone, to mention Evangeline's name in these dusty digital corridors. <words>183</words> The paint continued its lazy dance in the jar—a custom shade that Evangeline had supposedly mixed to honor the liminal space between worlds. <words>203</words> Vivian would apply this paint to the measuring tape before each ceremony, transforming the brass into something that could capture not just physical dimensions but metaphysical ones. <words>227</words>

A notification chimed, and Vivian's breath caught. <words>234</words> Someone had posted a daguerreotype of a striking woman in Victorian mourning attire, holding an ornate brass measuring tape. <words>250</words> "Found this in my grandmother's trunk," the caption read. <words>260</words> "She claimed this woman could measure souls." <words>268</words>

Tears of jubilant remorse streamed down Vivian's cheeks, smearing her carefully applied mascara. <words>279</words> Here was proof that Evangeline's legacy lived beyond their family, that the ancient practice of soul-measuring had touched other lives, other stories. <words>300</words> The myth of ordinariness crumbled in that moment—death work wasn't mundane bureaucracy but sacred geometry, connecting the measurable world to the immeasurable beyond. <words>322</words>

Vivian lifted the brass measuring tape reverently, feeling its familiar weight. <words>333</words> Tomorrow, she would continue Evangeline's work, elongating another soul's journey with precise measurements and consecrated paint, preserving the ancient practice that transformed ordinary undertaking into extraordinary art. <words>357</words> The digital archive had given her the greatest gift—confirmation that their family tradition wasn't mere superstition but a bridge between the prosaic world of the living and the profound mystery of the dead. <words>384</words> She closed the laptop with trembling hands, ready to honor Evangeline's memory once more. <words>398</words>
