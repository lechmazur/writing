Marlowe perched three hundred feet above ground in the World Tree's twisted branches, counting the seconds after little Emma's final bedtime story drifted up from the village below. <words>26</words>

The hush that followed was his cue—when nightmares collided with dreams in the liminal space between waking and sleep, creating the perfect hunting ground for a high-altitude con artist. <words>56</words>

His fingers worked methodically through today's arrangement of sticky notes plastered across the bark, each yellow square containing fragments of cosmic melodies that visitors had paid him to "interpret." <words>84</words>

The mundanely terrifying truth was that Marlowe actually could decode these dream-songs, unscrambling the daily reshuffled messages that the Tree whispered to those who climbed high enough to listen. <words>115</words>

Tonight felt different, though—the notes spelled out coordinates leading to a particular branch where someone had tied a faded fabric scrap, barely larger than a thumb. <words>145</words>

As he reached for it, pristine chaos erupted around him: the Tree's leaves began harmonizing in frequencies that made his teeth ache, while below, every sleeping child in the village started humming the same tune. <words>177</words>

The fabric scrap crumbled at his touch, releasing microscopic threads that danced upward like reverse snow, each strand carrying a note of the cosmic lullaby he'd been trying to compose for seventeen years. <words>211</words>

This was why clients climbed to him—not for dream interpretation, but because he was the only one who could further their deepest desires by weaving together the Tree's ancient songs with human longing. <words>244</words>

The sticky notes began rearranging themselves without his touch, spelling out verses in languages that predated human speech, each word a building block of the universal song that could lull entire galaxies to sleep. <words>279</words>

Marlowe realized with crystalline horror that he'd been the one being conned all along—the Tree had been using him to collect these fragments, and now it had enough pieces to complete its cosmic lullaby. <words>316</words>

The song would put everything to sleep: the village, the planet, the stars themselves, creating an eternal hush after the last bedtime story ever told. <words>345</words>

As the melody began flowing through him, Marlowe understood that he had one choice: become the Tree's instrument or find a way to scramble the notes one final time. <words>372</words>

His hands moved frantically across the bark, rearranging sticky notes faster than the Tree could correct them, turning the cosmic lullaby into a chaotic symphony that would keep the universe awake. <words>402</words>

The Tree shuddered, and Marlowe smiled—sometimes the greatest con was convincing creation itself that sleep could wait. <words>418</words>
