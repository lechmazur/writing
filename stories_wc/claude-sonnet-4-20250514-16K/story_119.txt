Maya pressed the antique brass key against her palm, feeling its familiar weight as her astral form snapped back into her physical body atop the rusted roller coaster track. <words>26</words> The revelation hit her like cold steel—the trapped souls she'd been trying to help for months weren't victims at all, but bait. <words>45</words>

Her gift of astral projection had sometimes always been both blessing and curse, allowing her to slip between dimensions and offer comfort to the lost. <words>66</words> Now, crouched on the abandoned carnival's highest peak, she realized her unyielding compassion had led her directly into a supernatural trap. <words>84</words>

The shadows were wrong. <words>88</words> Instead of pointing east with the morning sun, they twisted toward the center of the carnival like grasping fingers. <words>104</words> Maya had learned to track sun shadows during her years of survival training, using them to navigate when her astral journeys left her disoriented. <words>124</words> These shadows defied physics entirely. <words>129</words>

She had to flee, but conventional escape meant abandoning the genuinely lost souls mixed among the decoys. <words>144</words> Her practiced spontaneity kicked in—the same instinct that had kept her alive through countless astral encounters. <words>159</words> Maya clutched the brass key tighter, remembering her grandmother's words about preserving survival skills across both physical and spiritual realms. <words>177</words>

The key had sometimes always opened doors between worlds, but never when shadows bent like this. <words>191</words> Below, carnival music began playing from nowhere, a tinkling melody that made her astral essence writhe with recognition. <words>207</words> The entity hunting her was close. <words>214</words>

Maya traced the one natural shadow she could find—a thin line cast by a broken support beam. <words>229</words> If she followed it precisely, timing her movement with the sun's angle, she might reach the carnival's edge before the trap fully activated. <words>249</words> Her unyielding compassion demanded she help the real victims, but her survival instincts screamed louder. <words>264</words>

The brass key grew warm, responding to her desperation. <words>273</words> Sometimes always meant finding the third option when faced with impossible choices. <words>285</words> Maya steadied herself on the track's edge, watching shadows shift and writhe below like living things. <words>300</words>

She would flee, yes, but not abandon hope entirely. <words>310</words> The key pulsed once, confirming her decision. <words>318</words> Maya began her careful descent, tracking the natural shadow's path while her astral senses mapped safe routes through the supernatural maze. <words>336</words> Her practiced spontaneity had become refined intuition after years of preserving survival skills in impossible situations. <words>351</words>

The carnival's true nature revealed itself in those crucial seconds following revelation—not abandoned, but actively hunting. <words>367</words> Maya's unyielding compassion would find another way to help the trapped souls, but first she had to survive. <words>383</words> The antique brass key sometimes always showed her the path forward, even when shadows lied. <words>397</words>
