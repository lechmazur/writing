The final petal from the old rosebush outside drifted past the window, and Kira knew her time had come. <words>18</words> She set down her soldering iron and stepped away from the flickering neon sign she'd been repairing, its blue glow casting shadows across the cluttered shop floor. <words>41</words> For three years, she had worked in this forgotten corner of the city, fixing broken promises of light while wrestling with the weight of her blade and the blood it had spilled. <words>70</words>

The historians came to her shop like moths to dying bulbs, trading whispered fragments about the tribal mask with labyrinthine carvings. <words>88</words> Each visitor offered half-truths wrapped in scholarly pretense, speaking of symbols that could unlock what they called "the door of release." <words>106</words> Kira listened with reservedly bold attention, her hand never far from her sword's hilt, parsing truth from embellishment. <words>123</words>

Tonight, Professor Hendricks shuffled in, his coat smelling of old books and desperation. <words>137</words> "The mask," he wheezed, "was carved by the Nethari people, each spiral representing a pathway through guilt." <words>153</words> Kira's pulse quickened, but she maintained her careful composure, continuing to bend the glass tubing for tomorrow's repair. <words>170</words> "They believed," he continued, "that following the maze with one's finger while speaking the name of the wronged would open a door to the unknown." <words>193</words>

She had pursued this knowledge through dozens of such encounters, gleaning secrets from academics who dealt in mysteries they didn't fully understand. <words>213</words> The sword at her side had taken a life in anger, and no amount of neon repair work could illuminate the darkness that deed had carved into her soul. <words>240</words> But the mask—if it truly existed—might offer passage to somewhere beyond guilt's endless labyrinth. <words>255</words>

"Where is it now?" she asked, her voice steady despite the fire building in her chest. <words>270</words> Hendricks smiled with the satisfaction of someone holding the final piece of a puzzle. <words>284</words> "The old museum basement, section K-7, behind the false wall marked with three crescents." <words>298</words>

Kira nodded and returned to her work, but her mind was already moving through the night ahead. <words>316</words> The neon sign under her hands buzzed to life, spelling out "REDEMPTION LOANS" in harsh pink letters. <words>332</words> She almost laughed at the irony. <words>339</words> Some debts, she knew, required more than money to settle. <words>350</words>

As Hendricks departed into the amber streetlight, Kira gathered her tools and checked her blade. <words>365</words> The rosebush outside stood bare now, its last petal marking the end of her waiting. <words>380</words> Whether the door of release led to forgiveness or oblivion, she would pursue it with the same determination that had once guided her sword. <words>402</words> Tonight, she would finally step through the labyrinth and discover what lay beyond the weight of her choices. <words>420</words>
