Lady Evangeline Ashworth adjusted the artificial hummingbird drone's wing mechanism, her trembling fingers betraying the hollow recklessness that had consumed her since the family estate burned three months ago. <words>27</words> The spontaneous combustion lab felt more like home than anywhere else now, its sterile walls and chemical burns mysteriously obvious in their indifference to her former title. <words>52</words> Her phone buzzed with another text from her sister, but she ignored it, focusing instead on the scattered ticket stubs from her father's opera collection that littered the metal workbench. <words>79</words>

"These fragments hold more truth than any inheritance," she whispered to herself, beginning to reassemble the torn pieces with surgical precision. <words>98</words> Each stub represented a night when her family had pretended to be cultured, refined, worthy of their crumbling legacy. <words>117</words> The drone hummed softly as she calibrated its sensors, designed to detect the microscopic changes preceding spontaneous combustion in organic materials. <words>135</words>

Her motivation to cut through illusions had driven her here, to this place where pretense burned away as quickly as hydrogen gas. <words>154</words> She fortified her resolve by weaving the ticket stubs into a delicate pattern, each piece a small confession of her family's manufactured sophistication. <words>175</words> The hummingbird's artificial wings beat faster as she programmed it to hover over the reassembled constellation of memories. <words>192</words>

Another text arrived, her sister demanding answers about the missing insurance money. <words>203</words> Evangeline's laugh echoed hollowly through the lab as she realized the mysteriously obvious truth: her sister still believed in their noble facade. <words>223</words> In this small moment of candor with herself, she admitted that burning the estate had been intentional, necessary, cleansing. <words>241</words>

The drone suddenly detected heat signatures rising from the ticket stub arrangement, its sensors confirming what she had suspected. <words>259</words> Her father's collection, soaked in years of expensive cologne and champagne spills, was beginning to smolder. <words>276</words> She watched with hollow fascination as the first flames licked the edges of their false memories. <words>292</words>

The third text arrived as smoke began filling the lab's ventilation system. <words>304</words> This time she answered with brutal honesty: "The money burned with everything else we pretended to be." <words>320</words> She pocketed the hummingbird drone and walked toward the emergency exit, leaving behind the fortified truth spelled out in ash and flame. <words>341</words> Between her sister's furious responses and her own measured replies, Evangeline finally felt the reckless freedom of a forgotten noble who had chosen to forget herself. <words>365</words> The lab's sprinkler system activated behind her, but some fires, she knew, were meant to burn until only honesty remained. <words>383</words> In the parking lot, she released the artificial hummingbird into the night sky, watching it disappear like every other beautiful lie she had finally learned to abandon. <words>406</words>
