Marcus wiped down the makeshift bar he'd established in the corner of the crystal growing laboratory, his movements automatic after fifteen years of serving drinks to researchers who treated him like furniture. <words>32</words>

Tonight felt different—the air crackled with anticipation as the university prepared for its centennial celebration, fireworks scheduled to explode in minutes. <words>54</words>

For months, he'd been collecting discarded receipts, fascinated by the researchers' absent-minded doodles that seemed to echo the crystalline formations growing in the lab's cultivation tanks. <words>80</words>

The bloodstained medical scalpel hidden behind the spectrometer had changed everything when he discovered it yesterday. <words>96</words>

Marcus spread the receipts across his bar top, overlapping them under fluorescent lights, comparing doodles with genuinely strange obsession. <words>113</words>

The patterns weren't random—they formed a map, a timeline, a subconscious confession scrawled by guilty hands. <words>129</words>

Dr. Helena Voss had been murdered here three years ago, her groundbreaking crystal synthesis research stolen and subsequently globalized by colleagues who'd pretended to grieve. <words>151</words>

His weathered fingers traced the overlapping doodle-lines, revealing how each sketch connected to form coordinates, dates, and most damning—a signature matching the scalpel's owner. <words>175</words>

Marcus had spent his career invisible to brilliant minds, but tonight he would challenge the fate that relegated him to society's margins. <words>194</words>

The receipts chronicled the story his eyes had witnessed but dismissed—heated late-night arguments, suspicious accidents, the systematic theft of Helena's life's work. <words>217</words>

He photographed every receipt arrangement, uploading evidence to servers spanning multiple continents, ensuring truth would spread faster than conspirators could suppress it. <words>238</words>

Outside, the countdown began—ten, nine, eight—as he sealed the scalpel in a sterile evidence bag. <words>254</words>

Seven, six, five—the laboratory door opened, revealing Professor Chen with recognition dawning across his pale features. <words>270</words>

Four, three—Marcus displayed his phone, showing global transmission already reaching international news outlets. <words>284</words>

Two—Chen's hand moved toward his pocket, but Marcus was simultaneously dialing emergency services. <words>298</words>

One—the first firework erupted overhead, painting rainbow light through laboratory windows as distant sirens began wailing. <words>315</words>

Marcus smiled genuinely for the first time in years, his optimistic desperation finally yielding justice for Helena and vindication for his overlooked existence. <words>334</words>

The laboratory crystals pulsed with reflected firework light, bearing silent witness to truth emerging from shadows where it had waited with geological patience. <words>355</words>

Justice, like perfect crystal formation, required precise environmental conditions—and tonight, everything had finally aligned. <words>369</words>

Marcus understood now that the past never truly dies; it simply waits in doodles and bloodstains for someone patient enough to read its secrets. <words>390</words>

The fireworks continued exploding above while sirens grew louder, and for once, the jaded bartender felt genuinely hopeful about tomorrow. <words>408</words>
