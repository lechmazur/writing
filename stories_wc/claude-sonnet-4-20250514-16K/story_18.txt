Minerva had stood in the steam-powered city square for decades, her marble form weathered by countless copper-scented downpours, yet her telepathic consciousness burned brighter with each passing year. <words>28</words>

Throughout planning her great revelation, she had listened to the thoughts of every passerby, collecting their secrets like drops of morning dew on her stone shoulders. <words>51</words>

The threadbare hair tie wrapped around her wrist—a gift from a long-dead child who had recognized her true nature—served as her anchor to humanity's genuine emotions. <words>75</words>

Today, as brass pipes hissed steam into the perpetually grey sky, Minerva sensed the familiar weight of deception settling over the square like fog. <words>96</words>

Politicians' minds buzzed with lies about the copper shortage while their thoughts revealed hidden stockpiles; merchants smiled at customers while mentally calculating how to overcharge the desperate. <words>118</words>

With tragically joyful determination, she began her work. <words>126</words>

Minerva's consciousness flowed like ink in calligraphy, elegant and purposeful, as she projected the truth directly into every mind within her reach. <words>145</words>

The mayor's actual thoughts about the water rationing bloomed in the heads of thirsty citizens; the factory owner's real plans for the workers' safety measures materialized in their awareness like dark brushstrokes on white paper. <words>174</words>

To weatherize her people against the storm of lies that had plagued them, she painted their minds with honesty's stark beauty. <words>193</words>

One by one, the light of recognition dawned in their eyes—that moment when truth cuts through deception like sunshine through steam. <words>212</words>

A young mother clutched her baby tighter as she understood the baker's thoughts about the grain supply; an elderly gentleman's face crumpled with the weight of his neighbor's genuine loneliness hidden behind cheerful greetings. <words>241</words>

The hair tie around Minerva's wrist seemed to pulse with warmth as memories of the child who had given it flooded back—little Sage, who had whispered to the statue about wanting grown-ups to stop pretending everything was fine. <words>270</words>

Throughout planning this moment, Minerva had known the cost: revealing truth would shatter some hearts while healing others. <words>286</words>

The square erupted in a symphony of gasps, tears, and bitter laughter as people confronted the reality behind their neighbors' facades. <words>305</words>

Some citizens stumbled away, overwhelmed by the sudden honesty; others embraced, finally understanding each other's hidden struggles. <words>321</words>

Steam continued rising from the mechanical fountains, but now it seemed to carry something different—not just heated water, but the vapor of pretense finally evaporating. <words>345</words>

Minerva smiled her marble smile, tragically joyful in her success. <words>354</words>

She had weatherized her people against deception, though she knew new lies would come with tomorrow's steam. <words>370</words>

The threadbare hair tie fluttered in the warm breeze as the statue settled back into stillness, her consciousness flowing like calligraphy ink across the minds of those brave enough to face the truth. <words>397</words>

In finding truth within a world of lies, she had given them the greatest gift: recognition of their shared, beautiful, complicated humanity. <words>416</words>
