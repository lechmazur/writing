The weatherbeaten knight pressed his scarred palm against the cold mirror, watching his reflection shimmer in the lighthouse prison's only window. <words>20</words> Beyond the glass lay jagged reefs that had claimed countless ships, their broken masts scattered like his own shattered dreams. <words>38</words> 

In the mirror's depths, he saw not his present cell but the moment everything changed—the brass door knocker gleaming in his reflected memory as he'd stood before the castle gates twenty years ago. <words>68</words> The choice had been impossible then: save the innocent child or capture the murderer who'd killed his brother. <words>86</words>

His weathered fingers traced the mirror's surface, and suddenly the reflection revealed objects scattered across his cell floor that he'd never noticed before. <words>106</words> A child's wooden toy, a tarnished coin, a wilted flower, a broken chain—seemingly random items that now formed a perfect circle around him. <words>127</words>

The pattern hit him like lightning: each object represented a choice, a path not taken, a life forever altered by his decisions. <words>147</words> The toy belonged to the child he'd saved; the coin, payment he'd refused from grateful parents; the flower, from the murderer's grave where he'd finally caught him years later. <words>173</words>

Through the mirror, he could hear it again—that final cry of regret echoing across time, the murderer's last words: "I only wanted my sister back." <words>197</words> The knight had learned too late that the "murderer" was merely a grieving brother seeking justice for his own impossible choice. <words>217</words>

The brass door knocker materialized in his reflection, and he understood its grudgingly sweet invitation. <words>231</words> To appreciate the weight of impossible choices was to accept that every decision carried both salvation and sorrow. <words>248</words> His hand moved toward the mirror, ready to grasp the knocker and face whatever lay beyond. <words>264</words>

As his fingers touched the brass surface within the reflection, the lighthouse prison began to dissolve around him. <words>280</words> The cry of regret—his own voice, he realized—finally hushed as he embraced the joyful agony of understanding. <words>296</words> Every choice had been impossible because every choice had mattered. <words>307</words>

The mirror cracked, releasing him from the prison of his own making, and the weatherbeaten knight stepped through into whatever redemption awaited on the other side of impossible choices. <words>332</words> The brass door knocker fell silent, its purpose fulfilled, as the lighthouse faded into the peaceful storm of memory. <words>349</words> In the end, he'd learned to appreciate both the weight of his decisions and the grudgingly sweet truth that regret, too, could be a form of love. <words>374</words>

The reflection finally shattered, and the knight was free. <words>383</words>
