Kenji had wandered for three decades, designing fireworks displays that bloomed and faded like his memories of Yuki. <words>17</words> The collection of pressed leaves in his weathered satchel held fragments of their shared autumns, each one a bookmark in the story he'd failed to finish. <words>38</words> Now, following frost patterns etched across his rental car's windshield that morning, he'd discovered something impossible: a hidden library nestled behind the cascade of Takahashi Falls. <words>64</words>

The building seemed theoretically creative in its defiance of physics, its stone walls glistening with perpetual mist while remaining mysteriously dry inside. <words>83</words> Ancient volumes lined shelves that spiraled upward into shadows, and Kenji recognized the familiar puzzle of this place—it felt like the riddles Yuki used to pose during their university days. <words>107</words>

Time moved differently here, minutes stretching and compressing within the ephemeral nature of existence itself. <words>124</words> As he climbed the spiral stairs, subtle paths began unfolding in his mind, connections he'd never noticed before. <words>141</words> The frost patterns he'd followed weren't random—they matched the delicate veining in the maple leaf pressed between pages fifty-seven and fifty-eight of his notebook. <words>164</words>

On the highest shelf, a single tome waited, its cover unmarked except for a small indentation shaped exactly like the ginkgo leaf Yuki had given him the day before the accident. <words>189</words> Inside, pages revealed themselves as he needed them, showing equations that could augment pyrotechnic formulas with something beyond chemistry—with memory itself. <words>208</words>

Kenji spread his pressed leaves across the ancient reading table, each one corresponding to a formula in the book. <words>224</words> The patterns in the frost had been a map, leading him to this moment where science and sentiment could finally converge. <words>242</words> He understood now that his three decades of wandering hadn't been aimless—they'd been preparation for this discovery. <words>259</words>

Working through the night that felt both eternal and instantaneous, he designed his masterpiece: fireworks that would bloom in perfect recreation of autumn leaves, each burst timed to unfold like the seasons they'd never share. <words>288</words> The display would correct his life's deepest regret—not the words left unspoken, but the beauty left unshared. <words>304</words>

As dawn approached, the library began to fade with the mist, but the knowledge remained burned into his memory like afterimages of light. <words>324</words> Kenji descended through the waterfall, his satchel now lighter, his purpose finally clear. <words>337</words> Tonight, he would launch his creation above the city where Yuki rested, painting the sky with pressed leaves and impossible mathematics. <words>356</words> The subtle path had led him home at last, to the intersection of regret and redemption, where love could bloom again in burst of calculated fire. <words>378</words> Time would remain ephemeral, but this moment—this correction—would burn eternal in the darkness above. <words>393</words>
