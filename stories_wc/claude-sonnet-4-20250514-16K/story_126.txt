Captain Elara Voss pressed her weathered palm against the cold viewport of the abandoned observation deck, watching Earth's barren surface rotate below like a corpse in space. <words>25</words> Three months since her cargo vessel had been destroyed by debris from the dying planet, and still the station's automated systems played cheerful recordings about Earth's "temporary environmental adjustment period." <words>52</words> The lies nauseated her with their honestly strange persistence, as if repetition could resurrect forests from ash. <words>68</words>

Behind her sat the rustic butter churn she'd salvaged from her ship's galley—a relic from her grandmother's farm, now more valuable than any synthetic protein dispenser. <words>92</words> The wooden artifact felt obscene in this sterile environment, its hand-carved surface a mockery of everything humanity had destroyed. <words>109</words> She'd carried it through the ghost station's corridors, past flickering holographic advertisements for Earth vacations that would never come. <words>127</words>

The rebellious sparks had started small—disconnecting propaganda feeds, sharing forbidden footage of the last tree falling in sector seven. <words>144</words> But Elara's merchant instincts recognized a larger truth: the station's elite were preparing to abandon this orbital graveyard, leaving the lower decks to die with their illusions intact. <words>169</words> Their grand illusion of eventual planetary restoration was just another product being sold to desperate consumers. <words>184</words>

She approached the travel poster near the maintenance shaft, its edges flaking like diseased skin. <words>198</words> "Visit Beautiful Earth—Where Every Day is Earth Day!" the faded text proclaimed, showing impossible green meadows. <words>214</words> Elara gripped the poster's corners and began to ascend through the gap it concealed, her grandmother's churn secured to her back. <words>232</words>

The shaft led upward toward the station's communication array, where she would broadcast what she'd discovered in the merchant files—evacuation schedules, resource hoarding, the calculated abandonment of millions. <words>256</words> Her movements carried an aloof passion, the detached fury of someone who'd lost everything but gained terrible clarity. <words>272</words>

The churn's weight pressed against her spine as she climbed, a reminder of simpler times when cream became butter through honest labor rather than corporate alchemy. <words>296</words> Soon she would shatter their carefully constructed narrative, revealing the rebellion's ultimate truth: Earth was finished, but humanity's future didn't have to be. <words>318</words>

As sparks flew from damaged conduits around her, Elara smiled grimly. <words>329</words> She would transform this ghost station into something honestly strange—a place where truth replaced marketing, where the last shipwrecked merchant would ascend to become the first honest voice in the void. <words>355</words> The butter churn would witness humanity's next revolution, even if it began with the death of their most beautiful lie. <words>374</words>

Above her, the communication array waited like a pulpit for the galaxy's most important sermon. <words>388</words> Earth was dead, but rebellion had just been born. <words>397</words>
