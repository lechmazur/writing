Ziggy Stardust-Morrison (yes, that was her real name, courtesy of hippie parents and a studio contract) pressed her palms against the humming walls of the vibration analysis chamber, her authentically odd collection of mood ring jewelry casting prismatic shadows in the sterile light. <words>39</words>

The crumpled treasure map—torn from a prop Bible during her disastrous teen comeback attempt—lay spread across the chamber's central console like a patient on an operating table. <words>65</words>

After the last secret is revealed, she'd learned, the real treasure hunt begins. <words>79</words>

"Twenty-three years of Hollywood's artificial magic," she muttered to the empty laboratory, her voice deliberately theatrical in that way that made normal people uncomfortable, "and now I'm finally ready to tap into the wild magic of madness." <words>114</words>

The map's cryptic symbols had led her here, to Dr. Pemberton's abandoned acoustic research facility, where she'd discovered something magnificently absurd: the vibration analysis chamber could detect frequencies that trickled through the hidden layers of etched glass in the cathedral window embedded impossibly in the chamber's north wall. <words>166</words>

Ziggy had installed the window herself last month, salvaged from a demolished church, because the map's final clue demanded "where sacred sound meets profane science." <words>191</words>

She'd paid the price of ambition once—her childhood, her sanity, her ability to exist normally in the world—and found it wanting. <words>212</words>

The chamber's sensors detected her heartbeat, her breathing, the subtle tremor in her hands as she adjusted the frequency dials with the precision of someone who'd spent decades hitting her marks under stage lights. <words>242</words>

Through the etched glass, something began to trickle—not water, not light, but something that made the air taste like copper pennies and forgotten prayers. <words>266</words>

The vibration analysis equipment screamed in electronic ecstasy as impossible frequencies cascaded through its sensors, each pulse revealing layers of reality that her former co-stars, now trapped in their suburban normalcy, would never comprehend. <words>295</words>

Ziggy laughed, a sound both bitter and triumphant, as the treasure map's true purpose became clear: it wasn't leading to gold or jewels, but to this moment when the universe's hidden frequencies would either drive her completely mad or grant her access to the authentic magic she'd spent her entire post-celebrity existence seeking. <words>346</words>

The chamber filled with harmonics that had never been meant for human ears, each note trickling through the sacred glass like liquid starlight, and Ziggy Stardust-Morrison—former child star, current seeker of impossibilities—spread her arms wide to embrace whatever delicious madness awaited on the other side of ambition's final price. <words>392</words>

In the end, the wild magic of madness tasted exactly like freedom. <words>403</words>
