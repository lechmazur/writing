Mei Lin adjusted the tattered doll's dress against the makeshift stage, watching sunlight filter through collapsed solar panels that once powered the reimagined Forbidden City. <words>23</words> In this post-petroleum world, the ancient palace served as headquarters for the Truth Reproduction Agency, where chameleon actors like herself solved cold cases by recreating the final moments of victims. <words>52</words>

The fabric whispered secrets as she examined its frayed edges, her rationally impulsive mind already calculating the emotional geometry needed to inhabit the murdered child's last performance. <words>77</words> Mei Lin had perfected the art of weaving emotional honesty into illusions, transforming her body into living evidence that could unlock decades-old mysteries. <words>99</words>

Breathe slowly, she reminded herself, cultivating the anxious serenity that allowed her to channel trauma without drowning in it. <words>118</words> The doll's dress belonged to six-year-old Li Hua, who vanished forty years ago when oil still flowed and the palace operated as a tourist attraction. <words>143</words>

Sunlight through debris created shifting patterns across the courtyard where Li Hua had last been seen, and Mei Lin positioned herself within those golden fragments. <words>167</words> Her director watched from the observation deck as she began the reproduction ritual, her spine curving into a child's posture, her face softening into innocent wonder. <words>194</words>

The dress slipped over her adult frame like borrowed skin, and suddenly she was six years old, chasing butterflies between ancient pillars while her grandmother bargained with souvenir vendors. <words>222</words> Mei Lin felt the child's joy transform into confusion as a stranger approached, offering candy that tasted like promises and danger. <words>242</words>

Her rational mind catalogued details while her impulsive heart followed the victim's emotional trail toward the hidden chamber beneath the Dragon Throne. <words>263</words> The killer had been someone Li Hua trusted, someone who knew the palace's secret passages before the renovations began. <words>281</words>

As Mei Lin reproduced the child's final moments, sunlight through debris illuminated a loose stone she hadn't noticed before. <words>299</words> Her adult reasoning merged with childlike curiosity, and she pressed against the stone with small, desperate fingers. <words>317</words>

The hidden compartment revealed yellowed photographs and identification papers belonging to a maintenance worker who had disappeared the same week as Li Hua. <words>339</words> In that moment of discovery, Mei Lin achieved perfect synthesis between illusion and truth, her performance becoming both memorial and evidence. <words>359</words>

She removed the tattered dress with ceremonial precision, knowing that Li Hua's story would finally reach its conclusion. <words>376</words> In this reimagined palace where ancient wisdom met modern necessity, Mei Lin had once again transformed performance into justice, weaving emotional honesty through the gossamer threads of carefully constructed illusion. <words>404</words>
