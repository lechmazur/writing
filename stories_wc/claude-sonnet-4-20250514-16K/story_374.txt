Kael descended to the rooftop horse stables with his worn mandolin, just as the morning coffee lines began forming forty stories below in Neo-Singapore's gleaming streets. <words>24</words> The bizarrely typical sight of commuters queuing for their daily caffeine fix while genetically-enhanced thoroughbreds grazed on synthetic grass above them never ceased to amaze him. <words>48</words> As the city's last lonesome minstrel, he'd inherited more than just his grandmother's musical talent—he'd also inherited her bitter rivalry with the Volkov family, who controlled the rooftop agricultural consortium. <words>74</words>

"Still playing that ancient noise-maker, are you?" <words>82</words> Petra Volkov emerged from the feed storage, clutching a rubber stamp whose image had worn so unclear over decades of use that it resembled either a horseshoe or a crescent moon. <words>106</words> She stamped the daily grain authorization with unnecessary force, making the metal platform shudder. <words>119</words>

"Still stamping papers like it's the twentieth century?" <words>128</words> Kael retorted, settling onto his usual perch beside the water troughs. <words>139</words> They'd been continuing this inherited rivalry for seven years now, ever since both their grandparents died and left them to bicker over territorial boundaries that existed more in principle than practice. <words>165</words>

"At least I contribute to society," Petra snapped, though her voice carried the familiar weariness of their daily routine. <words>181</words> "What do you do besides strum strings and stare at clouds all day?" <words>194</words>

Kael tilted his head skyward, tracking the cumulus formations as they drifted east toward the port districts. <words>209</words> "I read the silent cosmos," he said simply, his fingers finding the mandolin's strings. <words>222</words> "These cloud patterns tell stories—weather systems, atmospheric pressure changes, the planet's breathing." <words>235</words> He began playing a soft melody that seemed to mirror the clouds' slow dance. <words>248</words>

Petra paused in her stamping, despite herself. <words>256</words> She'd never admit it, but his music somehow made the sterile rooftop feel alive, transforming their mundane morning ritual into something approaching magic. <words>275</words> "Grandmother always said your family were dreamers," she muttered, but her tone had softened. <words>288</words>

"And your family were builders," Kael replied, watching a particularly interesting cloud formation that suggested rain by afternoon. <words>303</words> "Maybe that's why we can't stop arguing—we're both trying to honor what they left us." <words>318</words>

Below them, the coffee lines moved with clockwork precision, each person playing their part in the city's vast choreography. <words>334</words> Petra looked at her unclear rubber stamp, then at Kael tracking clouds with the same methodical attention she gave her administrative duties. <words>351</words> Perhaps their inherited rivalry was just another form of routine, as necessary and bizarrely typical as the morning coffee rituals below. <words>368</words> She almost smiled as his music caught the wind, carrying fragments of melody toward the cosmos he claimed to read. <words>384</words> In this moment, their bickering felt less like warfare and more like a strange duet—two heirs performing an ancient dance of opposition that somehow kept them both tethered to this impossible rooftop world. <words>412</words>
