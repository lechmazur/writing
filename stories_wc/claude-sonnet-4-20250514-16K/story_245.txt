Kai's boots hammered against the cracked durasteel of the abandoned spaceport's flight deck, each stride a percussion of fury that echoed through the skeletal remains of what once bustled with interstellar commerce. <words>31</words>

The single ivory chopstick clutched in his left fist had belonged to Lin, and now it served as both anchor and accusation as he pushed his body through another punishing circuit around the derelict landing bays. <words>63</words>

Three years since the Syndicate had burned his partner alive, three years of smuggling contraband through the outer rim while his heart staged its relentless revolt against the very life that had cost him everything. <words>93</words>

His lungs burned with the acrid taste of recycled air and regret, the physical pain an abstractly physical manifestation of grief that refused to be contained within the boundaries of mere emotion. <words>122</words>

Every morning he came here to run, to remember, to memorialize Lin through the only ritual that made sense anymore—reading the patterns his tears left in the cold tea he carried in a battered thermos. <words>151</words>

The salt would swirl with the bitter leaves, creating configurations that spoke of hidden waterfalls on distant worlds where smugglers could disappear into mist and anonymity, where the Syndicate's reach couldn't penetrate the roar of cascading water. <words>185</words>

Kai had mapped seventeen such sanctuaries through Lin's stories, places where they'd planned to retire once their ship's cargo hold had earned them enough to vanish completely. <words>211</words>

Now the chopstick carved small arcs through the morning air as he ran, its worn surface smooth from Lin's fingers, from countless shared meals in cramped quarters between dangerous runs through hostile space. <words>243</words>

The spaceport's control tower loomed ahead, its shattered windows reflecting his solitary figure like fractured mirrors, each shard showing a different version of the man he'd become—bitter, driven, absolutely sincere in his hatred for the criminal empire that had claimed the only person who'd ever made him believe in something beyond profit margins. <words>290</words>

He slowed near the old customs checkpoint, pulling out the thermos with trembling hands that had steadied through a thousand illegal transactions but couldn't quite master the simple act of unscrewing a metal cap without thinking of Lin's laugh. <words>323</words>

The tea leaves swirled, and in their chaotic dance he saw it again—the waterfall on Kepler's Edge, hidden behind a curtain of perpetual rain, where Lin had promised they'd build a small cabin and grow old arguing about whose turn it was to cook. <words>362</words>

Kai pressed the chopstick to his lips, tasting phantom memories of Lin's cooking, and made his decision. <words>377</words>

Tomorrow he'd take his ship and follow the patterns in the leaves, abandoning the smuggling routes that had become his prison, seeking the waterfalls that would either heal his revolting heart or provide the perfect place to let it finally stop beating. <words>412</words>
