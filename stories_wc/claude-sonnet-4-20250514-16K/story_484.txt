Marcus stumbled through the wrought-iron gates of Ravenshollow Cemetery, his head still swimming from last night's experimental batch of elderberry ale. <words>20</words>

The protest against the mansion's demolition had quieted to whispers now, activists huddled around flickering candles as they regrouped for another round of chants. <words>42</words>

He'd joined them not out of political fervor, but because something about preserving old places felt right—uniquely generic perhaps, like every small-town brewer who believed in tradition over progress. <words>68</words>

The Gothic mansion loomed behind the cemetery, its windows dark as the graves below, and Marcus found himself wandering toward its shadow-draped entrance. <words>87</words>

"Might as well see what all the fuss is about," he muttered, his breath forming clouds in the autumn air. <words>104</words>

Inside, dust motes danced in shafts of moonlight, and the air tasted of decades-old secrets. <words>118</words>

A spiral staircase wound upward into blackness, its oak steps worn smooth by countless footfalls, but it was the slightest discoloration on the third step that made him pause. <words>140</words>

Something glinted there—a shard of broken mirror, no bigger than his thumb, reflecting not his face but the encroaching darkness that seemed to breathe from the mansion's depths. <words>164</words>

As he picked up the glass fragment, voices began gathering again outside, growing louder, more determined. <words>178</words>

The mirror showed him something impossible: not his reflection, but his intentions made visible—every compromise he'd made, every time he'd chosen comfort over conviction. <words>199</words>

"Well, that's appropriately melodramatic," he said, though his voice cracked slightly. <words>210</words>

The darkness wasn't just in the mansion; it was in him, in everyone who watched injustice unfold while nursing their beer and muttering about how things used to be better. <words>235</words>

He understood now why the protesters wouldn't let this place die—it was a mirror itself, reflecting what happened when people stopped fighting for what mattered. <words>257</words>

The shard grew warm in his palm as he climbed the stairs, each step an initiation into something larger than his small life of brewing and brooding. <words>279</words>

Outside, the chants resumed with renewed vigor, and Marcus realized he could either remain a spectator in his own existence or become what he claimed to value. <words>301</words>

He descended the stairs with purpose, the mirror piece tucked safely in his pocket like a talisman against his own mediocrity. <words>319</words>

The protesters welcomed him back with surprised nods as he took his place at the front of their line. <words>337</words>

"Time to brew up some trouble," he announced, his grogginess replaced by a clarity that felt suspiciously like courage. <words>353</words>

The darkness would always be there, patient and persistent, but tonight it would have to wait—he had finally chosen his side. <words>371</words>

As dawn approached and their voices rose against the coming demolition, Marcus understood that becoming the embodiment of one's values required nothing more than showing up when it mattered most. <words>397</words>

The broken mirror in his pocket caught the first light of morning, reflecting not darkness but possibility. <words>413</words>
