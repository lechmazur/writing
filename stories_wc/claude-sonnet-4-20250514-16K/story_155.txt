Marcus descended into the broken planetarium's flooded basement, his welding torch illuminating corroded star projectors that now pulsed with neon club lights above. <words>22</words> The vintage button box floated past his mask, its mother-of-pearl surface catching the underwater strobes like captured starlight. <words>39</words> He was patiently impatient, as always—twenty years of underwater welding had taught him to wait for the perfect moment while his blood burned with urgency. <words>60</words>

The club owner had hired him to repair the foundation, but Marcus sensed something deeper lurking in these submerged chambers where two timelines should never meet. <words>81</words> His grandmother's stories whispered through his memory—tales of mirrors that showed not reflections, but revelations. <words>96</words>

As he worked, the vintage store mirrors salvaged from the planetarium's original gift shop began revealing glimpses of another era. <words>113</words> In their warped surfaces, he watched elegant figures from the 1940s pamper themselves in what had once been the observatory's powder room. <words>132</words> These moments of unraveling between past and present made his torch flame dance with inherited mystery. <words>146</words>

The button box pulsed with each glimpse, its contents shifting like liquid mercury. <words>158</words> Marcus understood now why his grandmother had left him her welding equipment along with cryptic warnings about "the crossing." <words>175</words> She had known he would find this place, this convergence where her timeline and his intersected in impossible ways. <words>192</words>

Above, bass lines thundered through the water as dancers moved across the planetarium's cracked dome, unaware that beneath their feet, reality was bending. <words>210</words> Marcus opened the button box with trembling hands, revealing not buttons but miniature galaxies, each one a gateway to moments when the impossible became inevitable. <words>230</words>

The mirrors showed him wielding improbable power—not the controlled flame of his torch, but something far more dangerous. <words>246</words> In those glimpses, he watched himself repair not just metal and stone, but the very fabric of time itself. <words>264</words> His grandmother appeared in the largest mirror, young again, nodding with approval as she had never done in life. <words>281</words>

The water around him began to warm, not from his torch but from the temporal friction of two eras grinding against each other. <words>300</words> Marcus realized the club above was no accident—it was a beacon, drawing people to dance on the exact spot where past and future collided. <words>322</words>

He closed the button box and watched the mirrors return to normal, reflecting only his own masked face surrounded by swirling sediment and dying starlight. <words>343</words> But now he knew the truth his grandmother had carried: some welders were meant to fuse more than metal. <words>359</words> As he ascended toward the pulsing lights above, the button box secured in his tool belt, Marcus felt the inherited mystery settling into his bones like a second skeleton. <words>384</words> Tonight, he would dance among the unknowing crowd, patiently impatient for the next crossing, the next moment when timelines would unravel and offer him the chance to pamper reality itself with his impossible craft. <words>411</words>
