Magnus slumped against the obsidian bar of the sky-lounge, his lute forgotten as polaroid photographs scattered across black velvet cushions like fallen stars. <words>22</words> The endless city sprawled beneath through transparent floors, its lights blinking in patterns that defied his cartographer's mind. <words>39</words> His broken watch band dangled from his wrist, its severed leather ends marking time's rebellion against his ambitious project. <words>57</words>

"Subjectively rational," he muttered, arranging another faded photograph—this one showing a rooftop garden that shouldn't exist according to every map he'd studied. <words>76</words> The image revealed secret terraces blooming amid steel and glass, hidden sanctuaries that appeared only in these decades-old snapshots. <words>93</words>

Magnus had come to this floating establishment specifically to excavate meaning from his collection, to understand why certain boundaries appeared solid in daylight but dissolved in darkness. <words>114</words> Each photograph whispered of garden secrets: lovers meeting in impossible places, flowers growing where concrete should reign, pathways that connected to nowhere and everywhere simultaneously. <words>134</words>

"You're mapping dreams, not streets," called the bartender, polishing glasses with mechanical precision. <words>146</words>

"Dreams have geography too," Magnus replied, spreading more polaroids in careful rows. <words>157</words> The dismay that had driven him here—three failed attempts to chart the city's nocturnal transformations—began dissolving into something resembling excitement. <words>176</words> These photographs proved his suspicions: the endless night redraws boundaries according to desire rather than logic. <words>191</words>

He traced connections between images with his finger, noting how the same garden appeared in different districts, how staircases led to buildings that existed only after midnight. <words>213</words> The broken watch band caught on a photograph's edge, and suddenly Magnus understood its significance—time itself was boundary, and this city existed beyond such constraints. <words>235</words>

"The map isn't about finding places," he whispered, gathering polaroids with renewed purpose. <words>247</words> "It's about understanding when places choose to be found." <words>257</words>

His lute hummed as evening winds swept through the lounge's open walls. <words>269</words> Magnus began arranging photographs not by location but by the emotional weight they carried, creating a cartography of longing rather than coordinates. <words>288</words> The endless city below pulsed with new meaning—each light a story, each shadow a secret garden waiting for the right moment to bloom. <words>309</words>

His dismay transformed into laconic exuberance as he worked, understanding finally that some boundaries exist only to be crossed by those brave enough to excavate truth from fragments of forgotten time. <words>335</words> The broken watch band would remain unfixed—a reminder that the most important maps navigate not space, but the endless possibilities that emerge when darkness redraws the world's edges. <words>359</words>

Magnus smiled, beginning his map of an endless night where gardens bloomed in polaroid dreams. <words>374</words>
