Cassandra clutched the pocket puzzle box with thirteen locks, her fingers trembling slightly as she surveyed the maze of flickering billboards that had sprouted like metallic tumbleweeds across the neon-lit desert. <words>26</words> "Oh sure," she muttered, wiping sweat from her brow, "because what every dying planet needs is more advertisements for products that no longer exist." <words>46</words> The soothsayer's gift had become a curse in these lost years between the Great Collapse and whatever fresh hell awaited humanity next. <words>66</words>

She stumbled into the only establishment still operating in this wasteland—a ramshackle bar where the wooden countertop bore countless water rings, ghostly circles marking drinks consumed when clean water was still probably unlikely to kill you. <words>99</words> The bartender, a grizzled woman with radiation burns forming constellations across her cheek, nodded toward the stained surface. <words>116</words>

"Reading the rings again, prophet?" <words>122</words> The woman's voice carried the weight of someone who'd watched oceans boil away. <words>135</words>

Cassandra leaned closer, her panic mounting as she tried to magnify the faint impressions left by glasses long empty. <words>151</words> Each ring told a story of environmental stewardship gone catastrophically wrong—corporate executives toasting profit margins while glaciers melted, politicians celebrating deregulation while forests burned. <words>173</words> The rings formed patterns, and within those patterns, she could glimpse fragments of destiny itself. <words>187</words>

The first lock on the puzzle box clicked open. <words>195</words>

"Fantastic," she whispered, her voice dripping with molten sarcasm as another advertisement blazed to life outside, hawking solar panels to a world where the sun now scorched rather than sustained. <words>223</words> "Only twelve more locks between us and whatever cosmic joke passes for salvation these days." <words>238</words>

The water rings shimmered under the bar's dying fluorescent light, revealing the sequence she needed. <words>252</words> Each lock represented a choice humanity had made, a path toward destruction they'd embraced with open arms and closed minds. <words>270</words> Her motivation burned fierce and desperate—to shape destiny with bare hands, to wrench some meaning from the apocalypse their greed had authored. <words>288</words>

Click. <words>289</words> Click. <words>290</words> Click. <words>291</words>

The locks fell away one by one as she read the patterns, the final ring revealing not prophecy but bitter truth: they'd known this would happen all along. <words>313</words> The box opened to reveal a single seed, probably unlikely to grow in this poisoned soil, but carrying within its DNA the stubborn hope that someone, somewhere, might still care enough to try. <words>340</words>

Outside, the neon billboards continued their electric requiem, advertising a future that would never come while the desert wind whispered epitaphs for a world that could have been saved. <words>364</words> Cassandra pocketed the seed and smiled grimly. <words>371</words> "Well," she announced to the empty bar, "time to get my hands dirty." <words>383</words>

The bartender raised an invisible glass in salute as the soothsayer walked back into the maze, carrying tomorrow's probably unlikely hope into the neon-stained darkness. <words>404</words>
