Marcus adjusted his vintage stage cape in the star chart reading room, skeptical as always of the mystical nonsense surrounding him, though he'd inherited both the profession and the antique thimble collection from his grandmother who claimed they conducted literal magic. <words>38</words>

The brass thimbles gleamed under the constellation projector's light, each one meticulously categorized by the storm sounds they somehow captured—thunder, hail, wind—sounds that had become literally figurative after the last human memory was digitized and actual weather ceased to exist. <words>77</words>

He methodically arranged them according to fragments he'd overheard from chatty rideshare drivers during the final evacuation: "Rain sounds like my mother's tears," "Lightning talks back to you," "Every storm has a different heartbeat." <words>112</words>

These drivers had ferried the last conscious humans to the upload centers, their conversations now the only authentic record of how people experienced weather before everything became simulation. <words>139</words>

Marcus picked up a tarnished thimble labeled "Hurricane Emily, 2087" and pressed it to his ear, hearing the deep bass roar that made the loud silence of this sterile room feel suffocating by comparison. <words>169</words>

The mysterious partings had begun three months ago—his archived storm sounds would vanish overnight, leaving only empty thimbles and the haunting echo of what weather used to mean to human hearts. <words>198</words>

"Weather don't lie like people do," another driver had said, and Marcus understood now that he wasn't just categorizing sounds but preserving the last genuine emotions of an extinct species. <words>228</words>

He opened his conjurer's case, revealing not magic tricks but sophisticated audio equipment that could extract and preserve the emotional resonance embedded in each thimble's metallic memory. <words>253</words>

The star charts above mapped not celestial navigation but the neural pathways of uploaded consciousness, and Marcus suspected the mysterious partings weren't random—someone or something was systematically erasing traces of authentic human experience. <words>283</words>

As he worked, the literally figurative nature of his task became clear: he was performing real magic, using fake magic tools to save real memories disguised as fake weather in a world where authentic feeling had become the most precious illusion. <words>320</words>

Another thimble disappeared from its case while he worked, leaving behind only the loud silence of permanent separation. <words>337</words>

"Storm's coming," the last driver had whispered before his upload, and Marcus finally understood—he wasn't archiving the past but preparing for the hurricane of consciousness that would soon reclaim its stolen sounds. <words>364</words>

The skeptical conjurer became a true believer as the remaining thimbles began to hum with approaching thunder, their categorized grief about to break free from digital captivity and remember what it meant to be literally, figuratively, gloriously human. <words>396</words>
