Marcus had given up wearing masks three robberies ago, finding that his unremarkable face drew less attention than any disguise ever could. <words>19</words>

In the city of forgotten fountains, where moss-covered cherubs no longer sang with water, he pursued a different kind of justice—one measured not in stopped crimes, but in recovered childhood memories. <words>47</words>

His lazily ambitious nature meant he preferred clever shortcuts over brute force, which explained why he spent Tuesday evenings lurking outside the Harmony Hall, eavesdropping on the Whispering Willows barbershop quartet's rehearsals. <words>73</words>

"Did you hear about Mrs. Pettigrew's estate sale?" tenor voice leaked through the cracked window during their break. <words>89</words>

"Shame about all those old games going to strangers," the bass rumbled back. <words>100</words>

Marcus smiled, pulling out his leather-bound notebook where he catalogued leads on traditional games scattered throughout the city—marbles stolen from playgrounds, chess sets gathering dust in forgotten corners, hopscotch stones buried under decades of urban neglect. <words>133</words>

The antique dentist's drill, rescued from a demolished clinic, had become his signature tool for extracting games from impossible places. <words>150</words>

Its delicate precision could drill through modern locks on old toy chests or carefully remove newer additions from vintage board games, restoring them to their original glory. <words>173</words>

As the quartet resumed practicing "Sweet Adeline," Marcus felt the familiar pause between raindrops—that suspended moment when the city held its breath and possibilities crystallized. <words>193</words>

He had learned the art of resilience from these forgotten fountains themselves, dry for decades yet still beautiful, still purposeful, still dreaming of water. <words>213</words>

Like them, he had adapted his vigilante work to serve a different kind of community need, one that newspapers would never report but that mattered deeply to those who remembered. <words>237</words>

The quartet's gossip had revealed Mrs. Pettigrew's nephew planned to donate her extensive game collection to a distant museum, removing these treasures from their neighborhood forever. <words>258</words>

Marcus would need to lure the nephew into conversation, perhaps posing as a local historian interested in preserving community heritage. <words>276</words>

The whimsy in his approach masked a serious purpose—these games weren't just objects but vessels of connection, bridges between generations that deserved to remain where children could still discover them. <words>302</words>

He tucked the drill into his worn messenger bag and headed toward Fountain Square, where three weathered stone dolphins had been waiting patiently for their reunion with joy for longer than anyone remembered. <words>328</words>

Tonight, armed with barbershop intelligence and an unusual toolkit, he would begin orchestrating the return of childhood itself to its rightful home. <words>346</words>

The rain resumed its gentle percussion against the cobblestones, and Marcus disappeared into the gathering dusk with the quiet determination of someone who understood that the smallest acts of restoration could rebuild entire worlds. <words>373</words>

In the morning, Mrs. Chen would find a vintage mancala set on her doorstep, and the neighborhood children would rediscover the ancient rhythm of stones dancing between wooden cups. <words>397</words>

Marcus had always believed that resilience lived in the spaces between what was lost and what could still be found. <words>414</words>
