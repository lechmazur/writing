Marcus sat in the abandoned bus terminal's waiting area, rolling a plain wooden bead between his fingers as another virtual call flickered on his laptop screen. <words>23</words> The antique funhouse mirror he'd salvaged from a demolished carnival leaned against the wall, its warped surface catching fragments of the screen's glow. <words>43</words> For three months, he'd been tracking the distortions in that mirror, learning to read the subtle shifts that revealed when his targets were lying during their online meetings. <words>67</words>

His artfully clumsy reputation served him well—colleagues dismissed him as the bumbling IT consultant who accidentally joined high-level military contractor calls. <words>85</words> They never suspected that his seemingly innocent questions were designed to flatter their egos, drawing out confessions about weapons deals and cover-ups. <words>104</words> The mirror's ancient silvering created unique visual distortions that somehow amplified micro-expressions, turning each virtual meeting into an interrogation room. <words>122</words>

The wooden bead had belonged to his grandfather, a master of an ancient Vietnamese art of reading truth through reflection and meditation. <words>141</words> Marcus desperately wanted to master this forgotten skill, hoping it would help him process the screaming silence that had filled his head since returning from overseas. <words>163</words> Every night, the same memories: his unit walking into an ambush orchestrated by the very contractors now hosting these pristine video conferences. <words>182</words>

Seven soldiers had paid the price of war with their lives while executive bonuses climbed higher. <words>196</words> The official investigation had been buried beneath layers of bureaucratic courtesy and patriotic rhetoric. <words>209</words>

Tonight's target was Eleanor Vash, a procurement officer whose nervous laughter distorted strangely in the mirror's surface. <words>225</words> Marcus fumbled with his mute button, playing his role perfectly as she detailed shipping manifests to Afghanistan. <words>241</words> "You're so thorough, Eleanor," he said, voice thick with manufactured admiration. <words>253</words> "Those routing codes must be incredibly complex." <words>261</words>

In the mirror's twisted reflection, her smile cracked slightly. <words>270</words> Marcus squeezed the wooden bead tighter, feeling his grandfather's presence guide his perception. <words>283</words> The ancient art wasn't about revenge—it was about truth cutting through deception like light through darkness. <words>299</words>

"Well," Eleanor's voice carried a new tension, "some routes were... expedited for efficiency." <words>313</words> The mirror showed her eyes darting left, the telltale sign his grandfather had taught him to recognize. <words>329</words> Marcus continued flattering her expertise while documenting every nervous gesture, every defensive pause. <words>342</words>

The price of war extended beyond casualties; it corrupted the living, turning patriotism into profit margins. <words>357</words> But in this abandoned space, surrounded by the echoes of travelers who once waited for journeys home, Marcus had found his own path to justice. <words>379</words> The screaming silence in his mind quieted slightly as truth emerged through ancient wisdom and modern technology. <words>395</words> His grandfather's bead grew warm in his palm, a small victory against the darkness. <words>408</words>
