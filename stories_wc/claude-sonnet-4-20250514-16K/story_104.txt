Marcus had been the steward of the Lilliputian World Museum for seventeen years, his face as unchanging as the miniature dioramas he dusted each morning. <words>22</words>

The tourists saw only his pressed uniform and mechanical politeness, never suspecting the honestly rare rebellious heart that beat beneath his starched collar. <words>42</words>

After the orchard gate closed on harvest day each autumn, when the last school group departed and silence settled over the tiny kingdoms under glass, Marcus would begin his true work. <words>68</words>

He pulled the encrypted shipping label from beneath his desk drawer, its coded symbols meaningless to anyone lacking his particular skills in subversion. <words>87</words>

The label directed him to gallery seven, where a new acquisition waited—a wearable bird skull cameo, delicate as porcelain yet fierce as the raven it once housed. <words>107</words>

Marcus understood what the resistance wanted him to do with it, though the irony wasn't lost on him that revolutionaries would venerate something so beautiful yet so dead. <words>130</words>

He lifted the cameo carefully, noting how its hollow sockets seemed to watch him with ancient disapproval. <words>145</words>

The museum's board had recently mandated that all displays promote "harmony and order," their euphemism for the crushing lullaby of conformity that lulled visitors into peaceful stupidity. <words>168</words>

But Marcus had other plans. <words>173</words>

He positioned the cameo within the Revolutionary France diorama, where its gothic presence would whisper different truths to those willing to listen. <words>192</words>

The tiny guillotine, previously sanitized as a "historical curiosity," would now share space with something that spoke of death's democracy and beauty's rebellion. <words>213</words>

As he adjusted the miniature cobblestones around the cameo's base, Marcus felt the familiar satisfaction of watching cracks appear in the museum's carefully constructed façade. <words>235</words>

Tomorrow, children would press their faces against the glass and see not just sanitized history, but something wild and untamed. <words>253</words>

Their parents would hurry them along, uncomfortable with questions about why the pretty bird looked so sad, so empty, so knowing. <words>273</words>

Marcus straightened his tie and walked through the galleries one final time, his footsteps echoing through worlds where revolution now lived alongside order. <words>294</words>

The encrypted label would burn in his fireplace tonight, its mission complete. <words>305</words>

He paused before the France display, watching how moonlight through the museum windows transformed the skull cameo into something luminous and defiant. <words>324</words>

Even the steward's mask had its purposes—who would suspect the dutiful keeper of tiny worlds to be smuggling chaos one encrypted delivery at a time? <words>345</words>

Marcus smiled, the expression cracking his professional composure just enough to reveal the cynical warmth that made him honestly dangerous to those who mistook conformity for peace. <words>367</words>

The orchard gate would open again tomorrow, bringing fresh crowds to witness his quiet revolution disguised as curation. <words>384</words>

But tonight belonged to him and the hollow-eyed bird that now stood guard over the dreams of the miniature dead. <words>402</words>
