In the vast study where books towered like skyscrapers and dust motes danced through beams of ethereal light, Mika folded laundry that shouldn't have existed. <words>24</words> The washing machines hummed their midnight song, sprouting impossibly from between ancient tomes, their chrome surfaces reflecting the giant's abandoned reading spectacles that hung like moons above the scholarly chaos. <words>51</words> She was an unlikely prophet, this girl with purple hair and safety pins for earrings, more accustomed to spray-painting manifestos on subway walls than delivering divine revelations. <words>74</words>

The wilted paper flower in her jacket pocket crinkled as she bent to retrieve a stranger's forgotten sock—a reminder of the vision that had brought her here, between the spaces where reality shifted like quicksilver. <words>106</words> In that glimmering transition from dream to wakefulness, she had seen it: scattered minds floating like dandelion seeds in a cosmic wind, desperate for unity. <words>128</words>

"You don't belong here," came a voice sharp with academic authority. <words>139</words> Professor Hendricks emerged from behind a mountain of journals, his conventionally rebellious leather jacket and wire-rimmed glasses marking him as another misplaced soul in this impossible laundromat-library hybrid. <words>164</words>

"Neither do you," Mika replied, her fingers tracing the paper flower's brittle petals. <words>177</words> The washing machine's final spin cycle triggered another glimmering transition, and suddenly the study's ancient wisdom merged with the laundromat's humble purpose—both places where things became clean, renewed, transformed. <words>205</words>

But Hendricks recoiled from her knowing smile, sensing the prophecy that sparkled behind her dark eyes. <words>221</words> "Your vision threatens everything I've built," he whispered, backing toward a dryer that doubled as a card catalog. <words>239</words>

"I'm not here to destroy," Mika said, pulling out the paper flower, its wilted form somehow radiating possibility. <words>257</words> "I'm here to show that scattered minds—yours, mine, the giant's whose study this is—can become one beautiful, terrible symphony." <words>277</words>

The haunting delight of recognition flickered across Hendricks's face before fear extinguished it. <words>290</words> He chose estrangement over enlightenment, fleeing into the shadows between bookcases, leaving Mika alone with the humming machines and her sacred burden. <words>310</words>

In the glimmering transition between his departure and the dawn that would soon break through impossible windows, she placed the wilted paper flower atop a spinning dryer. <words>334</words> Its petals began to unfurl, no longer paper but something alive and luminous, ready to carry her vision to other scattered minds wandering in their own between-spaces. <words>357</words>

The giant's study held its breath, and in that haunting, delightful silence, prophecy bloomed like flowers in a cosmic laundromat where wisdom and wonder met to dance. <words>380</words>

Through the morning's first glimmering transition, her unlikely ministry continued, one estranged soul at a time, until all minds might finally sing as one. <words>401</words>
