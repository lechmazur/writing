Kira clutched the flimsy photo album, its pages warped from humidity in the forgotten library nestled high in the ancient oak's embrace. <words>20</words> She had been convicted as a dream thief decades ago, though counting those stolen fragments remained impossible—numbers always scattered like leaves when she tried to hold them. <words>40</words> Each photograph showed the same face: hers, yet fractured into countless versions, some laughing, others weeping, all strangers wearing her skin. <words>58</words>

The treehouse groaned in the perpetual silence that had settled over Earth since the last human drew breath. <words>74</words> No more dreams to steal meant no more pieces of herself to collect, leaving her identity scattered across stolen memories like confetti after a celebration no one remembered. <words>98</words> She turned each page with trembling fingers, searching for the one fragment that might make her whole again. <words>114</words>

Tennis had brought them together—her and Marcus, whose dreams she'd plundered most thoroughly. <words>127</words> In the photographs, she saw herself serving, volleying, celebrating victories that belonged to someone else's muscle memory. <words>143</words> The mathematical impossibility of her theft tormented her: how could she steal what made someone themselves while becoming less herself in return? <words>162</words> The equation never balanced, no matter how she rearranged the stolen pieces. <words>173</words>

Outside, the sky stretched endlessly gray, refusing to birth the storms she desperately needed. <words>186</words> Thunder would shake loose the fragments trapped in her borrowed consciousness, or so she believed with the quiet mania that had replaced rational thought. <words>205</words> She climbed higher through the library's spiral of books, each step bringing her closer to the treehouse's crown. <words>221</words>

At the platform's edge, she opened the album one final time. <words>232</words> The photos fluttered free, each stolen moment of someone else's life dancing on the stagnant air. <words>246</words> Marcus's serve, his grandmother's recipe, his first kiss—all hers now, all meaningless without their original owner to give them weight. <words>264</words>

The mathematics of identity finally clicked: she was zero divided by infinity, a remainder with no whole number to define her. <words>282</words> With the desperate precision of someone who had forgotten how to count her own heartbeats, she prepared to plunge toward the earth below. <words>300</words> Perhaps the impact would scatter her stolen fragments back to the empty skies, where thunder waited to carry them home. <words>318</words>

The album fell first, its pages catching wind like desperate prayers. <words>329</words> Kira followed, arms spread wide, mathematically challenged but finally understanding that some equations could only be solved by becoming nothing at all. <words>347</words> In her descent, she felt the fragments of her thieved identity loosening, ready to seed the clouds with the dreams of the dead. <words>366</words> The silent sky rumbled once, as if remembering how to speak. <words>376</words> Thunder bloomed across the heavens, carrying whispers of every stolen dream back to the void where all selves began and ended. <words>395</words> She smiled as the earth rushed up to reclaim her fragmented pieces. <words>405</words>
