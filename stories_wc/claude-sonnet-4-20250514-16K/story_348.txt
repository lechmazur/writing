Mira descended the moss-covered stone steps to her grandmother's sunken laboratory, her bare feet moving with the peculiar certainty of someone who walked these paths in sleep as often as in waking. <words>29</words>

Between the red-eye flight from Portland and tomorrow's departure to the archaeological dig in Peru, she had exactly eighteen hours for her yearly pilgrimage to this ancestral home buried beneath the Oregon woodland. <words>59</words>

The laboratory's walls glowed softly with dozens of mason jars, each containing a single lightning bug suspended in amber-colored preservative, their bioluminescent bodies creating a constellation of secrets her family had been mapping for generations. <words>91</words>

As a somnambulist scout, Mira possessed the rare ability to navigate both the physical terrain and the spiritual landscape that lay beneath it, her unconscious mind drawn to places where the veil between worlds grew thin. <words>123</words>

"I'm just a messenger," she would say with unapologetic humility whenever fellow researchers questioned her methods, never mentioning how the lightning bugs called to her in dreams, revealing the woodland's hidden wisdom through their ancient dance. <words>159</words>

Her grandmother's journal lay open on the central table, its pages filled with meticulous notes about each specimen: their location of capture, the phase of the moon, the particular secret they had witnessed in their brief, brilliant lives. <words>194</words>

Mira uncapped a fresh jar and breathed in the earthy scent of preserved magic, her curiosity loading like a spring-wound mechanism as she traced the locations on her grandmother's hand-drawn map. <words>223</words>

The forty-third lightning bug had been found near the ancient oak where her great-grandmother first discovered she could sleepwalk to places that didn't exist on any surveyor's map. <words>246</words>

Tonight, Mira would scout the northeastern quadrant where the woodland whispered of something new, something that pulsed with the same ethereal rhythm as the creatures in these jars. <words>271</words>

She slipped into her grandmother's moth-eaten sweater and gathered her collection kit, knowing that by dawn she would wake somewhere deep in the forest with dirt under her fingernails and a new jar glowing softly in her pack. <words>305</words>

The laboratory's stone walls seemed to exhale as she climbed toward the surface, carrying with her the weight of inherited purpose and the electric anticipation of discovery. <words>328</words>

In six hours, her unconscious mind would guide her to a clearing where lightning bugs gathered around a fallen meteorite, their collective glow forming symbols her waking mind couldn't yet decipher. <words>352</words>

But for now, she simply walked upward through the darkness, trusting in the ancient compact between her bloodline and the woodland's most luminous secrets. <words>371</words>

The forest floor beckoned above, promising answers to questions she had not yet learned to ask, each step carrying her closer to the sacred work of mapping wisdom that existed beyond the reach of ordinary sight. <words>402</words>
