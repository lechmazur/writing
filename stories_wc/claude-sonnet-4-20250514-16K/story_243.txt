Zephyr's skeletal fingers trembled as echoing footsteps haunted the pixelated corridors of Castle Digitalis, each step reverberating through the 8-bit stonework like a glitched sound effect. <words>24</words> The jumpy necromancer clutched his glowing fishhook—a typically bizarre artifact that pulsed with ethereal moonlight even in this underground realm where no natural moon existed. <words>47</words> While the old gods slumbered in their coded dreams, Zephyr had discovered something that made his undead minions gibber in terror: their beloved King Retro might not be the heroic savior the pixelated masses worshipped. <words>79</words>

The echoing footsteps grew louder as Zephyr approached the hidden chamber, his necromantic robes flickering between purple and green pixels. <words>96</words> He had spent weeks following rumors through the digital underground, collecting whispers from ghost NPCs about a secret mural that contradicted everything the kingdom believed. <words>115</words> The fishhook's moonlight glow intensified as he pressed against a seemingly solid wall, revealing the hidden doorway through its supernatural luminescence. <words>133</words>

Inside, Zephyr's breath caught—a massive protest mural covered the chamber walls, depicting King Retro not as a hero but as a tyrant crushing smaller sprites beneath his golden boots. <words>157</words> The typically bizarre paint drips formed patterns that seemed almost alive, and Zephyr realized this was no ordinary artwork but a necromantic message left by ancient rebels. <words>179</words> His hands shook as he began analyzing the paint drips, using his dark magic to decode the hidden story they told. <words>197</words>

Each drip contained fragments of murdered souls, their final testimonies bleeding through the pigment. <words>211</words> The echoing footsteps suddenly stopped, and Zephyr began to falter, his resolve wavering as the terrible truth emerged from his analysis. <words>227</words> King Retro had systematically deleted entire populations of sprites, erasing them from the game's memory to consolidate his power. <words>243</words> The fishhook pulsed brighter, as if responding to the revelation, its glow now revealing even more hidden layers of the mural. <words>262</words>

But as Zephyr prepared to document his findings, the echoing footsteps resumed—this time approaching rapidly. <words>276</words> He frantically photographed the mural with his magical device, knowing that exposing this truth would shatter the kingdom's foundation. <words>292</words> The typically bizarre nature of his discovery—that their savior was actually their destroyer—would require careful planning to reveal without causing total chaos. <words>312</words>

The footsteps reached the chamber entrance just as Zephyr completed his analysis. <words>323</words> Clutching the glowing fishhook like a talisman, he dissolved into shadow, carrying with him the power to unmask the revered icon. <words>340</words> While the old gods continued their slumber, oblivious to the brewing revolution, Zephyr knew the echoing footsteps of truth would soon thunder throughout Castle Digitalis. <words>359</words> The jumpy necromancer had become something far more dangerous—a bearer of revelations that would reshape their pixelated world forever. <words>376</words> As he vanished into the digital darkness, the fishhook's moonlight glow faded, leaving only the damning mural and its typically bizarre testimony of a fallen hero's crimes. <words>398</words>
