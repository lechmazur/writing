Millicent Finch, small-town librarian extraordinaire, clutched the stolen museum artifact tag between her perfectly manicured yet perpetually ink-stained fingers. <words>19</words> She had "borrowed" it during last Tuesday's field trip, because honestly, who would miss one little tag from the Ancient Mysteries exhibit? <words>39</words> Now, standing before the portal-strewn canyon where she'd spent thirty-seven years cataloging every mysterious carving, she felt destiny calling with all the subtlety of a fire alarm. <words>64</words>

The canyon's ancient watchers—those stone-faced sentinels carved by civilizations whose names were lost to her meticulously organized filing system—had observed generations of seekers. <words>86</words> But none, Millicent was certain, possessed her unique combination of institutional access and homemade cherry pie. <words>102</words> After all, every legend needed a signature calling card, and hers happened to involve lattice crusts and a secret ingredient of pure, unadulterated hubris. <words>123</words>

She had discovered through decades of careful observation that the portals responded to offerings of perfectly flawed pastries—pies with slightly burnt edges, cookies with uneven chocolate chips, bread with that one stubborn air bubble. <words>148</words> It was, she'd concluded with scholarly precision, about harvesting grace from imperfection itself. <words>160</words>

Today, she intended to dismantle the greatest mystery of all: why the artifact tag, when placed against the central carving while sharing pie with interdimensional beings, allegedly opened pathways to becoming the stuff of whispered folklore. <words>188</words> The museum's description had been laughably incomplete—"Origin Unknown, Possible Ritual Use"—as if she hadn't spent her entire career deciphering the obvious. <words>206</words>

As she approached the largest portal, its edges shimmering like heat waves above summer asphalt, Millicent unpacked her picnic basket with ceremonial reverence. <words>224</words> Three cherry pies, each perfectly imperfect, each crafted with the kind of devoted precision that only a woman with a lifetime of overdue notices and budget cuts could muster. <words>247</words>

"Well then," she announced to the silent watchers, her voice dripping with the sort of mock solemnity reserved for award ceremonies and book club meetings, "let's make some history." <words>270</words> She pressed the artifact tag against the ancient stone, feeling it pulse with otherworldly warmth. <words>284</words>

The portals blazed to life, their guardians stirring from millennia of patient observation. <words>296</words> Somewhere in the distance, she could already hear future generations whispering her name: "Millicent the Pie-Bringer, She Who Opened the Ways." <words>313</words> 

As the first interdimensional visitor emerged, drawn by the intoxicating aroma of perfectly imperfect pastry, Millicent smiled with the satisfaction of someone who had finally, decisively, upgraded from "quaint local character" to "legendary figure of cosmic significance." <words>342</words> The transformation was, she noted with professional satisfaction, exactly as she had catalogued it would be. <words>357</words>
