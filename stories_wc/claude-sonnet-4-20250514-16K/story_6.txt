Cornelius the minstrel stood amid the rusted machinery of the abandoned disappearing ink factory, his lute case slung across his back like a shield against impossibility. <words>23</words> The midday sun filtered through broken skylights, casting shadows that seemed to evaporate and reform—much like the factory's former product. <words>41</words> He'd tracked the immortal trickster Morrigan here, following breadcrumbs of vanishing footprints and rumors that dissolved the moment anyone tried to repeat them. <words>63</words>

"Still don't believe in magic, do you?" Morrigan's voice echoed from somewhere near the ancient steam vents, which hissed with supernatural persistence despite decades of abandonment. <words>87</words> Cornelius snorted, kicking at a piece of shimmering metal embedded in the factory floor. <words>101</words> It came loose easily—a dragon-scale armor scrap, its surface rippling with colors that definitely weren't supposed to exist. <words>119</words>

"Just because I can't explain it doesn't mean I have to worship it," he muttered, pocketing the scale with the practiced skepticism of someone who'd seen too many card tricks. <words>142</words> But this felt different, warm and alive in ways that made his musician's fingers tingle. <words>157</words>

The factory's old pneumatic mail system groaned to life, tubes whistling as an invisible message shot through the network. <words>175</words> At precisely midday, when even the mailbox seemed to hold its breath in the oppressive silence, Morrigan materialized atop a towering ink vat. <words>195</words>

"I'll make you a wager," the trickster called, grinning with teeth like broken glass. <words>208</words> "Prove your mortal cleverness can match immortal cunning." <words>217</words>

Cornelius pulled out his childhood slingshot—a battered thing he'd kept more for sentiment than practicality. <words>232</words> With reckless generosity born of pure spite, he loaded the dragon-scale scrap into the leather pouch. <words>248</words> "Fine, but when I win, you stop haunting street performers." <words>259</words>

He aimed not at Morrigan, but at the largest steam vent, its ancient hiss growing louder as if responding to the scale's presence. <words>280</words> The shot was impossibly plausible—if dragon scales were real, and if steam vents could amplify magic, then obviously this would work. <words>301</words>

The scale struck the vent with a crystalline chime, and suddenly every piece of machinery in the factory roared to life. <words>320</words> Disappearing ink erupted from broken pipes, writing invisible messages across every surface before fading into nothingness. <words>336</words> The letters spelled out every trick Morrigan had ever played, every secret shame, every moment of genuine kindness hidden beneath centuries of mischief. <words>357</words>

"Impossible," Morrigan whispered, but the reverence in their voice suggested they were secretly delighted to be outmaneuvered by a mortal with a slingshot and absolutely no respect for the natural order. <words>383</words>

Cornelius picked up his lute, strumming a victory chord that somehow harmonized with the factory's mechanical symphony. <words>399</words> "Just because something's impossible doesn't mean it can't happen." <words>409</words>
