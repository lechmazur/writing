Mira touched the waterlogged vintage photographs with practiced indifference, her fingers tracing faces that existed across seventeen parallel timelines. <words>18</words> The forgotten underwater city market hummed around her with the mechanical buzz of dying neon signs and the whispered negotiations of desperate souls seeking impossible answers. <words>41</words> She was known here simply as the shy diviner, the one who read futures in faded snapshots while pretending not to care about the cosmic catastrophe unraveling above them. <words>67</words>

The photographs revealed the same confusingly clear truth in every timeline: regret echoed backward through time like sonar, creating ripples that threatened reality itself. <words>88</words> Each image showed different versions of the same moment—a woman walking away from a burning house, a child abandoning a dying pet, a scientist deleting crucial research. <words>110</words> The regret was so pure, so concentrated, that it had begun to precipitate like acid rain across dimensions. <words>127</words>

Mira's phone buzzed with notifications, a trail of social media posts appearing simultaneously across all timelines. <words>141</words> @TimelineWatcher posted: "Anyone else noticing reality glitching?" <words>148</words> @ParallelSelf shared: "I keep remembering things I never did." <words>158</words> @QuantumDrifter uploaded blurry photos of the same woman in seventeen different locations, each post timestamped at the exact same moment. <words>177</words>

The hidden truth crystallized before Mira's reluctant eyes: the woman in the photographs was her, scattered across timelines, carrying the weight of a single moment of cowardice that had metastasized into cosmic imbalance. <words>206</words> She had failed to save her sister in Timeline Zero, and that failure had infected every parallel version of herself. <words>225</words>

More posts flooded her screen, each one a cry for help from another version of herself: "The water is rising," "The city is sinking," "The regret is drowning us all." <words>247</words> The market around her began to shimmer and distort as the dimensional barriers weakened. <words>261</words> Coral-encrusted vendors hawked their wares to customers who flickered between existing and not existing. <words>275</words>

Mira sighed, her passionate disinterest cracking like old paint. <words>284</words> She had spent years perfecting her emotional detachment, reading fates for others while ignoring her own. <words>300</words> But the universe apparently had other plans. <words>308</words>

She selected one photograph—Timeline Zero, her sister's last day—and let herself remember instead of forget. <words>322</words> The regret hit her like deep water pressure, threatening to crush her lungs. <words>335</words> But she breathed through it, accepting the pain she had scattered across seventeen realities. <words>349</words> Slowly, the social media posts began to change: "I remember now," "I forgive myself," "The water is receding." <words>366</words>

The cosmic imbalance shuddered and stabilized as Mira finally stopped running from her echo of regret. <words>380</words> The underwater market solidified around her, its forgotten denizens returning to their eternal commerce. <words>394</words> She closed her eyes and let the vintage photographs sink into the dark water below. <words>408</words>
