Elena had been the most dutiful ward at Serenity Hills for fifteen years, watching caregivers audition through her soundless sanctuary's one-way glass with the eagerly jaded eyes of someone who'd seen every possible human performance. <words>34</words> Her fingers traced the worn leather glove she'd kept hidden beneath her pillow, the last remnant of her grandmother's magic tricks from the old vaudeville days. <words>58</words> During today's auditions, she would solve the mystery that had haunted these halls—why residents kept disappearing just before their families arrived for final visits. <words>79</words>

The familiar routine of hopeful faces interviewing for positions had become Elena's theater, but she was reframing it now as her detective's stage. <words>98</words> Each stolen phone—lifted from purses and jacket pockets during previous auditions—held cryptic voice notes she'd recorded, breadcrumbs leading to the truth about Administrator Walsh's midnight transfers. <words>121</words>

"Third floor, Room 307, Mrs. Henderson never made it to Tuesday breakfast," Elena whispered into the latest pilfered device, her voice barely audible even to herself. <words>142</words> The glove's supple leather had molded to her grandmother's hands during decades of sleight-of-hand, and now it guided Elena's own fingers across phone screens with practiced invisibility. <words>166</words>

Through the sanctuary's thick glass, she watched Walsh interview a young nurse, his smile as rehearsed as the card tricks Grandma once performed for dying children. <words>186</words> Elena had been collecting evidence for months, each voice note a piece of the puzzle revealing how Walsh relocated residents to cheaper facilities right before expensive end-of-life care began. <words>209</words>

The graceless beauty of her plan was its simplicity—she would expose him during the afternoon's group audition, when families gathered to meet potential caregivers. <words>230</words> Her eagerly jaded heart had learned to find humor in humanity's endless capacity for both cruelty and compassion, but this betrayal demanded justice. <words>248</words>

As Walsh's voice droned through the intercom announcing the group session, Elena smiled and slipped on her grandmother's glove. <words>265</words> She had solved the mystery of the missing residents, and her final, fearless laugh at mortality would come through exposing the man who robbed families of their last goodbyes. <words>287</words>

The auditorium fell silent as Elena wheeled herself center stage, stolen phones arranged like tarot cards across her lap. <words>303</words> "Ladies and gentlemen," she announced, her voice cutting through the soundless sanctuary with surprising strength, "I'd like to perform my grandmother's greatest trick—making the truth appear." <words>328</words>

Walsh's face drained of color as Elena's recorded voice notes began playing simultaneously from multiple devices, each one documenting his systematic relocation of terminal patients. <words>347</words> The worn leather glove caught the light as she gestured, transforming the familiar space into a courtroom where dying patients could finally testify. <words>366</words>

In that moment, Elena reframed her role from dutiful ward to avenging angel, offering families the closure Walsh had stolen while giving herself the most meaningful performance of her remaining days. <words>389</words> Her grandmother would have been proud of this final trick—turning a soundless sanctuary into a place where truth could finally speak. <words>408</words>
