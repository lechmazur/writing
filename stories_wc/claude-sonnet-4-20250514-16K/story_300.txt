Marcus fingered the simple cloth pouch at his belt, knowing full well how ridiculous he must appear—a wanted criminal browsing art stalls like some cultured patrician with time to spare. <words>28</words>

The Forum Boarium buzzed with merchants hawking their wares, none aware that the empire's most determined outlaw stood among them, searching for something far more valuable than their olive oil and wine. <words>60</words>

He paused at a vendor's display of discarded canvases, their corners stained with forgotten paint smudges that might—just might—hold the key to his obsession. <words>84</words>

"Looking for anything particular?" the seller asked, eyeing Marcus's worn cloak with wistfully pragmatic assessment. <words>100</words>

"Art appreciation," Marcus replied with earnest mockery, lifting a canvas to examine the curious azure streak along its edge. <words>118</words>

For months, he'd been collecting these paint traces, matching them against the cryptic map his dying mentor had pressed into his hands—a map supposedly leading to an ancient power source hidden beneath Rome itself. <words>154</words>

The shimmer of possibility had sustained him through countless close calls with the Praetorian Guard, though he often wondered if he was chasing shadows painted by a madman's final fever dreams. <words>183</words>

Each canvas told a story of artists who'd worked above the old tunnels, their brushes somehow absorbing traces of the energy that pulsed below. <words>207</words>

Marcus held up another piece, comparing its vermillion stain to the sample in his pouch—close, but not quite right. <words>227</words>

"That one came from the old temple district," the vendor offered helpfully, "before they cleared it for the new construction." <words>247</words>

Marcus's pulse quickened; he stood at the threshold of discovery, possibly mere streets away from vindication or magnificent failure. <words>267</words>

The next canvas bore a golden smudge that perfectly matched his reference sample, its metallic sheen unlike any ordinary pigment. <words>284</words>

"Where exactly did this come from?" he asked, fighting to keep desperation from his voice. <words>299</words>

The vendor squinted thoughtfully. <words>303</words>

"Subura district, near the old shrine—artist was always complaining about strange lights bleeding through his studio floor." <words>320</words>

Marcus pressed coins into the man's palm, his wistfully pragmatic nature warring with sudden, fierce hope. <words>337</words>

Perhaps he truly was a fool, pursuing legends while his fellow outlaws robbed honest citizens for mere gold. <words>354</words>

But as he tucked the canvas into his pouch and turned toward the Subura, Marcus allowed himself to believe that some treasures were worth more than coin—and some hunts, however absurd they appeared to the world, might actually lead somewhere extraordinary. <words>392</words>

The shimmer of possibility had never felt quite so tangible. <words>403</words>
