Marcus arrived at the paper airplane test facility at precisely 7:59 AM, as he had every morning throughout his six months of volunteering—because if there was one thing this vigilant orchardist refused to be, it was tardy. <words>34</words> The irony wasn't lost on him that he now spent his days watching paper contraptions fail spectacularly when his own apple trees had been bulldozed by the very aerospace corporation that owned this facility. <words>66</words>

"Another delightful morning of aerodynamic futility," he muttered, pulling his grandmother's antique letter seal from his pocket—a bronze peacock with its tail fanned wide, which he'd taken to carrying since the orchard's destruction. <words>101</words> Dr. Henley waved him over to the testing chamber where today's batch of prototypes lay ready for launch. <words>119</words>

"Marcus, could you demonstrate the wind tunnel settings for our new intern?" <words>131</words> As always, Marcus complied with meticulous precision, but his trained eye—honed by years of watching for pest patterns in fruit trees—caught something peculiar in the flight trajectories displayed on the monitoring screens. <words>159</words>

The paper planes weren't failing randomly. <words>166</words> Their crash patterns formed distinct clusters, each group mirroring the eye-spots on his seal's peacock tail with mathematical precision. <words>182</words> Marcus felt that familiar surge of sardonic glee that had sustained him through months of apparent corporate volunteering while secretly documenting every inconsistency. <words>202</words>

"Fascinating how these 'failed' tests consistently avoid certain grid coordinates," he observed with mock innocence, rotating his seal between his fingers. <words>219</words> The intern looked confused, but Dr. Henley's face went pale. <words>230</words>

Marcus had spent decades protecting his orchard from threats, and his vigilance hadn't dimmed after losing it. <words>246</words> These weren't random tests—they were mapping optimal flight paths for military drones, deliberately avoiding civilian zones that matched the peacock-tail pattern he'd been unconsciously memorizing. <words>268</words>

"You know," Marcus continued cheerfully, "peacocks display their plumage to attract mates, but also to intimidate predators." <words>282</words> He pressed his seal firmly onto a test report, leaving its distinctive mark. <words>294</words> "My grandmother always said patterns reveal truth to those patient enough to observe." <words>306</words>

The facility's true purpose—weapons testing disguised as civilian research—had been hiding in plain sight via the patterns in a peacock's tail. <words>325</words> Marcus pocketed the marked document with savage satisfaction. <words>333</words> His orchard was gone, but exposing the conspiracy that destroyed it would be deliciously appropriate revenge. <words>347</words>

"I believe I've demonstrated quite enough for today," he announced, heading toward the exit with his evidence. <words>363</words> Dr. Henley lunged for the emergency lockdown, but Marcus was already gone—never tardy to arrive, and certainly never late to leave when justice beckoned. <words>384</words>

Outside, Marcus smiled grimly at the morning sky, knowing his grandmother's peacock seal would soon grace more official documents than corporate test reports. <words>404</words>
