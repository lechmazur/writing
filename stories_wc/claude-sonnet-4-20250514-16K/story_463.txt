Marcus drew a decisive line through the final name on his weathered list, the ink bleeding slightly into the damp paper as salt air crept through the lighthouse keeper's bedroom window. <words>29</words>

"Well, that's certainly possible," he muttered to himself, his dry wit intact despite three sleepless nights spent cataloguing the dead. <words>48</words>

As the lighthouse's appointed sentinel, Marcus had been tasked to confiscate any remaining personal effects before the demolition crew arrived at dawn. <words>67</words>

The frayed piece of rope coiled on the nightstand caught his attention—once thick and reliable, now threadbare from decades of maritime use. <words>85</words>

It represented something deeper: the eroding promises made to families who'd lost loved ones in these treacherous waters, assurances that their stories would be preserved. <words>106</words>

A sudden chill filled the room, and Marcus felt the familiar presence he'd grown accustomed to during his vigil. <words>123</words>

The ghost of Keeper Aldrich materialized slowly, his translucent form swaying in an unmistakable rhythm. <words>136</words>

"The Morris dance," Marcus said with characteristic dryness, "how perfectly antiquated." <words>147</words>

Yet he found himself moving in response, their shared appreciation for the ancient English folk dance creating an unexpected bridge between the living and the dead. <words>168</words>

Aldrich's spectral feet traced the traditional patterns with reckless precision, each step deliberately placed yet wildly urgent. <words>183</words>

Marcus matched the movements, understanding that this ethereal choreography was the keeper's method of teaching him the lighthouse's true traditional methods. <words>201</words>

Through their synchronized steps, Aldrich communicated the lighthouse's deepest secrets: how to read the wind's warnings, how to maintain the beacon's unwavering flame, how to honor the covenant with the sea. <words>226</words>

The rope began to glow with otherworldly light, revealing itself not as mere cordage but as a tangible link to every promise made within these walls. <words>248</words>

Marcus realized he couldn't simply confiscate these artifacts—doing so would sever the connection between past and present, allowing crucial knowledge to disappear forever. <words>268</words>

"You want me to stay," he said, his tone cutting through the supernatural tension with typical directness. <words>283</words>

Aldrich's form solidified momentarily, nodding as the dance reached its crescendo. <words>294</words>

The frayed rope straightened, its fibers knitting themselves together as Marcus accepted his true role. <words>308</words>

He wouldn't be confiscating anything today; instead, he would become the new keeper, learning the traditional methods that bureaucrats and developers couldn't comprehend. <words>327</words>

The list fluttered from his hand, names scattered like ash as the lighthouse claimed its next guardian. <words>343</words>

Marcus tied the restored rope around his waist, feeling the weight of generations of promises settling on his shoulders with reckless precision. <words>361</words>

The dance ended, but the covenant had just begun. <words>370</words>

Outside, the demolition crew would find only an empty building, the sentinel having learned that some traditions transcend bureaucratic lists and certainly possible seemed laughably inadequate to describe what he'd just experienced. <words>396</words>

The lighthouse would endure, and so would its promises. <words>405</words>
