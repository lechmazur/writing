Marcus adjusted his earpiece with meticulously impulsive precision, fingers dancing across the controls like a pianist who'd forgotten why he loved music. <words>21</words> The drought prediction center hummed around him, machines calculating rainfall probabilities while he calculated something far more valuable. <words>38</words> Between his weathered fingers, he rolled the pressed butterfly—a monarch whose wings had been flattened into amber transparency, smuggled from a dead collector's estate three months ago. <words>63</words>

"Subject is going under," the anesthesiologist announced, and Marcus leaned forward with practiced disinterest. <words>76</words> Dr. Elena Vasquez, the landscape painter whose drought predictions had somehow exceeded their computer models by thirty percent, lay unconscious on the medical table. <words>97</words> Her confession would begin any moment, and Marcus would listen with the enthusiastic apathy of someone who desperately wanted to care but had forgotten how. <words>118</words>

The butterfly caught afternoon light filtering through reinforced windows, its preserved body triggering musical memories—his grandmother's humming during the great drought of '89, when she'd taught him that weather lived in people's bones. <words>146</words> Marcus had spent fifteen years smuggling rare artifacts between climate research facilities, always cautious, always calculating risk. <words>162</words> But Dr. Vasquez represented something different: a person whose emotional connection to landscape translated into uncanny meteorological insight. <words>178</words>

"I can hear the rain before it forms," Elena's voice emerged thick and dreamlike through the anesthesia haze. <words>194</words> "Every brushstroke carries moisture, every color holds tomorrow's weather." <words>205</words> Marcus gripped the butterfly tighter, feeling its delicate edges press against his palm. <words>218</words> This was why he'd orchestrated this medical procedure—not for the smuggling operation that paid his bills, but for his true motivation: to become a master of empathy. <words>241</words>

Through Elena's delirious confessions, he began to predict not just weather patterns, but human ones. <words>255</words> Her memories spilled like watercolor across consciousness—summers when drought cracked earth like broken hearts, winters when snow fell like tears of relief. <words>274</words> The musical quality of her voice, rising and falling with remembered storms, taught him that prediction wasn't about data. <words>291</words> It was about feeling the world's emotional rhythms. <words>299</words>

Marcus carefully placed the butterfly in his jacket pocket, understanding now why she'd painted landscapes with such prophetic accuracy. <words>317</words> The center's machines could calculate atmospheric pressure and moisture content, but Elena painted with empathy, and empathy was the ultimate prediction tool. <words>336</words> As her confession continued, Marcus felt his cautious heart opening with methodical spontaneity, learning to predict human weather patterns through the delirious honesty of someone who loved the earth enough to speak its secrets. <words>365</words> He switched off his recording device, realizing some knowledge was too precious for smuggling—some insights were meant to transform the listener rather than enrich them. <words>386</words> The butterfly would remain his only tangible trophy from this operation, a reminder that true prediction required not calculation, but the courage to feel everything with magnificent indifference. <words>410</words>
