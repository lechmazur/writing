Ezra MacReady knelt among the cherry blossoms in the castle's ancient courtyard, his weathered hands gathering fragments of porcelain that had once been a tea service. <words>25</words> The vintage spectacles perched on his nose, salvaged from a dead merchant in San Francisco three years prior, caught the morning light as he worked. <words>46</words> Spring had arrived at Hikone Castle, and the gardeners moved methodically between the rows, planting seeds with ritualistic precision. <words>64</words>

A letter had found him here, impossibly delivered to this remote fortress where no former Texas Ranger had any right to be. <words>83</words> The envelope bore his name in careful script, though addressed to a monastery fifty miles south – probably improbable that such mail would reach its intended recipient through such confusion. <words>107</words>

Inside, his brother's words stirred memories he'd tried to bury: the McAllister gang had reformed, seeking vengeance for their leader's death. <words>126</words> Ezra had fled west to escape the cycle, had crossed an ocean to find peace, yet violence pursued him like a faithful hound. <words>147</words>

The castle's elderly caretaker, Tanaka-san, approached with a wooden bowl and knelt beside him. <words>162</words> Together they continued gathering the broken pieces, each shard reflecting fractured light through Ezra's borrowed lenses. <words>177</words> "Kintsugi," the old man whispered, stirring the fragments with reverent fingers. <words>190</words> "We make beautiful again with gold." <words>197</words>

Ezra understood the metaphor with corroded rapture – this broken thing he'd become might yet be made whole. <words>214</words> The seeds around them pushed through dark earth toward sunlight, and he felt something similar stirring within his chest. <words>232</words> His hands, once quick to draw iron and deal death, now moved gently among the porcelain pieces. <words>248</words>

The McAllisters would come eventually – such men always did. <words>259</words> But perhaps by then, he would have learned the art Tanaka practiced, the patient work of joining broken things with precious metal until the cracks became the most beautiful part. <words>286</words> The vintage spectacles slipped down his nose as he bent closer to examine a particularly delicate fragment. <words>302</words>

"You stay?" Tanaka asked, reading the letter's contents in Ezra's expression. <words>314</words>

Ezra stirred the pieces one more time, watching how they caught the light. <words>327</words> The seeds would need tending through summer, the broken tea service would require months of careful repair, and somewhere deep in his bones, he felt the cycle of violence finally beginning to crack. <words>354</words> "I stay," he said, removing the spectacles to clean them on his shirt. <words>367</words> Around them, spring whispered promises of transformation, and the ancient castle walls stood sentinel against the past. <words>383</words> Ezra MacReady, former lawman, placed another fragment in the bowl and discovered that gathering broken pieces was perhaps the most sacred work a man could do. <words>406</words>
