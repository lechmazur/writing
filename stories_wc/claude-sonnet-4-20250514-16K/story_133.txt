Cordelia's weathered fingers traced the clay wheel's edge with delightfully menacing precision, her embroidered gloves incongruous among the pottery class's casual chaos. <words>22</words> The jaded locksmith had chosen this rooftop studio specifically because it overlooked the labyrinth orchard, where citrus trees twisted between colonial buildings like nature's own combination lock. <words>44</words> 

"Your technique is rather aggressive for a beginner," murmured the instructor, a nervous man whose paint-stained apron suggested he doubled as the building's artist-in-residence. <words>65</words> Cordelia's smile carried demure audacity as she shaped the clay, remembering how she'd once crafted keys for kings who never claimed their thrones. <words>85</words>

Through the studio's windows, the scent of orange blossoms began to permeate the air, carrying whispers of old hunting parties that once roamed these very rooftops. <words>107</words> She had attended countless royal hunts, fashioning specialized locks for treasure chests filled with trophies, preserving ancient hunting methods that modern nobility had abandoned. <words>128</words>

"Those gloves," ventured a fellow student, pointing at Cordelia's ornate handiwork, "they're embroidered with the royal seal, aren't they?" <words>144</words> Cordelia's clay collapsed slightly as her grip tightened, the delicate threading on her gloves depicting crowned stags and golden keys—symbols of a dynasty that had crumbled decades ago. <words>169</words>

The instructor's painting session began as afternoon light filtered through the orchard below, illuminating paths that few remembered. <words>185</words> Cordelia watched paint mix with clay dust on her gloves, each speck a reminder of her forgotten craftsmanship. <words>201</words> She had been the kingdom's master locksmith when the last heir disappeared into these very orchards, leaving behind an unclaimed throne and unanswered questions. <words>222</words>

"I preserve things," she announced suddenly, her voice carrying across the studio with quiet authority. <words>236</words> "Methods, memories, mysteries." <words>240</words> The other students paused their painting, sensing something profound in her words. <words>252</words>

Through the labyrinth below, shadows moved with purpose, and Cordelia recognized the gait of someone she'd thought long dead. <words>268</words> Her jaded heart quickened as she spotted a figure wearing clothes that matched the embroidery on her gloves—the lost heir, still hunting through the maze of his abandoned kingdom. <words>293</words>

Rising with delightfully menacing grace, Cordelia removed her gloves and placed them on the pottery wheel like an offering. <words>309</words> The royal hunting traditions she'd preserved for thirty years were about to serve their purpose. <words>324</words> As paint continued to dry on canvases around her, she descended toward the labyrinth orchard, keys jingling softly—ready to unlock doors that had waited decades for the right hands to turn them. <words>349</words>

The unclaimed throne would finally meet its sovereign, and Cordelia would ensure the ancient hunting rites continued, permeating future generations with their sacred significance. <words>368</words> Her pottery remained unfinished, but some things were worth abandoning for the promise of restoration. <words>382</words> In the orchard's depths, a kingdom stirred back to life. <words>393</words>
