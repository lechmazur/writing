The stoic wanderer arrived at the witch's familiar training ground just as Professor Morrigan wiped the final formula from the blackboard. <words>19</words>

His mesmerizingly bland appearance - weathered coat, unremarkable features, tired eyes - allowed him to slip unnoticed among the departing students. <words>38</words>

In his weathered pack lay a single floorboard from an abandoned cabin, its surface etched with symbols that had haunted his dreams for months. <words>60</words>

He had followed this trail of nightmares across three provinces, each vision more vivid than the last, leading him inexorably to this hidden academy. <words>81</words>

"You're not supposed to be here," Professor Morrigan said without turning around, her voice carrying both warning and curiosity. <words>98</words>

The wanderer stepped forward, his voice steady despite the magnitude of his request. <words>110</words>

"I archive ritual practices before they're lost forever," he said, producing the inscribed floorboard. <words>123</words>

"This belonged to Grandmother Thorne's cabin - you knew her, didn't you?" <words>134</words>

Morrigan's shoulders tensed as she recognized the ancient binding sigils carved into the wood. <words>147</words>

"That cabin burned fifty years ago," she whispered, finally facing him. <words>157</words>

"Along with all her familiar-bonding techniques." <words>163</words>

The wanderer's expression softened with brash tenderness, understanding her pain while refusing to retreat from his purpose. <words>179</words>

"The nightmares showed me where she hid her final teachings," he said gently but firmly. <words>193</words>

"I can help you recover them, but I need to impose upon your knowledge first." <words>208</words>

He gestured toward the fading chalk marks. <words>215</words>

"That formula you just erased - it's connected to her work, isn't it?" <words>227</words>

Morrigan studied his face, searching for deception but finding only earnest determination. <words>238</words>

The necessary lies she had been telling herself for decades - that Grandmother Thorne's methods were lost, that some knowledge was too dangerous to preserve - crumbled in the face of his quiet persistence. <words>267</words>

"Yes," she admitted, her voice barely audible. <words>274</words>

"But retrieving those teachings will require entering the dream realm where her spirit still guards them." <words>289</words>

The wanderer nodded solemnly, understanding the price of preservation. <words>298</words>

"Then we begin tonight," he said, cradling the floorboard like a sacred text. <words>311</words>

Outside, the training ground's protective wards hummed with anticipation, as if the very air knew that lost knowledge was about to be reclaimed. <words>332</words>

The wanderer felt the weight of countless forgotten rituals pressing against his consciousness, each one a thread in the tapestry of magical heritage he had sworn to preserve. <words>357</words>

Morrigan approached the floorboard with reverent fingers, tracing the symbols that had once channeled the deepest bonds between witch and familiar. <words>376</words>

"She was my mentor," she confessed, her brash exterior melting into tender remembrance. <words>387</words>

"I've been telling myself her methods died with her because I was too afraid to seek them out." <words>404</words>

The wanderer placed a gentle hand on her shoulder. <words>413</words>

"Fear is natural when dealing with such powerful magic," he said. <words>424</words>

"But knowledge belongs to all who would use it wisely." <words>434</words>

Together, they prepared for the perilous journey into dreams, where necessary lies would finally give way to necessary truths. <words>451</words>
