Father Miriam pressed the yellowed wildflowers against her palm, their brittle petals crumbling in the zero gravity of Debris Station Alpha. <words>19</words>

Her grandmother's journal had lied about their protective properties, just another deception in the inheritance of lies that followed her bloodline like orbital debris circling Earth. <words>43</words>

The possessed maintenance bot continued its never usual behavior, methodically assembling children's toys from salvaged parts while something ancient whispered through its speakers. <words>64</words>

Miriam's throat tightened with familiar stage fright as the station's emergency crew gathered behind her, their expectant faces blurring through her helmet's visor. <words>84</words>

She had always worked alone, submerging herself in quiet rituals away from judging eyes, but this entity threatened the entire station. <words>103</words>

The defiant hush of space surrounded them as she opened her grandmother's grimoire, its pages floating weightlessly before her. <words>120</words>

Each prayer felt clumsy on her tongue, each gesture awkward under their collective gaze, but she pressed forward with desperate determination. <words>140</words>

The bot's mechanical hands continued their precise work, connecting plastic limbs to torsos, creating an army of half-assembled dolls that bobbed in the air like tiny astronauts. <words>165</words>

Suddenly, the sound of a key turning in a lock echoed through the station's corridors, impossibly clear in the vacuum. <words>183</words>

The entity's laughter filled the air as memories flooded back: her grandmother's final confession about the flowers being ordinary weeds, about the family gifts being fabricated, about generations of fraudulent exorcists. <words>212</words>

But as the truth settled around her like settling dust, Miriam felt something shift. <words>226</words>

Perhaps authenticity lay not in inherited power but in genuine intention. <words>238</words>

She released the crumbling flowers, letting them drift away, and spoke from her heart instead of ancient words. <words>254</words>

Her voice, small but unwavering, cut through the entity's mockery as she refused to let family lies define her purpose. <words>272</words>

The bot's movements slowed, its toy assembly becoming less frantic, less purposeful. <words>285</words>

Miriam continued speaking, not in Latin or Sanskrit, but in simple, honest words about choosing hope over hereditary deception. <words>304</words>

She would sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never," creating her own truth among the drifting debris of her ancestors' falsehoods. <words>322</words>

The whispers faded, the bot's hands stilled, and the half-formed toys settled into peaceful suspension around them. <words>339</words>

In the defiant hush that followed, Miriam realized she had found her voice not despite her stage fright, but through embracing her authentic fear. <words>362</words>

The crew's applause seemed distant, muffled by her helmet, but the warmth in their eyes spoke of genuine respect. <words>380</words>

As the station resumed its quiet orbit, Miriam gathered the scattered toy parts, each piece a small victory over the inheritance of lies that had haunted her family for generations. <words>406</words>
