Commander Aldrich had sailed through centuries of nausea, his awkwardly charming smile masking the constant churning in his stomach as he navigated by lunar cycles toward the crystal fortress gleaming at rainbow canyon's end. <words>32</words>

The translucent ghost orchid bulb pulsed in his weathered palm, its ethereal glow syncing with each moon phase he'd tracked across decades of quiet longing. <words>54</words>

"Another century, another secret to trade," he muttered, remembering how his predecessor had warned him about the mirror that dwelt within those crystalline walls. <words>75</words>

The fortress rose like frozen starlight, its faceted surfaces refracting memories of every soul who'd sought its truth. <words>91</words>

Aldrich's naval uniform, salt-stained and time-worn, felt heavy as he approached the entrance where reality bent like light through water. <words>108</words>

Inside, corridors hummed with the accumulated whispers of traded secrets, each moon-tracked journey adding another layer to the fortress's collective memory. <words>126</words>

He'd learned to transform his seasickness into determination, his nausea becoming a compass pointing toward the chamber where the mirror waited. <words>143</words>

The ghost orchid bulb grew warmer as he walked, responding to proximity of the ancient glass that had reflected lies for millennia. <words>162</words>

Generations of naval officers had come before him, each trading their deepest secrets for glimpses of truth, only to discover the mirror's cruel deceptions. <words>182</words>

But Aldrich carried something different—centuries of accumulated wisdom from tracking moon phases had taught him to see beyond reflections. <words>199</words>

The chamber opened before him, crystalline walls amplifying his awkward charm as he faced the towering mirror that had promised answers to countless seekers. <words>220</words>

"I know what you are," he said, his voice carrying nostalgic defiance earned through centuries of quiet longing. <words>236</words>

The mirror shimmered, preparing its familiar lies, but Aldrich raised the ghost orchid bulb like a beacon. <words>251</words>

As the next moon phase peaked through the crystal ceiling, he felt the transformation beginning—not of his body, but of his understanding. <words>270</words>

The bulb's translucent glow revealed the mirror's true nature: not a gateway to truth, but a collector of traded secrets, growing stronger with each deception. <words>291</words>

His seasickness finally stilled as he realized he'd been sailing not toward answers, but toward the courage to stop asking the wrong questions. <words>312</words>

"I trade nothing," Aldrich declared, pocketing the orchid bulb that now pulsed with defiant light. <words>325</words>

The mirror cracked, its centuries of lies unable to withstand someone who refused to believe in reflections. <words>340</words>

Outside the fortress, rainbow canyon echoed with the sound of shattering glass as truth, for once, transformed freely without requiring payment. <words>359</words>

Aldrich sailed home through calm seas, his awkward charm now genuine, carrying the secret that some mirrors lie because we expect them to tell the truth. <words>383</words>

The ghost orchid bulb remained translucent in his cabin, a reminder that the longest journeys sometimes end exactly where they began—with the courage to see clearly. <words>406</words>
