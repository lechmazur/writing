Darius pressed his weathered palms against the ornate astronomical clock, its brass gears clicking in the cavernous funeral parlor that had been rebuilt within the shell of an ancient Persian palace. <words>27</words> The sudden crack of a car backfiring echoed through the street outside, followed by that peculiar silence that settles like dust over the city. <words>49</words> In that hush, the old undertaker felt the familiar weight of tribal knowledge his grandfather had whispered to him decades agoâ€”rarely practical wisdom about celestial movements and shadow paths that modern morticians dismissed as superstition. <words>82</words>

But tonight, as darkness pressed against the palace's reconstructed walls, Darius understood why his ancestors had encoded their deepest secrets in star charts and solar observations. <words>105</words> The thing that had been stalking his funeral home for months, feeding on grief and growing stronger with each burial, could only be contained by following the precise sun paths his forebears had mapped across these very floors. <words>139</words>

With placid ferocity, he began tracing the ancient patterns etched into the marble, his movements deliberate despite the exhaustion that had settled into his bones after thirty years of preparing the dead. <words>167</words> The astronomical clock's celestial spheres rotated slowly, marking not just time but the cosmic coordinates his grandfather had taught him to read when shadows fell at impossible angles. <words>192</words>

Each step along the sun path drew the invisible boundaries of a prison older than the Sassanid Empire, designed to imprison entities that existed in the spaces between life and death. <words>217</words> The rarely practical knowledge suddenly blazed with purpose as Darius felt the malevolent presence writhing against the constraints of stellar geometry. <words>234</words>

His motivation burned clear and desperate: to hold onto hope in the absolute dark that threatened to consume not just his funeral home, but every mourning family who sought solace within these reimagined palace walls. <words>263</words> The car backfire's echo finally faded completely, leaving only the soft clicking of the astronomical clock and Darius's measured breathing as he completed the final solar arc. <words>286</words>

The ancient Persian wisdom, dismissed by colleagues as theatrical nonsense, had proven its worth once again. <words>301</words> As the last shadow-line connected to form the celestial cage, Darius felt the hungry presence retreat into whatever dimension had spawned it, trapped by mathematics older than memory. <words>325</words> 

He straightened slowly, his undertaker's suit wrinkled but his purpose renewed. <words>337</words> Tomorrow would bring new grief, new families seeking comfort, but tonight the palace-funeral home stood protected by the rarely practical knowledge that had saved them all. <words>361</words> The astronomical clock continued its eternal rotation, guardian and timekeeper of secrets that modern science could neither explain nor replicate. <words>379</words> In the restored Persian palace where ancient wisdom met contemporary sorrow, hope had found its fortress against the absolute dark. <words>397</words>
