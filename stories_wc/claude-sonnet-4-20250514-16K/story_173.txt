Kira descended through the flooded corridors of the forgotten city hall, her collection of dried leaves sealed tight in waterproof pouches that had seen a thousand dimensions. <words>25</words> The orchardist's weathered hands traced the barnacle-crusted walls, searching for the records chamber where trade route maps from collapsed universes gathered like sediment. <words>47</words> Her grandmother's kitchen table wisdom echoed in the murky depths: "Trust what grows, child, even when the world drowns it." <words>64</words>

The phantom hand materialized first as a shimmer, then as translucent fingers that beckoned her deeper into the submerged bureaucracy. <words>81</words> Kira had learned to trust this spectral guide during her years wandering the infinite possibilities of the multiverse, harvesting seeds and knowledge from dying realities. <words>102</words> Each dried leaf in her collection represented a universe where fruit trees had evolved differently, where trade had flourished until cosmic collapse claimed everything. <words>123</words>

The phantom hand pressed against a corroded filing cabinet, and ancient mechanisms groaned to life beneath the water. <words>139</words> Maps unfurled like kelp in the current—trade routes that had once connected orchards across dimensional barriers, now lost to bureaucratic negligence and universal entropy. <words>161</words> Kira's unique gift was reading these fragments, her trustworthy reputation built on successfully navigating merchants through the maze of parallel worlds. <words>181</words>

She reached for the maps with gritty determination, knowing each recovered route meant saved lives and preserved livelihoods in universes still clinging to existence. <words>202</words> The phantom hand guided her touch to specific coordinates, and suddenly she understood—this wasn't just about mapping trade; it was about reclaiming hope itself. <words>225</words>

Water rushed through her lungs without drowning her, another gift of the wandering life, as she carefully rolled the precious charts into her pack. <words>246</words> The dried leaves rustled against the maps like whispered promises, specimens that would prove to skeptical merchants that profitable orchards existed beyond their known dimensions. <words>268</words>

As she ascended toward the surface, the phantom hand faded with something resembling satisfaction. <words>281</words> Kira surfaced in a different universe than she'd entered, the city hall now a thriving hub where her grandmother's portrait hung in the hall of honored advisors. <words>304</words> She smiled with bittersweet recognition—in this reality, kitchen table wisdom had shaped policy, and trade routes bloomed like fruit trees across the multiverse. <words>326</words>

Opening her collection, she selected three dried leaves and placed them on the reception desk—payment for knowledge reclaimed, and proof that some orchards never truly die. <words>349</words> The phantom hand had guided her not just to maps, but to a universe where her wandering finally had meaning. <words>368</words> Here, she could plant both seeds and wisdom, watching them grow into networks that would feed the hungry spaces between worlds. <words>388</words> Her weathered hands steady with purpose, Kira began sketching new routes that would connect this thriving reality to those still struggling in the dark. <words>408</words>
