The scarecrow stood motionless atop the fossilized giant's ribcage, its burlap face turned toward the horizon with practiced indifference. <words>17</words> For three centuries, it had maintained its vigil over the petrified titan, bound by an oath that burned with quiet desperation in its straw heart. <words>37</words> The forgotten lace fan tucked within its coat pocket whispered of promises made between collapsing realities, when the worlds still touched at their edges. <words>56</words>

Through the neural interface woven into its skull, the scarecrow accessed the virtual realm where parallel dimensions bled together like watercolors in rain. <words>75</words> Here, in this space between worlds, it could witness the slow migration of the lines in the earthâ€”ancient geometric patterns that pulsed beneath the giant's fossilized flesh. <words>100</words> Each line represented a pathway between realities, and the scarecrow's oath demanded it prevent their convergence. <words>115</words>

The virtual encounters revealed fragments of what once was: the giant alive, striding between worlds, the lace fan clutched in a lover's hand as dimensions collapsed. <words>135</words> The scarecrow had sworn to the dying titan that it would guard this intersection, this crucial point where reality grew thin. <words>152</words> Now, watching through digital eyes as the earth-lines began to pulse more rapidly, it felt the familiar surge of urgent detachment. <words>170</words>

A crack appeared in the virtual sky, revealing another world bleeding through. <words>182</words> The scarecrow's stuffed fingers found the lace fan, its delicate pattern matching exactly the lines carved into the giant's bones. <words>199</words> With mechanical precision born of endless repetition, it withdrew the fan and positioned it over the largest earth-line. <words>216</words> The fan's intricate lacework aligned perfectly with the geological pattern, creating a barrier between dimensions. <words>230</words>

But something was different this time. <words>236</words> The earth-lines pulsed stronger, threatening to skewer through the dimensional membrane that kept the worlds apart. <words>250</words> The scarecrow pressed the fan deeper into the virtual interface, feeling reality strain against its edges. <words>264</words> Its oath demanded sacrifice, and it understood now what price the giant had truly asked. <words>278</words>

As the worlds pressed closer, the scarecrow made its choice with the same fervent apathy that had defined its vigil. <words>295</words> It drove the fan's delicate handle downward, skewering through the earth-line like a needle through fabric. <words>309</words> The virtual realm shuddered as dimensions locked back into their proper alignment, the fan disintegrating into pixels and memory. <words>325</words>

The scarecrow returned to its physical form atop the giant's ribs, oath fulfilled once more. <words>339</words> In the distance, new lines began forming in the earth, patient and inevitable as the next dimensional crisis. <words>355</words> The scarecrow settled back into its eternal watch, burlap face expressionless, waiting for the next encounter between worlds that would demand everything and expect nothing in return. <words>379</words> Its straw heart beat with the rhythm of geological time, fervent in its duty, apathetic to its cost. <words>396</words>
