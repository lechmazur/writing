Miriam polished the gears of the water clock with theatrical precision, her quietly flamboyant gestures betraying nothing of the poison she'd slipped into the Hendersons' tea service three hours earlier. <words>28</words>

The moss-covered lantern in the corner of her repair shop cast eerie shadows across the domestic mystery novels scattered on her workbench—ironic reading material for someone who solved family secrets permanently. <words>59</words>

She adored the symmetry of it all: housewives seeking to eliminate cheating husbands, children wanting inheritance money, siblings settling old scores—all while she tinkered with timepieces that measured their remaining moments. <words>93</words>

Between chapters of her latest mystery novel, Miriam composed another bleak eulogy in her leather journal, weaving hidden truths into flowery prose about Mrs. Henderson's "sudden departure" and her husband's "mysterious grief." <words>128</words>

The water clock's steady drip-drip-drip provided a morbid metronome as she wrote about transmuting pain into a masterpiece—though whether she meant her writing or her murders remained deliciously ambiguous. <words>158</words>

"Poor Margaret Henderson," she dictated aloud to no one, "who discovered that some secrets are better left buried, like the affair with the postal worker that her husband never suspected." <words>187</words>

The lantern's moss seemed to pulse in the dim light, a living reminder of how quickly beautiful things decay—much like marriages, families, and trust. <words>208</words>

Miriam chuckled darkly at her own melodrama, knowing that tomorrow's newspaper would report a tragic case of food poisoning at the Henderson household, while she'd be here, innocently repairing Mrs. Peterson's grandfather clock and planning her next "domestic consultation." <words>244</words>

She adored how the mundane world of timepiece repair provided perfect cover for her true calling—after all, who suspects the elderly woman who fixes the devices that mark our precious, fleeting hours? <words>272</words>

The irony wasn't lost on her that she spent her days repairing instruments of time while shortening people's access to it. <words>289</words>

As she closed her journal, Miriam reflected that perhaps this was her masterpiece: transforming the banal pain of suburban betrayal into something approaching art, one precisely timed death at a time. <words>315</words>

The moss-covered lantern flickered once, as if approving of her work, and she returned to her water clock with renewed enthusiasm. <words>333</words>

Tomorrow would bring another desperate client, another family secret, another opportunity to practice her craft with the same meticulous care she applied to springs and gears. <words>354</words>

In the silence between the water clock's measured drops, Miriam hummed a funeral dirge and began planning her next eulogy, already savoring the hidden truths she'd weave into its sorrowful verses. <words>379</words>

After all, someone had to document these domestic mysteries properly—even if she was the one creating them. <words>395</words>

The thought made her smile as the ancient lantern cast dancing shadows across her deadly, delicate work. <words>410</words>
