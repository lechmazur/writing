Meredith pressed the dried lavender between her fingers, inhaling its faded sweetness as the orchard island swayed beneath the waxing moon's silver light. <words>23</words> The ancient apple trees creaked around her cottage, their gnarled branches reaching toward the luminous sky while the maelstrom's winds howled beyond the island's protective barrier. <words>45</words> As the village's only midwife for forty years, she had delivered every child born on this drifting sanctuary, yet tonight she felt more lost than any newborn. <words>69</words>

"I tell everyone I keep no secrets," she murmured to herself, openly acknowledging the contradiction that defined her existence, "but I am made entirely of them." <words>93</words> The memories that had been stolen from her three months ago—taken by the island's former elder before his mysterious disappearance—haunted her like phantom labor pains. <words>118</words>

She knelt before the cold fireplace where she had discovered the half-burned remnants earlier that evening, fragments of journals that might hold the key to recovering what was lost. <words>142</words> The charred pages crackled as she smoothed them against her apron, revealing scattered words about birth rituals, herbal remedies, and something darker—memory extraction techniques. <words>164</words> Her hands trembled as she recognized her own handwriting, documenting procedures she could no longer remember performing. <words>181</words>

The pressed herbs in her collection suddenly made new sense: not just healing aids, but ingredients for ceremonies that could unlock minds and steal experiences. <words>202</words> Rosemary for remembrance, mugwort for visions, vervain for protection—all components of rituals she had apparently mastered and then forgotten. <words>220</words>

As the waxing moon reached its peak, Meredith felt her critical nature soften into something approaching acceptance. <words>237</words> The stolen memories weren't just hers; they belonged to every woman whose child she had delivered, every secret she had sworn to keep, every moment of intimate trust shared in her presence. <words>264</words> She had been the island's keeper of female mysteries, and someone had sought to claim that power. <words>281</words>

Gathering the fragments and her collection of pressed herbs, she stepped outside into the maelstrom's strange calm. <words>297</words> The island spun slowly in the eye of the supernatural storm, perfectly balanced between chaos and serenity. <words>313</words> Here, beneath the moon's growing light, she would transcend the boundaries between memory and forgetting, between the critical voice that doubted and the ancient wisdom that simply knew. <words>337</words>

With growing understanding, she began to arrange the herbs in patterns described by the burned pages, each placement bringing whispers of recognition. <words>356</words> The wisdom had never truly left her—it had only been buried beneath layers of imposed forgetting. <words>372</words> As the ritual circle took shape, Meredith smiled with the dissonant calm of someone discovering that what was stolen had never really belonged to the thief. <words>395</words> The island's maelstrom would carry her memories back to her, one pressed petal at a time. <words>409</words>
