Zara clutched the pair of dice in her palm, the chipped edge of the red one pressing against her skin like a familiar scar. <words>20</words> The space pirate ship's brig hummed with the low vibration of hyperspace engines, but she ignored the sound, focusing instead on the psychic echoes that clung to these ancient gambling tools. <words>47</words> As the galaxy's only certified psychic genealogist, she had traced bloodlines across star systems using far stranger artifacts than these. <words>66</words>

"Still playing games, fortune-teller?" Captain Vex's voice crackled through the cell's comm system, dripping with the grave playfulness that had marked their cat-and-mouse chase across three sectors. <words>91</words>

Zara smiled, proudly humble despite her circumstances. <words>99</words> "These dice belonged to my great-grandmother, Captain," she replied, rolling them gently across the metal floor. <words>114</words> "The chip happened when she threw them at a cheating smuggler in the Andromeda Express—one of those abandoned bullet trains drifting near the Horsehead Nebula." <words>132</words>

She had discovered this detail in a diary left aboard that very train, part of her unconventional research method that involved exploring derelict vessels for genealogical clues. <words>154</words> The pirates had captured her during one such expedition, but they didn't understand that imprisonment couldn't lengthen her suffering—only her determination. <words>172</words>

Through the brig's porthole, the last star faded into morning light as their ship approached the day-side of Kepler-442b. <words>189</words> Zara's heart clenched; this timing wasn't coincidence but destiny's cruel puzzle piece. <words>201</words> Today marked exactly one year since Marcus had vanished into the void, leaving behind only questions and the alarm bells of heartbreak that still rang in her dreams. <words>225</words>

The dice settled: snake eyes. <words>230</words> Zara closed her eyes and let her psychic abilities flow through the bone cubes, feeling the weight of generations. <words>246</words> Her great-grandmother's laughter echoed across time, followed by whispered words: "Some losses lengthen into lessons, child." <words>260</words>

"The puzzle isn't about finding Marcus," Zara murmured, understanding flooding through her. <words>272</words> "It's about accepting that some threads in the family tapestry must remain unfinished." <words>285</words>

The alarm bells in her heart gradually quieted as she pocketed the dice. <words>297</words> Through her cell's bars, she watched the morning light strengthen, and for the first time in months, felt something like peace. <words>316</words> The pirates thought they'd captured a tracker, but they'd actually imprisoned someone learning to let go. <words>331</words>

When Captain Vex eventually opened her cell, expecting to find a broken woman ready to bargain, he instead discovered Zara sitting cross-legged in meditation, the chipped die balanced perfectly on her forehead. <words>354</words>

"Ready to make a deal?" he asked. <words>361</words>

"Actually," she said, opening eyes that sparkled with newfound clarity, "I think I'll roll with whatever destiny has planned." <words>378</words> She flicked the die into the air, watching it tumble through zero gravity toward an uncertain future. <words>394</words> Some puzzles, she realized, were meant to remain beautifully unsolved. <words>404</words>
