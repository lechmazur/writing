Brother Matthias jolted awake in the swaying aerial gondola, the dream's echo still vibrating through his weathered bones as mountain peaks stretched endlessly below. <words>23</words>

The visually unappealing monk clutched a creased shipping label in his gnarled fingers, its faded text barely legible after decades of handling. <words>42</words>

This label had accompanied the antique bamboo flute now resting across his lap—the same instrument that had belonged to his murdered teacher, Master Chen. <words>63</words>

Through the gondola's scratched windows, Matthias watched his reflection shimmer against the alpine landscape, and for a moment, he saw not himself but the dark shadow he'd been wrestling with for twenty years. <words>92</words>

His stubborn nature had driven him to this precarious journey across the Himalayas, harvesting fragments of the past that others had long abandoned. <words>111</words>

The shipping records led him here, to this remote monastery where Chen's killer had fled, but revenge required more than mere suspicion. <words>130</words>

Matthias lifted the flute with trembling reverence, examining the peculiar indentations along its rim—tooth marks left by whoever had bitten down during Chen's final struggle. <words>151</words>

The dream had shown him everything: Chen's peaceful meditation shattered by violence, the desperate fight, the killer's distinctive bite pattern pressed into the sacred instrument. <words>173</words>

Through years of cautious investigation, Matthias had learned to read these marks like scripture, each groove and depression telling its story of that terrible night. <words>198</words>

The gondola lurched as wind caught its cables, but the monk's focus never wavered from his macabre forensic analysis. <words>216</words>

He pulled out a magnifying glass, comparing the flute's tooth marks to photographs he'd secretly taken of every monk in three provinces. <words>235</words>

The enchantment of this high-altitude pursuit felt almost mystical—suspended between earth and sky, between past and present, between justice and obsession. <words>256</words>

His dark reflection had whispered that revenge would corrupt his soul, but Matthias believed that some wrongs demanded stubborn persistence. <words>274</words>

As the gondola approached the distant monastery perched on an impossible cliff face, he felt the weight of years dissolving into this single moment of reckoning. <words>299</words>

The tooth marks matched perfectly with Brother Kenshin's distinctive overbite—the same Kenshin who now served as the monastery's revered abbot. <words>318</words>

Matthias carefully wrapped the flute in silk, tucking the creased shipping label into his robes like a prayer. <words>335</words>

The past had finally been harvested, its bitter fruit ready for consumption. <words>347</words>

Through the mountain mists ahead, monastery bells began their evening call, unknowing that justice rode the wind toward their gates. <words>367</words>

Brother Matthias smiled grimly, having outsmarted the reflection that urged him toward forgiveness. <words>379</words>

Some truths, he had learned, were worth a lifetime of stubborn pursuit. <words>391</words>

The gondola descended toward the ancient stones where Chen's killer waited, still wearing robes of false righteousness. <words>407</words>
