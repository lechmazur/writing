Mira scratched another tally mark with her piece of chalk against the cargo hold's rusted wall, her weathered fingers moving with practiced indifference. <words>20</words> The space pirate ship *Wandering Echo* creaked around her as she maintained her vigil over Captain Jorik's cryogenic pod, the man who'd been her charge for three decades now. <words>43</words> "Still counting days like they matter," she murmured to herself, the gentle mockery in her voice masking deeper currents of affection. <words>60</words>

The outdated communication console crackled to life beside her, its rotary dial glowing amber in the dim hold. <words>76</words> Mira had insisted they keep the ancient device—something about maintaining connection to linear time, she'd told the crew with that warmly aloof smile that never quite reached her eyes. <words>101</words>

Through the reinforced viewport, she watched the nebula clouds drift in their eternal dance, their patterns as predictable as heartbreak. <words>119</words> Each swirl and eddy told stories of temporal currents, the way time moved differently here in the Disputed Sectors where past and future bled together like watercolors in rain. <words>143</words>

The phone's dial tone began its steady drone, and Mira felt the familiar tightness in her chest—the endless "what if" siren song that had haunted her since Jorik's accident. <words>168</words> What if she'd insisted on better shielding? <words>176</words> What if she'd convinced him to retire before that last raid? <words>187</words> What if time itself could be bargained with, negotiated, sweet-talked into reversing just once? <words>201</words>

"Enough," she whispered, her voice carrying the gentle harshness of someone who'd learned to be cruel to herself out of kindness. <words>220</words> The dial tone wavered, then cut out with a decisive click. <words>231</words>

In that silence, Mira began to trace the cloud paths with her eyes, following their serpentine routes through space-time. <words>247</words> She'd studied their movements for years, understanding finally that they weren't just clouds but currents in the temporal substrate—highways for those who knew how to read them. <words>270</words>

The chalk felt warm in her palm as she made her choice. <words>281</words> With careful strokes, she began writing coordinates on the wall, numbers that corresponded to cloud vectors, to moments when time grew thin enough to slip through. <words>302</words>

"Take care of yourself, old friend," she said to the sleeping captain, pressing her hand against the pod's surface. <words>319</words> The warmth of her touch fogged the glass briefly, then cleared. <words>330</words>

As the last number completed her equation, Mira felt herself becoming translucent, her form beginning to scatter like chalk dust. <words>347</words> The "what if" chorus finally fell silent as she followed the cloud paths backward, not to change what had happened, but to find peace with what was. <words>370</words> Time, she realized in her final moments aboard the ship, wasn't meant to be conquered—only understood, accepted, and sometimes, gratefully left behind. <words>388</words> Her body dissolved completely, leaving only chalk marks on the wall and the steady hum of the life support systems watching over their endless charge. <words>410</words>
