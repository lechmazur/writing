Kenji had retreated to the castle's highest tower thirty years ago, transforming the ancient stone chambers into an herbalist's sanctuary. <words>19</words> Now the castle served as an art academy, its weathered walls echoing with students' voices during their evening classes. <words>36</words> From his window, he watched them arrive each Tuesday, their easels catching moonlight as they painted the gardens below. <words>53</words> His pressed flower book lay open beside him, petals arranged like constellations across yellowed pages—each specimen marking a night when meteor showers had crossed the sky in patterns only he could read. <words>81</words> The Perseid shower tonight would peak at eleven-fifteen, and he repositioned his telescope toward the constellation Perseus, knowing she would be among the students below. <words>102</words> Yuki had been attending these classes for three months, always choosing the spot beneath the cherry tree where his dried sakura blossoms had once fallen. <words>123</words> He had pressed those very flowers into his book the night they first met forty years ago, when she was a young apprentice in his village. <words>145</words> Their fates had intertwined that evening like the meteor trails he now studied, but words had never formed between them—only the language of pressed petals and distant glances. <words>170</words> The shooting stars began their dance, tracing silver messages across darkness, and Kenji decoded their ephemeral script with practiced eyes. <words>188</words> Each meteor's trajectory matched coordinates in his flower book: jasmine for unrequited longing, iris for unspoken messages, morning glory for affection that blooms only in shadow. <words>209</words> Below, Yuki paused in her painting, brush hovering above canvas as if sensing his presence in the tower above. <words>227</words> The meteor shower crescendoed, and Kenji carefully repositioned three pressed violets in his book—symbols of modesty and hidden love—aligning them with the celestial coordinates appearing overhead. <words>249</words> When morning came, he would descend and place the book on the garden bench where she always rested between classes. <words>267</words> She would recognize the flowers, remember their shared past, and perhaps finally understand that some conversations require neither words nor proximity—only the patient cultivation of moments when two distant souls acknowledge their eternal orbit around each other. <words>299</words> The last meteor faded, leaving only starlight and the sound of art students gathering their supplies. <words>315</words> Yuki looked up once toward his tower, her face a pale flower in the darkness, before disappearing into the castle's ancient corridors. <words>332</words> Kenji closed his book with the gentleness of someone tending sacred things, knowing tomorrow would bring another class, another chance to reposition the delicate evidence of their intertwined destinies. <words>357</words> In the silence between intention and revelation, their unspoken conversation continued through the language of pressed flowers and celestial signs, dramatically subtle as breathing, intimate as separate heartbeats counting the same eternal rhythm. <words>385</words> The herbalist's tower stood sentinel through the night, holding its secrets like pressed flowers between the pages of time. <words>402</words>
