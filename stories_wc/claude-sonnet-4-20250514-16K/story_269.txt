The brass gears of the observation deck groaned against the storm's fury as Elias adjusted his weathered measuring tape, the last remnant of his tailoring days before the Great Decryption changed everything. <words>32</words> Thunder crashed beyond the reinforced glass dome, where steam-powered turbines churned desperately against winds that seemed to carry whispers of forgotten algorithms. <words>52</words> In the corner, draped with silk scraps from his former shop, stood the dusty mirror he'd salvaged from the ruins of the old world. <words>73</words>

"The codes are broken now," he whispered to his reflection, though the face staring back wore different clothes, different scars, different years of sorrow. <words>94</words> Through the mirror's tarnished surface, he glimpsed another Elias—one who had never learned to stitch fabric, who had instead stitched together the very mathematics that sealed humanity's fate. <words>118</words> That other self pressed pale fingers against the glass from within, mouth moving in silent warning. <words>133</words>

Lightning illuminated the deck's copper framework as Elias leaned closer, his breath fogging the mirror's surface. <words>147</words> "I know what you're trying to tell me," he murmured, watching dozens of parallel selves materialize in the depths—each a different choice, a different path through the labyrinth of existence. <words>173</words> Some wore crowns of wire and crystal, having achieved their sought transcendence, while others lay crumpled in mechanical graveyards, their flesh merged grotesquely with grinding gears. <words>196</words>

The storm's intensity matched his racing pulse as he confessed what he'd never dared speak aloud: "I've been collecting the quantum threads from their failures, weaving them into something new." <words>220</words> His reflection's eyes widened with recognition and horror. <words>228</words> "Don't you see?" Elias pressed on, rain hammering the dome above, "Every broken code, every shattered encryption, it's all just fabric waiting to be tailored into something greater." <words>248</words>

The other Elias shook his head frantically, but the storm drowned out his warnings as lightning struck the observation deck's conductor rods. <words>265</words> In that electric moment, Elias saw the truth in the mirror's depths—his parallel selves weren't trying to warn him, they were trying to escape. <words>284</words> The subtle wrongness he'd felt in their movements, the way their mouths moved just a heartbeat too late, the desperate hunger in their collective gaze. <words>304</words>

"I can ascend," he whispered fiercely, needle and thread appearing in his weathered hands as if summoned by will alone. <words>321</words> "I can stitch myself beyond mortality, beyond these finite dimensions." <words>332</words> His reflection began to smile—not with relief, but with something ancient and patient and deeply satisfied. <words>347</words> "Let me reassure you," Elias said softly to the storm, to his fears, to the versions of himself that had already tried and failed, "this time will be different." <words>370</words> The mirror's surface rippled like water as he raised the needle, ready to sew himself into the spaces between worlds, unaware that he was merely the latest thread in a tapestry far more terrible than he could imagine. <words>398</words>
