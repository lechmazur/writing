Marcus had always justified his carefully careless approach to dog walking by claiming the ultra-rich preferred someone who wouldn't pry into their secrets. <words>23</words> He met Mrs. Ashworth at a blood drive three months ago, where her pale fingers had trembled as she signed the volunteer forms, whispering about needing someone brave enough to tend her "special pets." <words>58</words> Now, as color bled from day into night, he stood in the mansion's dining room where crystal chandeliers cast dancing shadows across walls lined with her prized botanical collection. <words>87</words>

The silence screamed louder than any sound he'd ever heard. <words>98</words> Ancient orchids twisted in their glass cases like gnarled fingers, while Venus flytraps snapped at invisible prey with an urgency that made his skin crawl. <words>120</words> Mrs. Ashworth's three Afghan hounds sat perfectly still, their eyes following movements Marcus couldn't see, their ears pricked toward whispers he couldn't hear. <words>141</words>

The silent agreements had formed naturallyâ€”he wouldn't acknowledge the cold spots that drifted through the room, and whatever haunted this place wouldn't interfere with his work. <words>165</words> He moved carefully careless among the specimens, refilling water bowls while pretending not to notice how the temperature dropped near the century-old roses that bloomed impossibly black. <words>188</words>

"Good boys," he murmured to the dogs, though they hadn't moved in twenty minutes. <words>202</words> One particularly aggressive pitcher plant had learned to recognize his footsteps, its mouth opening expectantly as he approached with the special fertilizer Mrs. Ashworth had left in unmarked containers. <words>227</words> He'd stopped asking questions about the dark, rust-colored powder weeks ago. <words>239</words>

His motivation to stand where fear dared not tread had brought him here, drawn by stories other dog walkers whispered about the Ashworth estate. <words>262</words> They spoke of previous caretakers who'd fled screaming, of groundskeepers found catatonic among the hedges, but Marcus thrived in spaces where others feared to breathe. <words>284</words>

As twilight deepened, the botanical collection seemed to pulse with its own heartbeat. <words>297</words> The loudest silence filled the dining room like a living thing, pressing against his eardrums until he thought they might burst. <words>316</words> Mrs. Ashworth had warned him about the dinner hour, when her "darlings" became most active. <words>332</words>

He carefully careless adjusted a particularly vibrant snapdragon that had somehow turned to track his movement, its petals opening and closing like a mouth forming words. <words>353</words> The dogs finally stirred, padding silently toward the kitchen where their evening meal waited. <words>367</words> Marcus followed, stepping around the cold spots with practiced ease, justified in his belief that some silences were meant to be honored, not broken. <words>388</words> Behind him, the botanical collection whispered its approval in a language older than fear itself. <words>403</words>
