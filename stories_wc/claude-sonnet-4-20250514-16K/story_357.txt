Minerva clutched her leather journal, its black rose pin glinting against the frost giant's crystalline walls, as she received the most seldom odd invitation of her collecting career. <words>26</words> The parchment had arrived via enchanted raven, requesting her presence at Gorvek's weekly board game soirée—apparently even ancient titans needed entertainment during the endless winter. <words>49</words>

As a focused collector of rare botanical specimens, she'd traveled to stranger places for lesser prizes, though admittedly none involved sitting cross-legged on ice floors playing Monopoly with a twenty-foot-tall host. <words>79</words> "Welcome, tiny scholar!" Gorvek boomed, his breath creating small snowstorms as other guests—a mix of adventurers, academics, and the chronically curious—settled around the massive game board. <words>106</words>

Throughout the first round of Settlers of Catan, Minerva found herself genuinely enjoying the company, which struck her as mildly alarming since she'd spent years perfecting the art of embracing solitude. <words>135</words> She'd always believed that loneliness was an alpha predator called despair, something to triumph over through careful cultivation of independence and scholarly pursuits. <words>155</words>

But as the dice rolled and the evening progressed through Risk, then Scrabble, then an incomprehensible frost giant game involving ice sculptures and philosophical debates, something began to unravel in her carefully constructed worldview. <words>186</words> The black rose in her journal—pressed from the Garden of Eternal Shadows—had been her reminder that beauty could exist in isolation, that one could find meaning in solitary quests for knowledge. <words>214</words>

"Your turn, plant lady," chuckled a dwarf named Thorkin during their fourth game, and Minerva realized she'd been laughing more in three hours than she had in three months. <words>242</words> The frost giant's lair, despite its intimidating architecture of ice and ancient runes, had somehow become the coziest place she'd ever experienced. <words>264</words>

As Gorvek served surprisingly delicate tea in bowls the size of bathtubs, Minerva opened her journal and touched the black rose's petals. <words>284</words> Perhaps despair wasn't a predator to defeat but simply the absence of connection—and perhaps embracing solitude didn't mean rejecting community when it genuinely presented itself. <words>307</words>

She looked around at her fellow players, all focused collectors in their own ways: Thorkin gathered stories, the elf Lyralei collected languages, and Gorvek himself apparently hoarded friendships like precious gems. <words>333</words> "Same time next week?" the frost giant asked as the evening wound down, his massive hand carefully straightening game pieces. <words>351</words>

Minerva smiled, tucking her journal safely away while mentally rearranging her schedule. <words>363</words> Some collections, she realized with earnest flippancy, were best enjoyed in the company of fellow enthusiasts—even if they happened to live in ice caves and served tea in bathtubs. <words>387</words> "Absolutely," she replied, already looking forward to next week's games. <words>397</words>
