Dr. Elara Voss pressed the seashell against her palm, its carved symbol pulsing with an otherworldly warmth as she crept through the hush of a half-lit corridor. <words>24</words> The outcast scholar had spent three years tracking down fragments of the Temporal Mirror Theory, a forbidden study that claimed souls reflected across time's boundaries at the stroke of midnight. <words>49</words> Her academic exile had begun when she'd first proposed that midnight only lasts so long—that there existed a measurable moment when one day truly died and another was born. <words>75</words>

The witch's flying carpet garage stretched before her, its cavernous space filled with rolled Persian rugs that shimmered with residual magic. <words>93</words> Dust motes danced in shafts of moonlight filtering through grimy skylights, creating an atmosphere of frantic peace that matched her racing thoughts. <words>112</words> Behind her, tucked within the public restroom's crumbling wall, lay the final diary she'd discovered—its pages detailing experiments that had cost the previous researcher her sanity. <words>133</words>

"You're the one they warned me about," came a voice from the shadows. <words>145</words> An elderly woman emerged, her strangely trustworthy face creased with concern rather than menace. <words>158</words> "The scholar who believes souls can be photographed in mirrors at midnight's true apex." <words>172</words>

Elara's hand trembled as she held up the seashell, its symbol now glowing against her skin. <words>187</words> "The diaries spoke of you—Madame Quillen, keeper of the temporal carpets." <words>199</words> She pulled out her pocket watch: 11:58 PM. <words>208</words> "I need to reach the Mirrored Realm before the transition completes." <words>218</words>

The witch studied her with eyes that seemed to weigh decades of lost researchers. <words>232</words> "That shell belonged to my predecessor, the one who discovered the soul-reflection phenomenon." <words>244</words> A sudden jolt of recognition passed between them as Madame Quillen unfurled a carpet that rippled like captured starlight. <words>261</words> "She hid the method in those restroom tiles because she knew only the desperate would look there." <words>277</words>

Elara stepped onto the carpet, feeling its ancient fibers respond to her presence. <words>290</words> The seashell's symbol blazed brighter as they rose into the night air, racing toward the cathedral's bell tower where a massive mirror waited. <words>310</words> Below them, the city held its breath in those precious seconds before midnight struck. <words>324</words>

"Thirty seconds," Madame Quillen called over the wind. <words>332</words> "Remember—the soul's reflection appears only in that infinite moment between one heartbeat and the next." <words>347</words>

As the bell tower loomed ahead, Elara gripped the seashell tighter, knowing that in moments she would either prove her theory or join the ranks of scholars who had vanished into midnight's embrace. <words>374</words> The carpet banked sharply toward the waiting mirror, its surface already beginning to shimmer as the clock hands converged on twelve. <words>393</words> Time itself seemed to slow, granting her the frantic peace she needed to finally capture proof that souls cast shadows across the boundary between yesterday and tomorrow. <words>416</words>
