Ezra stood amid the artfully messy sprawl of the radio wave garden, where rusted antenna towers sprouted like metallic wildflowers between overgrown tracks. <words>21</words> The seasoned woodsman clutched his grandmother's antique hairbrush, its silver handle catching the last rays of sunlight as he approached the abandoned water tower that marked the junction of three forgotten railway lines. <words>48</words> 

His portable equipment hummed with false cheer as he prepared to measure the echo within the tower's hollow belly, hoping the acoustic signature would reveal the precise coordinates needed to complete his obsessive mapping project. <words>77</words> For months, he'd been documenting every abandoned railway in the county, telling himself it was historical preservation, but the truth gnawed at him like termites in old timber. <words>100</words>

The final beep of his grandmother's hospital monitor still echoed in his memory, that mechanical farewell that had sent him fleeing into the wilderness with nothing but her hairbrush and a desperate need to catalog things that had already died. <words>135</words> He'd been measuring echoes in water towers, grain silos, and abandoned buildings ever since, each measurement a futile attempt to map his way back to a world that made sense. <words>159</words>

"Come on, you old bucket," he muttered to the tower, his voice artificially bright as he activated the sound equipment. <words>177</words> The first ping rang out, bouncing off the curved walls with a lonesome cry that reminded him too much of her labored breathing in those final days. <words>200</words>

His equipment began to short-circuit, sparks dancing from the control panel like angry fireflies. <words>213</words> "Dammit," he laughed, the sound hollow and brittle, because if he didn't laugh he might finally admit that all this measuring and mapping was just an elaborate way of avoiding the conversation he'd never had with her. <words>246</words>

The hairbrush trembled in his weathered hands as the truth finally surfaced like a rusty rail spike through melting snow. <words>264</words> He'd spent his life in forests and forgotten places because people were too complicated, too fragile, too likely to slip away before you could say the important things. <words>287</words>

"I'm sorry, Grandma," he whispered to the tower, to the garden of dead signals, to the ghost tracks that would never again carry anything home. <words>308</words> "I should have told you I was scared." <words>316</words>

The echo came back clean and true, a perfect measurement that mapped nothing but his own hollow spaces. <words>332</words> For the first time in months, Ezra felt something inside him stop running, stop measuring, stop pretending that distance was the same thing as healing. <words>352</words> The radio wave garden hummed around him, its artfully messy beauty suddenly seeming less like chaos and more like a place where broken things could finally rest. <words>377</words>

He pocketed the hairbrush and walked away from the tower, leaving his equipment behind like breadcrumbs for the next lost soul who needed to measure their way home. <words>402</words>
