Master Liu adjusted his botanical press with the same meticulous care he applied to poison darts, each dried chrysanthemum petal positioned precisely between the wooden plates. <words>24</words> The whispers of longing drifted through the palace corridors like incense smoke, literally murmuring his name from behind silk screens where concubines dreamed of freedom. <words>46</words> As the empire's most peculiar assassin, Liu took prophecies figuratively literal—when the oracle spoke of "death blooming in the garden," he understood both the metaphor and the actual method required. <words>73</words>

Tonight, before the first question would be asked at the Emperor's morning audience, Liu needed to amalgamate three separate fates into one inevitable outcome. <words>93</words> The prophecy demanded it: the corrupt minister, the treacherous general, and the poisonous advisor must fall together, their deaths following the pattern of a butterfly's wings. <words>115</words>

Liu studied his collection of pressed specimens, each flower corresponding to a different toxic compound he'd extracted over the years. <words>132</words> The irony wasn't lost on him that preserving beauty required the same patience as dealing death. <words>146</words> He selected three particular blooms: oleander for the minister's tea, foxglove for the general's wine, and nightshade for the advisor's evening pipe. <words>166</words>

The butterfly wing pattern meant symmetrical timing—simultaneous strikes that would appear unconnected yet create perfect balance. <words>180</words> Liu's hands remained steady as he ground the dried petals, his breathing calm despite the absurdity of his situation. <words>197</words> Other assassins used blades or arrows; he preferred the poetic justice of flowers that looked innocent pressed between pages but whispered deadly secrets when released. <words>220</words>

The palace gardens beckoned through his window, where actual butterflies danced among the very plants that would soon fulfill ancient words. <words>238</words> Liu chuckled softly at the cosmic joke—he was literally a flower arranger of fate, pressing prophecies into reality one petal at a time. <words>257</words> The whispers of longing grew stronger as midnight approached, voices of those who yearned for justice, for change, for the spinning of possibility into truth. <words>279</words>

He carefully packaged each prepared dose, labeling them with delicate calligraphy that would make any scholar proud. <words>294</words> Tomorrow, before anyone could question the coincidence, three men would discover that figurative deaths in poetry could become quite literal when the right botanist applied his craft. <words>318</words> Liu sealed his press one final time, the weight of destiny and dried flowers equally distributed between the wooden plates. <words>336</words> The butterfly's wings would flutter exactly once, and prophecy would transform into the raw possibility of a new dawn. <words>353</words> He smiled at his reflection in the polished bronze mirror, looking remarkably serene for someone about to orchestrate triple homicide through horticultural means. <words>372</words> The whispers fell silent, as if the palace itself held its breath before the first question would reshape everything. <words>388</words> Liu tucked his pressed flowers into his robes like deadly bookmarks, ready to write the next chapter of history. <words>405</words>
