In the hush of a simmering future, Marcus shuffled through the abandoned corridors of what had once been the Agency's most classified headquarters, his footsteps echoing against polished floors that reflected nothing but his own uncertainty. <words>33</words>

The insecure advisor had spent decades questioning every decision, every briefing, every whispered conversation in these halls, but now he chased a rumor beyond all reason—something about the dreamer's calling that the higher-ups had dismissed as fantasy. <words>70</words>

Through the echo of footsteps in an abandoned place, he navigated toward the restricted laboratory, where supposedly impossible things had been catalogued and forgotten. <words>93</words>

The glass container sat exactly where the encrypted message had promised: a pristine brain suspended in luminescent fluid, its label reading "DUPLICATE" in stark, clinical letters. <words>115</words>

Marcus stared at the specimen, his hands trembling as he tried to process what clearly ambiguous intelligence reports had hinted at for months—that consciousness could be copied, that dreams could be harvested, that someone's calling could be stolen and replicated. <words>149</words>

The brain pulsed gently, almost as if responding to his presence, and he felt an overwhelming urge to jab his finger against the glass, to somehow connect with whatever dreams lay trapped within. <words>177</words>

"They said it was impossible," he whispered to the empty room, his voice cracking like the fractured idyll this place had become—beautiful in its sterile perfection, yet haunted by the ethical nightmares it had spawned. <words>209</words>

The rumor spoke of agents whose dreams had been extracted, duplicated, and stored, their deepest callings preserved in these jars while their original minds forgot they had ever dreamed at all. <words>238</words>

Marcus had always been the advisor they ignored, the one whose warnings about moral boundaries fell on deaf ears, but now he understood why the facility had been abandoned so suddenly. <words>264</words>

The dreamer's calling wasn't just about following one's purpose—it was about the theft of purpose itself, the systematic harvesting of human aspiration for unknown ends. <words>287</words>

He reached toward the jar, his finger hovering inches from the glass, knowing that this single jab would either shatter his last illusions or confirm his worst fears about what the Agency had truly become. <words>318</words>

The brain seemed to pulse brighter, as if sensing his presence, and Marcus realized that the echo of footsteps he'd been hearing weren't just his own—something else moved through these corridors, something that had been waiting for him to find this terrible truth. <words>355</words>

In the silence that followed, he pressed his finger against the cold glass, and suddenly understood that he had been chasing not a rumor, but his own stolen dreams, now reflected back at him through the eyes of his duplicate's extracted consciousness. <words>389</words>

The facility's abandonment hadn't been escape—it had been containment, trapping the dreamers within their own fractured paradise while their duplicates wandered free in the world above. <words>412</words>
