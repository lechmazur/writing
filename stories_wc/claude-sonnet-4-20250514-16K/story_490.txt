Mira clutched the dried lavender bundle against her coveralls, watching the last foam dissipate where the strange tidal surge had finally retreated from the caravan repair station's lower platforms. <words>28</words>

The waves had revealed something extraordinary buried beneath decades of salt-crusted sediment: a data terminal, its crystalline surface still humming with ancient power. <words>48</words>

As the station's fading caretaker, she supposed she should report this discovery to the Transit Authority, but the allure of the forbidden pulsed through the device like a heartbeat she couldn't ignore. <words>77</words>

"Well, isn't this just fascinating," she muttered with the flat enthusiasm of someone who had seen too many wonders to truly care anymore. <words>96</words>

Her fingers moved across the interface with methodically random precision, triggering cascades of holographic text that materialized in languages both familiar and utterly alien. <words>116</words>

The lavender's scent seemed to sharpen her focus as she began to gorge herself on the flood of forbidden knowledge pouring from these ancient archives. <words>135</words>

Star charts depicting impossible geometries, equations that rewrote the laws of physics, biological schematics for creatures that had never walked any known world - each revelation hit her consciousness with the impact of distant thunder. <words>162</words>

"Marvelous," she deadpanned, though her hands trembled slightly as she hacked deeper into the system's protected cores. <words>177</words>

The repair station's familiar hum of welding torches and hydraulic lifts faded into background noise as Mira discovered records of civilizations that had risen and fallen between the spaces of atoms themselves. <words>205</words>

She pressed the lavender bundle closer to her chest, its dried petals crackling softly, a tangible anchor in an increasingly surreal experience. <words>224</words>

Her motivation had always been simple: to cradle the unknown like a newborn galaxy, nurturing mysteries until they bloomed into understanding. <words>242</words>

But this knowledge felt different - dangerous, intoxicating, absolutely off-limits according to every protocol she'd ever learned. <words>258</words>

"Oh good, another cosmic revelation," she sighed with mock weariness, even as her eyes blazed with genuine excitement at discovering the theoretical blueprints for manipulating temporal flow. <words>280</words>

The waves had given her this gift, and she would methodically extract every secret from its crystalline depths, one randomly selected file at a time. <words>301</words>

Hours passed unnoticed as Mira gorged on the archives, her enthusiastic apathy masking a growing hunger for truths that civilization had wisely chosen to forget. <words>322</words>

The lavender bundle remained pressed against her heart, its familiar scent the only thing keeping her grounded as she cradled impossible knowledge like stardust in her palms. <words>344</words>

When the next caravan arrived for repairs, they would find only an empty station and a single dried lavender bundle resting on a still-glowing terminal. <words>366</words>

Some mysteries, Mira had learned, were meant to be embraced completely, even if it meant fading away into the vast unknown she had always longed to understand. <words>389</words>

The waves had receded, but they had left behind something far more precious than salvage: a doorway to infinite secrets that demanded everything in return. <words>412</words>
