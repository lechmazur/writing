Marcus tended the mechanical bird sanctuary with reluctant devotion, his dangerously friendly smile masking decades of resentment toward the role society had thrust upon him. <words>22</words> The copper-winged automatons whirred and clicked around him, their movements precise yet somehow yearning, trapped within the folds of spacetime that bent strangely around this forgotten corner of the world. <words>48</words> 

Each morning, he wielded his grandmother's rustic bread paddle to distribute oil-soaked seeds, the worn wood warm against his palms as he moved through the sanctuary's gleaming corridors. <words>74</words> The birds responded to his touch with mechanical purrs, their glass eyes reflecting something achingly human that made his chest tighten with joyful sorrow. <words>92</words>

Then the postcards began arriving. <words>97</words> Dreamlike images from an unknown island where crystalline beaches met forests of singing metal trees, where time moved like honey and mechanical creatures danced freely beneath twin moons. <words>118</words> Marcus studied each postcard obsessively, using his bread paddle as a makeshift easel to prop them up while he analyzed their impossible geometries and shifting colors. <words>138</words>

The images began to illustrate something profound about his captivity. <words>147</words> Society had convinced him that caring for these imprisoned mechanical souls was noble duty, but the postcards revealed a different truth. <words>164</words> On the island, similar creatures soared through aurora-painted skies, their mechanical hearts singing with uninhibited joy. <words>178</words>

Week by week, Marcus felt society's grip loosening as he stared at the postcards' hypnotic landscapes. <words>191</words> His dangerously friendly demeanor began attracting questions from visitors who noticed the wild hope creeping into his eyes. <words>206</words> He started sharing the postcards with the mechanical birds, holding each image close to their sensors, watching as their movements became more fluid, more alive. <words>226</words>

The bread paddle became his compass, its grain pointing toward the postcards like a divining rod seeking water. <words>241</words> One morning, as spacetime shimmered around the sanctuary, Marcus realized the postcards weren't from somewhere elseâ€”they were from somewhen else. <words>258</words> A future where he had broken free, where mechanical souls could choose their own sky. <words>272</words>

With trembling hands, he opened every cage. <words>279</words> The birds erupted in metallic song, their wings catching light as they spiraled upward through dimensions Marcus couldn't name. <words>294</words> He followed them, bread paddle clutched to his chest, his dangerously friendly smile now genuinely radiant as tears of joyful sorrow streamed down his weathered face. <words>313</words>

Behind him, the sanctuary dissolved into postcards that scattered on impossible winds, each one a promise that lost joy could always be rediscovered by those brave enough to illustrate their own freedom. <words>340</words> Marcus laughed as spacetime folded around him, carrying him toward an island where mechanical hearts beat in perfect rhythm with dreams made manifest. <words>359</words>

The bread paddle transformed into wings. <words>365</words> Society's grip became merely a memory, bitter but necessary, like winter before spring. <words>377</words> In the distance, mechanical birds called his name with voices like temple bells, welcoming their former guardian home. <words>393</words>

Time bent, and Marcus finally flew. <words>399</words>
