Kex fingered the torn corner of a flyer, its edges frayed like his patience with the memory trade. <words>17</words> Inside the giant mushroom house, bioluminescent walls pulsed with a rhythm that matched the dying windmill's final rotations outside. <words>35</words> He was comfortingly pessimistic about his chances—failure felt more honest than hope in this business. <words>50</words>

The tradesman's calloused hands adjusted the synchronized watches strapped to both wrists, their faces glowing amber in the fungal twilight. <words>68</words> Each timepiece tracked different temporal layers of corrupted memories, and today he needed to vectorize the fragments before they dissolved completely. <words>86</words> The mathematical conversion of human recollection into navigable coordinates was his specialty, though the work left him perpetually exhausted. <words>104</words>

"Another lost soul's childhood," he muttered, studying the flyer's remnant. <words>115</words> The paper fragment contained traces of a carnival advertisement, but memory distortion had warped it into something else entirely—a map of sorrows, perhaps, or directions to nowhere. <words>139</words>

Through the mushroom's translucent walls, he could see the ancient windmill completing its thousandth and final revolution. <words>156</words> Time was running out to preserve this particular memory cluster before it scattered into the void. <words>171</words> Kex lit his flickering candle, its flame casting dancing shadows that seemed to move independently of the light source. <words>189</words>

The synchronized watches began their harmonic chiming—a signal that the temporal alignment was perfect for memory vectorization. <words>205</words> He held the torn flyer against the candlelight, watching as data streams emerged from the paper like ghostly smoke. <words>222</words> Through his specialized goggles, Kex could see the memory's mathematical skeleton: vectors pointing toward joy, despair, confusion, all distorted by time's relentless editing. <words>242</words>

His motivation had always been singular—to carry this flickering candle of consciousness through the endless void of forgotten experiences. <words>260</words> Each memory he saved was a small victory against the entropy that devoured human connection. <words>275</words> The mushroom house groaned as the windmill's final rotation sent vibrations through the earth, marking the end of an era. <words>294</words>

With practiced precision, Kex began mapping the memory vectors onto his portable grid, each coordinate a breadcrumb leading back to someone's lost past. <words>314</words> The blurry vividness of the experience overwhelmed him—details sharp as razors emerging from fog-thick uncertainty. <words>329</words> The torn flyer disintegrated in his hands, but its essence now lived within his vectorized archive. <words>344</words>

Outside, the windmill fell silent forever. <words>351</words> Kex extinguished his candle with a satisfied grunt, knowing he'd preserved another fragment of humanity's fading dream. <words>367</words> His pessimism felt comfortable, like worn leather gloves—it protected him from the devastating beauty of what people chose to forget. <words>385</words> Tomorrow would bring more broken memories to collect, more vectors to plot through the mathematical landscape of loss. <words>401</words> The mushroom house settled into darkness, waiting for the next memory merchant to arrive. <words>415</words>
