Naia clutched the threadbare unicorn plush as she glided through the kelp forests of Pelagios, her daily nature walk serving a purpose darker than meditation. <words>22</words> The zealot assassin had killed seventeen souls in service to the Coral Throne, yet this faded carnival prize—won during her last surface visit as a child—remained her most treasured possession. <words>49</words> Today's constitutional through the bioluminescent gardens would help her consolidate the fragments of an epic tale she'd been crafting, one that cast herself as the villain in a story everyone else considered heroic. <words>80</words>

The reversed echoes of her footsteps through the city's calcified corridors seemed to whisper back her victims' names, each ripple in the water refracting her moral certainty into prismatic doubt. <words>106</words> She paused beside a brain coral formation, its labyrinthine surface reflecting her face in countless distorted angles—each one revealing a different interpretation of righteousness. <words>127</words> "Chapter Seven," she announced to a passing school of angelfish, her voice carrying that calculatedly playful tone that had unnerved so many targets. <words>147</words> "In which our heroine realizes she's been the monster all along." <words>158</words>

The unicorn's button eye had long since fallen out, leaving a hollow socket that mirrored Naia's own growing emptiness. <words>176</words> She'd murdered the Reef Council's enemies with surgical precision, believing wholly in their divine mandate to purify the seas. <words>193</words> But walking these same paths where children played among the anemone gardens, she began questioning whether her targets had families who missed them as desperately as she missed her surface-world innocence. <words>219</words>

"The Coral Zealot," she continued her narration, watching hermit crabs scuttle past, "convinced herself that each kill brought cosmic balance, but the ocean remembers everything." <words>239</words> The current carried her words away, mixing them with the eternal songs of whale-song and tidal shifts. <words>255</words> Her reflection fragmented across a thousand shell surfaces, each shard showing her from a victim's perspective—not as a holy warrior, but as death incarnate wearing a child's smile. <words>280</words>

She pressed the plush closer to her chest, feeling its synthetic fur dissolve slightly in the salt water. <words>296</words> Tomorrow she would complete her eighteenth assignment, but tonight she would finish consolidating this backwards epic—a testament to how easily righteousness could become corruption when viewed through the kaleidoscope of moral reflection. <words>322</words> The reef city sparkled around her like a living constellation, beautiful and terrible in its indifference. <words>337</words> In her twisted fairy tale, there would be no redemption, only the devastating clarity that comes from seeing yourself through your enemies' eyes. <words>357</words> The faded unicorn bore witness to this revelation, its remaining button eye catching the last rays of filtered sunlight like a dying star. <words>378</words> Naia laughed softly, the sound echoing through the coral chambers—a hymn of humorous solemnity for all the monsters who believed themselves saints. <words>397</words>
