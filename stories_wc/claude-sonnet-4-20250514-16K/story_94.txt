Dr. Valentina traced the amber earrings at her lobes as she gazed into the sky reflection pool, watching cloud trails drift across its crystalline surface like breadcrumbs leading to forgotten hearts. <words>27</words> In this era after time travel's invention, when people could revisit their past loves and future heartbreaks, her clients sought her counsel more desperately than ever. <words>50</words> The gravity of desires, she'd learned, only intensified when one could witness their romantic failures across multiple timelines. <words>67</words>

"Tell me about the day you stopped believing in love," she said to Marcus, her latest client, whose wife had left him in three separate decades. <words>87</words> Her restlessly curious nature compelled her to probe deeper, even as her own heart remained locked behind professional detachment. <words>104</words> She watched the cloud formations shift in the pool's reflection, tracking their trails as they revealed the hidden patterns of human longing. <words>123</words>

Marcus sobbed, describing how he'd time-traveled to every anniversary, trying to fix the moment things went wrong. <words>138</words> Valentina's fingers moved to zip her leather jacket closed against the sudden chill, though she knew the cold came from within. <words>156</words> Each client's story added another bar to her cage of illusions—the belief that she could heal others while remaining untouchable herself. <words>176</words>

"The clouds never lie," she murmured, studying a spiral formation that seemed to mirror Marcus's circular thinking. <words>191</words> Her method of tracking cloud trails had proven uncannily accurate at revealing the true nature of people's romantic obsessions. <words>207</words> But tonight, as she guided Marcus toward acceptance, the amber earrings felt heavier, weighted with her own unexamined desires. <words>223</words>

"Doctor, how do you stay so strong?" Marcus asked, hope flickering in his eyes. <words>237</words> The question struck like lightning, illuminating the careful distance she maintained from her own emotions. <words>251</words> Her cautious impulsiveness warred within her—part of her wanted to confess her own loneliness, while another part retreated further into her professional shell. <words>272</words>

She stood abruptly, her reflection fracturing in the pool as ripples disturbed the mirrored sky. <words>286</words> "Perhaps," she said slowly, watching a cloud trail dissolve into wisps, "the greatest freedom comes from admitting we're all trapped by what we want most." <words>308</words> The amber earrings caught the last light as she turned away from the pool, finally ready to proclaim herself free from the cage of illusions she'd built around her own heart. <words>336</words>

Marcus watched her go, understanding that sometimes the healer must first learn to heal herself. <words>350</words> In the pool, the clouds continued their eternal dance, tracking the paths of desires across an infinite sky, waiting for the next seeker brave enough to read their truth. <words>377</words> The gravity of what we want most, Valentina realized, isn't a force that traps us—it's the weight that finally sets us free. <words>399</words>
