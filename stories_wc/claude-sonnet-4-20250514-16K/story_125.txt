Marcus sifted through another stack of misdelivered packages in the abandoned space station control room, his exceptionally usual Tuesday taking an unexpectedly interesting turn. <words>25</words> The farmland beyond the cracked viewport stretched endlessly toward the horizon, soon to be sold to developers who would erase generations of his family's magical heritage. <words>48</words> As an underachieving mage whose spells barely managed to light candles, he'd grown accustomed to disappointment, but today felt different—charged with the kind of bored excitement that preceded either triumph or spectacular failure. <words>79</words>

The postal drone had been dumping packages here for months, mistaking the derelict station for the new agricultural depot coordinates. <words>97</words> Marcus had been coming here to sort through them, returning what he could while keeping anything interesting, though nothing had been particularly interesting until now. <words>119</words>

His fingers trembled as he unwrapped a small box addressed to "Archmage M. Thorne"—his great-grandfather's title, though the old man had been dead for thirty years. <words>141</words> Inside, nestled in velvet, lay a porcelain doll head with mechanical eyes that blinked once, twice, then fixed their gaze on him with unsettling intelligence. <words>163</words>

"About time," the doll head said in a voice like grinding gears. <words>174</words> "I've been waiting in that postal limbo for decades." <words>184</words>

Marcus nearly dropped it, his pulse quickening despite his practiced indifference. <words>194</words> "You're... what exactly?" <words>199</words>

"Your inheritance," it replied, blinking again. <words>206</words> "The final component of the Thorne family's greatest spell, designed to unveil the true potential locked within bloodline mages." <words>224</words> "Your great-grandfather hid me in the postal system, knowing that only when the farm faced its darkest hour would the packages find their way to the right place." <words>249</words>

Marcus felt something stir within him—not magic exactly, but recognition. <words>260</words> His whole life, he'd been told he was broken, incapable of accessing the power that ran in his veins. <words>278</words> But perhaps that wasn't limitation; perhaps it was protection, keeping him safe until he was ready to spring the trap on his own perceived inadequacies. <words>302</words>

The doll's eyes began to glow as Marcus lifted it toward the control panel's crystal matrix. <words>318</words> "The station's still connected to the farm's ley lines," it explained. <words>329</words> "Channel your intent through me, and we'll unveil what's been hidden." <words>341</words>

As Marcus pressed the doll head against the crystal, energy surged through him—not the flashy magic of stories, but something deeper, more fundamental. <words>361</words> The farmland below began to shimmer, revealing ancient protective wards his family had woven into the very soil. <words>378</words> For the first time in his exceptionally usual life, Marcus smiled with genuine excitement, knowing he'd finally found his true purpose. <words>397</words> The trap was sprung. <words>401</words>
