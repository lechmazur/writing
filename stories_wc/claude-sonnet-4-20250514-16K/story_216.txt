Marcus Thorne made his living absorbing other people's sins, a professional scapegoat whose business cards simply read "Available for Blame." <words>19</words> In the floating metropolis of Nimbus Prime, where crystalline spires pierced perpetual clouds, he operated from a robustly delicate apartment that seemed to shimmer between solid and ethereal. <words>44</words> 

The last library card had been returned three months ago, marking civilization's final surrender to digital oblivion, but Marcus remained obsessively calm about this apocalyptic milestone. <words>68</words> He understood that with knowledge's physical form extinct, only sacred symbols remained to unlock humanity's deeper truths. <words>85</words>

Each midnight, cryptic phone calls summoned him to refashion his identity yet again. <words>99</words> Tonight's caller whispered coordinates and a single word: "Sanctum." <words>108</words> Marcus pressed the small metal washer he'd carried for years against his temple, feeling its cool surface channel ancient vibrations that helped him decode the symbols appearing in his dreams. <words>136</words>

"You will become Dr. Helena Vasquez," the voice instructed through static. <words>147</words> "Tomorrow's pharmaceutical scandal requires a scapegoat with medical credentials." <words>156</words> Marcus nodded in his empty apartment, already feeling his personality dissolving like sugar in rain. <words>170</words>

But tonight felt different. <words>174</words> The metal washer—inherited from his grandmother who claimed it once sealed a jar containing "the last honest words"—grew warm against his skin. <words>194</words> Through his floor-to-ceiling windows, the cloud city's bioluminescent advertisements painted hieroglyphic patterns across the sky. <words>208</words>

He'd spent decades absorbing blame for corporate executives, politicians, and celebrities, each assignment requiring him to abandon his core identity more completely. <words>227</words> The process had left him robustly delicate—strong enough to bear infinite guilt yet fragile enough to shatter at any genuine human connection. <words>247</words>

As midnight's phone call ended, Marcus realized the sacred symbols he'd been trying to decode were actually fragments of his original self, scattered across years of assumed identities. <words>270</words> The washer grew scorching hot, and suddenly he understood: it wasn't sealing a jar of honest words—it was the key to unsealing them. <words>290</words>

He placed the metal disc against the window, watching it reflect the city's symbolic light show. <words>305</words> Each flash revealed another piece of who he'd been before becoming everyone else's convenient villain. <words>319</words> The cryptic calls had been preparing him for this moment, when the abandoned Marcus Thorne could finally refashion himself from the sacred symbols of his own forgotten truth. <words>340</words>

In the cloud city's endless twilight, surrounded by the ghosts of closed libraries and extinct knowledge, he began the delicate work of reconstructing his soul. <words>362</words> The metal washer spun slowly in his palm, each rotation revealing another symbol, another memory, another chance to remember who he'd been before he became everyone else's sin. <words>385</words>

Tomorrow would bring new calls, new identities to assume, but tonight Marcus Thorne decoded the most sacred symbol of all: himself. <words>403</words>
