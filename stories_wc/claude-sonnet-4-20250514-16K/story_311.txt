Marcus pressed his palm against the transparent aluminum of the lunar greenhouse, watching Earth's blue marble hang suspended above the crater's jagged rim. <words>21</words> His shoulders remained rigid despite the serenity of the hydroponic gardens around him, a tense bodyguard even in this sanctuary three hundred thousand miles from any terrestrial threat. <words>44</words> The faded photograph tucked in his breast pocket seemed to burn against his chest, its edges worn smooth from countless nervous touches during his mandatory park visits to the station's recreation deck. <words>71</words>

For months, he had been serendipitously stubborn in his habit of lingering near conversations, collecting fragments of overheard stories like a detective assembling evidence. <words>92</words> The other guards spoke in hushed tones about Director Vance's previous bodyguards, how they had all mysteriously requested transfers or simply vanished from the payroll. <words>113</words> Each whispered fragment painted a darker picture of the man Marcus was sworn to protect. <words>127</words>

Today's revelation had arrived during his virtual park simulation, where he escaped to remember Earth's forests and meadows. <words>143</words> A maintenance worker, unaware of Marcus's presence behind the oak hologram, had mentioned seeing the Director dispose of personnel files in the incinerator. <words>163</words> The worker had specifically mentioned Marcus's predecessor, a woman whose disappearance had never been properly explained. <words>178</words>

Marcus withdrew the photograph, studying the image of a young girl with his eyes and his mother's smile. <words>195</words> His sister Sarah had been working as a junior botanist on this very station before he arrived, before Director Vance had convinced him that family connections were dangerous liabilities in security work. <words>219</words> The controlling influence that had shaped his entire career suddenly crystallized into focus with sickening clarity. <words>234</words>

The greenhouse's automated systems hummed peacefully around him as serene anger settled in his bones like gravity. <words>250</words> He would ratify his suspicions by accessing the Director's private files tonight, using the man's own paranoid security protocols against him. <words>269</words> This timely rebirth of his true purpose felt inevitable, as if the lunar soil itself had been nurturing his awakening. <words>287</words>

Sarah's face smiled up at him from the photograph, forever frozen at seventeen, forever trusting her big brother to protect her. <words>305</words> Marcus had failed her once by believing Vance's lies, but he would not fail her memory. <words>320</words> The fragments of overheard stories had woven themselves into an undeniable truth, and tomorrow's shift would bring either justice or his own mysterious disappearance. <words>341</words>

He tucked the photograph away and turned toward the greenhouse exit, his reflection ghostlike in the dome's surface. <words>357</words> Beyond the crater's edge, Earth waited three days away, but Marcus knew he might never see those blue skies again. <words>376</words> The thought should have terrified him, but instead it filled him with the calm certainty of a man finally ready to honor his real duty. <words>399</words>
