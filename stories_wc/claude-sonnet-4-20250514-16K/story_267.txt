Marcus adjusted his security badge with the same methodical precision he applied to everything, watching resort guests pedal their gravity-defying bikes along the event horizon's luminous edge. <words>25</words> The Void's Edge Resort marketed itself as the ultimate destination for thrill-seekers, where black hole tourism met luxury accommodations, but Marcus found the whole spectacle poetically bland—like watching expensive fireworks through frosted glass. <words>55</words>

"Another thread's come loose," whispered Elena, the resort's blacksmith, gesturing toward her massive anvil where she forged the specialized bike frames that could withstand the gravitational anomalies. <words>81</words> Marcus studied the literal unraveling thread she pointed to—a shimmering filament of spacetime itself beginning to fray near the hammer's resting place. <words>102</words>

The resort's board of directors would expect him to either sound the evacuation alarm like a hero or suppress the information like a villain, but Marcus refused such simplistic categorizations. <words>126</words> Instead, he nodded toward the service alleyways where maintenance cats roamed freely, their enhanced genetics allowing them to navigate the resort's dimensional quirks. <words>146</words>

"I'll investigate quietly," he said, his voice carrying that peculiar flatness that made even urgent declarations sound like grocery lists. <words>164</words>

Marcus followed a silver tabby named Quantum through the narrow passages between the resort's floating modules, disguising his investigation as routine maintenance checks. <words>183</words> The cat's path revealed what the sensors had missed—more unraveling threads appearing wherever the blacksmith's latest creations had been installed. <words>201</words>

Amid the afternoon's bike tours, where guests shrieked with savage bliss as they rode impossibly close to the black hole's photon sphere, Marcus discovered Elena's secret. <words>223</words> She had been weaving compressed spacetime into her metal work, creating bikes that didn't just resist the black hole's pull but actively fed off it. <words>246</words>

"You're not stopping me," Elena declared when he found her at the anvil, hammer raised. <words>260</words>

"I'm not trying to," Marcus replied with his characteristic bland certainty. <words>271</words> "But your threads are destabilizing the resort's position." <words>280</words>

She paused, hammer suspended. <words>285</words> "So what are you—hero or villain?" <words>292</words>

Marcus watched another tour group spiral past in savage, joyful loops, their laughter echoing across the cosmic void. <words>307</words> "I'm a guard," he said simply. <words>314</words> "I guard things worth protecting." <words>320</words>

Together, they studied the unraveling threads, neither hero nor villain but two individuals choosing cooperation over conflict. <words>337</words> Elena began adjusting her technique while Marcus followed the cats to map every compromised area, their work unfolding amid the eternal dance of light and darkness at the universe's most beautiful precipice. <words>365</words>

The threads slowly re-wove themselves, spacetime healing under their careful attention, proving that sometimes the most savage bliss comes from refusing to choose sides and simply choosing to care. <words>391</words>
