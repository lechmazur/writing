Lyra clutched the worn-out dinosaur plush against her chest, its faded purple scales catching the harsh xenon light that bathed the underground tunnel. <words>22</words> As a bard, she should have carried a lute or harp, but the threadbare toy felt more honest somehow—a relic from childhood dreams that refused to die. <words>44</words> The dream-hopping machines hummed around her like sleeping giants, their chrome surfaces reflecting the artificial glow that made everything look both futuristic and eerily ancient. <words>67</words>

"Another one?" whispered Dr. Chen, gesturing toward the latest patient strapped into Machine Seven. <words>81</words> Lyra nodded, her voice barely audible yet somehow carrying the weight of mountains when she spoke. <words>96</words> "The nightmares are getting worse as we approach midnight," she murmured, her shyly loud manner making even the technicians lean closer to catch her words. <words>116</words>

This year—2029—had been the one everyone wanted to forget, when the neural plague swept through half the world's population, leaving survivors trapped in recursive loops of trauma. <words>139</words> Lyra had discovered, quite by accident, that her songs could navigate the labyrinthine dreamscapes where people's minds had retreated. <words>157</words> But tonight felt different; tonight, at the crossing of this cursed year into whatever came next, she sensed something fragile about time itself. <words>178</words>

The machine's neural crown settled over her temples with a familiar electric kiss. <words>191</words> She dove into the patient's dream, finding herself in a child's bedroom where the same dinosaur plush sat on every surface, multiplied into infinity like a hall of mirrors made from sorrow. <words>216</words> Here was the tapestry she needed to unravel—each plush toy a thread of grief, woven so tightly that the dreamer couldn't wake. <words>235</words>

"Listen," Lyra sang, her voice paradoxically gentle yet thunderous in the dream-space, "time isn't breaking, it's just... reshaping itself." <words>252</words> She began to motivate the scattered fragments of the patient's psyche, coaxing them toward integration rather than escape. <words>268</words> The dinosaur plushies began to fade one by one, not disappearing but transforming into something lighter—paper birds that carried away the weight of remembered pain. <words>290</words>

As the patient's breathing steadied in the real world, Lyra felt the ironic awe that always accompanied her work. <words>307</words> Here, surrounded by machines that let humans leap between consciousnesses like ancient shamans, she wielded the oldest magic of all: storytelling. <words>326</words> The xenon lights flickered as 2029 finally died, and in that moment between heartbeats, between years, she understood that time's fragility was actually its greatest strength. <words>349</words> It could be torn, yes, but it could also be rewoven into something beautiful. <words>363</words>

She emerged from the machine holding her own dinosaur plush a little less tightly, knowing that sometimes the most profound healing came from learning to let go gently rather than clinging desperately to what was already gone. <words>395</words> The new year whispered its first hello in the tunnel's electric hum. <words>407</words>
