Mira adjusted the brass thermometer's delicate gears, watching mercury dance through its spiraled chamber as she worked in her suspended palace. <words>20</words> The crystalline structure hung from massive stalactites deep within the Earth's last stable cavern, where she crafted her oddly truthful mechanical fortune-tellers. <words>39</words> Each automaton she sculpted would tell visitors exactly how many heartbeats they had left, delivered through whimsical carnival performances that made mortality feel like entertainment. <words>59</words>

The thermometer had been climbing steadily for months, recording the cavern's warming as the surface world collapsed above. <words>76</words> Mira's mechanical prophets, destined for tomorrow's pop-up carnival, would need to incorporate this environmental data into their predictions. <words>92</words> She had spent decades chronicling these changes through her tinkering, believing that if people could see their own endings clearly, they might finally care about the planet's. <words>112</words>

As her brush touched the automaton's painted face for the first time, the moment stretched impossibly. <words>126</words> In that single stroke, she felt the weight of every fortune her creations would deliver: the child who had seven decades remaining, the elderly woman with merely days, the young man whose reckless driving would end everything next Thursday. <words>151</words> The brass thermometer ticked higher, and Mira understood that her own mortality was intertwined with the Earth's fever. <words>167</words>

Her palace swayed gently on its stalactite anchors, responding to tremors from the surface. <words>179</words> The carnival would arrive tomorrow, setting up their bright tents around her workshop's entrance, drawing crowds who thought they were seeking entertainment. <words>197</words> Instead, they would receive the truth wrapped in practical illusion: mechanical dancers that calculated carbon footprints, fortune wheels that spun to reveal species extinction rates, mirror mazes that reflected environmental tipping points. <words>221</words>

The paintbrush completed its stroke, and time resumed its normal pace. <words>232</words> Mira's latest creation opened its brass eyes, peering up at her with the accumulated wisdom of a thousand climate measurements. <words>248</words> "Forty-three years," it whispered in a voice like grinding gears, reading both her life expectancy and the time remaining before the cavern's ecosystem collapsed. <words>267</words>

She smiled, oddly comforted by the honesty. <words>274</words> Her thermometer registered another degree of warming, but her automaton army was nearly complete. <words>287</words> Tomorrow, carnival-goers would laugh at their mechanical fortunes, never realizing they were receiving the most important information of their lives. <words>303</words> Mira returned to her sculpting, adding final details to faces that would speak truths no human fortune-teller dared voice. <words>319</words>

The suspended palace creaked around her like a ship in a storm, and the brass thermometer climbed toward tomorrow's revelations. <words>336</words> In her workshop where illusion served practicality, she prepared her whimsical ambassadors of truth for their brief moment in the dying sun. <words>353</words> Each fortune would be perfectly accurate, delivered with just enough magic to make mortality bearable. <words>366</words> The thermometer's mercury reached another degree, marking time until both the carnival and the world would transform forever. <words>382</words> Mira's oddly truthful creations would ensure that when the end came, no one could claim they hadn't been warned. <words>399</words>
