Elena pressed her weathered palms against the cool glass walls of the clifftop observatory, watching the Atlantic surge beneath her in patterns she had spent three decades memorizing. <words>27</words>

Once a celebrated herbalist whose tonics could cure anything from heartbreak to plague, she now devoted herself entirely to studying tide patterns with the same fervent indifference that had driven her to perfect every formula. <words>61</words>

The blacksmith's bellows she had salvaged from the village below wheezed rhythmically beside her, repurposed to create precise air pressure measurements that corresponded with tidal shifts. <words>86</words>

During these afternoon napping hours, when the world slumbered and she remained vigilantly awake, Elena tracked the flight path of a lone goose that appeared each day at exactly 2:47 PM. <words>115</words>

The bird's trajectory, she had discovered, predicted tidal anomalies with uncanny accuracy, though she could never quite articulate why this mattered to anyone, including herself. <words>141</words>

She cherished these moments of solitary observation, when her thoughtfully thoughtless nature could flourish without judgment or expectation. <words>159</words>

Her former patients had called her brilliant, then obsessive, then mad, as she gradually abandoned human healing for the ocean's cryptic rhythms. <words>179</words>

The price of perfection had been everything: her practice, her reputation, her connection to the very people she had once saved with her botanical mastery. <words>202</words>

Now, sapped of her former vitality but somehow more alive than ever, she measured wave heights against atmospheric pressure, recording data in notebooks that would likely never be read. <words>230</words>

The goose appeared on schedule, its wings cutting through salt air as it followed its mysterious route from northeast to southwest. <words>251</words>

Elena adjusted the bellows, noting how the pressure gauge fluctuated in harmony with the bird's descent toward the water. <words>269</words>

Everything connected, she realized with the same detached passion that had once driven her to distill perfect remedies from imperfect plants. <words>289</words>

The tide would turn in thirty-seven minutes, exactly when the goose would disappear beyond the southern headland. <words>306</words>

She had predicted this correlation for sixty-three consecutive days, yet the accomplishment felt both monumentally important and utterly meaningless. <words>325</words>

Through the glass walls, she watched fishing boats dot the horizon like scattered seeds, their crews blissfully unaware of the mathematical poetry unfolding beneath their hulls. <words>351</words>

Elena smiled, or perhaps frowned â€“ the distinction had become irrelevant in her pursuit of oceanic perfection. <words>366</words>

The bellows exhaled another measured breath, the goose completed another arc, and the tide prepared for its inevitable surrender to celestial forces. <words>385</words>

She had traded everything human for this: the privilege of witnessing infinity through the lens of salt water and solitude. <words>403</words>

The price had been steep, but the currency was knowledge, and Elena had always been thoughtlessly generous with her wealth. <words>423</words>
