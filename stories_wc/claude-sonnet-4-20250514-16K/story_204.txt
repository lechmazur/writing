Maya clutched the phantom train ticket punch in her sweating palm, its brass edges worn smooth by decades of absent-minded fidgeting. <words>19</words> The abandoned spaceport hangar had been converted into Luna City's most prestigious farmer's market, where vendors hawked earthworms and heirloom tomatoes beneath rusting launch gantries that would never again taste rocket fuel. <words>51</words> Today, however, the usual bustle had given way to an expectant hush as the agricultural guild prepared to present their annual Humanitarian Service Award. <words>72</words>

As a professional cuddler, Maya had spent five years navigating the unspoken rules that governed her unusual profession—never presume intimacy, always respect boundaries, charge fairly for emotional labor that society deemed both desperately needed and vaguely shameful. <words>106</words> The nomination letter had called her work "unusually usual," a perfect description for something that felt as ancient as human touch yet as novel as regulated therapeutic contact. <words>131</words>

She watched the morning light filter through gaps in the deteriorating ceiling, illuminating motes of dust that danced like tiny ghosts above vendors peddling their wares. <words>154</words> Everything here seemed caught in beautiful decay—the hangar slowly surrendering to time while life persistently sprouted from its cracks. <words>171</words>

"You're the cuddler, aren't you?" <words>177</words>

Maya turned to find an elderly man studying her with curious eyes, his gnarled hands sorting through a basket of purple carrots. <words>196</words> She braced herself for the usual mixture of pity and prurient interest that her profession inspired. <words>211</words>

"I am," she replied carefully, following the unspoken rules of these encounters. <words>223</words>

"My grandson, he's autistic," the man continued, his voice dropping to a whisper. <words>236</words> "Never liked being touched, not until he met you last year." <words>247</words> His weathered face cracked into a smile. <words>254</words> "Changed everything for our family." <words>260</words>

Maya felt the phantom punch warm in her palm—a relic from her grandfather's railroad days that she carried for luck, though she'd never understood why until now. <words>284</words> Perhaps some tools transcended their original purpose, connecting disparate moments across time. <words>296</words>

The microphone crackled to life somewhere behind the heirloom apple display. <words>307</words> "Ladies and gentlemen, our service award recipient..." <words>316</words>

The man pressed a small bunch of carrots into her free hand. <words>328</words> "These are for your acceptance speech," he said. <words>337</words> "Grown in soil that's seen both starships and root vegetables—seemed fitting for someone who bridges worlds like you do." <words>356</words>

As Maya walked toward the makeshift stage, she realized she'd been carrying her grandfather's punch all these years not for luck, but as a reminder that the most meaningful journeys often required the simplest tools: patience, presence, and the courage to touch what others found untouchable. <words>396</words> The hush deepened, waiting for her words. <words>403</words>
