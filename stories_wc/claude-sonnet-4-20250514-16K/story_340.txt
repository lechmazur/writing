Esperanza balanced precariously on the rope bridge connecting the upper canopies of Nueva Selva, clutching the wizard's battered grimoire that had belonged to her predecessor. <words>23</words> The treehouse city sprawled beneath her like a verdant maze of platforms and walkways, where exorcists like herself kept the spiritual balance between the living world and whatever lurked beyond the veil. <words>50</words> "Another day, another demon," she muttered with characteristic sass, though the leather-bound tome felt heavier than usual in her calloused hands. <words>68</words>

The clock tower's ancient mechanism chose that precise moment to hiccup, skipping its usual beat and sending a ripple of unease through the canopy dwellers below. <words>89</words> Esperanza's mentor had always warned her that such temporal anomalies meant trouble was brewing, and today she could feel it in her bones like humidity before a storm. <words>111</words> The grimoire's pages fluttered open on their own, revealing a spell she'd never seen before: Juvenescere Umbram—to youthify shadows. <words>129</words>

"Well, that's ominously convenient," she said, rolling her eyes at the universe's theatrical timing. <words>142</words> The main bridge to the eastern district had collapsed overnight, forcing her to take this precarious route when she should have been preparing for the Conclave of Spirits. <words>163</words> Her rival, Magnus, would surely use her tardiness to cement his position as the city's premier exorcist, casting her accomplishments into shadow once again. <words>183</words>

But as Esperanza studied the cryptic incantation, she realized the spell wasn't about youth at all—it was about responsibility, about shouldering burdens that aged souls beyond their years. <words>205</words> The weight of protecting Nueva Selva had been crushing her spirit slowly, methodically, like vines strangling ancient trees. <words>220</words> Perhaps this magic could reverse the process, not by making her younger, but by lightening the load that came with being the city's spiritual guardian. <words>240</words>

"Time to show Magnus what real exorcism looks like," she declared, her fierce grin cutting through the humid air. <words>256</words> The grimoire's pages began to glow as she chanted the ancient words, feeling decades of accumulated spiritual fatigue lifting from her shoulders like morning mist. <words>276</words> Around her, the treehouse city seemed to pulse with renewed energy, its wooden platforms creaking in approval. <words>291</words>

The shadow she'd been fighting wasn't external—it was her own doubt, her own crushing sense of duty. <words>306</words> As the spell concluded, Esperanza felt genuinely light for the first time in years, her spirit restored to its naturally feisty state. <words>324</words> She tucked the grimoire under her arm and sprinted across the remaining bridges, ready to face whatever supernatural crisis awaited with renewed vigor and trademark irreverence. <words>344</words> After all, someone had to keep the demons in check, and it might as well be someone who could crack jokes while doing it. <words>365</words> The clock tower resumed its steady rhythm, and Nueva Selva breathed easy once more. <words>377</words>
