Erasmus adjusted his charcoal blazer with deliberate nonchalance, his thin lips pressed into a determined line as he descended deeper into the forgotten library buried within the abandoned copper mine. <words>26</words> The December chill couldn't penetrate these depths, where centuries of accumulated dust muffled his footsteps on rotting floorboards. <words>43</words> Tonight, when the final calendar page of the year would flip to welcome January, he would finally optimize his understanding of the ancient maritime mysteries. <words>65</words>

His formally casual demeanor—pressed slacks paired with an untucked oxford shirt—belied the urgency driving him through these shadow-draped stacks. <words>83</words> Somewhere among these moldering tomes lay the key to locating the Eriksson figurehead fragment, a carved piece of Viking ship prow that supposedly contained navigational secrets lost for eight hundred years. <words>108</words>

Erasmus pulled a leather-bound volume from a collapsed shelf, its spine cracked and illegible. <words>121</words> Inside, he found exactly what the discredited folklore texts had promised: detailed sketches of runic patterns that matched descriptions of the lost artifacts he'd spent decades pursuing. <words>143</words> The academic establishment had dismissed these particular manuscripts as fraudulent, but Erasmus knew better—their rumored cures for historical amnesia were precisely what he needed. <words>166</words>

"Knowledge is sustenance," he muttered, tracing the angular symbols with one pale finger. <words>179</words> The warnings from his former colleagues echoed mockingly: such obsession would consume him, they'd said, leave him hollow and mad. <words>198</words> But they couldn't understand his hunger, his need to gorge on every scrap of forgotten wisdom, regardless of consequence. <words>217</words>

The warlock's breath misted in the frigid air as he cross-referenced three separate texts, their contradictory accounts somehow forming a coherent pattern in his mind. <words>238</words> Yes, the figurehead fragment was definitely here, somewhere in these tunnels, waiting to reveal its maritime magic to someone worthy of comprehension. <words>258</words> His thin lips curved into something resembling a smile as he realized the obvious truth that had escaped lesser scholars. <words>277</words>

By combining the discredited navigation formulas with modern optimization principles, he could extract the fragment's embedded knowledge without triggering its protective enchantments. <words>298</words> The certainty felt absolute, even as the logic remained beautifully, mysteriously unclear to anyone but himself. <words>315</words>

Outside, midnight church bells began their countdown to the new year. <words>327</words> Erasmus gathered the essential texts under his arm and ventured deeper into the mine's heart, following instincts that felt both completely rational and utterly inexplicable. <words>347</words> The figurehead fragment called to him through stone and time, promising revelations that would justify every warning he'd ignored. <words>365</words> His formally casual stride never wavered as he walked toward whatever transformation awaited in the darkness ahead. <words>381</words> After all, optimization required sacrifice, and knowledge demanded its price from those bold enough to pay. <words>397</words>
