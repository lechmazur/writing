Ezra hunched against the salt-crusted headstone, his weathered fingers working the short piece of yarn into intricate knots that his grandmother had taught him decades ago. <words>25</words> The sailor's graveyard stretched before him in the grey light between autumn and winter, where neither season claimed dominion over the restless dead. <words>47</words> As the island's surly watchman, he had spent fifteen years cataloging the patterns of death that washed ashore with each storm, seeking the cosmic rhythms that governed when the sea claimed its tribute. <words>75</words>

His grandmother's voice echoed in his memory as he worked the yarn: "Markets rise and fall like tides, boy, and death follows the same wisdom." <words>95</words> She had been a merchant before becoming a mystic, teaching him that everything—storms, harvests, even mortality—followed cycles that could be read like ledgers. <words>115</words> Now he sat serenely frantic among the weathered stones, his surface calm masking the urgent need to decode the universe's accounting system. <words>134</words>

A figure emerged from the morning mist, wrapped in a tattered cloak that spoke of long travels. <words>149</words> "Watchman," the stranger called, voice carrying the dignity of accumulated years, "I bring you a riddle from the merchants of the eastern ports." <words>170</words>

Ezra's knots tightened as he listened, his craft requiring steady hands despite the chaos of anticipation building in his chest. <words>188</words> "When do the wise sell their cargo before the storm arrives, and when do they hold fast until the waters calm?" <words>207</words>

The question struck him like lightning illuminating a dark harbor. <words>216</words> His grandmother's teachings surged forward—market wisdom demanded knowing when to act and when to wait, reading the signs that preceded both fortune and catastrophe. <words>239</words> The yarn in his hands formed a pattern he had never achieved before, loops and twists that seemed to mirror the constellation of graves around him. <words>262</words>

"The wise," Ezra said slowly, his voice cutting through the dignified chaos of wind and wave, "know that timing is everything." <words>280</words> He held up the completed knot-work, seeing in its geometry the answer that had eluded him for years. <words>297</words> "They sell when the signs align with death's approach, and hold when the patterns promise renewal." <words>313</words>

The stranger smiled and dissolved back into the mist, leaving Ezra alone with his revelation. <words>327</words> The cosmic patterns finally made sense—not as random chaos, but as a vast market where souls were the currency and seasons the exchange rate. <words>349</words> He tucked the yarn into his coat pocket, understanding at last that his role as watchman was not to guard the dead, but to read the divine ledger they had become. <words>377</words> The graveyard around him transformed from a place of ending into a library of cosmic commerce, each stone a record of the universe's eternal transactions. <words>401</words>
