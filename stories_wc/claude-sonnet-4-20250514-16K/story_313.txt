Marcus clutched the empty tape dispenser like a talisman as he settled into the circle of weary farm workers beneath the sickly yellow glow of the compound's evening lights. <words>26</words>

Despite years of small-time cons and petty schemes, he appeared unusually normal among the dystopian settlement's broken souls—no cybernetic implants, no radiation scars, just calloused hands and knowing eyes. <words>52</words>

"Story time," announced the overseer, and Marcus felt that familiar lull of remorse wash over him as children gathered close, their faces gaunt from rationed meals. <words>73</words>

He'd come here to escape his past, but the ghosts had followed him even to this forsaken agricultural prison. <words>90</words>

"Tell us about the old world," whispered a girl with hollow cheeks, and Marcus began interrogating the ghostly apparitions that only he could see, drawing stories from their transparent lips. <words>114</words>

The spirit of a long-dead teacher materialized beside him, her ethereal voice describing libraries and playgrounds that existed before the collapse. <words>131</words>

Marcus translated her words with mild fervor, his voice growing stronger as he watched hope kindle in young eyes. <words>147</words>

"There were places called schools," he continued, "where children learned without fear of punishment quotas." <words>161</words>

The empty tape dispenser had once sealed packages in his elaborate mail scams, but now it served as a prop, a piece of "ancient technology" that helped make his stories tangible. <words>187</words>

As he spoke, more spirits gathered—a baker, a musician, a mother—each offering fragments of a world worth remembering. <words>204</words>

The remorse that usually paralyzed him transformed into something purposeful; these weren't lies to exploit, but truths to preserve. <words>220</words>

"Why did you really come here?" a translucent businessman asked, and Marcus paused mid-story. <words>235</words>

To taunt the jaws of defeat and grin, he realized, meeting the ghost's hollow gaze. <words>249</words>

He'd lost everything to his final con gone wrong, but here, surrounded by society's discarded, he'd found something valuable. <words>266</words>

"The old world had something we've forgotten," Marcus told his living audience, his voice carrying new conviction. <words>282</words>

"What?" asked the girl. <words>286</words>

"Hope," he replied, and began to comfort her with gentle words about tomorrow's possibilities. <words>300</words>

The ghosts nodded approvingly as Marcus continued weaving tales that bridged past and future, his former skills finally serving a worthy cause. <words>320</words>

When the session ended and workers shuffled to their quarters, Marcus remained in the circle, still holding his empty dispenser. <words>338</words>

The spirits lingered too, and he understood his new purpose: to interrogate the dead for stories that could resurrect hope in the living. <words>358</words>

His con artist days were over, but his greatest performance was just beginning. <words>371</words>

In this place where authenticity was rarer than clean water, Marcus had discovered that sometimes the most powerful truth comes from speaking with ghosts. <words>391</words>

He smiled, tucking the dispenser into his pocket, ready for tomorrow's story time. <words>403</words>
