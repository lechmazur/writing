Maya knelt among the spinning gears of Dr. Henrickson's perpetual motion workshop, her fingers trembling against the soil of a potted fern that shouldn't exist in this mechanical cathedral. <words>28</words> For three months, she had posed as a research assistant while secretly communing with the plants hidden throughout the facility, their whispered secrets revealing the location of humanity's most dangerous discovery. <words>54</words> 

Her loose shoelace caught in a gear mechanism, jerking her forward as the ancient fern pressed a vision into her mind—a test of faith that would determine whether she could find the last piece of the puzzle before Henrickson completed his reality-altering machine. <words>91</words> The plant showed her fragments of memory, singularly multiple moments collapsed into one terrifying truth: the perpetual motion engine didn't generate energy, it harvested time itself from parallel dimensions. <words>117</words>

Within the space of a thought experiment that felt both eternal and instantaneous, Maya understood why the plants had called to her. <words>135</words> They were sentient refugees from timelines where Henrickson's machine had already succeeded, each botanical survivor carrying memories of worlds that had been consumed to fuel mechanical immortality. <words>160</words> 

The fern's consciousness began to constrict around her thoughts with the melody of a violin string breaking—a sound that existed only in the plant's memory of its homeland's final symphony. <words>184</words> Through that graceless beauty of shared trauma, Maya felt the weight of infinite responsibility pressing against her chest. <words>202</words>

She freed her shoelace and crawled toward the machine's core, where a small compartment held what appeared to be an ordinary seed. <words>221</words> The fern's whispers grew urgent: this was the temporal anchor, the last piece that would complete Henrickson's design and allow him to drain every parallel Earth simultaneously. <words>246</words>

Maya's hand hovered over the seed as footsteps echoed through the workshop. <words>257</words> The plant consciousness flooded her with images of dead worlds, their final moments stretching across dimensions like screams frozen in amber. <words>275</words> This was her test of faith—trust in beings whose existence defied every scientific principle she'd once believed, or allow humanity's curiosity to devour the multiverse. <words>297</words>

Dr. Henrickson appeared in the doorway, his eyes reflecting the terrible hunger of someone who had glimpsed infinity and found it insufficient. <words>317</words> "Ah, Maya," he said, noticing her position near the machine, "I see you've discovered my final component." <words>333</words>

The fern's voice became a symphony of breaking strings, urging her toward a choice that would echo across realities. <words>350</words> Maya closed her fingers around the seed, feeling its warmth pulse against her palm like a heartbeat from a dying universe. <words>370</words> In that moment, she understood that some puzzles were meant to remain incomplete, their missing pieces serving as humanity's salvation rather than its doom. <words>392</words> The seed crumbled to dust between her fingers. <words>400</words>
