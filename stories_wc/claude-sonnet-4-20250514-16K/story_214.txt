Ezra clutched the frosted piece of sea glass between calloused fingers, watching it catch the artificial starlight filtering through the floating observatory's cracked dome. <words>23</words> The lone trapper had found it years ago, back when he still believed the ocean would eventually give up its secrets willingly. <words>42</words> Now, suspended three miles above the churning Pacific, he understood that everything worth knowing had to be stolen. <words>59</words>

Between shifts monitoring the deep-space tracking equipment, Ezra hunched over his makeshift desk, squinting at microfilm strips he'd liberated from the facility's shady archives. <words>79</words> The images were silently audible to him now—whispered coordinates and coordinates that sang of locations where reality bent like heated metal. <words>99</words> Each frame revealed another fragment of the conspiracy that had cost him his partner, his boat, and his faith in honest work. <words>120</words>

The sea glass warmed against his palm as he decoded another sequence, its surface smooth as a lie told with conviction. <words>140</words> Maria had always said losing everything was just another way of finding what you actually needed. <words>156</words> She'd been right, of course, though she'd never lived to see him prove it. <words>170</words>

The microfilm revealed coordinates where gravitational anomalies created pockets of impossible darkness—black holes of doubt that the government had been quietly harvesting for decades. <words>192</words> Ezra's weathered face cracked into a grin that would have frightened small children and middle management alike. <words>208</words> The upside of loss, he realized, was that it stripped away everything except the essential hunger for truth. <words>225</words>

His equipment hummed with barely contained energy as he prepared to recommence the hunt that had destroyed his old life. <words>244</words> The sea glass caught another beam of artificial starlight, transforming from cloudy green to brilliant amber. <words>259</words> This time, instead of chasing shadows across the water's surface, he would siphon radiance directly from the source. <words>277</words>

The floating observatory groaned against its moorings as Ezra input the decoded coordinates into the facility's unauthorized transmission array. <words>295</words> Far below, the Pacific rolled with ancient indifference, but up here among the stars and lies, everything was about to change. <words>314</words> He'd lost his partner, his boat, and his innocence to their conspiracy. <words>326</words> Now he'd use their own tools to trap something far more valuable than fish or fowl. <words>342</words>

The sea glass pulsed once in his palm, silently audible as a heartbeat, before he slipped it into his pocket and reached for the transmission controls. <words>364</words> Some nets were worth casting into the void itself. <words>373</words> The hunt could finally recommence. <words>379</words>
