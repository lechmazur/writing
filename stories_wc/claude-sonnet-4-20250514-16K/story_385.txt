Nurse Evelyn smiled sweetly as she adjusted the monitors in the forty-second floor ward of Meridian Tower, the obsidian skyscraper that pierced the pre-dawn darkness like a black needle. <words>27</words>

She was, by her own cheerful admission, a meddler who couldn't resist nudging situations toward more interesting outcomes, and tonight's quiet shift had presented her with a delicious puzzle. <words>54</words>

Mr. Henley in room 4207 had been brought in clutching a pair of rusted ice skates, their blades etched with what appeared to be ancient symbols that seemed to shift and dance in the fluorescent light. <words>87</words>

"I walk the beach every night," he'd mumbled during intake, his words scattered like windblown seeds of meaning that Evelyn had been collecting and arranging in her mind. <words>109</words>

Through his window, she could see the distant shoreline where his footprints would recede with each tide, and she found herself openly manipulating the conversation each time she checked his vitals. <words>137</words>

"Tell me about the symbols," she'd say with practiced innocence, knowing her pleasant demeanor would weaken his natural resistance to sharing. <words>155</words>

The old man's ramblings painted a picture of midnight wanderings, of finding the skates buried in sand, of dreams where the symbols told stories of seeds scattered across frozen waters centuries ago. <words>182</words>

Evelyn photographed the skates when he dozed, cross-referencing the markings with online databases while pretending to update his charts. <words>200</words>

The symbols were definitely Norse runes, but arranged in patterns that suggested something far older, something that predated known runic alphabets. <words>220</words>

As dawn approached and Mr. Henley's sedatives began to weaken his grip on consciousness, she gently pried more details from his confused murmurs. <words>240</words>

"The seeds," he whispered, "they told me to follow the footprints backward, to find where the ice began." <words>257</words>

Evelyn's pulse quickened as understanding crystallized with lucid confusion – the symbols weren't just decorative, they were a map. <words>275</words>

Each rune corresponded to tidal patterns, to the precise locations where medieval Norse settlers had scattered grain seeds on frozen harbors, marking safe passage routes that became legends. <words>302</words>

Her manipulation had worked perfectly, but as she decoded the final symbol, she realized her persistent questioning had begun to weaken Mr. Henley's already fragile mental state. <words>324</words>

The old man's eyes had grown distant, his memories of nighttime beach walks now tangled with half-remembered dreams and the nurse's leading questions. <words>345</words>

Evelyn felt a familiar pang of guilt that she quickly suppressed with professional rationalization – after all, she'd solved a historical mystery. <words>364</words>

The ancient symbols revealed trade routes that historians had only theorized about, seeds of knowledge that would revolutionize understanding of Norse exploration. <words>383</words>

Yet as she watched Mr. Henley's confused face in the growing dawn light, she wondered if some puzzles were meant to remain unsolved. <words>403</words>
