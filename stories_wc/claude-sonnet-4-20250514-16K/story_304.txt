Beneath the gilded arches of Asteroid Bellerophon, where baroque spirals twisted through artificial atmosphere, the assassin waited in shadows cast by ornamental cherubim. <words>24</words> His paint-splattered camera lens caught fragments of the station's borrowed starlight, each smudge a memory of canvases he'd abandoned for this unforgiving road. <words>45</words> The final bus of the night cycle wound through corridors lined with frescoed walls, its driver humming melodies that echoed off marble surfaces like prayers. <words>67</words>

Viktor had been many things before becoming death's architect—artist, philosopher, dreamer of superficially profound truths about beauty and mortality. <words>84</words> Now he studied the transport schedule with the patience of a spider observing raindrops collect on its web, each droplet a passenger, each strand a potential escape route. <words>107</words> The pattern revealed itself slowly: maintenance worker at 23:47, the night-shift supervisor at 23:52, and finally, his target—the curator who'd stolen more than paintings. <words>128</words>

Through his stained lens, Viktor watched Dr. Helena Voss board the final route, clutching a small case that contained what she believed was hers by right. <words>150</words> She'd taken his life's work, published his discoveries under her name, left him with nothing but rage and borrowed starlight streaming through station windows. <words>172</words> The bus curved along the asteroid's baroque interior, past fountains that recycled tears and sculptures that wept condensation. <words>188</words>

As the vehicle approached the terminus—a maintenance bay where the driver would complete his final route before the long sleep—Viktor moved. <words>207</words> His footsteps followed the same intricate pattern he'd observed in morning dew clinging to webs in his childhood garden, each step calculated, purposeful. <words>226</words> The driver stepped off, keys jingling a lullaby against the silence. <words>237</words>

"Dr. Voss," Viktor called softly, emerging from behind a pillar carved with dancing angels. <words>250</words> She turned, recognition dawning in her eyes like the artificial sunrise that would soon illuminate the station's eastern sectors. <words>267</words> "I've come to cradle the dawn in trembling hands," he said, raising the camera instead of a weapon. <words>284</words>

She began to laugh—not from fear, but from the absurd poetry of their reunion in this place of manufactured beauty. <words>301</words> "Still speaking in metaphors, Viktor?" <words>307</words> "Still stealing them," he replied, clicking the shutter. <words>315</words> The flash illuminated her face one final time, preserving this moment when the unforgiving road had finally led him home. <words>331</words> In the developing image, through paint and starlight, he would find his masterpiece—not in her destruction, but in the terrible beauty of forgiveness. <words>350</words> The case fell from her hands as she wept, and Viktor lowered his camera, understanding that some dawns were meant to be cradled together. <words>370</words> Behind them, the bus sat empty in its baroque cathedral, the final route complete. <words>384</words>
