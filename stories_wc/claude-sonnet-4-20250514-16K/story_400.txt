Kesh had always found it grimly ironic that the world's last orchard hung suspended over a chasm of blue ice, its crystalline branches heavy with fruit that no human would ever taste again. <words>32</words>

The guarded druid picked their way carefully along the translucent walkways, gathering the pale, frost-touched apples that somehow still grew in this impossible place decades after the final exodus. <words>58</words>

Today marked what would have been their sister's seventieth birthday, and Kesh felt fiercely ambivalent about maintaining the tradition of preparing her special meal when she had been gone for three winters now. <words>86</words>

The silence here was absolute, broken only by the occasional crack of shifting ice far below, and Kesh had grown to both cherish and despise the quiet that had become their constant companion. <words>115</words>

They pulled the dull safety pin from their weathered cloak, the same one Mira had used to fasten her festival dress each year, and methodically pricked each apple to test its ripeness—a ritual their sister had taught them when the world still had seasons that made sense. <words>152</words>

The crippling fear that had kept Kesh mute for months pressed against their throat like a physical weight, the terror of speaking aloud to no one, of hearing their own voice echo uselessly in the vast emptiness. <words>182</words>

But as they arranged the gathered fruit in the pattern Mira had always insisted upon—a spiral representing the cycle of growth and decay—Kesh felt something shift in their chest. <words>204</words>

"Happy birthday, sister," they whispered, and the words fell into the glacial air like stones into deep water. <words>220</words>

The sound of their own voice, rusty from disuse, struck them as absurdly small against the backdrop of endless ice, and they found themselves laughing—a bitter, broken sound that seemed to crack the silence like an egg. <words>251</words>

With dour amusement, they realized they had been preparing this meal not for Mira's memory, but as an excuse to finally break their self-imposed quiet, to prove they still existed in a world that had forgotten the very concept of existence. <words>284</words>

The safety pin caught the pale light filtering through the orchard's crystalline canopy as Kesh fastened it to their cloak once more, a talisman against the fear that had nearly consumed them. <words>309</words>

They gathered the prepared feast and sat at the edge of the crevasse, dangling their legs over the blue depths. <words>327</words>

"Tell me about the old world, Mira," they said aloud, their voice growing stronger with each word, carrying both invitation and farewell into the listening void. <words>348</words>

The glacial orchard hummed with something that might have been wind or might have been approval, and for the first time in years, Kesh felt genuinely, surprisingly, alive. <words>371</words>

They took a bite of apple and began to speak, finally ready to fill the silence with stories worth telling. <words>387</words>
