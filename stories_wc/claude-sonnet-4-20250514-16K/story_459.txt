Marcus adjusted his tool belt with elegantly clumsy fingers, the wrench slipping twice before finding its proper place. <words>17</words> The elevator shaft at the Coastal Sand Castle Preservation Lab hummed with mechanical precision, but he heard something else—whispers threading through the dissonance of silence between gear rotations. <words>46</words>

During his lunch break, Marcus abandoned his half-eaten sandwich to stake out the ghost tour gathering near the lab's entrance. <words>64</words> The tour guide's voice carried across the courtyard as she described the tragic drowning of a Victorian bride whose wedding party had picnicked on these very dunes. <words>87</words>

Marcus had been seeing ghosts since childhood, but only recently decided to dissect his experiences methodically, hoping to find liberation in letting go of his fear. <words>108</words> Each supernatural encounter felt like debugging faulty elevator code—patterns emerged if he paid attention. <words>122</words>

The tour moved inside, past the climate-controlled chambers where researchers preserved sand sculptures from around the world. <words>138</words> Marcus followed, pretending to check the service panel near the main exhibition. <words>151</words> The tourists gathered around a glass case containing a nineteenth-century sand cathedral, complete with miniature buttresses and rose windows. <words>170</words>

She appeared then—translucent, wearing a deteriorated wedding dress and a dried flower crown that had once been white roses. <words>187</words> The ghost's presence created pockets of absolute quiet that made the lab's constant air filtration system sound deafening by comparison. <words>205</words>

Marcus fumbled his screwdriver, the tool clattering elegantly to the floor in a way that somehow didn't disturb the tour group. <words>224</words> The bride turned toward him, her eyes holding centuries of coastal storms. <words>237</words>

"You see me," she whispered, her voice like sand shifting in wind. <words>250</words>

He nodded, no longer startled by direct contact. <words>259</words> "The flower crown—it's beautiful even now." <words>267</words>

She touched the brittle petals with fingers that barely existed. <words>278</words> "I wore them to my wedding that never happened. <words>288</words> The tide came too quickly." <words>295</words>

Marcus understood then—his gift wasn't about fear or fixing broken things. <words>307</words> It was about witnessing stories that demanded remembering. <words>316</words> "What would help you rest?" <words>323</words>

The ghost smiled, and for a moment the dissonance of silence felt peaceful rather than oppressive. <words>338</words> "Tell them my name was Eleanor Whitmore. <words>347</words> Tell them I loved these shores enough to stay." <words>357</words>

As the tour group moved on, Eleanor faded like morning mist. <words>369</words> Marcus picked up his screwdriver with newfound steadiness, understanding that some repairs required listening rather than tools. <words>385</words> He returned to the elevator shaft, but first made a note to visit the historical society. <words>401</words> Liberation, he realized, sometimes meant becoming a bridge between worlds rather than escaping them entirely. <words>417</words>
