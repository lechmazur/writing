In the depths below the world's forgotten places, Grim worked with oil-stained fingers that somehow gleamed like polished obsidian, his face a paradox that made visitors simultaneously recoil and lean closer. <words>28</words> The sentient car mechanic had discovered this subterranean orchard centuries ago, where crystalline fruit hung from silver branches fed by a river of liquid starlight that whispered secrets as it flowed. <words>56</words> Here, within the concept of infinity where time folded back on itself like origami made of moments, he pursued his eternal task. <words>75</words>

The park fountain at the orchard's heart overflowed with puzzle pieces—fragments of lives lived and words never spoken, scattered like confetti from celebrations that ended in silence. <words>100</words> Grim lifted his vintage opera glasses, their mother-of-pearl inlay catching the stellar current's glow, and studied each piece with the precision he once reserved for carburetors and timing belts. <words>126</words> Through the magnified lenses, he could see not just cardboard and ink, but the trembling outlines of confessions that died on tongues too afraid to speak. <words>148</words>

"I never told her I was sorry," whispered from a piece shaped like a broken heart. <words>162</words> "I wanted to run away every single day," sighed another fragment, its edges worn smooth by decades of handling in nervous pockets. <words>181</words> Grim sorted them methodically, his repulsive beauty drawing the lost words like iron filings to a magnet, gathering fragments of humanity's unspoken truths. <words>200</words>

The starlight river sang as he worked, its melody a symphony of exultant grief that matched the contradictions in his own existence. <words>219</words> Each confession he collected became a fruit on the silver trees, growing heavier with the weight of things unsaid until they fell into his waiting hands. <words>240</words> He had been a mechanic of engines once, but now he repaired something far more delicate: the broken machinery of the human heart. <words>260</words>

In this place where infinity curved back to meet itself, Grim understood that every unspoken word eventually found its way to this fountain, these puzzle pieces the remnants of conversations that should have happened. <words>286</words> Through his opera glasses, he watched new fragments materialize—apologies that arrived too late, love declarations swallowed by pride, forgiveness that withered in the space between heartbeats. <words>308</words>

The mechanical precision of his former life served him well here, sorting truth from pretense, urgent confessions from casual regrets. <words>326</words> His fingers, still stained with the memory of motor oil, now gleamed with stardust as he arranged the pieces into patterns that would become tomorrow's dreams. <words>347</words> In the endless now of this place, he knew that every unsaid confession would eventually surface, drawn by the repulsive attraction of a mechanic who had learned to fix more than just machines. <words>372</words> The orchard pulsed with gathered fragments of unspoken love, and Grim smiled his beautiful, terrible smile as the stars continued their eternal confession through the underground river of light. <words>395</words>
