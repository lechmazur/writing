Bernadette hummed "Rock-a-bye Baby" while adjusting her quantum entanglement watch band, its crystalline surface pulsing with ethereal blues and golds that shouldn't exist in this frozen tomb she called home. <words>27</words> The ice cavern stretched endlessly around her, walls glittering with frost patterns that seemed to shift when she wasn't looking directly at them. <words>47</words> As an eternal optimist who'd spent decades preparing for humanity's end, she found beauty even in this crystalline prison where she'd taken refuge after the Color Wars began. <words>72</words> 

"The cradle will fall," she whispered, parsing each syllable for hidden frequencies while her watch band detected quantum fluctuations from her twin sister's device three dimensions away. <words>96</words> Bernadette's politely chaotic nature meant she always said "excuse me" to the ice formations before she drilled through them, always knocked before entering new chambers, even as she systematically dismantled reality's fabric. <words>124</words>

The lullaby analysis revealed what she'd suspected: children's songs contained humanity's deepest fears encoded in major keys and simple rhymes. <words>142</words> Her sister needed to know that the colors of the unforeseen were bleeding through the dimensional barriers, painting impossible hues across the cavern walls where firelight had never touched. <words>167</words> Purple tasted like tomorrow's regrets, silver hummed with unborn sorrows, and the new color—the one without a name—whispered promises of realities where none of this had happened. <words>193</words>

At the hush as her single candle's flame was pinched between dampened fingers, Bernadette activated the notification protocol. <words>209</words> The quantum entanglement watch band vibrated with urgent pulses, transmitting her lullaby discoveries across the void to warn her sister that the unforeseen colors weren't just appearing—they were rewriting the fundamental laws that governed existence itself. <words>240</words>

"Down will come baby, cradle and all," she sang softly, her voice fracturing into harmonics that made the ice weep tears of light. <words>259</words> Each note carried the weight of infinite possible tomorrows, each melody line a thread in the tapestry she was weaving to create a new reality where the Color Wars had never begun. <words>286</words> 

Bernadette smiled in the darkness, her optimism undaunted by the magnitude of temporal reconstruction she was attempting. <words>302</words> The ice sang back to her in frequencies that painted themselves across her retinas in shades that had no names, fractal patterns of sorrow spreading through dimensions like cracks in reality's mirror. <words>327</words> She would notify every version of herself across every possible timeline, using children's lullabies as the key to unlock doors between worlds. <words>347</words> 

The unnamed color pulsed brighter now, promising redemption through polite chaos, hope through systematic destruction. <words>362</words> Tomorrow, when she woke to no candle and infinite light, the new reality would begin with her sister's answering hum echoing through quantum-entangled dreams. <words>382</words> Until then, Bernadette would sing to the ice, analyzing every note for the frequency that would make yesterday's horrors into tomorrow's forgotten lullabies. <words>403</words>
