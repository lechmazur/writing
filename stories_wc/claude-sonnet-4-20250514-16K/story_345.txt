Father Marcus clutched the broken abacus against his chest, its missing beads like gaps in his former faith, as he jogged deeper into the labyrinth orchard where giant bean stalks twisted skyward through perpetual mist. <words>32</words>

The snow fell in deliberate spirals, each flake tracing patterns that seemed to mock the mathematical certainty he'd once sought in prayer, and he followed these crystalline breadcrumbs with the unapologetically confused determination of a man who'd abandoned his collar but not his questions. <words>74</words>

Through the hush of fate unraveling around him, the massive stalks creaked like ship masts in an otherworldly wind, their leaves rustling secrets he'd spent decades trying to calculate on the abacus that now clicked hollow and incomplete in his trembling hands. <words>113</words>

He'd been complacent for too long, counting prayers like beads, measuring devotion in ritual repetitions, until the price of that spiritual lethargy had stripped away everything he thought he understood about divine design. <words>147</words>

The snow patterns shifted, leading him left through a corridor of emerald giants, their pods hanging like lanterns casting dull radiance through the perpetual twilight of this impossible place. <words>173</words>

Each footfall on the frost-covered earth was a rejection of the predetermined path he'd walked for forty years, each breath a declaration that he would step beyond fate's design, even if it meant running blindly through a maze that defied every law he'd once preached. <words>212</words>

The abacus rattled with each stride, its remaining beads sliding frantically as if trying to solve an equation written in the very architecture of confusion surrounding him. <words>238</words>

Above, the bean stalks disappeared into clouds that seemed to pulse with their own heartbeat, and Marcus understood that his complacency had been not just spiritual laziness, but a fundamental betrayal of the mystery he'd been called to serve. <words>274</words>

The snow whispered new mathematics as it settled on his shoulders, each crystal a variable in a formula he'd never learned to read, and he pushed harder through the labyrinth, his lungs burning with the effort of pursuing truth that couldn't be counted or contained. <words>318</words>

When the abacus finally slipped from his numb fingers and shattered against a root thick as a cathedral column, Marcus felt something break open inside him too, something that had been calcified by years of going through the motions. <words>354</words>

The snow patterns converged ahead, forming a spiral that led toward a clearing where the bean stalks parted like curtains, and beyond that opening, Marcus glimpsed something that made his confused heart leap with recognitionâ€”not answers, but the radiant possibility of questions he'd never dared to ask. <words>396</words>

He ran toward that dull radiance, leaving the broken mathematics of his old life scattered in the snow behind him. <words>413</words>
