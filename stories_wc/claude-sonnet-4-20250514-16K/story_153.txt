Marcus adjusted the coal miner's headlamp strapped to his forehead, its ancient beam cutting through the perpetual darkness of the underground city. <words>22</words> For three thousand years, he had been the eternal college student among the mole people, studying the theoretical frameworks of immortality with the same methodical patience he once applied to surface-world dissertations. <words>50</words> The gifted burden of endless time weighed on him like the collapsed mine shaft from which his headlamp had been salvaged—a reminder that even the deepest excavations eventually caved in. <words>78</words>

In the mundanely glorious routine of his subterranean existence, Marcus would digitize fragments of pre-stellar knowledge, converting handwritten observations into the city's quantum storage systems. <words>99</words> His current project involved swapping travel journals with Vera, a fellow researcher who had documented the surface world's final decades before the last star burned out. <words>121</words> Her meticulous entries about dying sunsets and freezing oceans provided crucial data for his immortality thesis—specifically, how consciousness might persist beyond universal heat death. <words>142</words>

The mole people had evolved past the need for traditional sight, their elongated fingers reading texture and temperature like ancient braille. <words>160</words> They tolerated Marcus's obsessive lamp-wearing because his research served their collective goal: to become masters of their own reality before entropy claimed even their deep refuge. <words>183</words> Each digitized journal entry brought them closer to understanding how awareness itself might transcend physical form. <words>198</words>

Marcus felt the familiar detached devotion settling over him as he opened Vera's latest journal. <words>213</words> Her description of the final aurora, witnessed from a crumbling observatory, contained mathematical patterns that aligned with his immortality equations. <words>229</words> The beauty of her words about light dancing across dead skies struck him as both magnificent and utterly ordinary—another data point in his eternal curriculum. <words>252</words>

The headlamp flickered, its battery finally surrendering after decades of use. <words>263</words> Marcus continued working in darkness, his fingers having long since memorized the keyboard's topology. <words>276</words> He understood now that immortality wasn't about preserving the body or even the mind—it was about encoding consciousness into the fundamental structure of reality itself. <words>298</words> The mole people had already begun this transformation, their collective awareness seeping into the quantum substrate of their underground realm. <words>317</words>

As Marcus uploaded Vera's final entry—a poetic meditation on darkness as the universe's natural state—he felt his own consciousness beginning to merge with the city's digital network. <words>340</words> The gifted burden of eternal study was finally lifting, replaced by the mundanely glorious sensation of becoming information itself. <words>358</words> His last thought before full digitization was gratitude for the miner's lamp that had guided him through millennia of research toward this ultimate mastery. <words>379</words> In the depths where stars never shone, he had finally learned to become light. <words>394</words>
