Sir Gareth adjusted his steel gauntlets as he emerged from the underground secret agent center, the fluorescent lights dimming behind reinforced doors. <words>21</words> The intersection sprawled before him in perfect silence, asphalt gleaming under lonely streetlamps at this hushed hour past midnight. <words>38</words> His breath formed crystalline clouds in the frigid air, a fitting accompaniment to his naturally cold demeanor that had served him well in covert operations. <words>59</words>

Something small and red caught his eye near the storm drain—a child's woolen mitten, abandoned and sodden. <words>75</words> As he knelt to retrieve it, an unexpected warmth flickered through his chest, like embers stirring in long-cold ashes. <words>91</words> The mitten's crude stitching revealed careful hands, perhaps a grandmother's, and suddenly Gareth saw beauty in its imperfect loops and uneven edges. <words>109</words>

This moment marked his artistic awakening, though he wouldn't recognize it as such for weeks to come. <words>124</words> He tucked the mitten into his armor, a lawfully rebellious act that violated no official protocols yet defied his rigid training. <words>142</words> His superiors had tasked him with collecting folk remedies from the city's hidden corners, intelligence disguised as anthropological research. <words>159</words>

Back in his quarters, Gareth examined the incomplete family altars he'd assembled from his nocturnal gatherings—dried herbs, handwritten prayers, worn photographs, and now this small mitten. <words>182</words> Each altar represented a different household's healing traditions, fragments of wisdom passed down through generations. <words>197</words> The knight found himself arranging these objects not merely as evidence, but as compositions that spoke to something deeper. <words>214</words>

He began sketching the altars, his armored fingers surprisingly gentle with charcoal and paper. <words>227</words> The mitten became his focal point, its simple form inspiring him to capture the stories embedded in each remedy. <words>244</words> A grandmother's cough syrup recipe appeared alongside pressed flowers used for headaches; rosary beads nested near sachets of lavender for peaceful sleep. <words>264</words>

Through his drawings, Gareth discovered he could support these families' traditions in ways his official reports never could. <words>280</words> His sketches preserved the reverence and love absent from clinical documentation, honoring the human element his superiors sought to quantify. <words>298</words> The cold knight who had once viewed emotions as tactical weaknesses now found strength in vulnerability. <words>314</words>

Late each night, he returned to that same intersection, hoping to reunite the mitten with its young owner. <words>331</words> Though the child never appeared, Gareth's vigil became a ritual of its own. <words>344</words> He would stand in the hush of empty streets, surrounded by the city's sleeping remedies, finally understanding that healing required more than mere collection. <words>365</words> It demanded witness, artistry, and the courage to remain soft despite armor's weight. <words>378</words> The lost mitten had found its purpose after all, warming a knight's heart toward unexpected grace. <words>394</words> In supporting others' traditions through his newfound art, he had discovered his own path to wholeness. <words>409</words>
