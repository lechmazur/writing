He knew that his work was far from over, but he also knew that he had made a difference, however small, in the lives of those lost souls. <words>307</words>
With a sense of noble chaos still swirling around him, Elias left the whisper collection point, ready to continue his mission of gathering lost souls and sowing the seeds of reconciliation through his cryptic puzzles. <words>347</words>
