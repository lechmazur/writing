The tired swordsman sat in the quiet breakroom of the floating rock monastery, his plain cloth bag resting beside him on the stone bench. <words>18</words> It was the moment after someone had resigned, and the usual bustle had given way to a contemplative silence. <words>35</words> He was fiercely apathetic to the monastery's daily routines, yet he remained, driven by a hidden promise to himself. <words>54</words> The promise was to keep the spark of defiance alive within him, a flame that flickered but never extinguished. <words>73</words>

As he sipped his tea, his eyes drifted to the window, where the night sky was illuminated by a meteor shower. <words>94</words> He had learned long ago that following meteor showers could lead to overcoming the most daunting challenges. <words>112</words> The swordsman's thoughts wandered to the battles he had fought, the enemies he had faced, and the weariness that now clung to his bones. <words>137</words> Yet, the sight of the meteors reignited that spark within him, a knowing naivety that whispered of hope and change. <words>158</words>

He reached into his plain cloth bag and pulled out a worn map, tracing the paths he had taken and the ones yet to come. <words>182</words> The map was a testament to his journey, marked by the meteor showers he had followed, each one guiding him to overcome another obstacle. <words>206</words> The swordsman knew that the monastery, with its floating rocks and serene isolation, was just another step in his quest. <words>226</words>

He stood up, the plain cloth bag slung over his shoulder, and walked to the edge of the monastery. <words>245</words> The wind whispered through the rocks, carrying with it the promise of new challenges and the chance to keep his hidden promise alive. <words>267</words> The tired swordsman looked up at the meteor shower, feeling the spark of defiance grow stronger within him. <words>286</words> He knew that by following the meteors, he would overcome whatever lay ahead, no matter how weary he felt. <words>306</words>

With a knowing smile, he stepped off the edge of the floating rock, trusting the meteors to guide him to his next destination. <words>330</words> The swordsman's fiercely apathetic exterior belied the burning desire to keep his hidden promise, to never let the spark of defiance die. <words>352</words> As he descended into the night, the meteor shower above him, he felt a renewed sense of purpose, ready to face whatever came next. <words>376</words> The tired swordsman, with his plain cloth bag and unwavering resolve, would continue his journey, guided by the meteors and driven by the spark of defiance within. <words>403</words>
