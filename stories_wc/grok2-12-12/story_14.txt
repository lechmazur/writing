The station, perched on the edge of the sea, was a place of constant motion, where the ebb and flow of the water mirrored the gambler's own life. <words>62</words> It was here, amidst the hum of machinery and the soft lapping of waves, that he found solace in the company of unhinged professors who would dock their boats under the cover of night. <words>82</words> These rebellious midnight lectures were his lifeline, a source of wisdom and madness that fueled his unpredictable nature. <words>95</words>
