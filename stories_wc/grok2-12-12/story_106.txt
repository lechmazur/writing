The station, once a beacon of progress, now lay dormant, its corridors filled with the echoes of a bygone era. <words>37</words>
Eli, who had come to this place to walk away from a dead end in his life, felt a strange sense of borrowed valor as he explored the abandoned facility. <words>64</words>
His motivation was clear: to find a new path, one that would erase the boundaries that had confined him to a life of monotony and despair. <words>88</words>

As he wandered through the dimly lit halls, Eli stumbled upon a collection of used postage stamps scattered across a dusty table. <words>112</words>
