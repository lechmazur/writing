In the heart of the sky burial site, where the vultures circled and the winds whispered ancient secrets, the cyber-templar stood, his armor gleaming under the stormy sky. <words>20</words>
His mission was clear: to reflect lightning back at the storm, a task that seemed both impossible and necessary. <words>37</words>
The cyber-templar's mind was a whirl of patiently frantic thoughts, each one pushing him closer to the edge of reality. <words>56</words>
He clutched a worn leather bridle in his hand, a relic from a time when horses roamed the earth, now repurposed for his sacred duty. <words>80</words>

During his reading of the ancient texts, he had discovered the method to harness the storm's power: through the refraction of light through a prism. <words>158</words>
He set up the prism on a stone altar, its facets catching the first glimmers of lightning as the storm drew near. <words>179</words>
The cyber-templar adjusted the worn leather bridle, now connected to the prism, ensuring it was perfectly aligned to capture and redirect the lightning's energy. <words>204</words>

The cyber-templar watched, his heart pounding with a mix of awe and terror, as the storm's fury seemed to intensify, the lightning bolts now striking closer. <words>257</words>
He knew that the mirage of safety was an illusion, but he was determined to prove that he could bend the forces of nature to his will. <words>284</words>
The patiently frantic energy within him surged as he fine-tuned the prism, each adjustment bringing him closer to his goal of reflecting the lightning back at the storm. <words>313</words>
The worn leather bridle, once a symbol of control over a gentler beast, now served as a conduit for the raw power of the heavens. <words>339</words>
As the storm reached its peak, the cyber-templar felt a rush of euphoric agitation, the thrill of the moment overwhelming his senses. <words>363</words>
With a final, precise adjustment, the prism caught a massive bolt of lightning, refracting it back into the heart of the storm. <words>387</words>
The sky burial site was bathed in a blinding light, and for a moment, the cyber-templar felt as if he had transcended the collision course with reality that had defined his existence. <words>418</words>
