As I stood amidst the chaotic sprawl of the spontaneous combustion lab, I couldn't help but feel like a forgotten noble, a relic of a bygone era. <words>24</words>
The air was thick with the smell of ozone and burned circuitry, and I gazed out at the scattered remnants of my life's work. <words>37</words>
