It was as if the panel was beckoning me, drawing me into the heart of the funhouse, towards the cradle of sparks that seemed to pulse with a life of their own.

In that moment, the world seemed to slow, and I felt the weight of my own solitude lifting, like a bird taking flight.

The hush that followed was almost palpable, a sense of anticipation building, as if the universe itself was holding its breath, waiting for someone to say the words that would change everything.

"I love you," a voice whispered, shattering the silence, and I felt my heart stutter, as if it had been waiting for permission to beat once more.
