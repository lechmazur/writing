As I floated on the tea platform, sipping on a soothing brew, I couldn't help but notice the dusty wine bottles lined up along the railing. 
<words>24</words>

My clients, a quirky couple, had hired me as their soul-broker real estate agent to find their dream home, and I was determined to make a lasting impression. 
<words>39</words>

I picked up one of the bottles, blowing off the dust to reveal a faded label with words that seemed to shimmer in the dim light: "Chateau La Vieille Tour 1985". 
<words>54</words>

As I turned the bottle over, I noticed that the label was actually a reversed message, and I wondered what secrets it held.
