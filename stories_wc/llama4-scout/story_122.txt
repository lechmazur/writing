As I stood at the edge of the sky burial site, the wind whipping my hair into a frenzy, I felt a patiently frantic energy coursing through my veins. <words>24</words>
The rows of makeshift platforms, each one a temporary resting place for the deceased, stretched out before me like a macabre cityscape. <words>39</words>
I clutched the worn leather bridle in my hand, its supple texture a comforting reminder of the world beyond this desolate place. <words>46</words>
As a cyber-templar, I had long ago abandoned the notion of safety, but the mirage of it still haunted me, a will-o'-the-wisp that I couldn't shake. <words>54</words>
I thought back to the storm that had driven me here, the lightning flashing across the sky like a madman's scrawl. <words>61</words>
I had come to this place seeking to prove something – not to others, but to myself – that I was still alive, still kicking against the void. <words>70</words>
The wind died, and for a moment, an unearthly silence fell over the site. <words>75</words>
I raised my eyes to the sky, and through the refraction of light, a prism of color burst forth, a miniature rainbow that danced across my vision. <words>84</words>
In that instant, I felt a sense of euphoric agitation, as if the very fabric of reality was about to tear apart. <words>91</words>
And then, like a slap in the face, the wind returned, whipping me back into a state of heightened awareness. <words>98</words>
I looked down at the bridle in my hand, its worn leather a testament to the journeys it had been on, the storms it had weathered. <words>106</words>
I thought of all those who had come before me, who had stood on this same ground, seeking to prove their own existence. <words>114</words>
The storm was closing in, its leading edge a wall of darkness that threatened to consume me whole. <words>121</words>
But I stood firm, the bridle clutched tightly in my hand, as I waited for the lightning to strike. <words>128</words>
And when it did, I would reflect it back at the storm, a mirror held up to the chaos, a declaration of defiance in the face of the void. <words>137</words>
The air was electric with anticipation, the very atmosphere charged with the promise of destruction. <words>144</words>
I closed my eyes, feeling the wind buffet me, and waited for the storm to unleash its full fury. <words>151</words>
The moment hung suspended, a droplet of water poised on the edge of a leaf, and then – <words>158</words>
The lightning struck, a blinding flash that seared itself into my retina, and I raised the bridle, a makeshift prism to refract the light. <words>166</words>
The storm raged on, but I stood at its center, a calm eye of fury, as I proved to myself that I was still here, still alive. <words>174</words>
And in that moment, the mirage of safety dissolved, revealing the harsh truth: that safety was just an illusion, and I was free. <words>183</words>
The storm slowly began to dissipate, leaving behind a sense of stillness, and I knew that I had found what I was searching for – not safety, but a reason to keep moving forward. <words>195</words>
As I walked away from the sky burial site, the worn leather bridle still clutched in my hand, I felt a sense of peace settle over me, a sense of purpose that I had not felt in a long time. <words>206</words>
The world was still uncertain, still full of danger, but I was ready, for I had faced the storm and emerged unbroken. <words>214</words>
