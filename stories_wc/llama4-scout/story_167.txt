As I sat in the capsule hotel's common area, surrounded by fellow time travelers, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. <words>15</words>
The soft hum of the fluorescent lights above seemed to reverberate through every cell in my body, a constant reminder that I was running out of time. <words>38</words>
I was a dutiful scholar, tasked with uncovering the secrets of the past, and I had a crucial test looming over me. <words>46</words>
My eyes wandered to the small wire coil on the table in front of me, a mysterious object that had been left behind by a previous occupant. <words>56</words>
It was an uncommonly typical trinket, one that seemed out of place in this futuristic capsule hotel, but it drew me in nonetheless. <words>64</words>

And with that, the calm that had settled over the hotel seemed to shatter, like a stone cast into a still pond. <words>173</words>
