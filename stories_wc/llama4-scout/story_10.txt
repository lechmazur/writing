The cheerless duelist, clad in a black leather jacket, surveyed the room with a gaze as cold as the steel that had forged his reputation. 
<words> 20 </words>

His eyes landed on a maggoty wooden chest that rattled with every faint tremor, as if it held secrets that refused to stay buried. 
<words> 33 </words>

The chest seemed to be the only thing that stirred in this stagnant air, and the duelist felt an unsettling pull towards it, as if drawn by a morbid curiosity.

Among the yellowed letters and torn photographs, a tattered cookbook lay open, its pages dog-eared and worn.
