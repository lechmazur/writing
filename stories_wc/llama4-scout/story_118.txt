As I stepped into the secret agent training facility, the dimly lit corridors seemed to hum with an air of anticipation, like the quiet buzzing of a hive. I was the resident hive-mind therapist, tasked with unraveling the tangled threads of my agents' minds. My office, a cozy nook with a view of the night sky, was a haven for those seeking solace in the darkness. The sound of hindsight whispered through my thoughts, a gentle reminder of the what-ifs that haunted us all. <words>46</words>

My next patient, Agent Rachel, sat across from me, her eyes fixed on the scuffed phone charger plug that lay on my desk. It was a peculiar habit of hers, finding comfort in the mundane. I smiled, a merry bitterness creeping into my voice as I asked, "What draws you to that plug, Rachel?" She hesitated, and I sensed the weight of her thoughts, like the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes on the floor. <words>83</words>

As she began to speak, the wax melted into a puddle of secrets, each one a tiny, shining universe that threatened to drain her of her vitality.

As the hours ticked by, the darkness outside deepened, and the stars began to twinkle like diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse.

It was a fragile thing, this hold on reality, but it was enough. <words>176</words>
