As I soaked in the warm bubble bath, I stared blankly at the patch I had salvaged from the crashed spaceship mission. <words>24</words>
It was a reminder of the prophecy that had driven my family for generations, one that I was determined to fulfill, no matter the cost. <words>39</words>
My name is Kael, and I'm a dancer, known for my sharp wit and agility on stage, but also for my linguistically inept nature, often struggling to find the right words to express myself. <words>54</words>
The weight of denial had been crushing me, as I tried to come to terms with the fact that I was about to embark on a journey that would change my life forever. <words>69</words>
According to the prophecy, I had to mimic the movements of the stars, to align myself with the celestial bodies that governed our universe. <words>80</words>
It was a task that seemed impossible, but I was determined to succeed, driven by a sense of duty and a desire to prove myself. <words>90</words>

The patch on my hand seemed to glow, as I looked at it, and I knew that I was on the right path, that I was one step closer to achieving my goal. <words>175</words>
