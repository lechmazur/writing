As I stumbled through the digital nomad camp, the bleary-eyed physician that I was, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was being pulled towards something. <words>24</words>
The sun was setting across the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the rows of laptops and scattered belongings. <words>37</words>
I had been traveling from place to place, trying to escape the memories of my past, but they always seemed to catch up with me. <words>51</words>
My eyes landed on a peculiar object lying on the ground - a sunken pirate's cutlass, its blade rusted and worn. <words>63</words>
I picked it up, feeling an inexplicable connection to it, and began to clean it with my sleeve. <words>71</words>
As I did, I noticed a figure sitting in the corner, sipping on a cup of coffee, their eyes fixed intently on me. <words>80</words>
She beckoned me over, and I walked towards her, the cutlass still clutched in my hand. <words>88</words>
"You're searching for something, aren't you?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. <words>95</words>
I nodded, and she handed me a cup of coffee, saying, "Let's see what the grounds have to say." <words>104</words>

Together, we worked tirelessly, pouring over the inscriptions, using the patterns in the coffee grounds to guide us. <words>168</words>
