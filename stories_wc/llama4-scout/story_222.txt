The dimly lit room was abuzz with an air of anticipation, for tonight was the night of the intergalactic gathering, and I had been invited to partake in the festivities.

My eyes wandered to the heirloom piece of jewelry that adorned my wrist – a gift from my great-grandmother, a wise and powerful conjurer in her own right.
