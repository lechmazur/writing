In the frozen orchard, where geothermal streams whispered secrets to the wind, a ghostly caretaker wandered, tasked with tending to the land after the last wish was granted. <words>24</words>

The caretaker's eyes, like frosty lanterns, shone bright as they surveyed the orchard, their solemnly silly demeanor a stark contrast to the eerie silence. <words>39</words>

As they strolled through the frozen rows, a plastic straw caught their attention, abandoned and weathered, yet still intact. <words>46</words>

The caretaker picked it up, and with a mischievous glint, began to perforate the ice beneath their feet, creating a makeshift path through the frozen landscape. <words>54</words>

This act of creative destruction was not mere whimsy; the caretaker sought to communicate with the animals that had long since fled the orchard. <words>61</words>

Through forbidden expedition logs, the caretaker had discovered that the animals, once drawn to the geothermal streams, had left behind a hidden language, etched into the ice and stone. <words>71</words>
