In the celestial grotto, where living shadows danced upon the walls, Kael, a radio host with a peculiar gift – channeling the dead – sat across from his cooking class instructor, the enigmatic Lyra. <words>24</words>
Their task was to prepare a traditional dish from the afterlife, but Kael's mind wandered to the mysterious chessboard he had discovered earlier, its surface intricately carved with symbols of unity and diversity, yet all the pawns were missing. <words>43</words>
Lyra, sensing Kael's distraction, gently nudged him back to the task at hand, as the soft glow of the grotto's luminescent orbs cast an ethereal light on the cooking station. <words>57</words>
