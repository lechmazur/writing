<words>24</words>

The burning comet above cast an otherworldly glow, illuminating the barren ground that stretched out before him like a canvas waiting to be transformed. 
<words>37</words>

He carried a worn leather satchel slung over his shoulder, its contents a testament to his life of solitude and contemplation.

As he walked, he paused to examine a withered branch, his fingers tracing the lines of a half-bent weathervane that stood sentinel nearby.
