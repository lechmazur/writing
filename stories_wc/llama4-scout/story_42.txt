The last song had been sung, and the crowd had dispersed, leaving me alone to ponder the ancient knowledge that lay hidden within the temple's crumbling walls.

I had been tasked with unlocking the secrets of the ancient civilization that once flourished here, and I was determined to succeed, no matter the cost.
