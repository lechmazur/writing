<words>24</words>

The air was heavy with dust and the scent of old books, a reminder of the centuries that had passed since the lighthouse had last shone bright. 
<words>39</words>

As Kaelin sat up, the creak of the old wooden chair echoed through the silence, a sound that seemed to reverberate deep within the chest.
