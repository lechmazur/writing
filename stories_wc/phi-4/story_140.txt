The room, filled with the scent of old costumes and dust, seemed to hold its breath as Elara made her decision. <words>89</words> She knew she must unleash the power within the doll, a power that could either save or destroy. <words>99</words> With a trembling hand, she placed the doll on the dressing table, its cracked surface reflecting the first light of dawn. <words>112</words>
