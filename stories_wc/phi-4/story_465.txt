As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the airship, Elara's thoughts drifted to the worn wooden ruler she carried. <words>64</words> It was a relic from her childhood, a symbol of discipline and creativity, now a tool for her art. <words>72</words> She often used it to tap out rhythms, a simple yet profound reminder of the balance between order and chaos. <words>82</words>
