In the serene yet tense atmosphere of a lunar greenhouse perched on a crater’s edge, a bodyguard named Marcus stood guard. <words>24</words> His posture was rigid, a testament to years of training and the weight of his responsibilities. <words>31</words> Yet, beneath his stern exterior, a storm of serene anger brewed, fueled by a desire to break free from the controlling influence of his employer. <words>50</words> 

Marcus had always been serendipitously stubborn, a trait that had both hindered and helped him in his career. <words>60</words> Today, it was this stubbornness that drove him to seek a timely rebirth, a chance to redefine his life. <words>70</words> Amid his routine park visits, he had begun collecting fragments of overheard stories, piecing together a plan to ratify his newfound freedom. <words>88</words>
