Master Chen pressed another chrysanthemum petal into his botanical press, the delicate flower joining hundreds of others in his peculiar collection. <words>21</words> The palace gardens provided endless specimens for his true profession—not court botanist, but the Emperor's most serene executioner. <words>38</words>

"The butterflies whisper again tonight," murmured Concubine Wei, gliding past his moonlit workshop with that knowing smile. <words>54</words> Her longing gaze lingered on the pressed flowers, each one marking another soul he'd quietly dispatched. <words>70</words> Chen nodded politely, understanding her figuratively literal meaning—tomorrow, someone would flutter their last. <words>83</words>

The ancient scrolls spoke of a prophecy: when pressed petals formed the pattern of butterfly wings, the dynasty would face its greatest test. <words>103</words> Chen had spent decades trying to spin this prophecy into raw possibility, carefully amalgamating his botanical specimens according to wing-like arrangements. <words>122</words> Tonight, before the first question would be asked at tomorrow's imperial audience, he sensed the moment approaching. <words>139</words>

His latest victim—a traitorous minister—had provided an exquisite orchid from his private garden before Chen's poison took effect. <words>158</words> The man had died with a confused smile, probably wondering why the court's mildest official carried such lethal tea. <words>176</words> Chen found this professionally amusing; people expected assassins to lurk in shadows, not tend flower beds. <words>191</words>

As he arranged the new orchid alongside previous specimens, an unmistakable pattern emerged—the delicate symmetry of butterfly wings. <words>208</words> Each petal represented a calculated elimination, but together they formed something beautiful and terrifying. <words>222</words> The prophecy was manifesting through his methodical murders, transforming individual deaths into a grand design. <words>237</words>

Footsteps echoed through the corridor—guards approaching with tomorrow's target, a general who'd grown too ambitious. <words>252</words> Chen smiled serenely, already envisioning which pressed flower would complete the pattern's lower wing. <words>266</words> The whispers of longing he'd heard in Wei's voice, in the dying minister's eyes, in his own heart, all pointed toward this culmination. <words>286</words>

By following the butterfly's wings pattern, he would amalgamate centuries of political intrigue into one decisive moment. <words>302</words> The prophecy spoke of transformation—perhaps his humble flower collection would reshape the empire itself. <words>317</words> Chen chuckled softly at the cosmic joke: the realm's quietest killer wielding the loudest destiny. <words>332</words>

He opened his botanical press one final time, revealing the completed butterfly pattern glowing softly in the lamplight. <words>348</words> Tomorrow's imperial audience would indeed face questions, but Chen already possessed all the answers, pressed between pages like delicate wings. <words>366</words> The whispers of longing had guided him to this moment—before the first question was asked, the prophecy would bloom. <words>384</words> Master Chen, calm assassin and unlikely prophet, closed his eyes and smiled at the beautiful absurdity of fate. <words>400</words>
