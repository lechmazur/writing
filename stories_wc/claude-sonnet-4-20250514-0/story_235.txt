Kenji tended his mountain herbs while watching the ancient castle below, its reconstructed walls now housing art studios where she sketched every Tuesday. <words>22</words>

Through his telescope, he observed Yuki position her easel near the eastern window, her movements deliberate yet graceful as meteor fragments streaked overhead. <words>41</words>

For months, he had been decoding the celestial patterns, repositioning his dried specimens according to the meteors' trajectories, each arrangement spelling out messages in his pressed flower book. <words>64</words>

Tonight's shower traced the constellation of their intertwined fates—a story written in stardust that only he could read. <words>80</words>

He pressed autumn chrysanthemums between pages marked with astronomical calculations, their golden petals forming words she would never hear spoken aloud. <words>97</words>

In the castle's converted chambers, Yuki mixed watercolors while sensing someone's distant gaze, her brush strokes unconsciously mirroring the meteor trails above. <words>115</words>

Kenji repositioned his collection again, the pressed flowers now spelling "remember the night we met" across consecutive pages, each bloom dried with the salt of unspoken longing. <words>135</words>

She had wandered into his herb garden five years ago, lost after leaving art class, and they had watched meteors together in comfortable silence. <words>154</words>

Their conversation had lasted only minutes, but her laugh at his clumsy joke about shooting stars had echoed in his hermit's heart ever since. <words>173</words>

Now he practiced this dramatically subtle courtship, repositioning flowers to decode messages from the sky, hoping cosmic patterns might bridge the gap between mountain and castle. <words>194</words>

Each Tuesday, as her art class ended, he arranged fresh specimens according to that night's meteor shower, believing the universe was conspiring to reunite them. <words>213</words>

Yuki often paused at her studio window, feeling pulled toward the mountain where someone's telescope glinted, her paintings increasingly featuring wildflowers she couldn't name. <words>232</words>

Through his pressed flower book, Kenji documented their parallel existence—her distant figure framed in castle windows, meteors connecting their separate worlds like celestial breadcrumbs. <words>251</words>

He repositioned the dried blooms one final time, spelling out an invitation to return to his garden, then left the book on the castle's doorstep. <words>273</words>

Tuesday evening arrived with another meteor shower, and Yuki discovered the mysterious collection, each page revealing botanical poetry written in pressed petals and astronomical charts. <words>294</words>

Recognition dawned as she traced the flower arrangements, remembering the shy herbalist who had shown her shooting stars years ago. <words>310</words>

She climbed toward his mountain garden, the pressed flower book clutched against her chest, meteors illuminating her path. <words>325</words>

Kenji waited among his herbs, finally understanding that some conversations require more than words—they need time, patience, and faith in celestial timing. <words>344</words>

When she appeared at his garden gate, they repositioned themselves under the same star-filled sky, their intertwined fates finally decoded and ready to be spoken aloud. <words>366</words>

The meteor shower peaked overhead as they began their long-awaited conversation, surrounded by the living herbs that had kept their connection alive through seasons of distant intimacy. <words>386</words>

Their dramatically subtle dance of longing transformed into something real and immediate, two souls repositioned by cosmic patience into perfect alignment. <words>403</words>
