Gareth the sellsword laughed heartily as he stumbled through the witch's herb garden, his astronomical telescope clutched against his chest like a tavern trophy. <words>22</words> The jovial mercenary had been boldly reluctant to accept this peculiar contract, but coin was coin, even when earned through elegant mayhem. <words>40</words>

"Find my family's time capsule," the dying witch had wheezed, "before my withering vow claims what remains of this place." <words>58</words> Her curse would transform the garden into barren wasteland unless someone treasured the buried memories of her lineage. <words>74</words>

Gareth's boots crushed lavender and sage as he peered through the telescope's lens, searching for celestial guidance among the twisted branches overhead. <words>91</words> The witch had explained that her ancestors buried their time capsule beneath the constellation Ursa Major's earthbound reflection—a pattern of seven ancient oak trees. <words>109</words>

Throughout the transformation, which had already begun with wilting roses and browning thyme, Gareth maintained his characteristic humor despite growing urgency. <words>126</words> "Come now, stars," he chuckled, adjusting the telescope's focus as moonlight filtered through dying foliage, "show me your secrets before I become fertilizer myself." <words>146</words>

His motivation to dethrone doubt from his mind drove him forward as shadows danced menacingly between the garden rows. <words>162</words> Each family tradition of making a time capsule held power here—the witch's grandmother had sealed protective spells within copper vessels, ensuring the garden's magical vitality. <words>182</words>

The telescope's brass gleamed as Gareth spotted the seven oaks arranged in perfect cosmic harmony, their roots intertwined like fingers clasping precious secrets. <words>201</words> "There you are, you beautiful bears," he grinned, dropping to his knees beneath the largest tree and clawing through rich, dark soil. <words>221</words>

His fingers struck metal just as the withering vow intensified—entire herb beds crumbling to ash around him in supernatural wind. <words>238</words> The copper time capsule emerged from earth like a newborn, its surface etched with protective runes that pulsed with fading light. <words>256</words>

Gareth's boldly reluctant nature had served him well; lesser mercenaries would have fled when the garden's transformation accelerated into chaos. <words>272</words> As he opened the vessel, releasing generations of stored magical energy, the elegant mayhem reached its crescendo—dead plants regenerating instantly, colors blazing with renewed life. <words>293</words>

"Well," Gareth laughed, watching morning glory vines spiral up his telescope in gratitude, "that's certainly worth drinking about." <words>308</words> The jovial sellsword had treasured more than gold tonight; he'd preserved an entire family's legacy while dethroning his own doubts about magic's reality. <words>326</words> The witch's herb garden bloomed eternal around him, testament to one mercenary's unexpected heroism amid the most elegant of magical mayhem. <words>344</words>

Standing amidst the restored paradise, telescope still in hand, Gareth realized some contracts paid in ways that no coin could measure. <words>361</words>
