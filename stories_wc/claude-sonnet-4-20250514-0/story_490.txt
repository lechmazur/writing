Mira swept debris from the caravan repair station with the enthusiasm of someone watching paint dry, her weathered hands gripping the broom like it might escape. <words>25</words> The great tsunami had retreated three days ago, leaving behind salt-crusted machinery and the metallic scent of brine that clung to everything. <words>44</words> As the station's fading caretaker, she'd watched countless travelers pass through for decades, but now only ghosts seemed to visit. <words>62</words>

She discovered the dried lavender bundle wedged beneath an overturned fuel pump, its purple fragments scattered like tiny stars across the concrete. <words>80</words> Something about its forbidden fragrance—flowers weren't supposed to grow in this wasteland—sparked a curious hunger she hadn't felt in years. <words>99</words> Mira clutched the bundle to her chest, inhaling deeply as if trying to cradle the unknown like a newborn galaxy. <words>117</words>

The lavender triggered a memory of the old data archives buried beneath the station, systems she'd been explicitly forbidden to access. <words>135</words> With methodically random keystrokes, she began hacking through layers of encrypted files, her movements both precise and chaotic. <words>151</words> Each breakthrough felt like discovering a new constellation, though she couldn't quite muster the energy to celebrate properly. <words>167</words>

The archives revealed something extraordinary: coordinates to pre-tsunami settlements, hidden supply caches, and most intriguingly, botanical research on extinct flowering plants. <words>185</words> Mira began to gorge herself on the forbidden information, downloading terabytes of data while maintaining her characteristic air of detached interest. <words>203</words> The lavender bundle sat beside her keyboard like a talisman, its dried petals occasionally crumbling under her absent-minded touches. <words>220</words>

Hours passed as she methodically ransacked digital vaults, her enthusiasm dampened by years of disappointment yet somehow unstoppable. <words>236</words> The data painted pictures of a world she'd never known—gardens flourishing where now only rust and salt remained. <words>253</words> She learned that lavender had once grown wild in the coastal regions, before the ecological collapse that preceded the great waves. <words>272</words>

As dawn broke over the desolate repair station, Mira finally leaned back in her chair, simultaneously exhausted and oddly energized. <words>289</words> The forbidden knowledge now lived in her mind like seeds waiting for proper soil. <words>303</words> She held the lavender bundle up to the morning light, seeing not just dried flowers but possibility itself. <words>320</words>

Perhaps she was still just a fading caretaker of a forgotten outpost, but now she carried secret gardens in her memory. <words>338</words> The waves had taken everything visible, yet somehow left behind this small miracle of purple and possibility. <words>354</words> Mira smiled with the satisfied exhaustion of someone who had just stolen fire from the gods, though she couldn't quite be bothered to feel triumphant about it. <words>376</words> She tucked the lavender into her pocket and began planning her methodically random expedition to find where such impossible flowers might grow again. <words>397</words>
