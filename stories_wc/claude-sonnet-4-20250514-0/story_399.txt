Erasmus shuffled through the crystal-lined chamber, his weathered hands clutching an unmarked cardboard tube with practiced irritation. <words>17</words> The witch's scrying room gleamed under starlight streaming through the domed ceiling, each faceted surface reflecting his perpetually sour expression. <words>34</words> Twenty years of tending crypts had taught him that the dead stayed quiet, unlike the living with their endless demands. <words>52</words>

Tonight's summons felt different, though—the tube's contents rustled with secrets he'd rather leave buried. <words>65</words> Inside lay colored sand from graves he'd maintained, each grain carrying memories of souls who'd found no peace. <words>81</words> The witch had commissioned this particular collection for reasons she'd kept maddeningly vague. <words>93</words>

"Begin the mandala," came her voice from the shadows, melodious yet commanding. <words>104</words> Erasmus grimaced but obeyed, pouring the cemetery sand onto the polished obsidian table. <words>117</words> As constellations wheeled overhead, he began arranging the grains into intricate patterns, each design echoing the sacred geometries he'd studied in his youth before tragedy had hardened his heart. <words>141</words>

The sand seemed to jiggle of its own accord, forming and reforming as though possessed by restless spirits. <words>158</words> Colors bled together—ash gray from suicides, bone white from plague victims, rust red from those who'd died violently. <words>176</words> Each pattern told a story of trauma multiplied yet singular, individual suffering that somehow connected to create a larger truth. <words>194</words>

Through the emerging mandala, Erasmus glimpsed fragments of his own past—the fire that had claimed his family, the guilt that had driven him to seek solace among the silent dead. <words>219</words> The uprising within his chest, that familiar rage and grief, began to stir as the sand patterns grew more complex. <words>238</words>

But something extraordinary happened as the starlight intensified. <words>247</words> The mandala's sacred geometry seemed to absorb his pain, transforming it into something beautiful and meaningful. <words>262</words> Each traumatic memory, when viewed through these ancient patterns, revealed its place in a greater design. <words>278</words> The sand continued to jiggle and shift, creating new configurations that spoke of healing rather than haunting. <words>294</words>

For the first time in decades, Erasmus felt the uprising within him begin to quiet. <words>308</words> The witch emerged from the shadows, her eyes reflecting the mandala's ethereal glow. <words>320</words> "Trauma shared becomes wisdom," she whispered, gesturing to the completed pattern. <words>331</words> "Each grain of sand, like each moment of pain, finds its purpose when connected to the whole." <words>348</words>

As dawn approached and the stars faded, Erasmus carefully swept the sand back into its tube. <words>364</words> The mandala was gone, but its lesson remained—that even a grumpy caretaker's wounded heart could find peace through understanding trauma's sacred patterns. <words>383</words> He tucked the tube away, no longer seeing it as burden but as a tool for transformation. <words>399</words> The uprising within had finally found its rest. <words>408</words>
