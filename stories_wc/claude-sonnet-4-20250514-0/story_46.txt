Maya stood motionless among the towering ferns, her face a porcelain mask of calculated emptiness as piano scales echoed from the distant conservatory. <words>21</words> She was uniquely typical among the dream-walkers—neither the most gifted nor the least, perfectly average in her extraordinary pursuit of learning the language of dreams. <words>43</words> The waterfall's thunderous cascade above cast shifting shadows through the prehistoric fronds, creating patterns she had memorized over countless sessions. <words>61</words>

Her fingers traced the plain plastic ring that marked her as guardian of rumors, the simple band containing more power than observers could fathom. <words>81</words> Tonight's piano practice session would provide the precise rhythmic foundation she needed to track the moon's invisible pathways through the dreamscape. <words>101</words> Each note that drifted from the conservatory windows corresponded to a lunar coordinate, a mapping system only dream-walkers understood. <words>119</words>

The rumors whispered of a sleeper whose dreams threatened to spill into waking reality, contaminating the careful balance Maya protected. <words>138</words> She lifted her blank face toward the silver moon visible through the canopy, feeling its pull like magnetic certainty. <words>156</words> The piano moved into Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat major, signaling the optimal moment for lunar tracking. <words>171</words>

Maya's mind split with precise madness—one half listening to the crystalline notes, the other following moon-paths that existed only in the space between sleep and consciousness. <words>196</words> The plastic ring grew warm against her skin as she navigated ethereal corridors where rumors took physical form. <words>213</words> There, in a dream-chamber constructed of crystallized whispers, she found the sleeper whose nightmares leaked like poison. <words>230</words>

His subconscious mind churned with terror so potent it threatened to manifest in the waking world, spreading chaos through the collective unconscious. <words>250</words> Maya approached with mechanical precision, her blank expression never wavering as she witnessed horrors that would shatter ordinary minds. <words>268</words> The piano's melody guided her movements as she began the delicate process of dream-editing, carefully excising the toxic elements. <words>286</words>

The moon-path algorithm hummed through her consciousness with mathematical beauty, each note from the distant piano corresponding to neural pathways in the sleeper's mind. <words>307</words> She could approve or reject each nightmare fragment, deciding which dreams deserved existence and which required immediate termination. <words>325</words> The waterfall's roar blended with piano music and dream-logic, creating a symphony only guardians could hear. <words>342</words>

When the final notes faded, Maya opened her eyes in the fern garden, the crisis resolved with surgical precision. <words>360</words> The sleeper would wake refreshed, unaware that his nightmares had been harvested and neutralized by a blank-faced guardian. <words>378</words> She touched the plastic ring one final time, already preparing for tomorrow's session, when the moon would trace new patterns and piano practice would once again open doorways between dreams and reality. <words>406</words>
