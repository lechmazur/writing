Mira had built her reputation on elaborate crystal balls and dramatic predictions, but the visions that came unbidden were painfully real. <words>19</words> She wandered Prague's twisted streets after another sleepless night, her mind churning with images of ancient symbols she couldn't understand. <words>37</words> The university's extinct language archive appeared like salvation when she stumbled upon it—a forgotten building tucked between crumbling apartments. <words>54</words>

Inside, Professor Kellner explained his life's work preserving dead tongues, his voice carrying the peaceful anger of someone fighting a losing battle against time. <words>74</words> "Languages die when people stop believing they matter," he said, gesturing at towering shelves of manuscripts. <words>88</words> Mira regularly seldom revealed her true gift, but something about this place loosened her tongue. <words>102</words> "I see things," she admitted quietly, "symbols, words I've never learned." <words>113</words>

Kellner's eyes sharpened with sudden interest. <words>119</words> Throughout planting season, Mira returned daily to explore the archive's depths, helping catalog fragments while sharing her mysterious visions. <words>136</words> She had taken chances before—leaving her small village, embracing her fraudulent career—but this felt different, purposeful. <words>151</words> Her motivation to study sacred development grew stronger as she recognized patterns between her dreams and the ancient texts. <words>167</words>

Then came the discovery that changed everything. <words>174</words> Deep in the basement archives, Mira's fingers traced along a forgotten shelf and found a hidden compartment. <words>189</words> Inside lay a bone flute, its surface carved with symbols that made her vision blur with recognition. <words>205</words> The moment she touched it, images flooded her mind—robed figures chanting in a language that predated known civilization. <words>222</words>

"This script," Kellner whispered when she showed him her sketches, "it shouldn't exist." <words>235</words> His hands trembled as he compared her drawings to the flute's markings. <words>248</words> "These symbols appear in fragments across twelve different dead languages, but never together, never complete." <words>262</words>

Mira lifted the ancient instrument, feeling its weight like destiny. <words>272</words> When she played it, the haunting melody unlocked something deeper than memory—a connection to voices that had been silenced for millennia. <words>289</words> The peaceful anger that had driven Kellner's preservation work now filled her too, a righteous fury against forgetting. <words>305</words>

Together, they began translating the complete sacred texts her visions revealed, each symbol a recovered piece of humanity's lost wisdom. <words>322</words> Mira had spent years pretending to see the future, but now she understood her true gift was seeing the past. <words>340</words> The bone flute became their key to unlock languages that scholars had declared impossible to decipher. <words>355</words> In getting lost in Prague's winding streets, she had discovered not just a hidden archive, but her authentic purpose. <words>372</words> The extinct voices spoke through her visions, demanding their stories be remembered, their sacred knowledge preserved for future generations who might need their ancient wisdom. <words>393</words> Her fraudulent crystal ball gathered dust while she explored realms far more mysterious than any fortune. <words>408</words>
