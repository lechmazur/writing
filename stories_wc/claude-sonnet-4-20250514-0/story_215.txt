Father Marcus stepped through the psychic research facility's sterile corridors, his hands trembling slightly as he clutched a vintage postcard depicting the Eiffel Tower. <words>23</words>

The irony wasn't lost on him—an exorcist seeking help from the very scientists the Church viewed with suspicion. <words>40</words>

"You're late for tango lessons," Dr. Helena Voss remarked with coy aggression, her eyes gleaming as she watched him fidget. <words>57</words>

Marcus forced a smile, inwardly craving connection despite his rattled exterior. <words>68</words>

"Dancing wasn't exactly covered in seminary," he replied, following her to the research wing where couples swayed to haunting melodies. <words>86</words>

Helena had designed this unconventional approach—using dance lessons as cover for their real work, allowing subjects to lower their psychological barriers. <words>105</words>

"The postcard," she pressed, extending her hand with practiced patience. <words>115</words>

Marcus hesitated, then surrendered the artifact that had materialized in his possession after each failed exorcism over the past month. <words>133</words>

"Guarded disclosures work both ways, Father," Helena murmured, leading him into a waltz while scanning the postcard's faded ink. <words>150</words>

Her motivation burned clear—to entwine science with wonder, proving that paranormal phenomena could be measured and understood. <words>166</words>

Around them, other researchers danced with test subjects, each pair working through their own mysteries. <words>180</words>

"Look closer," Helena whispered, guiding his attention to barely visible symbols etched along the postcard's edges. <words>195</words>

Marcus squinted, his scholarly training kicking in as he began to synthesize the patterns with Latin phrases he'd encountered in ancient texts. <words>214</words>

"It's a puzzle," he breathed, finally understanding. <words>222</words>

Over the next hour, amid swirling dancers and soft lighting, they decoded a series of puzzles hidden within the postcard's design. <words>239</words>

Each solution revealed coordinates that, when input into Helena's equipment, unlocked electromagnetic seals throughout the facility. <words>254</words>

The final sequence opened a hidden room behind the laboratory's main wall. <words>266</words>

Inside, they discovered archives dating back centuries—records of supernatural encounters meticulously documented by a secret collaboration between clergy and scientists. <words>284</words>

"We've been working together longer than either side admits," Helena said softly, her aggressive facade melting away. <words>300</words>

Marcus nodded, feeling his rattled nerves finally settling as understanding dawned. <words>312</words>

The postcards hadn't been supernatural manifestations—they were invitations, sent by this hidden network to recruit new members. <words>329</words>

"Your exorcisms failed because you were fighting symptoms, not causes," Helena explained, pulling ancient journals from the shelves. <words>346</words>

"And you need someone who understands both worlds," Marcus finished, his inward sociability finally finding its purpose. <words>362</words>

As the dance lesson continued beyond the hidden door, Marcus realized his true calling wasn't banishing mysteries—it was solving them. <words>380</words>

Together, they would synthesize faith and reason, one carefully guarded disclosure at a time. <words>394</words>

The vintage postcard had delivered him exactly where he belonged. <words>404</words>
