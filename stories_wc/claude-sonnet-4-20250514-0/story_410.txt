The elevator dinged cheerfully at the empty thirty-seventh floor, carrying nothing but the ghost of Harold's desperation and a fresh loaf of sourdough. <words>21</words> For three years, the astute hermit had lived in the building's abandoned sub-basement, a natural cavern cathedral where phosphorescent fungi painted the walls in eerie blues and greens. <words>42</words> The city's water system had failed spectacularly, leaving millions thirsty while Harold, former hydraulic engineer turned recluse, tinkered with solutions in his glowing sanctuary. <words>62</words>

His isolation had been strangely effective—away from corporate bureaucracy and human interference, he'd actually solved the crisis. <words>77</words> The irony wasn't lost on him that humanity's salvation required avoiding humanity entirely. <words>89</words>

Harold clutched his blunt scissors, the only tool sharp enough to cut through the municipal red tape that had driven him underground. <words>107</words> Metaphorically speaking, of course—the scissors couldn't even slice paper properly anymore. <words>118</words> He'd tried sharpening them on the cavern walls, but the phosphorescent moss just giggled at his efforts with tiny, bioluminescent sparkles. <words>135</words>

The bread's aroma wafted through the elevator shaft, somehow amplifying his resolve despite its absurdity. <words>148</words> He'd baked it in a makeshift oven constructed from broken water pipes—another cruel joke from the universe. <words>164</words> The scent reminded him of his grandmother's kitchen, back when kitchens had reliable water pressure and hope. <words>179</words>

"Right," Harold muttered to the glowing fungi, his audience of choice these days. <words>191</words> "Time to save the world with blunt scissors and carbohydrates." <words>201</words> The mushrooms pulsed approvingly, or perhaps they were just reacting to his carbon dioxide. <words>214</words>

He pressed the elevator button, watching the numbers climb toward street level where actual humans waited. <words>228</words> His water restoration system was brilliant—a network of pressure redirects and filtration improvements that could be implemented immediately. <words>243</words> The city council just needed someone to explain it without mentioning the talking mushrooms. <words>256</words>

The elevator rose through floors of abandoned offices, each ding a countdown to his return to civilization. <words>271</words> Harold broke off a piece of bread, savoring what might be his last moment of peaceful solitude. <words>286</words> The scissors felt warm in his pocket, surprisingly comforting for such a useless tool. <words>299</words>

Floor thirty-six: still ascending toward his destiny as the hermit who emerged to fix what isolation had helped him understand. <words>317</words> The phosphorescent glow faded below him, but the memory of those wise, ancient fungi would guide his presentation. <words>332</words>

The bread's aroma filled the elevator shaft, a strange herald announcing the return of the hermit engineer. <words>347</words> Harold smiled grimly—if the city rejected his solution, he'd simply return to his glowing cathedral and let them figure out their own hydration. <words>367</words>

Thirty-seven: the doors opened to reveal fluorescent lights and the familiar scent of human desperation. <words>381</words> Harold stepped forward, clutching his blunt scissors and trailing the aroma of hope baked into carbohydrates. <words>395</words>

Time to amplify whispers into roars. <words>401</words>
