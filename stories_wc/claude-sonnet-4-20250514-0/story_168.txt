Vera adjusted her scuffed plastic comb, the only tool she'd grabbed before fleeing her prestigious floral studio, as the ancient stone circle loomed before them in the predawn darkness. <words>25</words>

"Tell me again why we're here," Marcus whispered, his voice barely audible in the pause between verses of the folk singer's haunting melody that drifted from the nearby festival grounds. <words>50</words>

"Because someone has been watching us, documenting our every arrangement, stealing my designs," Vera replied with characteristic directness, her ruthless reputation in competitive floristry built on eliminating threats before they eliminated her. <words>77</words>

Their spontaneous road trip had begun twelve hours earlier when Marcus mentioned the mysterious symbols carved into these stones, symbols that matched the peculiar markings appearing alongside photos of her work on social media. <words>107</words>

"The watcher's burden," she murmured, running the comb's broken teeth along the ancient rock art, "is that they always leave traces." <words>126</words>

Marcus distinguished himself from other archaeology students through his intellectually spontaneous theories, and tonight he proved invaluable as their conversations during the drive had revealed connections between the prehistoric carvings and modern digital stalking patterns. <words>155</words>

"Look here," he said with polite rebellion against academic protocol, pointing to where her comb had caught a fresh chalk mark invisible in daylight, "someone's been updating these symbols." <words>182</words>

The folk singer's voice resumed, masking their footsteps as they followed the trail of modified petroglyphs deeper into the circle's heart. <words>200</words>

"My former apprentice," Vera realized with cold certainty, recognizing the botanical motifs now clearly visible in the moonlight, "she's been decoding my arrangements through these ancient patterns, using them to predict my next designs." <words>230</words>

Their phones buzzed simultaneously—new photos of Vera's unreleased work appearing online, timestamped mere minutes ago. <words>244</words>

"She's here," Marcus breathed, gesturing toward fresh tire tracks in the soft earth between the standing stones. <words>260</words>

Vera's smile carried the polite anarchy of someone who'd spent years destroying competitors through perfectly legal means. <words>276</words>

"Then let's give her something truly worth watching," she said, pulling wildflowers from her jacket and beginning an impromptu arrangement using her battered comb to position each stem with surgical precision. <words>305</words>

As the singer's final verse echoed across the ancient landscape, Vera created something unprecedented—a floral design that incorporated the stone circle's energy, decoding not just the rock art but transforming it into living art. <words>334</words>

When her former apprentice emerged from behind the largest megalith, camera raised, she found Vera waiting with documentation of her own—photos of the chalk marks, the tire tracks, the evidence of intellectual theft spanning months. <words>366</words>

"The burden of watching," Vera announced with devastating politeness, "is that eventually, the watched begin watching back." <words>381</words>

Marcus gathered the wildflower arrangement as proof of Vera's spontaneous genius, while sirens approached in response to Vera's earlier call to authorities about corporate espionage. <words>403</words>

The mysterious circle had revealed its secrets through their unconventional road trip conversations, but more importantly, it had ended the surveillance that threatened to destroy everything Vera had ruthlessly built. <words>429</words>
