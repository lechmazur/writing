The thin-lipped warlock descended into the forgotten library inside the abandoned mine, his formally casual robes trailing through decades of dust and debris. <words>22</words>

December thirty-first had arrived with its familiar weight of endings, and Marcus knew this would be his last chance to optimize the ancient rituals before another year slipped away. <words>49</words>

Crystalline formations jutted from the library's walls like frozen thoughts, illuminating rows of discredited textbooks that mainstream academia had banished to this subterranean tomb. <words>71</words>

He moved with confusing certainty toward the central vault, where rumors whispered of lost artifacts containing cures for mortality itself. <words>88</words>

The viking ship figurehead fragment sat precisely where the forbidden manuscripts had promised—a snarling dragon's head carved from blackened oak, its eyes still gleaming with otherworldly intelligence. <words>113</words>

Marcus had ignored every warning from his mentors about gorging on knowledge too dangerous for mortal minds, but the fruit of understanding had always been too tempting to resist. <words>139</words>

His thin lips curved into a smile as he lifted the artifact, feeling ancient power pulse through the weathered wood like a heartbeat. <words>159</words>

The discredited textbooks spread before him contained rumored cures that legitimate scholars had dismissed as madness, yet Marcus trusted their confusing certainty more than conventional wisdom. <words>182</words>

He began the optimization ritual, formally casual in his approach despite the magnitude of what he attempted—combining the figurehead's Norse magic with alchemical formulas that promised transcendence. <words>206</words>

As midnight approached and the final calendar page prepared to flip, Marcus felt the lost artifacts responding to his carefully calibrated incantations. <words>225</words>

The dragon's eyes blazed brighter, and suddenly the abandoned mine's silence shattered as ancient voices began whispering secrets in long-dead languages. <words>244</words>

Knowledge flooded his consciousness like a dam bursting—centuries of hidden wisdom, forbidden techniques, and the terrible truth about why these artifacts had been lost deliberately. <words>267</words>

His formally casual demeanor cracked as understanding overwhelmed him; the cures weren't for death but for the curse of endless life, and he had just bound himself to an eternity of searching for what could never be found. <words>301</words>

The figurehead fragment crumbled to dust between his fingers as the library began collapsing around him, but Marcus felt only confusing certainty that he had succeeded exactly as intended. <words>326</words>

When the final calendar page flipped to January first in the world above, the thin-lipped warlock emerged from the abandoned mine forever changed, carrying within him the optimized synthesis of lost knowledge and the terrible weight of understanding why some fruits of wisdom should never be tasted. <words>366</words>

He walked into the new year with formally casual steps, his thin lips curved in a smile that spoke of confusing certainty and the eternal hunger for forbidden knowledge that would now define his immortal existence. <words>394</words>

The mine sealed itself behind him, protecting future seekers from the same glorious damnation. <words>407</words>
