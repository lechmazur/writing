Mira's fingers worked with precisely creative fury, sculpting sugar dragons that breathed mint-scented fire across her makeshift stall in the forgotten market. <words>21</words> The rebellion raged beyond these crumbling walls, but she remained here, crafting confections while nursing a vendetta that burned hotter than any revolution. <words>39</words>

For three years, she'd searched for the man who'd stolen her sister's identity, her life, her very existence from the records. <words>58</words> The forgotten market, abandoned by the city's elite during the uprising, had become her sanctuary and hunting ground. <words>74</words> Here, among the desperate and displaced, information flowed like honey through broken teeth. <words>86</words>

Today brought something different: a photograph slipped beneath her sugar-work, showing her sister's forgotten locket gleaming against unfamiliar cobblestones. <words>103</words> No signature, no demand—just anonymous kindness from someone who understood her pain. <words>115</words>

The photograph led to another, tucked behind a loose brick where beggars once counted coins. <words>129</words> Then another, each image pulling her deeper into the market's labyrinthine passages with ardent scorn building in her chest. <words>146</words> Her sister's locket appeared in each picture, growing larger, clearer, more tangible. <words>158</words>

The final photograph lay beside a crumbling fountain where merchants once hawked maps to imaginary lands. <words>173</words> This image showed not just the locket, but the weathered hands holding it—hands she recognized from wanted posters scattered throughout the rebellion. <words>192</words>

Marcus Veil, the forger who'd erased her sister to create papers for wealthy families fleeing the conflict. <words>208</words> He'd promised Elena passage to the hidden continent beyond the war-torn mainland, then vanished with her identity and left her to die in the fighting. <words>229</words>

But now those same hands trembled as Mira emerged from the shadows, her confectioner's tools gleaming like surgical instruments. <words>245</words> The anonymous trail had led her here for this moment of counterattack against the man who'd stolen everything. <words>261</words>

"You kept it," she said, eyes fixed on the locket that contained Elena's portrait. <words>274</words>

Veil's face crumpled with recognition and shame. <words>282</words> "I couldn't throw it away," he whispered, understanding finally why someone had photographed his daily ritual of guilt. <words>298</words> "Every morning I come here, hoping to undo what I've done." <words>310</words>

Mira studied his broken posture, seeing not the monster she'd imagined but a man drowning in regret. <words>325</words> The rebellion had taught everyone about survival, about choices that haunted long after the necessity passed. <words>340</words>

Her precisely creative mind, so long focused on revenge, shifted like melting sugar taking new shape. <words>355</words> Perhaps the anonymous kindness that brought her here intended not destruction, but understanding. <words>368</words> Perhaps discovering the hidden continent of forgiveness required navigation through unfamiliar territories of mercy. <words>382</words>

She extended her hand toward the locket, and toward something harder to sculpt than any confection—a future beyond vendetta. <words>399</words>
