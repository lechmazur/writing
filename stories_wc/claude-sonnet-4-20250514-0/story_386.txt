Kestra spread the embroidered tablecloth across the lighthouse's control panel, its golden threads catching the atom-core's ethereal glow. <words>17</words> The fabric bore the seal of the Meridian Empire, though few would recognize it now—her homeland had been erased from history itself when the temporal wars collapsed the timelines. <words>44</words> She was the last refugee from that forgotten realm, quietly defiant in her refusal to let her people's memory die. <words>62</words>

The massive lighthouse hummed around her, its atom-powered beacon cutting through dimensions rather than fog. <words>76</words> For three centuries, she had served as its keeper, earning the coastal dwellers' trust despite her strangeness—this woman who never aged, who spoke of empires that never were. <words>103</words> They called her trustworthy strange, accepting her gentle eccentricities because ships always found safe harbor under her watch. <words>120</words>

Tonight felt different. <words>123</words> In the hush of a line that never moves—that eternal moment between heartbeats where time refugees learned to exist—Kestra sensed the stars aligning as they had not done for millennia. <words>148</words> The borrowed dawn of this dimension painted the horizon in hues that reminded her achingly of home. <words>165</words>

She activated the lighthouse's hidden function, one the locals had never suspected. <words>176</words> The beacon's lens array transformed into an enormous catapult mechanism, designed by Meridian engineers to launch not stones, but compressed temporal energy. <words>194</words> By the alignment of the stars, she could finally attempt what she had prepared for across three lifetimes. <words>211</words>

Her motivation had never wavered: to bind old wounds with unstoppable will, to tear open the scar tissue that sealed her empire's timeline and let its memory bleed back into reality. <words>238</words> The embroidered tablecloth began to glow, its threads unraveling into streams of pure chronological essence—the last physical remnant of her world, willingly sacrificed. <words>258</words>

The catapult mechanism hummed to life, drawing power from the lighthouse's atom-core. <words>270</words> Kestra fed the tablecloth's temporal energy into the device, watching as her ancestors' needlework dissolved into possibility. <words>285</words> The stars overhead pulsed in recognition of the ancient Meridian navigation patterns. <words>297</words>

With a sound like reality tearing, the catapult fired its payload into the space between seconds. <words>312</words> Kestra felt the timeline shudder, then crack. <words>320</words> Through the fissure, she glimpsed marble spires and floating gardens, her people walking streets that existed again, if only for a moment. <words>340</words>

The vision faded, but the crack remained—a hairline fracture in history's wall. <words>352</words> Each night, by the alignment of the stars, she would widen it further. <words>365</words> The lighthouse's beacon resumed its normal function, guiding ships safely home while its keeper worked quietly to guide an entire civilization back to existence. <words>386</words> In the borrowed dawn, Kestra smiled and began preparing another temporal charge. <words>398</words> Her defiance would outlast time itself. <words>405</words>
