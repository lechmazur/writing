Marcus rolled the plain wooden bead between his fingers, its worn surface smooth from decades of worry. <words>16</words> The abandoned airport waiting area stretched before him, its rows of broken seats testament to dreams deferred by endless conflict. <words>34</words> Through his laptop screen, fellow veterans gathered in their weekly virtual support group, their pixelated faces flickering like ghosts. <words>51</words>

"I'm doing fine," he lied with practiced ease, the words meant to flatter their collective need for progress stories. <words>68</words> Behind him, an antique funhouse mirror from the old children's play area caught fragments of light, its warped surface creating ripples that seemed to move independently. <words>89</words>

Dr. Chen's voice crackled through the speakers about healing and moving forward, but Marcus was learning something far older. <words>106</words> The art of reading distortions—how trauma bent reality like that broken mirror, creating patterns only the trained eye could decipher. <words>124</words> He'd been tracking these visual echoes for months, artfully clumsy in his explanations to anyone who asked about his strange new obsession. <words>143</words>

The bead had belonged to his grandfather, a World War II medic who'd never spoken of what he'd seen. <words>161</words> Now Marcus understood the screaming silence that had filled their family dinners, the weight of unspoken horrors that passed like heirlooms from one generation to the next. <words>183</words>

"Marcus, you're on mute," someone said, and he realized he'd been staring at the mirror's surface, watching how his own reflection fractured into a dozen broken selves. <words>206</words> Each distortion showed a different version: the soldier he'd been, the broken man he'd become, the subdued vigilante he was learning to be. <words>226</words>

"Sorry, connection issues," he mumbled, unmuting himself while his eyes remained fixed on the glass. <words>240</words> In its warped depths, he could see the patterns of his platoon's last patrol, the way light had bent around the IED crater, creating shadows that had haunted his dreams for three years. <words>265</words>

This was the price of war—not just the obvious wounds, but the way it taught you to see truth in broken things. <words>285</words> The ancient art he was mastering wasn't listed in any manual: how to read the distortions that trauma carved into the world, how to track the invisible damage that rippled outward from every conflict zone. <words>312</words>

The call ended with its usual pleasantries and promises to check in. <words>324</words> Marcus closed the laptop and stood before the mirror, holding his grandfather's bead up to the light. <words>340</words> In the warped reflection, he saw three generations of soldiers learning the same terrible skill: how to carry war's weight in perfect, devastating silence. <words>361</words> The mirror showed him what he was becoming—not a victim or a hero, but a guardian of dangerous truths that only broken glass could reveal. <words>382</words> He pocketed the bead and walked toward the exit, his reflection shattering into a thousand watchful fragments behind him. <words>400</words>
