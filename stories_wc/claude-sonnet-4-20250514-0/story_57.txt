Lord Pemberton wielded his mother's dull letter opener like a garden spade, halfheartedly scraping moss from the workshop's brick foundation. <words>19</words> The British Intelligence facility masqueraded as his estate's potting shed, complete with rusted tools and wilted geraniums that fooled absolutely no one who mattered. <words>39</words> As the most reluctantly recruited aristocrat in MI6 history, he'd volunteered his grounds mainly because saying no to Commander Hayes felt impossibly rude. <words>58</words>

"Sir, perhaps actual gardening implements might prove more effective," suggested his handler, watching Pemberton's pathetic moss-scraping technique with barely concealed amusement. <words>75</words> But Pemberton had discovered something rather extraordinary about his family heirloom—when pressed against certain surfaces, it conducted sound with remarkable clarity. <words>93</words>

The workshop's curved walls created perfect acoustic chambers, and Pemberton possessed the unusually perceptive ability to distinguish conversations happening three rooms away. <words>111</words> Today, he'd overheard something that made his aristocratic blood positively liquify with horror. <words>123</words>

"The canary operation terminates tonight," Agent Morrison had whispered to his colleague near the surveillance equipment. <words>137</words> "Hayes wants the little songbird permanently silenced before the Budapest exchange." <words>148</words>

Pemberton knew exactly which "canary" they meant—Sophia Volkov, the teenage Russian defector who'd been feeding them intelligence about her father's weapons syndicate. <words>167</words> The girl reminded him painfully of his deceased sister: brilliant, brave, and utterly defenseless against the machinations of powerful men. <words>184</words>

His motivation crystallized with startling clarity—he would protect this vulnerable creature, even if it meant betraying his own service. <words>200</words> After all, what was the point of privilege if one couldn't occasionally use it for something decent? <words>216</words>

"I say, Morrison," Pemberton called out cheerfully, abandoning his gardening charade entirely. <words>228</words> "Terribly sorry to interrupt, but I've just remembered—my gamekeeper spotted suspicious activity near the east perimeter." <words>243</words> "Probably nothing, but perhaps we should relocate our guest to the London safe house tonight?" <words>257</words> "You know how Mother worries about security breaches during her bridge tournaments." <words>269</words>

Morrison's eyes narrowed with suspicion, but Pemberton's reputation for bumbling harmlessness served him well. <words>282</words> "His Lordship raises valid concerns," Hayes agreed reluctantly. <words>290</words> "Better safe than sorry with such a valuable asset." <words>300</words>

As arrangements began for Sophia's immediate transfer, Pemberton resumed his theatrical moss-scraping, hiding his satisfied smile behind practiced aristocratic vapidity. <words>318</words> The dull letter opener had proved sharper than anyone imagined, cutting through lies and conspiracy with surprising precision. <words>334</words> Sometimes the most effective rebellion came wrapped in apparent submission, delivered with a apologetic smile and impeccable breeding. <words>350</words> His silent empathy had found its voice through unplanned eavesdropping, and one vulnerable creature would live to see another sunrise. <words>367</words> Mother would be positively scandalized if she knew her garden parties had produced an actual hero. <words>381</words> The thought made him chuckle as he scraped another pointless patch of perfectly innocent moss. <words>395</words>
