Kira adjusted her headphones as she rounded mile eighteen, the abandoned Wonderland Park looming ahead through morning fog. <words>17</words> The secretive pathfinder had discovered this route months ago during her marathon training, drawn by something inexplicable about the decay. <words>35</words> 

Inside her jacket pocket, the cracked porcelain teapot clinked softly with each stride—a vessel that once belonged to her grandmother, filled now with dried willow bark and elderflower. <words>60</words> Most runners carried energy gels; Kira carried the remnants of forgotten folk medicine knowledge that had made her a prodigy before the world moved on. <words>83</words>

Her custom playlist crackled through modified earbuds, each track embedded with encrypted data she'd hacked from medical databases worldwide. <words>100</words> Hidden within the bizarre symphony of electronic beats and traditional flute melodies were formulas, dosages, preparation methods—a digital herbarium disguised as running music. <words>120</words>

The ghost train's rusted tracks curved ahead like a metallic spine, its carriages frozen mid-journey to nowhere. <words>136</words> Kira felt that familiar surge of angrily peaceful determination, fury at a world that had forgotten ancient wisdom, yet serene in her mission to preserve it. <words>158</words>

As she approached the train's entrance, a figure emerged from the shadows between cars—another runner, but different. <words>175</words> He moved with the same secretive grace she recognized in herself, and somehow she knew he understood. <words>192</words>

"You're collecting too," he said simply, gesturing at her hidden cargo. <words>203</words>

Without hesitation, Kira stepped forward and embraced him, feeling the reciprocal weight of preserved knowledge in his pack. <words>219</words> The hug lasted only seconds, but in that moment, two forgotten prodigies acknowledged their shared burden. <words>235</words>

"Ginseng and ghost pipe," he whispered against her shoulder. <words>244</words>

"Willow bark and memory," she replied. <words>250</words>

They separated, and he disappeared back into the train's skeletal embrace while her playlist shifted to a haunting melody embedded with Cherokee healing chants. <words>270</words> Kira resumed her pace, the teapot's gentle percussion matching her heartbeat as she navigated the park's twisted pathways. <words>286</words>

Mile twenty approached, but she felt no fatigue—only the aloof passion that had driven her since childhood, when she'd first realized her gift for remembering what others forgot. <words>309</words> The ghost train's whistle seemed to echo in the distance, though no engine had run these tracks for decades. <words>327</words>

Her phone buzzed with an encrypted message from another collector in Prague, coordinates hidden in a death metal track about pharmaceutical corruption. <words>345</words> Kira smiled grimly, adjusting her route toward the park's exit where mile markers waited like ancient standing stones. <words>362</words>

The teapot's crack caught morning light, a flaw that somehow made it stronger, more precious. <words>376</words> Like her, like them all—broken vessels carrying humanity's forgotten remedies through a world that had chosen to forget. <words>394</words> The marathon would end, but their real race against oblivion continued. <words>405</words>
