Zyx's skeletal fingers trembled as echoing footsteps reverberated through the pixelated corridors of the ancient digital realm. <words>16</words> The jumpy necromancer clutched his glowing fishhook, its ethereal light pulsing brighter with each lunar cycle in this retro world where neon sprites danced between cathode-ray shadows. <words>34</words> While the old gods slumbered in their binary dreams, he had discovered something that would shatter the reverence surrounding Arcadia's most beloved hero. <words>52</words>

The footsteps grew closer, their 8-bit echoes bouncing off walls lined with typically bizarre advertisements for power-ups and extra lives. <words>68</words> Zyx's mission to unmask the revered Captain Pixel had led him deep into the forgotten sectors where deleted code fragments whispered secrets of corruption. <words>87</words>

His fishhook's moonlight illumination revealed paint drips cascading down a hidden protest mural, each droplet a clue in his desperate investigation. <words>104</words> The mural depicted Captain Pixel's true nature—not the savior of digital realms, but a virus consuming worlds from within. <words>121</words> By analyzing the paint drips' patterns, Zyx could decode the timestamp of when this damning artwork was created, proving the hero's deception predated his supposed reformation. <words>142</words>

The footsteps halted. <words>145</words> Zyx began to falter, his necromantic powers wavering as doubt crept through his pixelated bones. <words>158</words> What if exposing this truth would collapse the entire digital ecosystem that billions of NPCs called home? <words>174</words>

"You shouldn't have come here, bone-bag," a voice crackled through static. <words>185</words> Captain Pixel materialized from the glitched shadows, his heroic facade flickering between saint and demon. <words>199</words> "The old gods sleep for a reason—some truths are too dangerous for awakened minds." <words>214</words>

Zyx raised his fishhook, its glow now blindingly bright in the presence of such concentrated corruption. <words>228</words> "The people deserve to know what you really are," he stammered, his voice processing through damaged audio chips. <words>244</words>

"People?" Captain Pixel laughed, his pixels fragmenting momentarily. <words>252</words> "They're code, Zyx. <words>256</words> Beautiful, complex code that functions perfectly under controlled illusions." <words>265</words>

The necromancer studied the mural's final paint drip, realizing its analysis revealed not just when the truth was painted, but when it would be erased. <words>284</words> Tonight. <words>285</words> The moonlight in his fishhook pulsed urgently as he understood the clear complexity of his situation—save a lie that preserved millions, or speak a truth that would delete everything. <words>307</words>

As the old gods stirred in their digital slumber, sensing the disturbance, Zyx made his choice. <words>321</words> He pressed the fishhook against the mural's surface, its glow burning the evidence into permanent memory blocks scattered across the network. <words>339</words> Truth would survive, hidden but accessible, waiting for minds strong enough to handle its typically bizarre implications. <words>354</words>

Captain Pixel's scream echoed through infinite corridors as his false divinity crumbled, leaving only honest fragments in the moonlight. <words>370</words>
