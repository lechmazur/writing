Sir Gareth's weatherbeaten hands trembled as he reached for the brass door knocker, its surface reflecting his scarred face in fractured pieces. <words>20</words> The lighthouse prison rose from jagged reefs like a monument to his failures, each wave crash echoing the screams he'd failed to silence. <words>39</words> Within the mirrored reflection of the knocker's polished surface, time folded impossibly—he saw himself as the young knight who'd first accepted this cursed duty, and as the broken man he'd become. <words>65</words>

The warden's collection lay scattered across the table: a child's wooden toy, a faded letter, a silver locket, a dried flower, and a tarnished medal. <words>85</words> For decades, Gareth had dismissed them as random trinkets, but now their pattern emerged with grueling clarity—each item belonged to a prisoner he'd delivered to this forsaken tower. <words>107</words> The toy from little Marcus, accused of theft; the letter from Elena, condemned for treason; the locket from her mother, who'd died waiting for mercy. <words>127</words>

Behind him, the final prisoner whimpered—a boy no older than his own lost son, sentenced for stealing bread. <words>144</words> Gareth's orders were absolute: deliver the child to the lighthouse keeper, then seal the door forever. <words>159</words> But the brass knocker's reflection showed him a different truth—in its curved surface, he watched his own past victims, their faces grudgingly sweet in their final moments of hope before despair claimed them. <words>185</words>

The impossible choice crystallized: obey his oath and damn another innocent, or break his vows and face the king's wrath. <words>202</words> Yet as Gareth studied the artifacts, he began to appreciate their silent testimony—each life had mattered, each story deserved remembrance. <words>219</words> The pattern they formed wasn't random cruelty, but a map of conscience he'd ignored too long. <words>234</words>

With joyful agony, he lifted the brass knocker one final time, its weight somehow lighter now. <words>249</words> Instead of the prescribed three knocks that would summon the keeper, he struck once—a signal he and his own son had shared in happier times. <words>271</words> The door remained sealed. <words>276</words>

Turning to the boy, Gareth unbuckled his sword and let it clatter to the lighthouse steps. <words>290</words> "Run," he whispered, his voice thick with decades of suppressed grief. <words>301</words> As the child disappeared into the mist, Gareth gathered the scattered mementos and held them close, finally ready to face whatever consequences awaited. <words>321</words> The brass knocker's reflection showed him peace at last—not the peace of duty fulfilled, but the deeper satisfaction of a soul reclaimed. <words>341</words> For the first time in thirty years, the lighthouse would claim no new prisoner, and the final cry of regret had been hushed not by submission, but by courage reborn. <words>365</words> In the knocker's curved surface, his reflection smiled through tears, weathered but finally whole. <words>378</words> The pattern was broken, the choice made, and Sir Gareth stood free beneath the storm-gray sky. <words>394</words>
