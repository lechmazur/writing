Ezra wiped clay from his weathered hands, studying the woman across the pottery wheel with the practiced eye of someone who'd spent decades reading people through locked doors. <words>26</words>

Her embroidered gloves, pristine white silk adorned with golden hunting scenes, seemed absurdly delicate for ceramics class, yet she shaped clay with surprising skill. <words>47</words>

"You're not here for the art," he said, his voice carrying that delightfully menacing quality that had served him well in forty years of locksmithing. <words>67</words>

She smiled with demure audacity, never pausing in her work. <words>77</words>

"Neither are you, I suspect." <words>83</words>

Through the studio's windows, the labyrinth orchard sprawled across colonial rooftops like a verdant puzzle, apple trees planted in impossible geometric patterns that only made sense from above. <words>107</words>

Ezra had discovered this place while painting those very rooftops last month, following rumors of doors that led nowhere—or everywhere, depending on who held the keys. <words>130</words>

"The throne remains unclaimed," she continued, her fingers coaxing elegant curves from the spinning clay. <words>144</words>

"Twenty-seven others have tried to reach it through the orchard's heart." <words>155</words>

He'd heard whispers in taverns below about the ancient seat of power hidden within the maze, accessible only to those who understood the old ways of hunting—not animals, but secrets, pathways, the spaces between what people showed and what they hid. <words>191</words>

"You preserve the hunting methods," she observed, finally meeting his gaze. <words>202</words>

"In locks, in reading intentions, in finding what others cannot." <words>213</words>

The scent of ripening apples began to permeate the studio as afternoon shadows shifted, carrying with it something else—anticipation, perhaps, or ancient magic stirring. <words>235</words>

"My family planted that orchard three centuries ago," she said, pulling her pot from the wheel with practiced grace. <words>252</words>

"We've been waiting for someone who understands that the most valuable things aren't behind the strongest locks, but hidden in plain sight." <words>271</words>

Ezra set down his own half-formed vessel, recognition dawning. <words>280</words>

The pottery class had been cover, but for both of them—her testing, him searching. <words>294</words>

"The throne isn't a seat of power," he realized aloud. <words>304</words>

"It's a way of seeing, of moving through the world." <words>315</words>

She nodded, peeling off her gloves to reveal hands marked with the same calluses that spoke of years working with metal and precision. <words>334</words>

"My ancestors designed locks for that labyrinth," she said softly. <words>344</words>

"Yours crafted the keys." <words>349</words>

Outside, the orchard seemed to shimmer in the painting light, pathways shifting like a living thing. <words>364</words>

"Shall we claim what was always ours?" she asked, extending her unmarked hand. <words>376</words>

Ezra smiled, feeling decades of jadedness lift like morning fog. <words>385</words>

"Lead the way," he said, and together they stepped toward the window where destiny waited among the apple trees. <words>401</words>
