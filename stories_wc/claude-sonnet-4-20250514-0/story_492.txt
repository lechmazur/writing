Marcus hammered the neural interface into shape with blacksmith's tools that seemed anachronistic in the neon-soaked back alley. <words>18</words> His cybernetic arm sparked as he worked, distracted by the fractured hologram advertisements bleeding through the rain-slicked brick walls. <words>36</words> The broken escalator beside him had been frozen mid-ascent for three days, its passengers trapped in digital limbo between floors of the megacorp tower. <words>56</words>

He was normally weird, even by Night City standards, but tonight felt different. <words>68</words> The corporate data-thieves needed someone to infiltrate the tower's quantum consciousness network, and Marcus knew he was their reluctant catalyst. <words>85</words> They'd chosen him precisely because his scattered mind could navigate the fractured illusions that protected the AI core. <words>101</words>

"Focus, Marcus," he whispered, adjusting the interface's neural pathways with delicate hammer taps. <words>114</words> The escalator's frozen passengers flickered like ghosts, their consciousness uploaded somewhere between the fortieth and forty-first floors. <words>130</words> He could see their terror through the translucent barriers, their minds caught in an endless loop of corporate muzak and advertising jingles. <words>148</words>

The blacksmith's tools felt right in his hands, ancient craftsmanship meeting digital rebellion. <words>161</words> Each strike reshaped not just metal and circuitry, but hope itself. <words>172</words> Marcus had spent years gathering these fractured illusions from the city's forgotten corners, collecting broken dreams and abandoned memories like scrap metal. <words>189</words> Tonight, he would forge them into something bright. <words>197</words>

The interface pulsed with warm light as he connected the final neural pathway. <words>209</words> His plan was ruthlessly kind: he would infiltrate the network via interconnected trails of consciousness, following the passengers' trapped minds through the quantum maze. <words>229</words> Where the corporate programmers saw valuable processing power, Marcus saw souls worth saving. <words>242</words>

He jacked the interface into his skull, feeling the familiar electric burn. <words>253</words> The alley dissolved as his consciousness dove into the network, following breadcrumb trails of human memory through firewalls and encryption. <words>269</words> The passengers' minds appeared like constellation points in digital space, each one a star he could guide home. <words>285</words>

Marcus moved through the quantum pathways with surprising grace, his scattered thoughts now an advantage. <words>298</words> While security algorithms hunted for linear intrusion patterns, he danced between their searches like smoke. <words>312</words> One by one, he gathered the trapped passengers, their fractured illusions becoming tools of liberation. <words>326</words>

The escalator shuddered back to life as he rerouted power from the AI core. <words>339</words> Passengers materialized on the steps, confused but breathing, their minds restored to flesh. <words>352</words> Marcus collapsed in the alley, neural interface smoking, his hammer still gripping hope. <words>364</words> He'd turned corporate cruelty into rescue, transforming broken dreams into brilliant escape routes. <words>377</words> In this cyberpunk maze of endless consumption, he'd forged something genuinely precious: the simple gift of going home. <words>393</words> The blacksmith's tools clattered to wet pavement as sirens approached, but Marcus smiled through the pain. <words>408</words>
