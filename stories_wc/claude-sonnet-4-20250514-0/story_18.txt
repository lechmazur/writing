In the steam-powered city square, where brass pipes hissed and copper gears churned endlessly, the marble statue of Elena stood motionless among the bustling crowds. <words>23</words> Her stone eyes watched the citizens hurry past, their minds broadcasting lies like radio static she couldn't silence. <words>40</words> The threadbare hair tie wrapped around her wrist—the last remnant of her human life—had weathered decades of industrial rain and soot. <words>61</words>

Throughout planning her escape from this limestone prison, Elena had learned to read the flow of thoughts like ink in calligraphy, each mental stroke revealing hidden truths beneath spoken deceptions. <words>86</words> The mayor proclaimed prosperity while thinking of empty coffers; merchants smiled while calculating how to cheat their customers; lovers whispered sweet words while harboring bitter resentments. <words>109</words>

Elena's tragically joyful existence had taught her that even in a world drowning in falsehoods, moments of genuine recognition still flickered like steam-lamp flames. <words>132</words> She had been cursed to stone for seeking truth too boldly, but her telepathic gift remained her consolation prize—a window into authentic human nature. <words>153</words>

Today felt different, though, as she sensed something pure approaching through the mechanical cacophony. <words>166</words> A small girl wandered toward the fountain, her mind radiating the crystalline honesty that only children possessed. <words>182</words> The child's thoughts flowed smooth as master calligraphy: wonder at the statue's lifelike features, sadness for its apparent loneliness, and an inexplicable urge to offer comfort. <words>205</words>

When the girl reached up to touch the weathered hair tie, Elena felt the light of recognition pass between them—not the shallow acknowledgment of daily pleasantries, but the deep knowing that souls sometimes share. <words>234</words> The child's innocent telepathic potential sparked against Elena's ancient consciousness, creating a bridge neither had expected. <words>250</words>

"You're real, aren't you?" the girl whispered, her small hand still touching the frayed fabric. <words>264</words>

Elena's stone lips couldn't move, but her thoughts flowed with gloomy cheerfulness toward the child's receptive mind: "As real as the truth you carry, little one." <words>285</words>

The girl smiled with genuine understanding, her pure intention beginning to crack the curse that had bound Elena for so long. <words>303</words> Steam swirled around them as the mechanical city continued its relentless rhythm, but in this pocket of authentic connection, Elena felt the marble slowly warming to flesh. <words>327</words>

The threadbare hair tie, witness to both her human dreams and stone suffering, began to glow with the same recognition that passed between them. <words>348</words> Throughout planning her freedom, Elena had never imagined that truth would arrive in such a small package, offering salvation through the simple act of believing what others refused to see. <words>375</words>

As the transformation began, Elena's tragically joyful heart swelled with hope that perhaps, in a world built on lies, one honest soul was enough to weatherize even the deepest curse. <words>400</words>
