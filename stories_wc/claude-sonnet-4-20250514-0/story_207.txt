Kade floated through the abandoned space station's medical bay, clutching a dried flower bouquet against his weathered spacesuit. <words>17</words> The forthright peddler had traveled across three star systems to reach this desolate place, where cosmic winds whispered through broken hull plates. <words>35</words> While the universe hummed its secret song—a melody only those who'd lost everything could truly hear—he spread crumpled gossip columns across a surgical table. <words>56</words>

Years ago, he'd sworn a blood oath to Captain Moreau, promising to never reveal the location of this medical facility where illegal experiments had flourished. <words>77</words> But innocent people were dying now, and Kade's conscience weighed heavier than his loyalty. <words>90</words>

With meekly assertive movements, he began sifting through the rumor-laden gossip columns, searching for clues about which journalists might be trustworthy. <words>107</words> The dried flowers—remnants of his daughter's funeral bouquet—reminded him why he'd chosen this path of redemption. <words>122</words> She'd been one of Moreau's victims, though Kade hadn't known it when he'd made his oath. <words>137</words>

The joyful loneliness that had become his constant companion settled around him like stardust. <words>150</words> He felt joy because he was finally doing right, yet lonely because this choice would make him an exile forever. <words>168</words> No honorable trader would work with an oath-breaker, even one breaking his promise for noble reasons. <words>183</words>

Kade divided the articles into three piles: reliable sources, corporate mouthpieces, and sensationalist rags. <words>196</words> The universe's secret song grew louder, its harmonies echoing through the bay's empty chambers where so many had suffered. <words>213</words> In the reliable pile, he found Investigative Reporter Chen's contact information—someone known for protecting whistleblowers. <words>227</words>

He picked up a withered rose from the bouquet, its petals crumbling between his gloved fingers like his old life dissolving. <words>244</words> The oath had been sealed with his blood and Moreau's, but some promises deserved to be broken when they protected monsters. <words>262</words>

As he composed his message to Chen, revealing the station's coordinates and the evidence hidden in its data banks, tears floated weightlessly before his visor. <words>283</words> The universe's secret song swelled around him, no longer mournful but triumphant, as if the cosmos itself approved of his choice. <words>301</words>

Kade transmitted the message and scattered the remaining flower petals into the void through an airlock. <words>316</words> They drifted away like tiny spirits finally set free, carrying his daughter's memory toward distant stars. <words>331</words> He would face exile with dignity, knowing that his betrayal of one oath had honored a higher promise—to protect the innocent. <words>349</words> The forthright peddler smiled within his helmet, embracing both the joy of redemption and the loneliness of his chosen path. <words>367</words> In the abandoned medical bay, surrounded by the universe's eternal song, he had finally found peace through sacrifice. <words>384</words> His blood oath was broken, but his soul was whole. <words>393</words>
