Prophet Kael clutched his collection of cracked marbles, each fracture line mapping the contradictions in his soul as he stood in the lunar mining colony's observation deck. <words>25</words>

The ancient glass spheres had belonged to his grandmother, their hairline breaks spreading like spider webs through translucent cores—beautiful in their imperfection, sorrowful in their resilience. <words>49</words>

He was happily sad, a state that defined his existence as someone who could see tomorrow's tragedies and yesterday's missed joys with equal clarity. <words>70</words>

"The final oath must be spoken," he whispered to the Earth hanging in the black sky, though every fiber of his being recoiled from the responsibility. <words>91</words>

Kael had discovered his prophetic gift while sorting through a rummage sale box three years ago, finding jigsaw puzzle edges that somehow revealed fragments of future moments when arranged correctly. <words>117</words>

The colony's miners thought him eccentric—bashfully arrogant in the way he'd mumble predictions while avoiding eye contact, as if embarrassed by his own cosmic importance. <words>139</words>

Today's vision had shown him the cosmic scoreboard, that ethereal tally of universal balance, and his desperate need to scramble its cruel mathematics. <words>159</words>

In the space between heartbeats, where time stretched like taffy and consciousness expanded beyond mortal limits, Kael had witnessed the colony's destruction—unless he acted. <words>181</words>

The final oath wasn't just words; it was a defragmentation of reality itself, reorganizing the scattered pieces of fate like cleaning up a corrupted hard drive. <words>202</words>

He arranged the cracked marbles on the floor, their patterns matching the jigsaw puzzle edges he'd memorized, each placement a syllable in an ancient language. <words>223</words>

"I speak not for glory but for the unnamed children who will never see Earth's blue if I remain silent," he began, his voice gaining strength. <words>246</words>

The marbles began to glow, their cracks sealing and reopening in rhythmic pulses that synchronized with his heartbeat. <words>262</words>

Around him, the colony's systems hummed differently, as if the universe itself was listening and recalibrating. <words>277</words>

Kael felt the cosmic scoreboard's numbers shifting, probabilities dancing like aurora across dimensions he couldn't fully comprehend. <words>293</words>

The final words of the oath tumbled from his lips, each one reshaping tomorrow's certainties into today's possibilities. <words>309</words>

As the last syllable faded, the marbles crumbled to dust, their purpose fulfilled, their sacrifice necessary. <words>323</words>

Through the observation deck's reinforced glass, Kael watched the approaching asteroid change course—a trajectory adjustment so subtle that no instruments would detect it, but significant enough to spare three thousand lives. <words>349</words>

He smiled sadly, knowing he'd scrambled the cosmic scoreboard successfully but at the cost of his prophetic gift. <words>366</words>

The universe had been defragmented, its scattered pieces reorganized into a more merciful configuration. <words>379</words>

Tomorrow would arrive unmarked by catastrophe, and Kael would face it as an ordinary man, happily sad and finally free from the burden of knowing too much. <words>401</words>
