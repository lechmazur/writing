Kira swept the tavern floor with practiced indifference, her calloused hands gripping the broom like a weapon against tedium. <words>17</words> The broken seashells in her apron pocket clinked softly—fragments of a collection she'd kept since childhood, each piece representing dreams that had cracked under the weight of endless service. <words>38</words> Outside the tavern's grimy windows, the world had begun its impossible reversal, sand flowing upward in amber streams as time itself unwound. <words>57</words>

"Another pint!" bellowed a patron, but Kira was already moving, her movements predictably unpredictable—sometimes swift, sometimes deliberately sluggish, keeping customers perpetually off-balance. <words>76</words> She'd perfected this dance of defiance, this flippant solemnity that masked her burning desire to escape. <words>90</words>

The temporal reversal had exposed the ancient riverbed beneath the town, revealing fossilized footprints that led to the abandoned greenhouse laboratory. <words>107</words> Scientists had called it a vacuum chamber garden before the backwards cascade began—a place where impossible plants once grew in airless silence. <words>125</words> Now, with time flowing in reverse, Kira felt an inescapable calling pulling her toward those prehistoric tracks. <words>140</words>

She abandoned her broom mid-sweep, ignoring the patron's protests. <words>149</words> Following the fossilized trail, she reached the glass dome where plants hung suspended in their vacuum prison, their leaves trembling as if dreaming. <words>168</words> The broken shells in her pocket began to resonate, each fragment singing with oceanic memory. <words>181</words>

Inside the chamber, Kira discovered the Randomizer—a crystalline device humming with temporal energy. <words>194</words> The fossilized footprints circled it like a ritual dance frozen in stone. <words>207</words> Understanding flooded through her: this machine could catapult imagination beyond known realms, reshuffling reality's deck with cosmic indifference. <words>223</words>

With theatrical gravity masking genuine terror, she placed her broken shells around the device. <words>236</words> Each fragment began to glow, their jagged edges fitting together like pieces of a cosmic puzzle. <words>251</words> The shells reformed into something greater—a nautilus spiral that spun faster as the backwards sands accelerated. <words>267</words>

The vacuum chamber shattered. <words>271</words> Reality hiccupped. <words>273</words>

Suddenly, Kira stood in an impossible tavern where gravity flowed sideways and customers ordered drinks that hadn't been invented yet. <words>291</words> She was still a tavern-hand, but now she served liquid starlight to beings who spoke in mathematical equations. <words>308</words> Her predictably unpredictable nature had become a superpower in this randomized realm where consistency was chaos. <words>323</words>

The fossilized footprints had led her exactly where she needed to be—not away from service, but toward a grander kind of hospitality. <words>343</words> She poured a glass of crystallized time for a customer made of living geometry, her broken shells now forming constellation patterns across her apron. <words>364</words>

Some callings, she realized with mock-serious satisfaction, were worth following backward through time itself. <words>377</words> In this vacuum garden of impossibilities, even a scrappy tavern-hand could serve drinks to infinity and randomize the universe one order at a time. <words>399</words>
