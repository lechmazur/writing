Ezra hesitated at the threshold of the floating rock dojo, clutching a plain white candle against his chest like a talisman. <words>19</words> The ancient monastery drifted silently through the void, its stone platforms defying gravity while cosmic winds whispered through carved archways. <words>36</words> As the last flicker of the guttering lantern cast dancing shadows across weathered walls, he knew his time was running short. <words>55</words>

The morbid florist had spent years arranging funeral wreaths, finding strange comfort in the cyclical nature of death and rebirth that governed his profession. <words>74</words> Yet tonight, he sought something deeper—an understanding of the cosmic cycles that stretched beyond earthly decomposition. <words>88</words> His neutrally passionate demeanor masked a burning curiosity about universal truths that neither wilted petals nor mourning clients could satisfy. <words>105</words>

Master Yuen emerged from the shadows, her robes flowing like stellar dust. <words>116</words> "You've come seeking answers," she observed, her voice boldly timid in the vast silence. <words>129</words> "But first, you must oblige an unusual request." <words>138</words>

She led him to a weathered trunk overflowing with yellowed pages—decades of accumulated wisdom from countless seekers. <words>153</words> "These contain the tempered beliefs of every student who has walked these halls," she explained, gesturing toward the backlog of typed pages. <words>171</words> "Read them by candlelight, and perhaps you'll glimpse what you seek." <words>182</words>

Ezra lit his candle with trembling fingers, its steady flame illuminating the first manuscript. <words>195</words> The pages spoke of gardeners who understood seasons, of astronomers who mapped stellar deaths, of philosophers who questioned existence itself. <words>212</words> Each writer had arrived seeking cosmic truth, their beliefs gradually tempered by exposure to infinite mystery. <words>226</words>

As he read deeper into the night, Ezra's own certainties began shifting like sand. <words>239</words> His fascination with death transformed into reverence for transformation itself—the endless dance of creation and destruction that governed both flowers and galaxies. <words>258</words> The guttering lantern finally died, leaving only his candle's glow to illuminate the final pages. <words>273</words>

"Do you understand now?" Master Yuen asked softly. <words>281</words>

Ezra nodded, his boldly timid nature finally at peace with paradox. <words>292</words> "The cosmic cycles aren't separate from what I do," he whispered, watching wax drip onto the ancient stones. <words>308</words> "Every arrangement I create, every funeral I serve—they're all part of the same infinite pattern." <words>322</words>

The floating dojo continued its eternal drift through space as Ezra carefully closed the trunk. <words>336</words> His tempered beliefs now embraced both the intimate ritual of arranging flowers and the vast choreography of stars being born and dying. <words>355</words> He had obliged the master's request and found his answer hidden within the accumulated wisdom of seekers who came before. <words>373</words> The plain white candle burned steadily in his palm, a small but significant light in the cosmic darkness that no longer seemed empty, but full of endless, beautiful cycles. <words>400</words>
