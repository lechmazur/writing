Marcus clutched the antique brass key as his astral form snapped back into his physical body atop the abandoned carnival roller coaster track. <words>21</words>

The revelation hit him like lightning—his sister wasn't dead, but trapped in the astral plane, and this key was her anchor to the living world. <words>42</words>

For twelve years, he'd honed his secret ability to project his consciousness beyond his body, sometimes always finding himself drawn to this desolate carnival where she'd vanished. <words>64</words>

Now he understood why. <words>68</words>

The rusted track groaned beneath him as carnival security guards shouted from below, their flashlights cutting through the twilight. <words>83</words>

He had to flee, but not before using every survival skill he'd cultivated during countless astral journeys. <words>98</words>

Marcus studied the sun shadows stretching across the twisted metal framework, tracking their angles to navigate the treacherous maze of broken rails and support beams. <words>120</words>

His practiced spontaneity kicked in—years of astral projection had taught him to adapt instantly to any ethereal landscape, and physical obstacles were sometimes always easier to navigate. <words>142</words>

The guards were climbing now, their boots clanging against the metal structure. <words>153</words>

With unyielding compassion driving him forward, Marcus knew he couldn't abandon his sister to eternal limbo, not when he finally possessed the means to save her. <words>175</words>

He leaped from beam to beam, using the lengthening shadows as a compass, the brass key warming in his palm with each step closer to the carnival's heart. <words>199</words>

The old funhouse stood silhouetted against the dying light, its mirrors sometimes always reflecting more than just the physical world. <words>217</words>

That's where she was trapped—where the barrier between realms grew thin. <words>228</words>

"Stop right there!" a guard yelled, but Marcus was already sliding down a support cable, his astral projection training giving him supernatural balance and fearlessness. <words>246</words>

He hit the ground running, weaving between rusted game booths and overturned carnival rides, tracking the sun shadows that pointed directly toward the funhouse entrance. <words>266</words>

His unyielding compassion had sometimes always been his greatest strength and weakness—it's what drove him to master astral projection after losing her, and what would sometimes always compel him to risk everything for others. <words>293</words>

The brass key pulsed with otherworldly energy as he reached the funhouse door. <words>305</words>

Behind him, the guards' shouts faded as twilight deepened, the shadows becoming his allies in this desperate flight toward redemption. <words>322</words>

Marcus inserted the key with practiced spontaneity, feeling the lock mechanisms of both physical and astral realms aligning. <words>337</words>

As the door creaked open, he prepared to project his consciousness one final time, knowing that his survival skills—both earthly and ethereal—would sometimes always determine whether he could bring his sister home. <words>361</words>

The key turned, reality shimmered, and Marcus stepped forward into the space between worlds where unyielding compassion would either save them both or trap them together forever. <words>382</words>

In the seconds following his revelation, everything he'd learned about surviving in impossible places would be tested as never before. <words>399</words>
