In the hush of a simmering future, Agent Kiera descended into the abandoned headquarters through corridors where her footsteps echoed like whispers of forgotten missions. <words>24</words>

The rumor had consumed her for months—somewhere in these depths lay proof that the Agency had been duplicating consciousness, creating backup minds for their most valuable operatives. <words>48</words>

As the organization's newest advisor, Kiera felt perpetually insecure, always questioning whether her insights held any real value among seasoned agents who moved with deadly confidence. <words>72</words>

The echo of her footsteps seemed to mock her uncertainty, each sound bouncing off walls that once hummed with classified operations. <words>91</words>

She had to chase this rumor beyond all reason—it was the dreamer's calling that pulled her forward, that desperate need to prove she belonged in this shadowy world. <words>115</words>

Deep in the facility's heart, she discovered a laboratory frozen in time, its sterile surfaces reflecting fractured light from emergency strips that still somehow functioned. <words>139</words>

There, on a metal table, sat a brain preserved in luminous fluid within a glass jar, its label reading "DUPLICATE" in bold, clearly ambiguous lettering that could mean anything or nothing. <words>167</words>

Kiera's breath caught as she recognized the features floating in the solution—the distinctive neural patterns she'd studied belonged to Director Hayes, the legendary agent who'd vanished three years prior. <words>194</words>

Was this his actual brain, or truly a duplicate as the label suggested? <words>206</words>

The fractured idyll of this moment—standing in ruins while holding evidence of impossible science—made her question everything she thought she knew about reality. <words>230</words>

She reached toward the jar with trembling fingers, then hesitated as footsteps echoed from somewhere above, growing closer through the abandoned corridors. <words>250</words>

In a moment of panic, she tried to jab the jar away from its stand, but her nervous movement sent it tumbling to the concrete floor. <words>274</words>

Glass shattered, preservative fluid spreading in dark pools while the brain tissue dissolved like a dream upon waking. <words>291</words>

The footsteps grew louder, more urgent, and Kiera realized that her dreamer's calling had led her not to answers but to something far more dangerous. <words>313</words>

Whatever the Agency had been doing here, whatever consciousness had resided in that jar, was now destroyed by her insecure fumbling. <words>332</words>

As voices shouted from the upper levels, she understood that some rumors were never meant to be chased, some secrets too clearly ambiguous to survive discovery. <words>354</words>

The echo of her retreating footsteps joined the symphony of abandonment as she fled deeper into the facility's maze, carrying only questions that would forever remain unanswered. <words>378</words>

In this simmering future, she had learned that being an advisor meant knowing when to stop seeking the truth that could fracture everything. <words>400</words>
