Inspector Maya pressed her face against the kelp forest observation post's porthole, her exhaustion weighing heavier than the ocean above. <words>18</words> For three years, she'd enforced New Pacifica's harmony protocols without question, believing their underwater utopia had truly banished chaos. <words>35</words> The rustic bread box on her desk seemed absurdly out of place among the sleek monitoring equipment, a gift from her grandmother who'd insisted on preserving "old world charm." <words>58</words>

Tonight felt different—the kelp swayed with an unnatural rhythm, like drums in some forgotten tribal dance. <words>73</words> Maya's instruments detected nothing, yet her skin prickled with certainty that something genuinely fake was approaching, something that appeared normal but defied every natural law. <words>97</words>

"I swear to protect this colony," she whispered into her comm, the mandatory evening oath feeling hollow in her mouth. <words>114</words> At the exact second those words left her lips, the kelp forest erupted in ghostly blue light. <words>129</words>

Translucent figures emerged from the darkness—the drowned souls of the old world, moving with that same drumbeat rhythm that made Maya's heart race. <words>149</words> She laughed through sudden tears, hysteria and wonder colliding as her rational mind shattered like glass. <words>164</words> These spirits weren't malevolent; they were teachers, and she finally understood why her grandmother had given her that ancient bread box. <words>182</words>

Inside it, Maya found yellowed letters revealing the truth: New Pacifica wasn't built on empty ocean floor but on a mass grave of climate refugees. <words>202</words> The colony's perfection was genuinely fake, maintained by suppressing this history, and the spirits had come to guide her toward acknowledging it. <words>221</words>

Maya's laughter turned to sobbing as fear transformed into acceptance. <words>230</words> She'd spent years enforcing a lie, but now these supernatural teachers offered her the chance to greet fear as a necessary guide toward truth. <words>251</words> The drumbeat rhythm pulsed stronger, and she realized it matched her own heartbeat, connecting her to something deeper than policy and protocol. <words>270</words>

Through the porthole, one spirit gestured toward the surface, its message clear: the colony needed to remember what it was built upon. <words>289</words> Maya wiped her tears and began typing her report, knowing it would shatter their carefully maintained paradise. <words>304</words> But truth, even painful truth, was the only foundation worthy of a real utopia. <words>317</words>

As she worked, the spirits' rhythm guided her fingers across the keyboard, their ancient wisdom flowing through her into words that would change everything. <words>336</words> She laughed again, this time with genuine joy mixed with terror, as she prepared to teach her people that facing their buried past was the only way forward. <words>359</words> The bread box sat open beside her, finally serving its true purpose as a vessel for revelations that could no longer be contained. <words>378</words> Maya smiled through her tears, ready to guide New Pacifica toward an authentically imperfect but honest future. <words>393</words>
