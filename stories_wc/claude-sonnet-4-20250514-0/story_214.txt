Mako adjusted the floating observatory's gyroscopic stabilizers, savoring the silence that wasn't quite silence—the silently audible hum of cosmic radiation filtering through the station's hull. <words>25</words>

Between shifts, when the other researchers slept, the lone trapper emerged from his quarters clutching a weathered piece of sea glass. <words>43</words>

Nobody questioned why a deep-space salvage expert carried ocean debris; they assumed it was another quirky memento from his planet-hopping days. <words>63</words>

But Mako knew better—embedded within the frosted green surface lay microscopic film strips, stolen from archives that officially didn't exist. <words>82</words>

He'd lost everything to corporate pirates three years ago: his ship, his crew, his reputation. <words>97</words>

Now, floating above a swirling black hole that bent light into impossible spirals, he understood the upside of loss—it had freed him to become something darker, more useful. <words>123</words>

The sea glass caught starlight as he positioned it under his modified spectrometer, watching data cascade across his personal terminal. <words>141</words>

Layer by layer, the microfilm revealed shipping manifests, coordinates, and payment records that would make certain admirals very uncomfortable. <words>158</words>

His fingers danced across holographic keys with gritty determination, decoding each fragment like a puzzle wrapped in bureaucratic doublespeak. <words>175</words>

The black hole's event horizon pulsed hypnotically beyond the observatory's reinforced windows, its gravitational lensing creating aurora-like phenomena that painted his workspace in shifting colors. <words>200</words>

Mako smiled grimly—he'd learned to siphon radiance from his own black hole of doubt, transforming professional destruction into personal renaissance. <words>220</words>

Each decoded file brought him closer to the corporate syndicate that had branded him a thief while they plundered entire systems. <words>239</words>

His sea glass talisman had been a gift from Captain Torres before the ambush, a simple token from her homeworld's beaches. <words>258</words>

Now it served as both memorial and weapon, carrying enough encrypted evidence to topple governments. <words>272</words>

The observatory's night cycle hummed around him as he prepared to recommence his real work—not studying cosmic phenomena, but orchestrating corporate downfall. <words>291</words>

Tomorrow's shift would find him playing the reformed salvager, cataloging asteroid compositions and gravitational anomalies with scientific precision. <words>307</words>

But tonight belonged to justice, served cold as the vacuum outside his window. <words>319</words>

Mako uploaded the latest batch of decoded files to a secure network, each transmission another nail in his enemies' coffin. <words>337</words>

The sea glass grew warm in his palm, as if Torres herself approved of his transformation from victim to avenger. <words>355</words>

He'd lost his old life completely, but gained something infinitely more valuable—purpose distilled from betrayal, hope crystallized from despair. <words>372</words>

The black hole spun endlessly below, a cosmic reminder that even light could be captured and bent to serve new masters. <words>390</words>

Mako pocketed his sea glass and returned to the shadows, content to let the universe believe he was just another broken wanderer. <words>408</words>
