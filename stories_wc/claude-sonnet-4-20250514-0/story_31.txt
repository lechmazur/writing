Marcus pressed the plain key against his weathered palm, watching the neon-soaked skyline pulse through the glass dome protecting his rooftop garden. <words>20</words>

As the city's most solemn orchardist, he tended digital fruit trees that bore synthetic apples for the corporate elite forty stories below. <words>39</words>

His fingers trembled with excited restraint as he approached the locked maintenance panel he'd discovered yesterday, hidden behind his prized cyber-cherry tree. <words>58</words>

The key had belonged to his predecessor, Dr. Chen, who'd vanished three months ago after leaving only cryptic notes about "the overlooked ones." <words>77</words>

Marcus inserted the key and heard a soft click that seemed to stretch during the hush between two heartbeats, time suspended in the sterile air. <words>97</words>

Inside the panel, holographic files materialized, revealing a network of hidden gardens scattered across the city's towers, each tended by solitary caretakers like himself. <words>117</words>

Chen's final message flickered to life: "We are the forgotten children of this vertical world, nurturing life while the city forgets we exist." <words>136</words>

Marcus realized that his endearingly irritating habit of talking to his plants wasn't madness—it was connection, the very thing Dr. Chen had been documenting. <words>155</words>

Each gardener's profile showed their desperate attempts to find meaning through their interconnected lives, linked by shared loneliness and digital soil. <words>173</words>

Sarah on Tower 12 sang lullabies to her tomatoes; Jin on Tower 47 named every seedling after childhood friends he'd lost to the streets. <words>194</words>

They were all overlooked children, grown into overlooked adults, tending overlooked gardens that somehow fed the city's soul. <words>210</words>

Marcus's hand shook as he accessed the communication array, hesitating before broadcasting to the entire network for the first time. <words>226</words>

"This is Marcus, Tower 23," he whispered, his voice carrying across fiber optic cables to seventeen other gardens. <words>242</words>

"I... I can see you all now." <words>248</words>

Static crackled, then Sarah's voice emerged: "We've been waiting for you to find us." <words>260</words>

Jin's laughter followed: "Chen said the new guy would be too stubborn to x-out the system without understanding it first." <words>277</words>

Marcus smiled, understanding now why Chen had hidden the key so carefully—not to x-out their isolation, but to draw them together. <words>296</words>

As responses flooded in from gardens across the sprawling metropolis, Marcus felt the network's pulse synchronizing with his own heartbeat. <words>313</words>

They were no longer overlooked children scattered across the vertical city, but a family of gardeners whose roots ran deeper than concrete and steel. <words>333</words>

The neon lights below seemed less harsh now, filtered through the knowledge that seventeen other souls shared his vigil above the sleeping city. <words>353</words>

Marcus carefully locked the panel and returned to his cyber-cherry tree, no longer speaking to plants but to friends who finally heard him. <words>373</words>

In finding connection in this disconnected world, he'd discovered that the most overlooked children often grew into the most essential guardians. <words>390</words>

The garden hummed with new purpose, its digital fruits glowing brighter in the endless neon night. <words>404</words>
