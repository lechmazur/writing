Elara pressed her face against the cold glass wall of the clifftop observatory, watching the tide patterns with the fervent indifference of someone who had lost everything pursuing perfection. <words>28</words> The sapped herbalist had once been renowned for her ability to predict the ocean's moods, but years of relentless study had drained her passion while leaving her obsession intact. <words>56</words>

The blacksmith's bellows wheezed beside her makeshift bed, a peculiar contraption she'd salvaged from the village below to circulate the salty air through her glass sanctuary. <words>80</words> She had been napping fitfully when the lone goose's cry pierced her dreams, its flight path cutting directly across her view of the churning waters. <words>104</words>

Following the bird's trajectory with thoughtfully thoughtless precision, Elara traced its route across her charts, noting how it seemed to anticipate the tide's turn by exactly seventeen minutes. <words>131</words> This was the kind of detail that had consumed her life, the pursuit of perfect prediction that had cost her friendships, health, and the simple joy she once found in her craft. <words>160</words>

The price of perfection, she mused, watching the goose disappear into the morning mist, was the very thing she had sought to cherish: the mysterious dance between earth and sea. <words>187</words> Her herbs lay withered in their jars, neglected while she obsessed over tidal mathematics and lunar calculations. <words>203</words> The bellows exhaled another labored breath, reminding her of her own exhaustion. <words>216</words>

Yet even as she recognized her folly, Elara found herself reaching for her pen, recording the goose's timing with mechanical devotion. <words>233</words> The ocean below crashed against the cliff with perfect indifference to her studies, following patterns far more complex than her charts could capture. <words>252</words> She had sacrificed her intuitive understanding for rigid measurement, trading wisdom for data. <words>265</words>

The tide was turning now, just as the goose had predicted, seventeen minutes before her calculations suggested it should. <words>282</words> Elara set down her pen and pressed both palms against the glass, feeling the vibrations of the waves through the transparent barrier that separated her from the world she studied. <words>308</words> 

In pursuing perfect knowledge of the tides, she had become like her observatory: transparent, isolated, and ultimately hollow. <words>325</words> The bellows wheezed again, and she realized with sudden clarity that some mysteries were meant to be experienced, not solved. <words>344</words> The lone goose had known what she had forgotten in her fervent indifference to everything except precision. <words>360</words>

As sleep threatened to claim her again, Elara made a choice that felt both thoughtlessly impulsive and deeply considered. <words>377</words> Tomorrow, she would leave the glass walls behind and return to the village, where imperfect herbs still held more wisdom than perfect charts. <words>398</words> The tide would turn without her watching. <words>405</words>
