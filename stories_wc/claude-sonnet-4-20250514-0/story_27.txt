Eleanor had been cursed for three decades to speak only truth, a burden that made her the most unwelcome fortune teller at Willowbrook's abandoned amusement park. <words>24</words> She sat in the decrepit prize booth, surrounded by dust-covered stuffed animals and the gentle creaking of rusted carnival rides swaying in the evening breeze. <words>45</words> Through her vintage pencil box—inherited from her grandmother who had possessed the same terrible gift—she read the threads of fate that connected all living things. <words>66</words> The box contained not pencils, but fragments of crystallized moonlight that revealed the tapestry of destiny when properly arranged. <words>82</words>

Marcus approached hesitantly, binoculars hanging around his neck from his morning bird watching expedition in the nearby woods. <words>97</words> "I've heard you can see futures," he said, though his voice carried the weight of someone who had stopped believing in possibilities years ago. <words>117</words> Eleanor smiled with politely vindictive satisfaction—another stagnant soul seeking easy answers rather than difficult growth. <words>130</words> "You wish to provoke evolution in your own mind," she stated truthfully, opening the pencil box to reveal the glowing fragments within. <words>147</words>

"That's... oddly specific," Marcus admitted, lowering himself onto the splintered wooden stool across from her booth. <words>162</words> Eleanor began arranging the crystallized moonlight according to the current lunar phase—waning gibbous, perfect for revelations that would shatter comfortable illusions. <words>179</words> "Your stagnation isn't circumstantial," she continued, unable to soften her words despite the kindness in her voice. <words>194</words> "You've spent fifteen years cataloging birds because observing life feels safer than living it." <words>207</words>

The moonlight fragments began to shimmer, weaving themselves into a luminous tapestry that hovered between them. <words>220</words> Marcus watched, transfixed, as golden threads revealed the interconnected web of choices and consequences that had led him to this moment. <words>237</words> "You're afraid that truly engaging with the world will petrify you into something you can't control," Eleanor observed, her curse forcing her to voice his deepest fears. <words>257</words>

Within the glowing tapestry, Marcus saw himself as he truly was—not a detached observer, but a vital thread whose withdrawal had left gaps in the lives of others. <words>279</words> A former student who had needed his encouragement, a colleague who had sought his friendship, a sister who had wanted his presence at her wedding. <words>299</words> The revelation struck him with the gentle force of moonlight piercing fog. <words>311</words>

"The curse shows me that your evolution begins tomorrow," Eleanor said, closing the pencil box as the tapestry dissolved into silver mist. <words>328</words> "You'll stop hiding behind your binoculars and start seeing yourself as clearly as you see those birds." <words>343</words> Marcus nodded slowly, understanding that truth—even when delivered with polite vindictiveness—was sometimes the greatest gift. <words>357</words> As he walked away, Eleanor felt the familiar bittersweet tranquility that came with watching someone choose growth over safety. <words>374</words> The abandoned amusement park settled into deeper silence, its ghosts whispering approval of another soul awakened to its own potential. <words>392</words> Tomorrow, the moon would enter its new phase, and with it, Marcus would begin his transformation. <words>407</words>
