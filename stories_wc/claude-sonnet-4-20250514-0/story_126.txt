Marcus had traded in stellar commodities before the ecological collapse, but now he drifted through the abandoned Kepler Station like a shipwrecked merchant surveying worthless cargo. <words>24</words>

The observation deck stretched before him, its massive viewport revealing Earth's barren surface where the last tree had fallen three months ago. <words>43</words>

Corporate propaganda still flickered on deteriorating screens, promising green futures that would never come. <words>56</words>

He approached the peeling travel poster with aloof fascination—"Visit New Eden Colony!"—its edges curling like dying leaves. <words>71</words>

The honestly strange thing wasn't that he'd found a rustic butter churn floating in the station's hydroponics bay; it was that someone had carved rebellious sparks of graffiti into its wooden surface. <words>97</words>

"THEY LIED ABOUT EVERYTHING," read one message. <words>104</words>

Marcus traced the words with calloused fingers, feeling the passionate anger of whoever had wielded the carving tool. <words>119</words>

The grand illusion had been perfect—humanity expanding across stars while Earth flourished eternally. <words>132</words>

Now he understood why someone had brought this ancient artifact to space: to remember what abundance actually meant. <words>147</words>

His motivation crystallized like ice forming in vacuum. <words>154</words>

To shatter the grand illusion, he needed to ascend beyond corporate lies. <words>165</words>

Marcus began peeling away the poster's flaking edges, revealing the station's original blueprint underneath. <words>177</words>

The ghost station had been designed as an agricultural research facility, not the mining depot the corporations claimed. <words>193</words>

Each torn fragment revealed more deception—hidden gardens, seed vaults, atmospheric processors that could have saved Earth. <words>208</words>

The butter churn suddenly made perfect sense. <words>215</words>

Someone had known the truth, had smuggled this symbol of sustainable living aboard as evidence. <words>229</words>

Marcus felt rebellious sparks igniting within his chest as he continued his methodical destruction of the propaganda. <words>244</words>

Below, Earth's dead oceans reflected starlight like a massive gravestone. <words>253</words>

But the blueprint showed atmospheric generation capabilities that still functioned. <words>262</words>

The station's observation deck offered the perfect broadcast platform to transmit the hidden schematics across the colonial networks. <words>278</words>

Marcus cradled the butter churn, its wooden surface warm against his palms. <words>289</words>

Through the honestly strange alchemy of hope and fury, this simple tool had become his weapon against corporate mythology. <words>305</words>

He would ascend via the flaking edges of their lies, piece by piece, until truth emerged. <words>320</words>

The last tree had fallen, but the seeds of rebellion still germinated in forgotten corners. <words>334</words>

Marcus activated the station's dormant communication array, his shipwrecked dreams transforming into revolutionary purpose. <words>346</words>

As the blueprints transmitted across space, he carved his own message into the churn's surface with passionate aloofness: "The garden remembers." <words>363</words>

Earth might be dead, but the grand illusion would shatter tonight. <words>373</words>

Humanity would finally learn what they had truly lost, and perhaps, what they might still reclaim among the stars. <words>389</words>

The ghost station hummed with unexpected life as truth ascended through the digital darkness. <words>402</words>
