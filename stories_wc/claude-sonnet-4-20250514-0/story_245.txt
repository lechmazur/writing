Kex's boots pounded against the cracked duracrete of the abandoned spaceport flight deck, her morning jog echoing through the skeletal remains of what once bustled with interstellar traffic. <words>26</words> The irate smuggler clutched a single chopstick in her weathered hand, the ivory utensil worn smooth from decades of use aboard cargo ships that no longer existed. <words>48</words> Her heart hammered not just from exertion, but from the revolt brewing within—twenty years of hauling contraband across the galaxy, and for what? <words>68</words>

She'd come here seeking something the corporate overlords had stolen from every civilized world: hidden waterfalls, those secret places where water still fell freely without permits or taxation. <words>91</words> The old stories spoke of such places existing in the deep ruins, where collapsed infrastructure created unexpected cascades. <words>107</words>

Pausing beside a rusted fuel depot, Kex pulled out her battered thermos and poured steaming tea into its cap. <words>124</words> The liquid swirled, leaves dancing in patterns that seemed to mock her desperate search. <words>137</words> She'd learned this divination technique from a Martian mystic—reading futures in tea leaves, though today she sought only the past. <words>154</words>

The chopstick stirred the tea with practiced precision, each movement abstractly physical, more ritual than function. <words>168</words> Her grandfather had carved this chopstick from Earth bamboo before the exodus, before the corporations claimed every natural resource. <words>184</words> As the leaves settled, she saw it—a pattern resembling cascading water, pointing toward the spaceport's lower levels. <words>200</words>

"Damn it all," she whispered with biting sincerity, her voice cracking with years of suppressed longing. <words>214</words> The tea leaves never lied, but they demanded she venture deeper into the abandoned station's bowels where security drones still patrolled. <words>231</words>

Kex resumed her jog, descending through corroded maintenance shafts, following the invisible trail the leaves had revealed. <words>246</words> Her heart's revolt against a lifetime of cynicism grew stronger with each footfall. <words>258</words> She needed to memorialize something pure, something untouched by the greed that had poisoned the stars. <words>273</words>

Deep beneath the flight deck, she heard it—the unmistakable sound of falling water. <words>286</words> Following the echo through a blast door hanging askew, she discovered a natural spring bubbling up through fractured foundation, spilling into a crystal pool twenty feet below. <words>309</words> Overhead pipes had burst decades ago, creating an accidental waterfall in this forgotten sanctuary. <words>322</words>

Kex knelt beside the makeshift cascade, her chopstick trembling in arthritic fingers. <words>333</words> She etched crude symbols into the dust—coordinates, her grandfather's name, a prayer for forgiveness. <words>347</words> Here, in this hidden place where water fell without permission, she would remember what it meant to be human. <words>365</words> The smuggler's hardened heart finally found its revolution, not in violence or theft, but in the simple act of witnessing beauty the corporations couldn't commodify. <words>384</words> She sat in meditation as her tea grew cold, the chopstick resting across her palms like an offering to the water spirits who had guided her home to herself. <words>409</words>
