Ezra plucked his lute strings with dismayed fingers, the melody dying in the black velvet sky-lounge suspended impossibly above the endless city below. <words>21</words> His broken watch band dangled from his wrist like a metallic question mark, marking time that had lost all meaning in this floating paradise. <words>42</words> The lounge's patrons drifted between conversations and cocktails, blissfully unaware that their sanctuary existed because someone had drawn boundaries around their pleasure. <words>62</words>

"Another song about heartbreak?" laughed Celeste, the lounge's owner, her voice carrying that laconic exuberance that made everything sound both profound and absurd. <words>81</words> She scattered old polaroid photographs across his table like tarot cards, each image capturing moments from the gardens hidden within the city's endless sprawl. <words>103</words>

Ezra studied the photographs methodically, searching for patterns amid garden secrets that might explain why he felt so trapped in paradise. <words>122</words> Each polaroid revealed fragments: couples stealing kisses behind rose trellises, children chasing fireflies through hedge mazes, elderly gardeners tending plots that bloomed impossibly bright against the urban decay. <words>146</words> The images seemed subjectively rational to him—they made sense only because he desperately needed them to. <words>163</words>

"You're trying to excavate meaning from snapshots," Celeste observed, refilling his glass with something that tasted like starlight and regret. <words>181</words> "But meanings are like melodies—they exist in the spaces between notes." <words>193</words>

Ezra's fingers traced the photographs' edges, mapping connections between garden havens scattered throughout the metropolis below. <words>209</words> Each garden represented someone's attempt to draw boundaries against the city's relentless expansion, creating pockets of green sanity amid concrete madness. <words>228</words> The broken watch band slipped further down his wrist as he worked, time becoming irrelevant to his growing obsession. <words>246</words>

"I'm drawing a map of an endless night," he murmured, arranging polaroids into constellation patterns that mirrored the city's layout. <words>264</words> The gardens formed a secret network, connected by invisible threads of human longing for beauty and peace. <words>280</words> His lute sang softly as he moved, each note helping him understand the boundaries that people created not to keep others out, but to preserve something precious within. <words>307</words>

Celeste watched him work with knowing eyes, recognizing the precise moment when dismay transformed into discovery. <words>322</words> "Every boundary tells a story," she said, "and every story needs its minstrel." <words>336</words>

Ezra smiled, finally understanding why fate had broken his watch band and stranded him in this sky-lounge. <words>352</words> Time meant nothing when you were mapping eternity, excavating hope from polaroid memories, and learning that the most important boundaries were the ones drawn around love itself. <words>376</words> His music filled the velvet darkness, carrying the secrets of hidden gardens to anyone brave enough to listen. <words>394</words> The endless night suddenly felt navigable, each note a coordinate on his impossible map. <words>408</words>
