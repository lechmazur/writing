Marcus shuffled through the glass corridors of Neptune Station, his clerk uniform wrinkled from another eighteen-hour shift cataloging marine specimens, when the intercom crackled with an invitation to the monthly trivia night in the observation dome. <words>35</words>

He clutched his father's vintage stamp collection, the only possession that brought him comfort in this undersea greenhouse perched on the coral plateau, where bioluminescent kelp swayed in manufactured currents. <words>62</words>

The stamps bore images from a dozen worlds—Mars colonies, Europa outposts, distant systems—each one absolutely relative to the observer's frame of reference, shifting subtly when viewed from different angles due to quantum printing techniques. <words>92</words>

Dr. Kepler, the station's lead researcher, noticed Marcus examining the stamps during trivia night's intermission. <words>107</words>

"Those aren't ordinary stamps," she observed with dissonant calm, her voice steady despite the urgency Marcus detected beneath. <words>124</words>

"My father collected them before the plague," Marcus replied, watching angelfish drift past the dome's transparent walls. <words>140</words>

"The Dimensional Fever?" <words>143</words>

Marcus nodded, remembering how victims began weaving between worlds involuntarily, their consciousness scattered across parallel realities until they simply faded away. <words>162</words>

Dr. Kepler's eyes widened as she recognized the quantum signatures embedded in the stamp matrix. <words>176</words>

"These stamps contain navigation data," she whispered, her scientific composure cracking. <words>186</words>

"The cure exists in a parallel timeline where the plague never developed, but we need to quantize the dimensional coordinates precisely." <words>204</words>

In the ephemeral pause of a breath, Marcus understood why fate had brought his father's collection to this moment. <words>221</words>

The other trivia participants continued their game, oblivious to the revelation unfolding beside them. <words>235</words>

"The stamps show locations where dimensional barriers are thinnest," Dr. Kepler explained, her fingers tracing the shifting images. <words>251</words>

"Your father wasn't just a collector—he was mapping escape routes between realities." <words>264</words>

Marcus felt the weight of his mundane existence transform into purpose as coral gardens pulsed with bioluminescent rhythms around them. <words>281</words>

"The greenhouse's quantum field generators could amplify the stamps' navigation properties," she continued, hope threading through her voice. <words>298</words>

"We could breach the dimensional membrane and retrieve the cure." <words>308</words>

Through the dome's curved glass, deep-sea creatures moved in ancient patterns, their existence absolutely relative to the pressure and darkness of their world. <words>328</words>

Marcus realized his father had always intended these stamps for this moment, this choice between accepting his overburdened life or weaving between worlds to save countless others. <words>351</words>

"The trivia night question about parallel universes wasn't random, was it?" Marcus asked, understanding dawning. <words>366</words>

Dr. Kepler smiled, her dissonant calm finally revealing its true nature—controlled desperation wrapped in scientific precision. <words>381</words>

"Nothing here is random," she replied as bioluminescent kelp began responding to the stamps' quantum resonance. <words>396</words>

"Shall we begin?" <words>399</words>
