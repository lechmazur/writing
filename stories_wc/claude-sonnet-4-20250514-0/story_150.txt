Ezra "Dead Shot" McKinnon adjusted his brass goggles and studied the shifting text crawling across the copper-plated walls of the Celestial Café. <words>19</words> The outlaw cowboy poet had fled here to the steampunk observatory dome after his latest heist, seeking refuge among the gears and steam pipes that hummed beneath the massive telescope overhead. <words>44</words>

For three days now, during the astronomers' rehearsals for the Grand Conjunction viewing, the café's walls had been displaying an ever-changing tapestry of words and symbols that seemed to respond to his presence. <words>72</words> Today, as he sipped his bitter coffee, new text materialized: "The bones remember what the stars forget." <words>87</words>

Ezra's weathered hand instinctively moved to the worn runic bone dice hanging from his belt—his grandmother's dying gift, carved from the vertebrae of an ancient bison. <words>108</words> She'd whispered they would guide him to his destiny, though he'd always figured destiny was just another word for trouble. <words>126</words>

The wall text shifted again: "Two paths converge when courage misaligns with wisdom." <words>138</words> 

A peculiar chill ran down his spine as footsteps echoed on the observatory's spiral staircase. <words>151</words> Dr. Evangeline Thorne, the dome's chief astronomer, emerged from the shadows, her own brass instruments glinting in the gaslight. <words>168</words>

"You've been reading my walls," she said, her voice carrying that saturated ambivalence he'd grown to recognize—part accusation, part invitation. <words>186</words>

"They ain't exactly giving me a choice, Doc," Ezra replied, rolling the bone dice between his fingers. <words>202</words> "Been changing every time I look away, like they're trying to tell me something." <words>216</words>

Evangeline approached, her eyes fixed on the dice with an intensity that made him virtually peculiar uncomfortable. <words>231</words> "Those markings... they're not Lakota, are they?" <words>239</words>

The wall text suddenly blazed with new words: "When the outlaw's bones speak to the star-reader's equations, destinies intertwine." <words>256</words>

Ezra felt the dice grow warm in his palm as Evangeline pulled out a leather journal filled with astronomical calculations that mirrored the runic patterns perfectly. <words>277</words> "I've been tracking celestial movements for months, trying to solve why the observatory's clockwork keeps misaligning," she whispered. <words>294</words>

"And I've been running from something I didn't understand," he admitted, finally seeing the connection that had drawn him here. <words>311</words>

The rehearsals below grew quiet as the astronomers gathered, their instruments trained on the approaching conjunction. <words>325</words> Evangeline's calculations and his grandmother's bones had led them both to this moment, this place, this shared purpose that sparked an unstoppable curiosity about what lay beyond their separate worlds. <words>349</words>

As the great telescope rotated above them with mechanical precision, Ezra cast the dice onto the café table. <words>366</words> They landed showing symbols that perfectly aligned with Evangeline's star charts, revealing coordinates for a celestial event that would change everything. <words>383</words>

"Reckon we're about to find out what destiny really looks like," Ezra murmured, watching the wall text settle into its final message: "The conjunction begins now." <words>404</words>
