Ezequiel had spent forty years diligently whimsical in his work, transforming the ancient Aztec temple grounds into something between cemetery and sacred space. <words>21</words> The stepped pyramids now housed modern graves, their stone faces carved with both pre-Columbian glyphs and contemporary headstones. <words>37</words> As the steady gravedigger of this reimagined necropolis, he understood that some places existed where worlds naturally overlapped. <words>53</words>

The vintage magnifying glass had belonged to his predecessor, its brass rim worn smooth by decades of examining ritual artifacts unearthed during burials. <words>72</words> Through its lens, Ezequiel could see the shimmer where ancient ceremonies bled into present mourning, where Aztec priests' chants echoed beneath modern funeral prayers. <words>92</words>

"I've been seeing them," whispered Maria Santos, the museum curator who oversaw the site's archaeological integrity. <words>106</words> Her sudden confession hung in the air like incense as wind passed through the broken fence line that separated the sacred grounds from the bustling city. <words>128</words> In the hush that followed her admission, Ezequiel felt the familiar weight of keeper's responsibility. <words>142</words>

"The priests," she continued, her voice barely audible above the raucous silence that characterized this place where traffic noise merged with phantom drum beats. <words>162</words> "They're performing rituals at dawn, moving between the graves like they're tending to both the ancient and newly dead." <words>179</words>

Ezequiel nodded, unsurprised. <words>182</words> He had long ago learned to kindrelize with these spectral guardians, acknowledging their presence with small offerings of tobacco and careful preservation of their ceremonial paths. <words>202</words> The vintage magnifying glass revealed what others couldn't see: the careful choreography of two burial traditions dancing together across centuries. <words>219</words>

"They're not haunting," he explained gently, settling beside a headstone carved with both Spanish epitaph and Nahuatl blessing. <words>234</words> "They're teaching us to preserve ritual practices that honor both worlds." <words>245</words> Through the broken fence, wind carried the distant sound of traffic mixed with something that might have been obsidian flutes. <words>264</words>

Maria watched as Ezequiel held up the magnifying glass, its surface catching the morning light filtering through the temple's ancient stones. <words>281</words> "What do you see?" <words>286</words>

"Continuity," he replied, his diligently whimsical nature finding joy even in this solemn revelation. <words>298</words> "The priests aren't ghostsâ€”they're gardeners, same as me." <words>308</words> He gestured toward the graves that dotted the pyramid's terraces like carefully tended flowers. <words>321</words> "They know that sacred ground doesn't stop being sacred just because time passes." <words>334</words>

In the raucous silence that followed, filled with the whispered conversations between two worlds, Maria finally understood why this steady gravedigger had never seemed troubled by his unusual workplace. <words>356</words> The broken fence line sang with wind that carried blessings across centuries, and the vintage magnifying glass reflected not just light, but the eternal dance of those who tend the dead with loving hands. <words>381</words> Here, where worlds overlapped, preservation meant honoring every ritual, ancient and modern alike. <words>394</words>
