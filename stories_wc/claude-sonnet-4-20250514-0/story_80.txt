Marcus traced the rusted rails with trembling fingers, his weathered journal clutched against his chest like a prayer book. <words>18</words> The abandoned roller coaster stretched into fog-shrouded darkness, its skeletal frame twisted into impossible geometries that defied the laws of physics he'd once trusted. <words>40</words> He was a pathfinder by trade, daring enough to venture where maps ended, but ingeniously clueless about the supernatural forces that had drawn him to this place. <words>64</words>

The antique brass doorknob in his coat pocket grew warm as he walked, its ornate surface etched with symbols that seemed to shift between page turns of his research notes. <words>89</words> For months, he'd investigated bizarre housekeeping logs from haunted inns across three continents, each entry describing the same impossible phenomenon: rooms that cleaned themselves, beds that made themselves, and always, always, mention of a missing piece. <words>121</words>

The last fragment. <words>124</words>

His obsession bordered on quiet mania, a methodical madness that had consumed his savings, his relationships, his sanity. <words>140</words> The riddle was older than time itself, whispered in Sumerian tablets and Viking runes: "When the final door opens where tracks meet sky, the broken circle shall complete." <words>164</words>

Marcus stumbled over a loose rail tie, catching himself against a support beam that hummed with otherworldly energy. <words>180</words> The metal beneath his palm began to erode, flaking away like ancient parchment, revealing crystalline structures that pulsed with inner light. <words>199</words> He understood now why the housekeeping logs had led him here, why every abandoned inn had pointed toward this impossible place where gravity bent and time folded. <words>224</words>

At the track's highest point, suspended impossibly in midair, hung a doorframe without walls. <words>238</words> The doorknob grew scorching hot in his pocket, demanding release. <words>249</words> With shaking hands, Marcus fitted the antique brass into the waiting keyhole, feeling centuries of accumulated purpose flow through his fingertips. <words>268</words>

The door swung open onto starlight and singing winds. <words>277</words> Through the portal, he glimpsed the cosmic truth that had eluded humanity's greatest minds: reality was merely the largest haunted inn of all, and someone had been keeping meticulous housekeeping logs of every soul that passed through its infinite rooms. <words>310</words>

As the last fragment clicked into place, the roller coaster track began to move, carrying him not down but up, through dimensions that folded like pages in an endless book. <words>335</words> The riddle older than time whispered its answer in his ear as stars wheeled overhead and the abandoned became eternal. <words>353</words> Marcus laughed with quiet mania, finally understanding that he wasn't the pathfinder at allâ€”he was simply the final entry in a housekeeping log that spanned universes, and his ingenious cluelessness had been the key all along. <words>383</words> The track carried him home to rooms that had been waiting since time began, where every door opened and every circle closed. <words>403</words>
