Ezra adjusted his weathered mandolin case and stepped onto the rooftop stable of Tower Seventeen, where genetically-enhanced pegasi grazed on synthetic clouds beneath the perpetual noon of New Eden's artificial sky. <words>30</words>

The lonesome minstrel had inherited more than just his grandfather's instrument—he'd also inherited the old man's bitter feud with the Castellanos family, though neither could remember what sparked the generations-old rivalry. <words>59</words>

"You're late," called Mira Castellanos from beside her prize stallion, its silver wings folding as she dismounted. <words>76</words>

"Coffee lines were bizarrely typical today," Ezra replied, setting down his case near the stable's edge where morning commuters still queued forty stories below. <words>96</words>

They had been meeting here for months now, ostensibly to bicker about territorial disputes over busking spots, but really to pursue their shared obsession with reading the silent cosmos through cloud formations. <words>124</words>

Mira pulled out a rubber stamp from her jacket pocket, its image unclear from decades of use—her great-grandmother's tool for marking astronomical observations. <words>145</words>

"The cirrus patterns shifted again," she said, pointing to the eastern quadrant where artificial weather systems painted messages across the sky. <words>163</words>

Ezra nodded, his trained eye tracking cloud patterns that most citizens ignored in their rush to virtual offices and synthetic experiences. <words>181</words>

"Your family always did miss the obvious signs," he muttered, though his tone carried more affection than animosity. <words>198</words>

They stood together in mundane enchantment, watching mechanical birds guide cumulus formations into ancient symbols that spoke of stellar alignments and cosmic intentions. <words>219</words>

"We should be enemies," Mira whispered, pressing the rubber stamp against her observation journal, leaving its mysterious mark beside her sketches. <words>238</words>

"We are enemies," Ezra said softly, tuning his mandolin to the frequency of solar winds. <words>253</words>

But as the rooftop horses nickered and the city hummed below, their inherited rivalries felt as artificial as the weather above. <words>271</words>

The clouds shifted again, forming constellations that their ancestors had tracked for centuries, and suddenly the grudge that had defined their bloodlines seemed as unclear as the image on Mira's rubber stamp. <words>299</words>

"Maybe," Ezra suggested, strumming a chord that harmonized with the wind through the pegasi's wings, "we could try being bizarrely typical enemies who occasionally share the same sky." <words>326</words>

Mira smiled, stamping her journal one final time as the clouds spelled out coordinates to a distant nebula. <words>344</words>

"I suppose even enemies can bicker about the same cosmic poetry," she agreed. <words>357</words>

Together, they watched the city's coffee lines dissolve as artificial twilight approached, their rivalry transformed into something strange and wonderful—a mundane enchantment written in rubber stamps and cloud patterns across the endless sky of their futuristic world. <words>391</words>

The silent cosmos had spoken, and for once, two feuding families had listened to the same song. <words>407</words>
