Kael pressed his weathered palm against the barnacle-crusted council chamber doors, feeling the phantom hand of his grandmother guide him through the flooded corridors of New Atlantica's city hall. <words>26</words>

The wandering orchardist had traveled countless dimensions seeking this moment, his leather satchel heavy with dried leaves collected from fruit trees across infinite realities. <words>47</words>

Each leaf held memories of trade routes that once connected worlds before the great submersion, knowledge his grandmother had whispered to him during late nights at their kitchen table. <words>72</words>

"Trust what others cannot see," she had said, her phantom touch still guiding his steps through the underwater ruins where bioluminescent algae cast eerie shadows on waterlogged filing cabinets. <words>98</words>

Kael's unique ability to commune with the dead had made him trustworthy among dimension-hoppers, though the gift came with the bittersweet burden of never truly being alone. <words>122</words>

The council chamber's oak table, somehow preserved beneath layers of sediment and sea growth, called to him with ancient authority. <words>140</words>

He spread his collection of dried leaves across its surface, each specimen representing a crucial junction where interdimensional commerce had once flourished. <words>160</words>

The phantom hand of his grandmother pressed against his shoulder as he began arranging the leaves according to patterns she had taught him, creating a map that transcended physical space. <words>186</words>

Apple leaves from Earth-7 connected to cherry blossoms from the Sakura Dimension, while pomegranate fragments traced paths through the Desert Realms where merchant caravans had carried goods between realities. <words>213</words>

His motivation burned fierce and grittyâ€”to reclaim these lost trade routes and restore prosperity to isolated worlds that had forgotten how to reach beyond their boundaries. <words>237</words>

The wisdom learned at his grandmother's kitchen table had prepared him for this moment when science and intuition would merge beneath the crushing weight of an ocean that existed in all dimensions simultaneously. <words>267</words>

As Kael's fingers traced the leaf patterns, the phantom hand guided him to a final placement that completed the map, revealing pathways through space-time that corporate explorers had deemed impossible. <words>291</words>

The bioluminescent algae pulsed brighter, responding to energies unleashed by the completed arrangement, and Kael felt the familiar tug of dimensional currents that would carry him to his next destination. <words>316</words>

He carefully gathered his leaves, knowing that somewhere across the multiverse, traders would soon follow routes that had been lost for generations. <words>335</words>

The phantom hand squeezed his shoulder one final time before fading, leaving him alone with the weight of responsibility and the bitter satisfaction of duty fulfilled. <words>359</words>

Kael sealed his satchel and swam upward through the chamber's broken ceiling, emerging into the infinite darkness between worlds where his grandmother's kitchen table wisdom would guide countless others home. <words>383</words>

Behind him, the forgotten city hall settled deeper into its oceanic grave, having served its purpose in the grand tapestry of interdimensional commerce that connected all possible worlds. <words>407</words>
