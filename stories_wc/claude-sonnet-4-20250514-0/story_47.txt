Mira had always been the dutiful ward, tending to the ancient opera house's forgotten corners while prima donnas rehearsed above. <words>19</words> She was eagerly jaded at seventeen, having witnessed enough backstage betrayals to fill a thousand tragic arias. <words>35</words> But today, something different stirred in the soundless sanctuary of the basement archives, where discarded costumes hung like ghosts. <words>52</words>

The worn leather glove lay forgotten among the props, its cracked surface whispering of performances past. <words>66</words> As auditions raged overhead, Mira discovered it wasn't merely costume debris—it was evidence. <words>78</words>

Three singers had vanished during auditions over the decades, their disappearances dismissed as artistic temperament. <words>91</words> But Mira had been solving a pattern, reframing the familiar tragedy as something more sinister. <words>104</words> The glove belonged to Madame Corvina, the house's legendary vocal coach who'd supposedly died twenty years ago. <words>119</words>

Mira's investigation had begun with stolen phones, lifted from visiting directors and aging performers. <words>131</words> Hidden in their devices, she'd found cryptic voice notes—fragments of coaching sessions that revealed Corvina's survival. <words>145</words> The recordings painted a grotesque picture: the old woman had been culling voices, literally stealing them through some arcane ritual performed during auditions. <words>163</words>

Today's audition brought fresh prey—a young tenor whose voice could resurrect angels. <words>174</words> Mira clutched the glove, feeling its supernatural warmth as footsteps echoed above. <words>185</words> She understood now why the basement remained so unnaturally quiet; it absorbed stolen songs, hoarding them like a miser's treasure. <words>201</words>

Throughout the auditions, Mira had watched patterns emerge—how certain singers would descend these stairs for "private coaching" and never resurface. <words>218</words> Their voices would later emanate from the walls themselves, trapped in this soundless sanctuary that fed Corvina's immortality. <words>233</words>

But Mira possessed something the ancient predator hadn't anticipated: a willingness to offer a final, fearless laugh at mortality itself. <words>249</words> She'd spent years as the overlooked ward, invisible to those who wielded beauty and talent as weapons. <words>264</words> Now she would reframe this familiar story of victim and predator. <words>274</words>

As the tenor's voice soared overhead, Mira donned the worn glove and felt Corvina's essence flow through her fingers. <words>290</words> The old woman had made one crucial error—she'd never considered that a dutiful ward might possess the greatest hunger of all. <words>306</words>

The basement's graceless beauty revealed itself as Mira absorbed not just the tenor's voice, but every stolen song within these walls. <words>323</words> Corvina's shocked scream joined the chorus as her centuries of hoarded voices flooded into her replacement. <words>337</words> The soundless sanctuary had found its new keeper—one who understood that true power lay not in perfect pitch, but in perfect patience. <words>355</words>

Above, the auditions continued, oblivious to the changing of the guard below. <words>366</words> Mira smiled with graceless beauty, her eagerly jaded heart now beating with a thousand stolen rhythms. <words>379</words> She would solve this house's hunger differently—not through theft, but through willing sacrifice from those who truly understood art's terrible price. <words>397</words> The familiar had been reframed, and mortality had lost its sting. <words>407</words>
