Sir Galwen traced his weathered finger across the astronomical map, its constellations unknowingly familiar despite years of wandering these desolate lands. <words>20</words> The earnest knight had carried this ancient chart through countless battles, never understanding why its star patterns stirred something deep within his memory. <words>40</words> Now, sheltering beneath the crumbling arches of a ruined aqueduct that stretched endlessly across the arid desert, he studied it with renewed purpose. <words>61</words>

Above him, the stone ceiling bore jagged tears where time and weather had carved openings to the sky. <words>77</words> Moonlight streamed through these gaps, casting silver patterns that made him pause in recognition. <words>91</words> The shapes matched his map perfectly—each hole aligned with a constellation he'd memorized but never truly seen. <words>106</words>

His quest had always been to spark flames in a land of ice, following prophetic words spoken by a dying oracle. <words>124</words> For months he'd wandered between mountain passes, seeking the frozen realm where his destiny awaited. <words>138</words> But tonight, something shifted in his understanding. <words>146</words>

Galwen remembered now—this very aqueduct from his childhood, when his grandfather would bring him here to study the stars. <words>163</words> The old man had called it "the canvas of life," where earthbound structures framed celestial wisdom. <words>177</words> His grandfather's voice echoed across decades: "When you map the tears in heaven's roof, you'll trigger the memory that guides you home." <words>196</words>

The crisp nostalgia of those summer nights washed over him as understanding crystallized. <words>208</words> This greenhouse-like structure, with its broken ceiling and desert-dry interior, wasn't merely shelter. <words>220</words> It was a massive astronomical instrument, designed to align earthly purpose with cosmic design. <words>233</words>

As clouds parted overhead, starlight poured through each carefully positioned opening. <words>244</words> The map in his hands began to glow with subtle warmth, its inked constellations responding to their celestial counterparts. <words>260</words> Galwen realized his grandfather hadn't just been teaching him astronomy—he'd been preparing him for this moment. <words>276</words>

The "land of ice" wasn't some distant frozen kingdom. <words>285</words> It was the cold emptiness in his own heart, the disconnection from his roots and purpose. <words>300</words> To spark flames meant to rekindle the passion and knowledge his grandfather had planted within him. <words>316</words>

Standing beneath the star-mapped ceiling, Galwen felt the familiar warmth of belonging. <words>327</words> His true quest wasn't geographic but spiritual—a journey back to the wisdom he'd carried unknowingly all along. <words>343</words> The astronomical map had been his grandfather's final gift, a guide not to distant lands but to the understanding that home existed wherever knowledge illuminated darkness. <words>366</words>

The knight smiled, finally comprehending that some journeys end where they began, with stars as eternal witnesses to the canvas of life unfolding beneath them. <words>386</words> Tomorrow he would continue onward, but no longer as a wanderer—as a guardian of celestial wisdom. <words>401</words>
