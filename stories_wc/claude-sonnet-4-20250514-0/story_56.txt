Marcus lazily adjusted the blank price tag on his jacket lapel, a habit from his days selling nonexistent heirlooms to tourists. <words>19</words>

The ancient computer terminal in the reclaimed orchard farmland—built inside what was once Manhattan's tallest skyscraper—finally flickered to life after hours of frozen silence. <words>41</words>

He needed access to the agricultural records, not for another con, but to expose the truth about the contaminated soil that the corporation had buried for decades. <words>65</words>

As he reached for the keyboard with characteristic sluggish energy, his worn copy of "Silent Spring" slipped from his tired fingers. <words>82</words>

The book tumbled down through the twisted metal beams where apple trees now grew impossibly tall, their roots having claimed the building's skeletal remains. <words>102</words>

"Careful," a voice called softly from behind him, and Marcus turned to see a woman emerging from between the fruit-laden branches, her clothes bearing the same blank price tags he'd noticed throughout the settlement. <words>129</words>

"You dropped this," she said, extending the book with calloused hands that spoke of honest labor, her tone carrying that particular gentleness reserved for delivering uncomfortable truths. <words>150</words>

"Dr. Elena Vasquez," she introduced herself, "and I know why you're here, Marcus." <words>162</words>

His practiced smile faltered—how did she know his real name? <words>172</words>

"The invisible network has been watching," she continued, gesturing toward the other workers who seemed to materialize from behind trees and twisted steel. <words>190</words>

"We've been documenting the contamination for years, waiting for someone with your particular skills to help us magnetize public attention." <words>206</words>

Marcus felt an unfamiliar weight settle in his chest—these people trusted him despite knowing his history. <words>220</words>

"The blank tags," he realized aloud, touching his lapel, "they're your signal system." <words>232</words>

Elena nodded, her expression carrying the harsh reality of their situation tempered by hope. <words>244</words>

"Each tag represents a family affected by the poisoned earth beneath our feet," she explained, leading him toward a hidden archive built into the building's old elevator shaft. <words>268</words>

"We've been too gentle, too patient with the authorities," she continued, her voice hardening slightly. <words>281</words>

"But your reputation for making people believe impossible things—that's exactly what we need." <words>293</words>

Marcus stared at the mountains of evidence, feeling his characteristic lethargy transform into something resembling purpose. <words>307</words>

For once, his talent for deception would serve something greater than his own survival. <words>320</words>

"They won't want to handle this truth," he warned, already formulating how to present the devastating data to a world that preferred comfortable lies. <words>340</words>

Elena smiled grimly, her invisible army of agricultural workers nodding their agreement. <words>351</words>

"Then we'll make them," she said, and Marcus finally understood that sometimes the greatest con is convincing people to face reality. <words>369</words>

The computer hummed steadily now, ready to broadcast their carefully documented proof to every news outlet simultaneously. <words>384</words>

As sunlight filtered through the corrupted paradise above them, Marcus prepared to pull off his most important swindle yet—making the world care about truth. <words>405</words>
