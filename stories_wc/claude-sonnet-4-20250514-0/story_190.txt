Kira pressed the headphones against her ears, listening to the painter's rambling confession as the anesthesia loosened his tongue in the medical wing of the drought prediction center. <words>26</words> The pressed butterfly bookmark fell from her worn notebook as she leaned forward, its delicate wings catching the fluorescent light. <words>44</words> She'd been smuggling these confessions out for months now, selling emotional intel to corporate empathy training programs, but something about this one felt different. <words>66</words>

"The music," the painter mumbled, his voice thick and distant, "it holds everything... every drought I've ever predicted, every failed harvest, every family that fled..." <words>88</words> Kira's fingers hesitated over her recording device, her usual cautious nature warring with an inexplicable urge to capture every word. <words>106</words> She was meticulously impulsive, planning each smuggling operation down to the minute while simultaneously chasing gut feelings that made no logical sense. <words>126</words>

The painter's memories spilled out in musical fragments—melodies that predicted rainfall patterns, harmonies that echoed in empty reservoirs. <words>142</words> "When I paint the weather maps," he whispered, "I hear my grandmother's lullabies in the storm systems, my father's funeral march in the pressure drops." <words>164</words> Kira found herself genuinely moved, despite her practiced emotional detachment. <words>173</words>

She'd started this work to master empathy, believing that understanding others' pain would make her a better smuggler, better at reading people, better at survival. <words>196</words> But listening to confession after confession had created an odd numbness—she felt everything and nothing simultaneously, enthusiastic about human connection yet apathetic about her own emotional responses. <words>220</words>

The butterfly bookmark reminded her of her first musical memory: her mother humming while pressing flowers, creating beauty from dying things. <words>239</words> Now she pressed memories instead, flattening them into data, selling them to corporations that packaged empathy like meteorological forecasts. <words>255</words>

"Can you predict love?" the painter asked suddenly, his eyes focusing on her with unexpected clarity. <words>270</words> "Can you smuggle hope the way you smuggle our secrets?" <words>281</words> Kira's hand trembled as she reached for the butterfly, realizing she'd become so focused on predicting human behavior that she'd forgotten how to simply feel it. <words>303</words>

The confession ended, but the musical memories lingered in the sterile air of the prediction center. <words>318</words> Kira carefully placed the butterfly back in her notebook, making a decision that surprised her cautious nature: this recording would stay private. <words>337</words> Some predictions were too precious to smuggle, some empathy too authentic to sell. <words>351</words> She removed her headphones, finally understanding that mastering empathy meant knowing when to stop extracting it from others and start cultivating it within herself. <words>371</words> The painter's musical memories had predicted something she hadn't expected: her own emotional drought was ending. <words>387</words> Outside, the first drops of unexpected rain began to fall. <words>397</words>
