Margot descended into the champagne vault beneath Paris with practiced indifference, clutching the fragment of stained-glass window she'd forgotten to leave upstairs. <words>21</words> The science fair above echoed through limestone walls as young innovators presented their final projects, their enthusiasm filtering down like dust. <words>39</words> She'd stumbled into this subterranean exhibition while foraging for urban treasures, drawn by the promise of discarded electronics from the student presentations. <words>57</words>

"Excusez-moi, you cannot be here," came a sharp voice from the shadows between towering wine racks. <words>71</words> A security guard emerged, his uniform crisp against the vault's ancient stonework. <words>83</words>

Margot sighed, her fingers absently tracing the glass fragment's medieval edges—a piece from the demolished Saint-Étienne chapel she'd rescued months ago. <words>101</words> "I was looking for the restroom," she lied with charming confusion, though her backpack clearly bulged with salvaged circuit boards. <words>119</words>

The guard's expression softened as he noticed her obvious disorientation. <words>129</words> "The facilities are three levels up, madame." <words>137</words>

"Right, yes, I always forget these old buildings," Margot murmured, then paused as light from his flashlight struck her glass fragment, casting rainbow patterns across dusty bottles. <words>158</words> The guard gasped—he recognized the distinctive azure and gold of Saint-Étienne's lost windows. <words>171</words>

"Where did you find this?" he whispered, his official demeanor cracking. <words>182</words>

Margot studied his face, recognizing something beyond mere curiosity. <words>191</words> "You know what it is." <words>197</words>

"My grandmother prayed beneath those windows for sixty years before they demolished the chapel," he said quietly. <words>212</words> "The city claimed nothing could be saved." <words>220</words>

Understanding flickered between them—two people protecting different kinds of heritage. <words>230</words> "I have seventeen more pieces," Margot offered, her usual detachment warming slightly. <words>242</words> "Hidden in various locations around the city." <words>250</words>

The guard glanced toward the stairs where his supervisor's footsteps approached. <words>261</words> "There's a cultural preservation society that's been fighting the city council," he said urgently. <words>274</words> "They've been searching for proof that artifacts survived." <words>283</words>

Margot nodded, finally comprehending the fragment's true value beyond mere urban archaeology. <words>294</words> "Meet me tomorrow at Marché aux Puces," she said, tucking the glass safely away. <words>307</words> "Stall forty-seven, around noon—well, afternoon, I tend to oversleep." <words>317</words>

Above them, a student's presentation concluded to thunderous applause. <words>326</words> The guard smiled, extending his hand. <words>333</words> "I'm Claude." <words>336</words>

"Margot," she replied, shaking it firmly. <words>343</words> "And Claude? Bring documentation about your grandmother's chapel—photos, anything." <words>352</words>

As she climbed toward the surface, Margot felt an unfamiliar sense of purpose. <words>364</words> Sometimes the most fragile wonders needed more than individual protection—they needed communities willing to remember. <words>378</words> Her foraging had accidentally bridged two worlds: preservation and progress, memory and innovation. <words>390</words> The glass fragment in her pocket seemed to pulse with renewed significance. <words>401</words>
