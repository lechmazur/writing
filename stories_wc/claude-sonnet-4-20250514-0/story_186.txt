Gideon adjusted his brass thermometer with trembling fingers, watching mercury climb as the crystal palace swayed beneath the great cavern's stalactites. <words>19</words>

The whimsical tinkerer had spent decades chronicling how the underground kingdom's temperature rose each year, documenting the slow death of their suspended world. <words>39</words>

Today, carnival fortune-tellers filled his workshop, their pop-up booths materializing like colorful mushrooms between his weather instruments and mechanical sculptures. <words>56</words>

"Your readings show truth, old man," said Madame Zelda, her painted smile oddly sincere. <words>69</words>

"But truth won't save us from what's coming." <words>77</words>

Gideon nodded, knowing she spoke honestly despite her charlatan's costume. <words>87</words>

The thermometer registered another degree higher—the palace's ice anchors were melting faster now. <words>100</words>

He picked up his sculpting tools, beginning to carve the day's temperature reading into a growing timeline of warming metal. <words>118</words>

Each mark represented another step toward their inevitable fall into the abyss below. <words>130</words>

"Why do you keep recording when we're all doomed?" asked a young fortune-teller, genuinely curious. <words>144</words>

Gideon's hands moved steadily, sculpting numbers with practical precision while the palace creaked ominously overhead. <words>158</words>

"Because someone should witness," he replied, his voice carrying the weight of accumulated years. <words>171</words>

"Someone should remember how it felt the moment everything changed." <words>181</words>

The brass thermometer caught afternoon light filtering through crystal walls, its mercury dancing like liquid fire. <words>195</words>

Around him, the fortune-tellers began their readings, their mystical performances creating an atmosphere of practical illusion—everyone pretending normalcy while catastrophe approached. <words>213</words>

Gideon understood their charade; hope required such theatrical denial sometimes. <words>223</words>

His sculpture grew beneath his hands, each carved line a brushstroke painting their civilization's final portrait. <words>237</words>

The moment his chisel first met metal marked both beginning and ending—the start of artistic creation and acknowledgment of approaching mortality. <words>255</words>

"The spirits say we have three days," whispered Madame Zelda, reading her cards with unusual gravity. <words>269</words>

Gideon checked his thermometer again, calculating ice-melt rates with engineer's efficiency. <words>280</words>

"Two days," he corrected gently, adding another precise mark to his metal chronicle. <words>293</words>

The palace shuddered, stalactite anchors groaning under increasing strain as ancient ice surrendered to inexorable heat. <words>307</words>

Fellow tinkerers and fortune-tellers worked side by side now, practical science blending with mystical comfort as they faced their shared fate. <words>324</words>

Gideon's hands never stopped moving, sculpting humanity's last testimony into brass and steel while temperature readings climbed toward their final threshold. <words>342</words>

The thermometer's mercury seemed to pulse like a heartbeat, measuring not just heat but time itself running out. <words>358</words>

Yet still he carved, documenting environmental truth with artist's devotion, ensuring their story would survive even if they couldn't. <words>374</words>

When archaeologists eventually found the fallen palace, they would discover his metal sculptures scattered among fortune-telling cards, telling the honest story of a world that chose to face death with dignity and careful record-keeping. <words>401</words>
