Ambassador Chen fingered the fox tail tassel hanging from her briefcase, its russet fur catching the dim light filtering through the boarded windows of the abandoned city hall. <words>27</words> The ornament had belonged to the bandit who murdered her research partner, Dr. Yates, five years ago during their expedition to collect samples from the organically synthetic organisms thriving in the wasteland. <words>53</words> Now, amid the distant rhythmic pounding of drum circles echoing from the settlement beyond, she waited in this forgotten seat of government for the killer himself. <words>75</words>

The faint scent of must hung heavy in the air, drifting from what had once been a children's theater adjacent to the council chambers. <words>95</words> Chen's voice carried an abrasive calm as she spoke into her recorder: "Subject exhibits remarkable cellular structure—part biological, part manufactured polymer, defying conventional taxonomy." <words>114</words> She had spent years decoding the genetic patterns Yates died protecting, patterns that could revolutionize medicine or destroy ecosystems if weaponized. <words>132</words>

Footsteps echoed in the marble hallway. <words>138</words> Chen straightened her diplomatic insignia, her measured demeanor betraying nothing as the bandit entered—older now, scarred, but unmistakably the same man who had torn through their camp seeking the samples. <words>166</words>

"Ambassador," he said with a mock bow, attempting to jest despite the tension crackling between them. <words>181</words> "I hear you've been looking for me." <words>189</words>

"Marcus Webb," she replied, her tone steady as surgical steel. <words>200</words> "You killed a brilliant scientist for specimens you couldn't even comprehend." <words>212</words>

He shrugged, eyeing the tassel. <words>218</words> "Business is business. <words>222</words> Though I'm curious why a diplomat wants to meet in this tomb instead of simply having me arrested." <words>240</words>

Chen smiled thinly, producing a vial of shimmering, organically synthetic material that pulsed with its own inner light. <words>257</words> "Because arrest wouldn't satisfy the price of revenge I've calculated." <words>268</words> The substance in the vial had been engineered using Yates's research—a targeted pathogen that would recognize Webb's DNA signature, extracted from hair follicles on his own tassel. <words>293</words>

"You see, Marcus, I've learned that true diplomacy sometimes requires unconventional solutions." <words>305</words> She uncorked the vial, and the organisms began dispersing into the stale air of the children's theater, following scent trails with predatory precision. <words>327</words> "These particular specimens have a taste for violent men who destroy scientific progress." <words>340</words>

Webb's bravado crumbled as understanding dawned. <words>347</words> The drum circles outside seemed to pulse faster, matching his accelerating heartbeat as Chen's measured voice continued: "The irony is exquisite—you'll become the final data point in the very research you tried to steal." <words>375</words> 

In the musty darkness of the forgotten hall, where children once laughed at puppet shows, justice wore the face of a diplomat and carried the precise weight of calculated retribution. <words>402</words>
