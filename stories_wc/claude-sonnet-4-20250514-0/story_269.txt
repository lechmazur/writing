The brass gears of the observation deck wheezed their final rotation as Mordecai adjusted his wire-rimmed spectacles, steam hissing from the ancient mechanisms below. <words>22</words> The nostalgic tailor had spent decades in this forgotten tower, stitching uniforms for the Empire's code-breakers, but now that the last cipher had fallen, his true purpose could finally unfold. <words>47</words>

Thunder crashed outside the copper-plated windows as he approached the dusty mirror propped against his workbench, its surface clouded with years of neglect and secrets. <words>69</words> Through the glass, he could see not his own weathered reflection, but glimpses of another life—another Mordecai in a parallel world where the codes remained unbroken, where mortal limits still bound him to this mechanical realm. <words>104</words>

"You're frightened," he whispered to his other self, though the words carried a subtly menacing undertone that made even him shiver. <words>122</words> Lightning illuminated the observation deck's intricate clockwork as rain pelted the glass dome overhead, creating the perfect atmosphere for what he knew would be an improbable confession. <words>146</words>

His parallel self stared back with desperate eyes, and Mordecai felt compelled to reassure this other version of his soul. <words>163</words> "I know you've sewn the same uniforms, measured the same shoulders, hemmed the same sleeves," he murmured, pressing his palm against the mirror's cold surface. <words>185</words> "But listen—the ascension is real." <words>191</words>

The storm intensified, and through the howling wind, he began to confess truths that defied reason. <words>205</words> "I've been weaving threads of reality itself into these garments, collecting fragments of broken codes like fabric samples," he admitted, his voice barely audible above the tempest. <words>229</words> "Each stitch was a prayer, each measurement a calculation toward transcendence." <words>240</words>

His reflection—or was it truly another version of himself?—nodded with understanding born of shared longing. <words>255</words> The mirror began to shimmer as lightning struck the tower's copper spire, sending electrical currents through the steampunk machinery that powered the observation deck. <words>277</words>

"The Empire's cryptographers never realized their codes were keeping us trapped in flesh," Mordecai continued, his hopeful desperation bleeding through every word. <words>297</words> "But now that they're broken, we can finally shed these mortal coils and become something greater." <words>314</words>

The dusty glass cracked down the middle, and suddenly both Mordecais reached toward each other through the fracture. <words>329</words> As their fingertips touched across dimensions, the observation deck's gears began spinning faster, steam erupting from every joint and rivet. <words>348</words> The storm outside seemed to respond to their union, lightning dancing between the parallel worlds as reality itself prepared to stitch them together. <words>369</words>

Through the chaos of grinding metal and supernatural thunder, Mordecai smiled with the desperate hope of a tailor who had finally found the pattern for immortality. <words>390</words> The ascension had begun. <words>394</words>
