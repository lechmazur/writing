Marina had always been cynically gentle with her customers, offering warm bread while harboring cold truths about their small town's corruption. <words>20</words> The pressed flowers between her grandmother's recipe pages had seemed merely decorative until the shadows began whispering secrets of temporal manipulation. <words>38</words> Now, standing in Dr. Henley's emergency time machine garage, she understood the flowers were markers—botanical coordinates for tracking moon patterns across centuries. <words>58</words>

"The tyrant's rule began when shadows learned to speak," Dr. Henley explained, his weathered hands adjusting temporal dials. <words>74</words> "Your ancestor planted seeds of contagion in her baking—not disease, but rebellion that spreads through time itself." <words>90</words>

Marina touched the pressed violets, feeling their ancient energy pulse with lunar rhythms. <words>103</words> Each flower corresponded to a specific moon phase when the tyrant's power waned, when shadows whispered vulnerabilities instead of threats. <words>119</words> Her cynical nature had always made her question authority, but gentleness had kept her silent—until now. <words>134</words>

"I need to exceed what she started," Marina whispered, understanding flooding through her like yeast activating in warm dough. <words>150</words> The time machine hummed with mystical energy as she placed the pressed flowers into its core chamber. <words>166</words>

"The shadows speak loudest during the new moon," Dr. Henley warned. <words>176</words> "You'll have moments to plant your temporal seeds before the tyrant's guards notice the disruption." <words>190</words>

Marina stepped into the machine, clutching her grandmother's recipe book. <words>200</words> The garage dissolved into swirling darkness as she traveled backward, tracking moon patterns like breadcrumbs through time. <words>216</words> She materialized in her ancestor's bakery, where shadows danced with newfound voices, sharing secrets of resistance. <words>230</words>

Her ancestor looked up from kneading dough, unsurprised. <words>238</words> "You've come to help me exceed the original plan," the woman said, pressing fresh violets into Marina's palm. <words>254</words>

Together, they worked through the night, baking loaves infused with temporal seeds—each bite spreading not illness, but awakening. <words>270</words> The shadows whispered encouragement as they tracked lunar cycles, timing each delivery to maximize the contagion of consciousness. <words>286</words>

When Marina returned to her own time, the tyrant's statue lay toppled in the town square. <words>301</words> The pressed flowers in her book had multiplied, creating new patterns that mapped a future where shadows spoke only truth. <words>319</words> Her bakery became a sanctuary where cynical gentleness transformed into fierce compassion, serving bread that nourished both body and rebellion. <words>337</words>

Dr. Henley found her there at dawn, flour dusting her hands like temporal residue. <words>351</words> "Did you succeed?" he asked. <words>357</words>

Marina smiled, watching shadows dance peacefully in the morning light. <words>367</words> "The seeds of contagion have taken root," she said, pressing a fresh violet between her grandmother's pages. <words>382</words> "Revolution tastes sweeter when baked with moon-blessed flour." <words>390</words>

The shadows whispered their agreement, speaking now only of freedom. <words>400</words>
