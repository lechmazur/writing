Lieutenant Cassandra Thorne had crossed oceans for three centuries, her stomach still churning with each wave, yet her awkwardly charming smile never failed to win over skeptical crews. <words>27</words>

The translucent ghost orchid bulb pulsed in her weathered palm as she approached the crystal fortress that materialized at rainbow canyon's end, where traded secrets had accumulated like sediment across quiet longing centuries. <words>55</words>

She'd learned to track moon phases during her first mortal lifetime, discovering that each lunar cycle revealed another layer of the fortress's crystalline walls, each one holding whispered confessions from travelers who'd sought the mirror within. <words>86</words>

Tonight, under the new moon's darkness, she would finally confront the mirror before it could lie again about her transformation. <words>103</words>

The orchid bulb had been payment from a dying sorceress in exchange for Cassandra's most precious secret: that her seasickness was actually homesickness for a land that existed only in dreams. <words>128</words>

As she stepped through the fortress's shimmering entrance, memories flooded back with nostalgic defianceâ€”how she'd once been fully human, how the curse had granted her immortality while trapping her between sea and shore. <words>156</words>

The moon phases had become her calendar, marking centuries of searching for this place where transformation was possible. <words>171</words>

Each footstep on the crystal floor echoed with traded secrets from previous visitors: love letters never sent, names of children never born, dreams abandoned for duty. <words>192</words>

The mirror stood at the fortress's heart, its surface rippling like disturbed water, reflecting not her face but her deepest truths. <words>208</words>

"You've returned," the mirror spoke with voices of all who'd confessed here, "but the price of transformation remains the same." <words>224</words>

Cassandra held up the ghost orchid bulb, its translucent flesh glowing with captured moonlight from countless cycles. <words>238</words>

"I know," she said, her voice carrying the awkward charm that had sustained her through centuries of loneliness, "I must trade my final secret." <words>257</words>

The mirror's surface stilled, waiting. <words>262</words>

"My seasickness isn't a weakness," she whispered, "it's homesickness for the life I chose to abandon, and I've been punishing myself ever since." <words>282</words>

The orchid bulb dissolved into silver light that flowed into the mirror's depths. <words>294</words>

As the moon completed its hidden phase outside, Cassandra felt her immortal bonds loosening, her stomach settling for the first time in three hundred years. <words>315</words>

The crystal fortress began to fade around her, but instead of fear, she felt nostalgic defiance blooming in her chest like the ghost orchid she'd sacrificed. <words>334</words>

She was transforming at last, not into something new, but back into someone she'd forgotten she could be. <words>350</words>

When dawn broke over the rainbow canyon, only morning mist remained where the fortress had stood, carrying whispered thanks toward the waiting sea. <words>369</words>

Cassandra walked toward the ocean with steady legs and a settled stomach, finally ready to sail toward home. <words>385</words>

The traded secrets had set her free, and the mirror would never lie to her again. <words>400</words>
