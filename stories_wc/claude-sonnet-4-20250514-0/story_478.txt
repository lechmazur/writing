Mira knelt beside the dying woman in the moonlit orchard, her weathered hands moving with practiced precision despite the island's relentless spinning through the maelstrom. <words>23</words> The waxing moon cast silver light through apple branches as she crushed pressed herbs between her palms, releasing their ancient potency into the salt-tinged air. <words>43</words> As the island's most critical midwife, she had delivered countless souls into this world, but tonight felt different—charged with possibility and loss. <words>63</words>

"The memories," the woman whispered, clutching Mira's wrist with surprising strength. <words>74</words> "They stole them from us all, buried them in fire and ash." <words>86</words>

Mira nodded with her characteristic openly secretive manner, revealing just enough understanding to comfort while concealing the depth of her knowledge. <words>103</words> She had always been this way—transparent yet enigmatic, sharing healing wisdom while guarding the darker truths she'd accumulated over decades of midwifery. <words>122</words>

The woman's breathing slowed as the herbal remedy took effect, and she pointed toward the cottage where orange flames still flickered in the hearth. <words>141</words> "Look there," she gasped before her eyes fluttered closed. <words>150</words>

Inside the cottage, Mira discovered half-burned diaries scattered across the fireplace stones, their pages curled and blackened but still legible. <words>167</words> Her heart quickened as she recognized the handwriting—her own, from years she could no longer remember. <words>182</words> The entries spoke of stolen memories, of an entire generation of island women whose wisdom had been systematically erased. <words>199</words>

As she read, fragmented recollections began surfacing like bubbles in deep water. <words>211</words> She remembered teaching young mothers ancient birthing songs, sharing knowledge of herbs that could ease labor or prevent it entirely. <words>228</words> She remembered the ships that came in the night, the men who claimed such knowledge was dangerous, who fed their accumulated wisdom to the flames. <words>248</words>

The dissonant calm that had defined her existence—that strange peace built on forgotten foundations—finally made sense. <words>263</words> They had taken her memories but left her skills, creating a hollow competence that felt both natural and alien. <words>280</words>

Standing beneath the waxing moon's glow, surrounded by the maelstrom's endless churning, Mira felt her consciousness expanding beyond its imposed limitations. <words>298</words> The pressed herbs in her pocket seemed to pulse with recovered meaning, each one connected to stories she was finally remembering. <words>316</words> This was how wisdom truly grew—not through accumulation alone, but through the painful process of reclaiming what had been stolen. <words>334</words>

As the island spun through the night, she gathered the remaining diary pages, understanding that her journey to transcend the artificial boundaries of her memories had only just begun. <words>357</words> The other women deserved to remember too, and she would help them birth their stolen knowledge back into the world. <words>375</words> Her openly secretive nature would serve a new purpose now—protecting the recovered wisdom while carefully nurturing its return. <words>392</words> The maelstrom could rage around them, but memory, once recovered, proved stronger than any storm. <words>407</words>
