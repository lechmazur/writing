Maya floated through the abandoned underwater market, her divination crystals barely glowing in the aquamarine gloom. <words>16</words> She collected vintage photographs from the scattered stalls with mechanical precision, each image rippling strangely in the water-warped light. <words>33</words> The photographs showed the same faces across different timelines—versions of herself making choices that had precipitated cosmic disasters. <words>49</words>

Her followers on AquaNet barely cared about her cryptic posts anymore, but Maya continued uploading the photographs with timestamps that shouldn't exist. <words>68</words> "Timeline C-47: chose love over duty," she captioned one image of herself kissing a stranger while cities burned in the background. <words>87</words> The echo of regret pulsed through the water around her, a frequency only she could perceive. <words>103</words>

Maya's gifts made the truth confusingly clear—she could see every parallel decision branching like coral, but understanding which choice would restore balance remained maddeningly elusive. <words>125</words> In Timeline B-23, she had ignored the cosmic imbalance entirely, and reality had simply... stopped. <words>140</words> In A-91, she had acted too hastily, precipitating the very catastrophe she'd tried to prevent. <words>155</words>

She photographed another memory-crystal, this one showing her future self drowning in this exact spot. <words>169</words> Her social media algorithm had evolved beyond human comprehension, automatically cross-posting to timelines where she hadn't been born, where followers who didn't exist yet somehow liked her content. <words>193</words>

The trail of posts was revealing something crucial—a pattern Maya's shy nature had always prevented her from seeing. <words>210</words> In every timeline where she remained silent, where she refused to share her visions publicly, the cosmic balance shattered. <words>227</words> Only when she embraced the passionate disinterest that marked true prophecy—caring deeply while appearing detached—could she guide reality toward stability. <words>245</words>

Maya's fingers moved across her waterproof device with practiced indifference, uploading the final photograph. <words>258</words> It showed all timelines converging at this moment, this choice, this underwater market where past and future collapsed into a single point. <words>277</words> Her caption was simple: "The cosmos doesn't need saving. <words>286</words> It needs witnessing." <words>289</words>

The regret-echo suddenly stilled. <words>294</words> Across infinite timelines, versions of Maya simultaneously understood—the cosmic imbalance hadn't been caused by wrong choices, but by her refusal to document them publicly. <words>314</words> The universe required a shy diviner willing to expose her failures, to let strangers judge her deepest mistakes. <words>331</words>

As the underwater city began to rise, returning to its proper timeline, Maya smiled at her phone's notification. <words>348</words> One million followers across seventeen dimensions had finally heard the truth. <words>359</words> She photographed the ascending buildings, captioning it simply: "Going home." <words>370</words> The cosmic balance, restored through radical transparency, hummed quietly around her as reality settled into its rightful configuration. <words>387</words> Maya tucked her camera away and swam upward, leaving the photographs floating like luminous breadcrumbs for the next diviner to find. <words>405</words>
