Kira descended into the lighthouse basement, her bright eyes scanning the water-stained walls with characteristic literal precision. <words>16</words> The basement had been abandoned since the Great Drought Wars ended, when humanity finally exhausted every aquifer and ocean in their desperate conflict. <words>34</words> Now, twenty years later, she served as apprentice to the last cartographer, tasked with decoding the ancient star maps that might reveal celestial water sources. <words>54</words>

The ghostly whispers that haunted this place didn't disturb her brazen calm as she collected the coded notes slipped under the heavy basement door each morning. <words>75</words> Today's batch contained astronomical coordinates written in the old language, each symbol demanding her uniquely literal interpretation—no metaphors, no assumptions, only exact meaning. <words>95</words>

She pulled out the brass phone booth key, a relic from the defunct TransGlobal Communications Company that had once connected the world. <words>112</words> The key unlocked a hidden compartment in the lighthouse's original telegraph station, where she kept her decoding apparatus. <words>127</words>

As Kira parsed each note methodically, the spectral voices grew louder, as if the drowned souls of the water wars were drawn to her work. <words>147</words> Her master had warned that the ancient astronomers would overcharge their star maps with false coordinates to protect real water-bearing worlds from exploitation. <words>165</words> But Kira's literal mind could distinguish truth from deception by examining the mathematical precision of each celestial measurement. <words>181</words>

The basement's stone walls seemed to pulse with otherworldly energy as she aligned the decoded coordinates with her astrolabe. <words>197</words> Three notes revealed consistent patterns pointing to a distant system where frozen comets might yield the water humanity desperately needed. <words>214</words>

"The dead approve," she murmured with brazen calm as the ghostly whispers crescendoed into something resembling approval. <words>228</words> Her grand designs extended beyond mere survival—she envisioned fleets of ships carrying humanity to those distant, water-rich worlds. <words>244</words>

The phone booth key turned smoothly as she locked away her completed translations, her bright eyes already anticipating tomorrow's batch of stellar secrets. <words>263</words> The ancient cartographers had embedded their knowledge in layers of literal truth, requiring an apprentice who could read between the lines without losing the precision of the original meaning. <words>286</words>

As she climbed the basement stairs, leaving the haunted voices behind, Kira carried humanity's hope in her methodical translations. <words>303</words> Each decoded star map brought them closer to abandoning this desiccated world for the water-abundant planets that awaited among the stars. <words>320</words> Her uniquely literal gift would overcharge their exodus with the exact coordinates needed for humanity's greatest journey. <words>335</words> The lighthouse basement had become her command center for the most audacious escape in human history, where ancient wisdom met desperate necessity in perfect, literal harmony. <words>357</words>
