Marcus had been a master pickpocket until the lighthouse job went wrong. <words>12</words> Now he stood baffled in the haunted engine room, clutching the eerie ventriloquist dummy he'd accidentally stolen instead of the wealthy collector's wallet. <words>30</words> The wooden figure's painted eyes seemed to follow him with confusingly lucid awareness, as if it understood his predicament better than he did. <words>49</words>

"This is ridiculous," Marcus muttered, his scorching poise barely masking the frustration that burned through his usual confidence. <words>67</words> He had twenty minutes between his next appointment with a fence and this catastrophic mistake, but the dummy felt impossibly heavy in his hands. <words>87</words>

The lighthouse's ancient machinery groaned around him, and suddenly the dummy's mouth moved. <words>99</words> "You seek transformation, thief, but steal only objects," it spoke with mechanical precision. <words>112</words> Marcus nearly dropped it, his street-smart composure cracking. <words>120</words>

"What kind of sick joke—" he began, but the dummy interrupted. <words>131</words>

"To challenge the status quo, you must sustain something greater than mere theft," it continued, its voice echoing off the rusted pipes. <words>150</words> "Speak your truth in verse, and I shall teach you the art of transformation." <words>165</words>

Against every instinct, Marcus found himself responding through impromptu poetry, the words flowing unexpectedly from his lips. <words>180</words> "I steal from pockets lined with gold, but hunger gnaws at souls grown cold," he whispered, surprised by his own vulnerability. <words>199</words>

The dummy's wooden features softened imperceptibly. <words>206</words> "Now you begin to understand," it replied, its painted smile somehow warmer. <words>218</words> "True transformation comes not from taking, but from giving voice to what society ignores." <words>233</words>

Marcus felt something shift inside him, a loosening of the cynical armor he'd worn for years. <words>248</words> "The lighthouse keeper's ghost still tends these engines, waiting for someone to carry his message beyond these walls," the dummy explained. <words>267</words>

"What message?" Marcus asked, his voice barely audible above the spectral machinery. <words>279</words>

"That even the lost can become beacons," the dummy whispered, and suddenly Marcus understood why he'd been drawn here. <words>297</words> This wasn't a failed heist—it was destiny. <words>305</words>

He clutched the dummy tighter, feeling its wooden heart pulse with otherworldly warmth. <words>317</words> "I know poetry about the forgotten ones," he said, his scorching poise now tempered with genuine purpose. <words>333</words> "The people I've robbed, the streets I've haunted—they all have stories." <words>346</words>

"Then become their voice," the dummy urged. <words>353</words> "Sustain their memory through verse, and transform your gift for reading people into something that illuminates rather than exploits." <words>371</words>

Marcus smiled, understanding finally washing over him like lighthouse beam cutting through fog. <words>384</words> Between this appointment and his next, he had discovered not just a haunted dummy, but his true calling. <words>401</words> The art of transformation had found him after all. <words>411</words>
