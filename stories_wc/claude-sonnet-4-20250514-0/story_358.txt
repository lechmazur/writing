The old-fashioned mage adjusted his wool robes against the Arctic chill as he entered the research greenhouse, his weathered hands clutching a fragment of Pharaoh Khufu's golden coffin. <words>25</words>

Through the frosted glass panels, children's laughter echoed from the nearby station's playground, their voices cutting through the sanctified dread that had haunted him for weeks. <words>47</words>

He moved purposefully aimless between the rows of experimental plants, letting the unfolding riddle guide his steps rather than forcing a destination. <words>66</words>

The ancient hieroglyphs on the coffin fragment had revealed themselves gradually through his mirror scrying—each reflection showing different symbols, different meanings, different paths to the uncharted frontier he sought to claim. <words>93</words>

In the greenhouse's central mirror array, installed to redirect precious sunlight to the plants, he caught glimpses of his younger self experimenting with forbidden magic. <words>112</words>

These ephemeral encounters with mirror reflections had become his primary method of divination, each surface revealing fragments of the riddle that would unlock the pharaoh's greatest secret. <words>133</words>

As playground time reached its peak outside, he placed the coffin fragment against the largest mirror and whispered the incantation he'd pieced together from weeks of reflection-walking. <words>153</words>

The mirror shimmered, and suddenly his reflection split into dozens of versions—each holding a different piece of an ancient map. <words>170</words>

The riddle unfolded before him: the pharaoh had hidden not gold or jewels, but knowledge of a realm beyond death itself—an uncharted frontier where consciousness could exist without flesh. <words>194</words>

His reflection-selves began to move independently, some pointing north beyond the Arctic ice, others gesturing to symbols on the coffin fragment he'd never noticed. <words>214</words>

The sanctified dread intensified as he realized the riddle's final truth—to claim this frontier, he would need to abandon his physical form entirely. <words>234</words>

In a moment of desperate human need, he found himself reaching toward his reflection, wanting to cuddle against the cold certainty of his fate. <words>253</words>

His fingers touched the mirror's surface and passed through, grasping the hand of his reflection as children's voices sang outside in blissful ignorance. <words>272</words>

The greenhouse filled with golden light as the pharaoh's ancient magic activated, the boundary between life and death growing thin as arctic mist. <words>291</words>

Through the mirrors, he saw the uncharted frontier opening—a realm of pure thought and eternal exploration where the riddle's solution awaited. <words>309</words>

As his physical form began to fade, he smiled at the sound of children playing, their innocent joy blessing his transition into the purposefully aimless wandering that would define his existence in the pharaoh's hidden realm. <words>337</words>

The coffin fragment clattered to the greenhouse floor as the old-fashioned mage stepped through the mirror into forever, finally claiming the frontier that had called to him through reflections and riddles. <words>360</words>

The mirrors returned to normal, reflecting only empty greenhouse rows and the distant sound of playground laughter echoing through the Arctic air. <words>378</words>

Outside, the children continued their games, unaware that an ancient threshold had been crossed in the warmth of their nearby sanctuary. <words>396</words>

The riddle was complete. <words>400</words>
