Brother Matthias clutched the visually unappealing antique flute, its tarnished surface marred by countless tooth marks from centuries of devoted players. <words>19</words>

The aerial gondola swayed precariously as it crossed the mist-shrouded peaks, carrying the stubborn monk toward his ancestral monastery. <words>36</words>

In the heartbeat after his recurring dream returned—the one where his shadow-self murdered the previous flute keeper—Matthias knew he must harvest the past to prevent his dark reflection from manifesting. <words>63</words>

The creased shipping label affixed to his travel case bore the monastery's ancient seal, but Matthias sensed something sinister beneath its weathered surface. <words>82</words>

His fingers traced the intricate bite patterns etched into the flute's rim, each mark telling a story of the monks who had played it before their mysterious deaths. <words>104</words>

Through analyzing these tooth marks with cautious enchantment, he discovered they formed a musical cipher—a warning left by Brother Sebastian, the keeper who had died exactly one year ago. <words>129</words>

The gondola lurched as mountain winds howled through the cables, and Matthias felt his shadow writhing independently on the cabin floor. <words>146</words>

Sebastian's teeth marks spelled out a melody that, when played backward, would supposedly banish the dark reflection that plagued each flute keeper in turn. <words>165</words>

Matthias had been too stubborn to believe the monastery's whispered legends until his dreams began showing him strangling Sebastian with his own hands. <words>183</words>

Now, suspended between earth and sky, he understood that harvesting the past meant more than simply learning from it—it meant actively preventing history's repetition. <words>204</words>

The shipping label suddenly peeled away, revealing Sebastian's final message scratched into the case: "The shadow feeds on music played forward, starves on music played in reverse." <words>226</words>

As the gondola approached the monastery's landing platform, Matthias raised the flute to his lips with trembling hands. <words>241</words>

His reflection in the cabin window grinned malevolently, its eyes glowing with anticipation of another murder. <words>255</words>

But Matthias, guided by Sebastian's tooth-marked cipher, began playing the melody backward, each note a weapon against his own darkness. <words>272</words>

The shadow in the window writhed and shrieked silently as the reversed music unwove its power, and Matthias continued playing with stubborn determination. <words>290</words>

Through this ancient method of musical reversal, he would avenge Sebastian and all the other keepers who had fallen to their own reflections. <words>308</words>

The gondola touched down gently as the final note echoed across the peaks, and Matthias watched his shadow return to its proper place—subdued, harmless, and thoroughly defeated. <words>330</words>

He had successfully harvested the wisdom hidden in tooth marks and shipping labels, outsmarting the darkness that had claimed so many before him. <words>348</words>

The monastery bells rang out in greeting, their pure tones mixing with the mountain air as Brother Matthias stepped onto solid ground, flute still warm in his victorious hands. <words>372</words>

Sebastian's spirit seemed to whisper through the wind: "Well played, brother. Well played indeed." <words>386</words>

Matthias smiled, knowing that sometimes the most visually unappealing objects held the greatest power to transform destiny itself. <words>403</words>
