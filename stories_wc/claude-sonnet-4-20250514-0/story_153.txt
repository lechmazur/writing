Marcus had been studying immortality for three centuries when the universe finally dimmed to its last ember. <words>16</words> In the depths beneath what once was Earth, he continued his eternal education among the mole people, their subterranean civilization now humanity's final refuge. <words>36</words> The coal miner's headlamp strapped to his forehead cast wavering shadows on ancient tunnel walls, its beam revealing truth in darkness—a relic from the Bergmann Mine collapse that had created this underground sanctuary generations ago. <words>68</words>

His gift was immortality itself, yet it proved the heaviest burden imaginable. <words>80</words> While others aged and found peace in death's embrace, Marcus remained forever tethered to consciousness, forever seeking mastery over his own reality through academic pursuit. <words>102</words> The lamp had belonged to Heinrich Bergmann, whose journal Marcus now possessed—one half of a correspondence that would change everything. <words>121</words>

"Still reading?" asked Vera, her pale mole-person features adapted perfectly to perpetual darkness. <words>134</words> She gestured toward the leather-bound journal with clinical detachment, though her eyes held centuries of devotion to their shared research. <words>152</words>

Marcus nodded, his finger tracing Heinrich's faded words about discovering "the chamber where time bends." <words>166</words> Somewhere in these tunnels lay Heinrich's partner journal, swapped with a surface dweller before the collapse—their correspondence containing the secret to controlling temporal flow. <words>186</words>

"I've found Werner's journal," Vera announced, producing its twin. <words>195</words> "His final entry describes the digitization process—how consciousness can be uploaded into the cave's crystalline formations." <words>210</words>

The mundane glory of their discovery struck Marcus like physical weight. <words>221</words> Here, in simple miners' journals exchanged between friends, lay the answer to his eternal quest. <words>236</words> Heinrich had found the temporal nexus; Werner had learned to digitize human awareness into living stone. <words>251</words>

As the last star died overhead, casting the surface into absolute darkness, Marcus felt the burden of his gift transforming into purpose. <words>270</words> The mole people had always known their caves held power, but only now could he understand why time moved differently here, why consciousness seemed to echo in the crystalline walls. <words>295</words>

"We can become masters of our own reality," he whispered, his voice echoing through chambers carved by countless generations. <words>311</words> The headlamp's beam illuminated crystal formations that pulsed with inner light, responding to his presence. <words>325</words>

Vera nodded with her characteristic detached devotion, understanding that their centuries of research had led to this moment. <words>341</words> Together, they would digitize their consciousness into the cave system itself, becoming one with the underground city, eternal guardians of knowledge in a universe gone dark. <words>363</words>

Marcus removed the coal miner's headlamp, no longer needing its light. <words>374</words> The crystals around them glowed brighter, welcoming new residents to their mundanely glorious immortality. <words>387</words> In the end, his burden had become his greatest gift—not just immortality, but the wisdom to share it perfectly. <words>405</words>
