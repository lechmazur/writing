Kess slouched in the captain's chair of the derelict space station, watching delivery drones buzz past the viewport like metallic bees over his grandmother's farmland below. <words>24</words> The family property stretched to the horizon, soon to be sold to developers who'd never understand its true significance. <words>41</words> He yawned, fingers drumming against a misdelivered package that had somehow found its way to this abandoned control room. <words>59</words>

Inside the package, wrapped in faded cloth, lay a porcelain doll head with unnaturally blinking eyes that seemed exceptionally usual for his family's magical artifacts. <words>80</words> Most mages would find such relics fascinating, but Kess had grown up surrounded by them—another disappointing heir to a lineage of powerful spellcasters. <words>101</words> His own magic barely managed to levitate teacups, let alone command the respect his ancestors had earned. <words>117</words>

The doll's eyes blinked in a rhythmic pattern he recognized from childhood lullabies. <words>130</words> Suddenly alert despite his perpetual boredom, Kess realized this wasn't just another family trinket. <words>143</words> The pattern matched the old stories about the Seeing Stones, artifacts that revealed hidden magical potential. <words>158</words>

He'd spent years avoiding his heritage, convincing himself he was too ordinary to matter. <words>172</words> But maybe ordinary was exactly what he needed to spring this trap he'd built around his own limitations. <words>189</words> While his cousins pursued flashy spells and dramatic gestures, perhaps his unremarkable approach was the key. <words>205</words>

Kess placed his palm against the doll head, and the control room's dead systems flickered to life. <words>221</words> Through the ancient screens, he could see ley lines crisscrossing the farmland below—invisible rivers of power his family had been guarding for generations. <words>242</words> The developers didn't just want the land; they wanted to tap into something they couldn't possibly comprehend. <words>259</words>

The excitement building in his chest felt oddly muted, like discovering something he'd always known was there. <words>276</words> His magic wasn't weak—it was subtle, designed for protection rather than spectacle. <words>289</words> The misdelivered package hadn't been an accident; the family's ancient safeguards had guided it here, to him, at precisely the right moment. <words>310</words>

Standing slowly, Kess began to unveil the true extent of his abilities, weaving shields around the farmland that would make it impossible to exploit. <words>332</words> His exceptionally usual magic created barriers so natural they seemed like coincidence—permits lost, surveys producing impossible results, investors suddenly finding better opportunities elsewhere. <words>352</words>

The doll head's eyes stopped blinking, its purpose fulfilled. <words>361</words> For the first time in years, Kess smiled with genuine satisfaction. <words>372</words> He'd finally reclaimed his heritage by accepting exactly who he was—not the mage everyone expected, but the guardian his family had always needed. <words>394</words> The farmland was safe, and he was home. <words>402</words>
