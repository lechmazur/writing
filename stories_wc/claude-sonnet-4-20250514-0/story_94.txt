Dr. Valentina Cross adjusted her amber earrings as another client entered her ethereal office suspended above the sky reflection pool. <words>19</words>

The heartbreak counselor had built her reputation on mending shattered souls, though few knew she collected their deepest vulnerabilities like trophies. <words>38</words>

"Time travel has complicated love," Marcus confessed, his reflection rippling in the crystalline waters below. <words>52</words>

Valentina nodded with practiced sympathy, her restlessly curious mind already dissecting his pain. <words>64</words>

"I keep chasing versions of her across timelines, but the gravity of my desires pulls me deeper into obsession." <words>81</words>

She leaned forward, amber catching the light filtering through the pool's surface. <words>93</words>

"Tell me about the first timeline where you lost her," she purred, fingers dancing across her tablet. <words>108</words>

Marcus described tracking cloud trails between dimensions, following meteorological patterns that somehow led to his beloved's alternate selves. <words>125</words>

Valentina's pulse quickened—not from empathy, but from recognizing a fellow prisoner of impossible love. <words>139</words>

She had once done the same, pursuing a man who existed only in fractured realities. <words>154</words>

"The irony," she whispered, "is that we proclaim ourselves free while trapped in cages of our own illusions." <words>170</words>

Marcus looked up sharply. <words>174</words>

"You understand." <words>176</words>

For a moment, her carefully constructed facade wavered. <words>184</words>

"More than you know." <words>188</words>

She stood abruptly, her amber earrings swaying as she moved to zip shut her case files. <words>204</words>

The action felt symbolic—closing chapters on the lies she told herself daily. <words>217</words>

"Doctor, are you alright?" <words>222</words>

Marcus had become the counselor, sensing her sudden vulnerability. <words>231</words>

Below them, clouds drifted across the sky reflection pool, creating an ever-shifting canvas of possibilities. <words>246</words>

"I've been tracking cloud trails too," she admitted, her voice barely audible. <words>259</words>

"Following patterns that promised to lead me back to him." <words>270</words>

Her cautious impulsiveness warred with professional boundaries, but truth demanded release. <words>282</words>

"The gravity of desires—it doesn't just pull us toward what we want. <words>295</words>

It anchors us to what we can never have." <words>306</words>

Marcus approached slowly, understanding dawning in his eyes. <words>315</words>

"We're both prisoners." <words>319</words>

"Yes," she breathed, touching her amber earrings—gifts from a man who existed in seventeen different timelines but loved her in none. <words>338</words>

"But perhaps," she continued, watching their reflections merge in the pool below, "we can find freedom in acknowledging our cages." <words>356</words>

The sky above shifted, cloud trails forming new patterns that seemed less like maps to impossible destinations and more like invitations to accept what was real. <words>379</words>

For the first time in years, Dr. Valentina Cross felt the gravity of desires loosening its grip, replaced by something more dangerous: hope. <words>399</words>

"Shall we begin again?" she asked, removing her amber earrings and setting them aside. <words>413</words>

This time, as equals in their beautiful, broken humanity. <words>423</words>
