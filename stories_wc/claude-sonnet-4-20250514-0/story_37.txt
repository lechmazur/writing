Marcus fidgeted with the crumpled sheet music in his pocket, sitting in the doctor's waiting room where silence stretched like a held breath. <words>20</words> The former con artist had traveled far from his rainforest canopy village, taking an unexpected detour through the city to avoid construction blocking the mountain road. <words>40</words> Now, awaiting news about his mentor's condition, he reflected on how dishonestly honest he'd become—telling truths wrapped in seemingly impossible tales. <words>59</words>

The paper bore ancient yodeling notation from his village's sacred Fire Festival, where each year someone was chosen to become the guardian of tomorrow's flame. <words>79</words> Marcus had once scoffed at such traditions, preferring to bilk tourists with fake artifacts and manufactured mysticism. <words>94</words> But three months ago, everything changed when old Henrik collapsed during practice, gasping that the songs must survive. <words>109</words>

"Mr. Silverberg?" the nurse called, mispronouncing his adopted village name. <words>118</words> Marcus rose, his weathered hands smoothing the precious sheet music one final time. <words>130</words>

In Henrik's room, the old man's eyes sparkled with mischief despite his frailty. <words>143</words> "Did you bring them?" he whispered. <words>149</words>

Marcus nodded, producing not just the crumpled pages but seven others—each representing a different village tradition he'd secretly been documenting. <words>166</words> "I've been dishonestly honest about my conversion," he admitted with characteristic whimsy. <words>177</words> "Told everyone I was just humoring you, but really I've been preserving everything." <words>189</words>

Henrik chuckled, triggering a small coughing fit. <words>196</words> "Smart boy. <words>198</words> People trust reformed scoundrels who seem reluctant about their reformation." <words>207</words>

"The festival is in two weeks," Marcus said, uncertainty creeping into his voice. <words>219</words> "I can read the music, but the high mountain calls..." <words>229</words>

"Practice," Henrik urged, gesturing toward the window overlooking the city's concrete canopy. <words>240</words>

Marcus felt foolish but began softly, his voice rising in the traditional Alpine style that had somehow found its way into their treetop community generations ago. <words>263</words> The yodel echoed strangely in the sterile room, transforming it momentarily into something magical. <words>276</words> Other patients peered curiously through doorways, drawn by the haunting melody. <words>286</words>

As his voice soared through the final passage, Marcus realized the gradual revelation of his true purpose: he hadn't been preserving traditions for Henrik, but for the children who would inherit their elevated world. <words>315</words> The flame wasn't metaphorical—it was the literal fire that kept their canopy village warm through mountain winters, and the songs contained crucial timing for the sacred lighting ceremony. <words>339</words>

Henrik smiled, his breathing easier now. <words>346</words> "Tomorrow's guardian," he murmured approvingly. <words>351</words>

Marcus folded the sheet music carefully, no longer crumpled but treasured, understanding finally that his greatest con had been convincing himself he didn't belong among the trees. <words>375</words> The detour through the city had shown him what he was truly protecting—not just songs, but an entire way of life suspended between earth and sky. <words>399</words>
