Margaret clutched her grandmother's embroidered handkerchief, its delicate roses trembling against her weathered palms as the phone's battery finally died mid-conversation. <words>22</words> The silence that followed felt heavier than usual in Millbrook, where the magnetic field readings had been dancing erratically for weeks, making compasses spin like dervishes and electronics malfunction with increasing frequency. <words>48</words>

As the town's self-appointed keeper of hidden truths, Margaret had spent decades collecting evidence of conspiracies both real and imagined, but lately her focus had shifted to something more personal—breaking the curse that had plagued three generations of women in her family. <words>85</words> Her mother had died young, as had her grandmother, and Margaret could feel the same shadow creeping closer with each passing day. <words>105</words>

The antique secretary desk she'd purchased at the Hendricks estate sale had yielded its secret that morning: a hidden compartment containing decades of handwritten letters between her grandmother and a government scientist studying local magnetic anomalies. <words>134</words> The correspondence revealed that her family's tragic pattern wasn't supernatural at all, but the result of exposure to experimental electromagnetic fields that caused certain molecular structures in the brain to polymerize, creating fatal protein tangles. <words>164</words>

Margaret's reputation for being discreetly flagrant—loudly whispering her theories at the diner while pretending to keep secrets—had always made people dismiss her as harmless. <words>184</words> But now she understood that her grandmother had been trying to expose the truth before succumbing to the same fate that awaited Margaret. <words>204</words>

The letters detailed how the military had been secretly testing weather modification technology, using Millbrook's isolated location as their laboratory. <words>222</words> Each experiment had strengthened the magnetic field anomaly, and families living closest to the epicenter—like hers—bore the heaviest burden. <words>240</words>

Margaret folded the embroidered handkerchief carefully around the most damning letter, knowing she finally held evidence that could weigh the cosmic scale in her favor. <words>263</words> The crumbling peace she'd maintained for years, built on half-truths and speculation, was dissolving into something harder but more honest. <words>282</words>

Walking toward the town square where the field readings peaked, Margaret felt the familiar disorientation that preceded her episodes. <words>299</words> But this time was different—this time she carried proof, and with it, the possibility of justice for her family and warning for others. <words>322</words> The curse wasn't generational destiny but environmental crime, and she would expose it even if the effort cost her everything. <words>341</words> Behind her, street lamps flickered as the magnetic anomaly pulsed stronger, as if the earth itself knew that its secrets were finally being dragged into the light. <words>366</words> Margaret pressed forward, the handkerchief warm against her chest, carrying the weight of three generations toward whatever came next. <words>383</words> The conspiracy was real, the curse was breakable, and for the first time in years, Margaret felt genuinely dangerous. <words>400</words>
