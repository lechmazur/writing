Maya adjusted her professional cuddler certification badge as she wandered through the farmer's market that had sprouted impossibly within the abandoned Kepler Station hangar. <words>23</words> The massive space, once alive with interstellar departures, now hosted vendors selling heirloom tomatoes beneath rusted boarding gates—an unusually usual sight in this post-expansion era. <words>43</words>

She fingered the phantom train ticket punch in her pocket, a relic from Earth's golden age that clients sometimes brought to sessions, seeking comfort from tactile memories of journeys never taken. <words>69</words> Maya had learned the unspoken rules of her profession: never judge the objects people clutched, never question their need for human warmth. <words>89</words>

The market hummed with pre-ceremony energy as vendors prepared for Senator Valdez's acceptance speech, scheduled to begin once the crowd settled into that peculiar hush that precedes momentous announcements. <words>116</words> Maya paused at a stall selling ancient Earth spices, their scents carrying whispers of civilizations that had learned to embrace rather than fear. <words>136</words>

"You're one of those cuddlers," said a gruff voice behind her. <words>147</words> She turned to face a weathered vendor whose eyes held the kind of suspicion that had driven her clients to seek professional comfort rather than risk rejection from friends. <words>174</words>

"I am," Maya replied simply, watching decay creep across his expression—the slow dissolution of certainty that often preceded understanding. <words>191</words>

"My daughter..." he began, then stopped, his hands trembling as he arranged preserves on his table like an ancient ritual. <words>208</words> "She's been asking about your services since her husband died in the mining accident." <words>221</words>

Maya nodded, recognizing the weight of unspoken rules that had kept him from supporting his grieving child. <words>237</words> The phantom punch pressed against her palm, its smooth edges worn by countless hands seeking connection across impossible distances. <words>254</words>

"She thinks I disapprove," he continued, voice cracking like the station's deteriorating hull. <words>266</words> "But I just... I don't understand how strangers can provide what family should." <words>279</words>

"Sometimes," Maya said gently, "strangers can hold our pain without adding their own." <words>292</words> The crowd began to quiet, that ancient novelty of collective breath-holding before truth emerges. <words>305</words> "Your love doesn't diminish because she needs professional comfort—it grows when you honor that need." <words>320</words>

The vendor's prejudice continued its slow decay, years of misunderstanding crumbling like the hangar's forgotten dreams of stellar travel. <words>337</words> Senator Valdez's voice echoed through the space, speaking of unity and acceptance, while Maya handed the man her card. <words>355</words>

"Tell her," Maya whispered as applause began to build, "that healing takes many forms, and all of them are valid." <words>372</words> The phantom punch clicked softly in her pocket, marking another journey toward understanding in this unusually usual world where human connection transcended both time and space. <words>396</words>
