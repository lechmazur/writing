Magnus wandered through endless yard sales with the practiced indifference of someone who had seen too much magic go wrong. <words>19</words> His conjuring days were behind him now, sealed away with the memories of spells that had twisted beyond his control. <words>37</words> The sunken orchard greenhouse he called home sat surrounded by barnacle-crusted shipwrecks, a fitting monument to his own maritime of mistakes. <words>55</words>

Today's suburban treasure hunt yielded the usual detritus—broken toasters, romance novels, ceramic cats—until his fingers found the antique microscope. <words>72</words> Its brass surface was obviously mysterious, covered in swirled patterns that made his pulse quicken with recognition. <words>87</words> The vendor, a grandmother knitting with a single needle, watched him with knowing eyes. <words>100</words>

"That one's been waiting for you," she said, her needle catching sunlight as it danced through wool. <words>117</words> Magnus traced the microscope's surface, feeling the familiar tingle of dormant power beneath his fingertips. <words>131</words> The swirls weren't decorative—they were fingerprints, layered and preserved in the metal like fossil memories. <words>145</words>

Back in his glass sanctuary, surrounded by the skeletal remains of apple trees and the distant groaning of settling ships, Magnus set up the microscope with methodical care. <words>168</words> He pressed his thumb to the brass base, matching his own print to one of the countless swirls embedded there. <words>185</words>

The connection sparked immediately, flooding his mind with shared wisdom from every practitioner who had touched this instrument before him. <words>202</words> Their knowledge didn't overwhelm—it dampened his fears, softening the sharp edges of his remorse like rain on parched earth. <words>220</words>

Through the lens, he examined drops of greenhouse condensation, watching as ordinary water revealed extraordinary patterns of memory and possibility. <words>238</words> Each droplet contained universes of potential, wild frontiers of consciousness that he had forgotten existed beyond his guilt. <words>254</words>

The grandmother's single knitting needle appeared in his peripheral vision, somehow transported here, gleaming against the microscope's base. <words>270</words> He understood then that wisdom shared was wisdom multiplied, not diminished. <words>281</words> The needle had guided countless hands through intricate patterns, just as this microscope had shown truth to countless eyes. <words>298</words>

Magnus felt something shift in his chest—not quite enthusiasm, but perhaps its distant cousin. <words>312</words> The wild frontier of his mind stretched before him again, no longer barricaded by shame. <words>326</words> Around him, the greenhouse hummed with possibility, while beyond the glass, the shipwrecks stood sentinel not as warnings but as reminders that even the sunken could nurture new growth. <words>349</words>

He adjusted the microscope's focus and began to explore, one drop of possibility at a time. <words>364</words> The knitting needle gleamed beside him, ready to help weave whatever patterns emerged from this rediscovered magic. <words>379</words> In the shared wisdom of brass and bone, metal and memory, Magnus found his way back to wonder. <words>396</words>
