The final chord echoed through the abandoned music hall before dying into silence. <words>12</words>

Marcus adjusted his phone's camera as he stepped into the adjoining mess hall, where peeling paint and overturned tables created the perfect backdrop for his latest digital exorcism. <words>38</words>

As a social media exorcist, he specialized in purging the haunted feeds of people possessed by their online personas, and tonight's client had led him to this decaying venue where underground groups gathered. <words>69</words>

His quietly loud approach—dramatic gestures filmed in whispered tones—had earned him a cult following among those seeking liberation from their digital demons. <words>89</words>

The crumpled grocery receipt in his pocket crinkled as he moved through the shadows, a seemingly mundane artifact that would serve as tonight's focal point for the ritual. <words>115</words>

These abandoned spaces attracted familiar strangers—people he'd seen countless times in comment sections and livestreams but had never truly known, all drawn together by shared hunger for authentic experience. <words>143</words>

Marcus felt the familiar surge of indifferent enthusiasm as he began setting up his equipment, simultaneously bored by the routine yet energized by the possibility of genuine connection. <words>167</words>

To feed his curiosity with life's raw edge, he'd spent months infiltrating secret clubs in alleyways, following digital breadcrumbs that led to real-world gatherings where people shed their online masks. <words>194</words>

Tonight's group huddled in the far corner, their faces illuminated by phone screens as they performed their own peculiar rituals of disconnection. <words>214</words>

"The receipt represents the transactions that bind us," Marcus announced, pulling the weathered paper from his pocket as his camera rolled. <words>232</words>

The gathering turned toward him with expressions mixing skepticism and desperate hope, their familiar usernames now attached to actual faces marked by fatigue and longing. <words>252</words>

He held the receipt to a flickering candle someone had lit, watching the flames consume the printed evidence of mundane commerce. <words>270</words>

"We reignite our capacity for genuine presence," he whispered to his audience, both physical and digital, as smoke curled upward through the mess hall's broken rafters. <words>293</words>

The familiar strangers began to mirror his movements, some filming themselves, others simply watching the paper burn with quiet intensity. <words>313</words>

In this moment, Marcus recognized the strange paradox of his work—using social media to help people escape social media, creating spectacle to destroy spectacle. <words>333</words>

The receipt crumbled to ash as the group stood in contemplative silence, their phones lowered for perhaps the first time in hours. <words>353</words>

Marcus felt both satisfied and empty, knowing that tomorrow they would all return to their feeds, carrying only faint memories of this manufactured authenticity. <words>375</words>

He packed his equipment with practiced efficiency, already planning his next infiltration, chasing the elusive moment when digital performance might transform into genuine human connection. <words>397</words>

The mess hall fell silent again, holding its secrets until the next gathering of familiar strangers. <words>411</words>
