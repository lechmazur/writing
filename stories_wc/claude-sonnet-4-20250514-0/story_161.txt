Marcus had never been late to anything in his life, which made his current predicament particularly galling as he stood in the sterile corridors of the Aerodynamics Research Institute, clutching his grandmother's antique letter seal like a talisman. <words>35</words>

The orchardist-turned-volunteer had stumbled into this paper airplane test facility six months ago, seeking distraction from the fire that had consumed his apple groves and, with them, his will to live. <words>62</words>

"Another conspiracy theorist," Dr. Fleming had muttered when Marcus first explained his suspicions about the "accidental" blaze. <words>78</words>

But Marcus knew better. <words>82</words>

The same corporate signatures on his insurance denial had appeared on the facility's funding documents—sealed with wax impressions he'd memorized from decades of business correspondence. <words>102</words>

Today, he would demonstrate the truth with delicious irony. <words>110</words>

"Observe the test patterns," Marcus announced to the assembled researchers, his voice dripping with sardonic satisfaction as he arranged paper aircraft on the wind tunnel platform. <words>133</words>

Each plane bore markings mimicking peacock tail feathers—iridescent blues and greens that caught the laboratory lights with mesmerizing beauty. <words>150</words>

"Notice how these eye-spots create predictable turbulence," he continued, launching the first aircraft. <words>163</words>

The researchers watched, transfixed, as the planes traced elaborate spirals through the chamber. <words>176</words>

What they couldn't see was the genius of his design: each flight path, when mapped over time, would spell out the corporate conspiracy that had destroyed his livelihood. <words>203</words>

Week after week, Marcus had volunteered here, meticulously documenting wind patterns, learning the facility's secrets. <words>217</words>

The peacock motif wasn't mere whimsy—it was a code, each feather corresponding to a different shell company in the web of corruption. <words>237</words>

"Fascinating aerodynamics," Dr. Fleming murmured, photographing the swirling patterns. <words>246</words>

Marcus pressed his grandmother's seal against the warm wax he'd prepared, imprinting his family crest onto the flight log. <words>264</words>

"Indeed," Marcus replied, watching his carefully orchestrated revelation unfold. <words>272</words>

The collected flight data would expose everything: how the research facility was merely a front, how his orchard had been targeted for its valuable water rights, how every "accident" had been planned with scientific precision. <words>303</words>

As the final paper airplane completed its choreographed descent, Marcus felt something resembling peace for the first time since the fire. <words>322</words>

His trees were gone, but justice would bloom from their ashes. <words>333</words>

"Dr. Fleming," he said, his voice bright with vindictive joy, "I believe you'll find these patterns quite... illuminating when cross-referenced with certain financial records." <words>354</words>

The vigilant orchardist had never been late to anything, and revenge, as it turned out, was no exception. <words>371</words>

Tomorrow, the peacock's tail would spread its evidence across every newspaper in the state, and Marcus would finally sleep soundly again. <words>391</words>

Some conspiracies, after all, were simply too beautiful to keep hidden. <words>402</words>
