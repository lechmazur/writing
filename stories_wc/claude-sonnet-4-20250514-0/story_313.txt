Marcus clutched the empty tape dispenser like a talisman as he walked through the withered cornfields of Sector 7, where nothing grew anymore except government surveillance drones. <words>26</words> The small-time con artist had spent years running fake seed schemes on desperate farmers, but tonight felt different—unusually normal, despite the ghostly figures materializing between the dead stalks. <words>49</words>

"Tell me why you're here," Marcus whispered to the first apparition, a woman in overalls whose translucent face bore the weight of agricultural collapse. <words>69</words> She pointed toward the farmhouse where children's voices drifted through broken windows—story time, the last ritual families maintained even as their world crumbled. <words>88</words>

The lull of remorse had been gnawing at Marcus for weeks, ever since his latest scam bankrupted the Morrison family. <words>105</words> He'd sold them "miracle seeds" that were nothing but painted pebbles, watching their hope transform into crushing debt. <words>122</words>

"Why do you torment us?" asked another ghost, an elderly farmer whose hollow eyes reflected decades of failed harvests. <words>140</words> Marcus felt an unexpected urge to comfort these spirits, even as his usual motivation—to taunt the jaws of defeat and grin—warred with something deeper. <words>162</words>

"I interrogate you because I need to understand," Marcus said, his voice carrying mild fervor as more phantoms emerged from the toxic soil. <words>182</words> "Why do you stay in this wasteland?" <words>189</words>

The woman in overalls stepped closer, her form shimmering. <words>198</words> "We stay because someone must witness what greed has done." <words>209</words>

Inside the farmhouse, a mother's voice rose and fell, weaving fairy tales for children who would inherit nothing but contaminated earth. <words>229</words> The empty tape dispenser in Marcus's hands suddenly felt heavier—he remembered using it in his office, sealing envelopes full of false promises. <words>249</words>

"The seeds you sold," the elderly farmer ghost continued, "they weren't just fake—they were poison." <words>264</words> Marcus's knees buckled as understanding crashed over him like a wave of radioactive rain. <words>278</words>

The children's laughter from story time seemed to mock his years of exploitation, yet also offered something he'd never expected: forgiveness. <words>297</words> The apparitions began to fade as dawn approached, their interrogation complete. <words>308</words>

Marcus walked toward the farmhouse, the empty tape dispenser now a symbol of all the connections he'd severed through deception. <words>326</words> For the first time in his criminal career, he felt the weight of choosing comfort over profit, truth over manipulation. <words>344</words> The ghostly farmer's final words echoed in his mind: "Redemption grows slowly, but it grows." <words>359</words>

As he knocked on the farmhouse door, Marcus prepared to confess everything, knowing that facing the jaws of defeat honestly was the only way to stop grinning at others' misery. <words>383</words> The empty tape dispenser slipped from his fingers, landing in the poisoned earth where perhaps something new might finally take root. <words>403</words>
