Esmeralda perched on the rope bridge connecting the upper canopy platforms of Nueva Selva, clutching a wizard's battered grimoire that had seen better centuries. <words>22</words> The proud exorcist's reputation for banishing demons was legendary throughout the treehouse city, though at seventy-three, her joints creaked louder than the ancient mahogany beneath her feet. <words>44</words> She'd acquired the grimoire from a desperate mage who claimed it contained the perfect solution to her most pressing problem: Father Miguel's insufferable shadow looming over every exorcism contract in the Amazon. <words>70</words>

"Youthify," she muttered, tracing the faded Latin inscription with her gnarled finger. <words>81</words> The spell promised to restore her body to its prime, ensuring she could outmaneuver that sanctimonious priest who'd been stealing her clients with his flashy cathedral backing. <words>103</words> Time itself seemed to mock her urgency—the great clocktower of Nueva Selva had been skipping beats all morning, as if the universe conspired against her ambitions. <words>125</words>

Esmeralda's endearingly feisty nature had earned her both admirers and enemies; she'd once told the Archbishop himself that his blessing technique was "adequate for amateur hour." <words>147</words> Now, perched three hundred feet above the rainforest floor, she felt the weight of responsibility pressing against her ribcage like a physical thing. <words>167</words> Hundreds of families depended on her protection from the malevolent spirits that plagued the canopy settlements. <words>182</words>

She began the incantation just as the rope bridge's anchor point snapped—her usual path to the market district suddenly severed, leaving her dangling precariously from a single strand. <words>203</words> The grimoire's pages fluttered wildly in the humid breeze as golden light erupted from its binding. <words>217</words> Esmeralda felt her wrinkled skin tightening, her silver hair darkening to lustrous black, her stooped spine straightening with supernatural vigor. <words>234</words>

"Well, I'll be damned," she laughed, her voice now rich and strong. <words>245</words> With newfound agility, she swung hand-over-hand along the remaining rope, landing gracefully on the platform where Father Miguel stood gaping. <words>263</words> His morning sermon had been interrupted by her dramatic transformation, his congregation of howler monkeys screeching in apparent approval. <words>279</words>

"Esmeralda?" he stammered, clearly recognizing her distinctive emerald eyes despite her youthful appearance. <words>291</words>

She tucked the grimoire into her rejuvenated frame and grinned with playful cynicism. <words>302</words> "Sorry to crash your little prayer circle, padre, but I've got demons to catch and a reputation to reclaim." <words>318</words> The weight of responsibility felt lighter now, though she suspected the real burden was just beginning. <words>333</words> After all, cheating time always came with a price, and the Amazon's spirits had long memories for such transgressions. <words>350</words> But watching Father Miguel's jaw drop as she vaulted effortlessly toward the demon-infested lower canopy made every future consequence worthwhile. <words>366</words> The clocktower resumed its steady rhythm, as if satisfied with the chaos it had witnessed. <words>379</words> Esmeralda descended into the green shadows, her laughter echoing through the treehouse city like a challenge to every supernatural force that dared cross her path. <words>400</words>
