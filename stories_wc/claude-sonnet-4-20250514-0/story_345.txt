Father Marcus clutched the broken abacus against his chest, its missing beads a testament to calculations he could no longer complete. <words>19</words>

The labyrinth orchard stretched endlessly before him, giant bean stalks twisting skyward through layers of cloud, their leaves catching fragments of pale sunlight that cast everything in dull radiance. <words>46</words>

He had abandoned his collar three winters ago, yet still felt the weight of unspoken prayers as he began to jog along the winding path between the towering stalks. <words>68</words>

The snow had fallen in strange patterns here—spirals that seemed to beckon him deeper into the maze, and he followed them with the desperate hope of someone who had grown unapologetically confused about his purpose. <words>97</words>

Each footfall echoed through the hush of fate unraveling, a sound that reminded him of empty pews and unanswered questions. <words>114</words>

The abacus rattled with each stride, its incomplete rows mocking his attempts to quantify faith, to measure the price of his complacency during those final years behind the pulpit. <words>136</words>

He had stood silent while his congregation dwindled, watching their doubt bloom like winter frost, never fighting for their souls because fighting required admitting his own uncertainty. <words>158</words>

Now the bean stalks groaned above him, their massive trunks disappearing into gray nothing, and Marcus understood that this labyrinth was both prison and salvation. <words>178</words>

The snow patterns shifted as he jogged deeper, forming arrows that pointed toward the maze's heart, where something waited in the perpetual twilight. <words>198</words>

His breath came in sharp puffs, crystallizing instantly in air that tasted of forgotten promises and second chances. <words>214</words>

The broken abacus had belonged to his father, a man who counted everything but never truly measured what mattered—love, forgiveness, the courage to choose uncertainty over comfortable lies. <words>237</words>

Marcus had inherited both the calculating tool and the mindset, spending decades moving beads instead of hearts, tallying sins instead of offering grace. <words>255</words>

But here, following snow that defied natural law through an orchard that shouldn't exist, he felt something stirring—a rebellion against the predetermined path his complacency had carved. <words>277</words>

The dull radiance grew stronger as he approached the labyrinth's center, where the largest bean stalk rose like a cathedral spire. <words>295</words>

He stopped jogging and stood before it, breathing hard, the abacus warm now in his hands despite the cold. <words>311</words>

To climb would mean abandoning the safe ground of certainty, stepping beyond fate's design into whatever waited above the clouds. <words>328</words>

Marcus smiled for the first time in years, unapologetically confused but finally, beautifully willing to embrace that confusion. <words>343</words>

He tucked the broken abacus into his jacket and reached for the lowest vine, ready to pay whatever price climbing demanded. <words>361</words>

The snow swirled around him in approval, and the hush of fate unraveling became a whisper of possibility. <words>377</words>

Above, through the dull radiance and cloud, something infinite waited for a lapsed priest who had finally learned that faith meant leaping without counting the cost. <words>399</words>
