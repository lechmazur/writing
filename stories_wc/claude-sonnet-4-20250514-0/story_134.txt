Eliza adjusted her apprentice robes with exaggerated precision, offering a theatrical bow to the empty salt crystal growing chamber. <words>17</words>

"Terribly sorry to disturb your crystalline slumber," she whispered to the gleaming formations sprouting from every surface, her obnoxiously polite manner masking genuine nervousness. <words>36</words>

The washing machines hummed their familiar rhythm three floors above, marking another laundry cycle in the dormitory—her only reliable timekeeper in this windowless sanctum. <words>58</words>

Master Corvus had forbidden her from this chamber, claiming understudy sorcerers lacked the finesse for salt divination, but Eliza's research on cultural evolution demanded she wake the unheard voices trapped within these ancient growths. <words>92</words>

She clutched the small cardboard box containing her grandmother's hearing aid, modified with copper wire and crushed moonstone—her secret weapon for amplifying forgotten whispers. <words>113</words>

"If you'll permit the intrusion," she murmured to the largest crystal formation, "I simply must eavesdrop on those oak grove memories you've absorbed." <words>135</words>

The salt crystals had grown here for centuries, fed by groundwater that flowed beneath the ancient oak grove outside—each drop carrying microscopic echoes of conversations held beneath those weathered branches. <words>162</words>

Eliza activated her device, and immediately the chamber filled with overlapping voices from decades past: merchants haggling, lovers arguing, children playing games whose rules had long been forgotten. <words>186</words>

Her excitement mounting, she began transcribing the cultural fragments when suddenly the crystals pulsed with malevolent energy. <words>202</words>

"Oh dear, I do apologize," she said quickly, realizing her eavesdropping was hindering the natural flow of temporal essence through the crystal matrix. <words>222</words>

The washing machines above stuttered ominously, their cycles disrupted by the magical interference she'd created. <words>236</words>

Dark shadows began seeping from between the crystal formations, and Eliza felt the playful dread she'd initially experienced transform into something far more sinister. <words>257</words>

"Forgive me, truly," she pleaded with the crystals, but the ancient oak whispers had awakened something that preferred to remain silent. <words>276</words>

The shadows coalesced into writhing tendrils that reached toward her cardboard box, desperate to silence the device that had violated their eternal rest. <words>298</words>

Eliza clutched her research notes as the chamber trembled, the salt formations groaning like arthritic joints. <words>313</words>

"I meant no offense," she gasped, backing toward the door while maintaining her insufferably courteous demeanor even as terror gripped her heart. <words>332</words>

The laundry cycles above had stopped entirely now, the building holding its breath as centuries of accumulated secrets fought against their unwanted exposure. <words>353</words>

Eliza switched off her device with elaborate ceremony, bowing again to the crystals. <words>365</words>

"Thank you ever so much for sharing your wisdom," she said, though the shadows continued advancing with predatory patience. <words>381</words>

As she fled the chamber, Eliza realized that some cultural evolution was meant to remain buried, and that her obnoxiously polite nature might not save her from the consequences of waking things better left undisturbed. <words>408</words>

The washing machines resumed their cycles as the door sealed behind her, but the whispers followed. <words>423</words>
