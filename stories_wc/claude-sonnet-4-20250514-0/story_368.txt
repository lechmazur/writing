Kira had learned to trust her instincts on the streets, but standing before the overgrown temple gates, uncertainty crept through her confidence like morning fog. <words>23</words> The ancient orchard temple sprawled before her, its stone walls nearly consumed by fruit-laden vines that seemed to pulse with theoretically random patterns of ripeness. <words>44</words> Some apples gleamed crimson while others hung withered, their distribution following no natural logic she could decipher. <words>61</words>

The cursed cameo brooch felt warm against her palm, its ivory surface depicting a woman's profile that seemed to shift when she wasn't looking directly. <words>82</words> Old Margie had pressed it into her hands before dying, whispering about harvesting hope from darkness and pointing toward these forgotten ruins. <words>102</words>

Kira pushed through the temple's broken entrance, her footsteps echoing strangely in the vast chamber where time moved across an unwritten calendar. <words>122</words> The vines had claimed everything here too, their fruit creating a reversed pattern from outside—here the withered ones hung high while perfect specimens clustered near the ground. <words>145</words>

A distant echo called to her from deeper within, not quite voice, not quite music. <words>159</words> Following the sound, she found herself contrasting everything she'd learned about survival with the inexplicable pull of this place. <words>177</words> The brooch grew warmer, and suddenly she understood—the echo was calling through reversed patterns, leading her not forward but backward through the temple's history. <words>201</words>

With each step deeper, the fruit around her grew more vibrant, the theoretically random distribution revealing itself as purposeful. <words>219</words> The vines were showing her something, their chaotic arrangement actually a map written in seasons that had never been recorded. <words>238</words>

In the temple's heart, she found the source of the echo—a pool of still water surrounded by the most perfect fruit she'd ever seen. <words>264</words> The brooch's surface had grown almost hot now, the woman's profile becoming clearer, familiar. <words>278</words> It was her own face, but older, marked by hope rather than the cynical wisdom of street survival. <words>296</words>

Kira realized the distant echo had been her own voice, calling back through time across an unwritten calendar of possibilities. <words>315</words> The temple hadn't been lost—it had been waiting, its reversed patterns contrasting present despair with future promise. <words>332</words>

She reached for the nearest fruit with confident uncertainty, knowing this moment would transform her from a streetwise orphan into something she couldn't yet name. <words>352</words> As her fingers closed around the apple, the brooch's warmth spread through her entire body, and she finally understood how to harvest hope from darkness. <words>376</words> The echo faded, replaced by the sound of her own heartbeat marking time on a calendar that was finally beginning to be written. <words>400</words>
