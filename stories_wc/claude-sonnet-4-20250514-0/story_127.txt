Marcus adjusted his steam-powered violin between phone calls, the mechanical strings humming softly in the dim copper light of The Gilded Gear lounge. <words>21</words>

For three years, he'd performed here nightly, his true identity as former Guild Artificer buried beneath worn leather and calculated mediocrity. <words>39</words>

The rusted knight's gauntlet sat hidden in his instrument case, its corroded surface a constant reminder of his creative paralysis since the war. <words>58</words>

Tonight felt different—Helena Voss, his former partner turned sworn enemy, had left two messages requesting a meeting. <words>73</words>

His fingers traced the gauntlet's texture, rough and pitted like the coral reefs he'd studied before everything went wrong. <words>89</words>

Those underwater expeditions had inspired his greatest inventions, the biomechanical designs that made him famous before Helena's betrayal destroyed his reputation. <words>106</words>

The coral's intricate patterns had once unlocked his imagination—branching, interconnected, alive with possibility. <words>118</words>

Now he could barely tune his violin without trembling. <words>127</words>

The brass telephone rang again, its shrill tone cutting through the lounge's ambient clockwork symphony. <words>140</words>

"Marcus." Helena's voice carried the same desperate edge that had haunted his dreams. <words>152</words>

"I know you're there, playing that damned violin like some common busker." <words>164</words>

He lifted the receiver, hand shaking. <words>170</words>

"What do you want, Helena?" <words>176</words>

"Forgiveness," she whispered, the word barely audible over the static. <words>185</words>

"The Guild files were leaked yesterday—everyone knows I falsified the sabotage reports." <words>197</words>

Marcus closed his eyes, remembering the coral's delicate architecture, how each polyp supported the whole structure. <words>211</words>

Trust, like coral, grew slowly but created something beautiful and strong. <words>222</words>

"I destroyed your career to protect mine," Helena continued, her voice breaking. <words>233</words>

"But living with this guilt has destroyed me instead." <words>242</words>

The gauntlet felt warm in his palm, its rust-rough surface suddenly familiar as scales and calcium deposits. <words>257</words>

"The Meridian Project," he said quietly. <words>264</words>

"You sabotaged it because you were afraid my coral-inspired designs would overshadow your work." <words>277</words>

"Yes," she sobbed. <words>281</words>

"And now the Guild wants to recommission the project—with me as lead artificer." <words>294</words>

Marcus felt something shift inside him, like tumblers falling into place. <words>305</words>

The creative block that had plagued him cracked, memories of underwater gardens flooding back with startling clarity. <words>320</words>

"I'm offering you co-lead position," Helena said desperately. <words>329</words>

"I'll publicly confess everything, restore your name, split the patents equally." <words>340</words>

He opened his instrument case, placing the gauntlet beside his violin. <words>351</words>

The ancient armor piece had belonged to his grandfather, a reminder that honor sometimes required laying down arms. <words>367</words>

"The Brass Anchor tavern," Marcus said finally. <words>375</words>

"Tomorrow at noon—and Helena, bring the original coral specimens." <words>385</words>

"We have work to do." <words>391</words>

For the first time in years, his fingers found their melody without hesitation, the violin singing like whale songs through living reef. <words>408</words>

Trust, like coral, could rebuild itself stronger than before. <words>417</words>
