In the forgotten library nestled within the massive oak's hollow trunk, Zara clutched the flimsy photo album with trembling fingers, her mind fractured like the yellowed pages themselves. <words>27</words> As the last convicted dream thief in a world where no new humans would ever be born, she had stolen fragments of sleep from the dying until even their subconscious refused her entry. <words>54</words> The treehouse library creaked in the windless air, its rope ladder dangling uselessly below like the mathematical equations she could never solve, numbers scattering from her thoughts like startled birds. <words>81</words>

She opened the album to reveal photographs of strangers playing tennis on courts that no longer existed, their faces blurred by time and her own deteriorating perception of reality. <words>106</words> Each image showed the same sport but different players, and somehow she knew these were pieces of herselfâ€”the confident athlete she'd been, the focused competitor, the graceful dancer across the baseline. <words>134</words> But those selves felt alien now, mathematical impossibilities her broken mind couldn't reconcile into a whole person. <words>150</words>

The quiet mania that had consumed her for decades whispered that if she could just remember the exact angle of a perfect serve, calculate the precise trajectory of a winning shot, she might summon the storm that had been building in the cloudless sky for years. <words>188</words> Her fingers traced the faded faces, each touch sending electric jolts through her fragmented consciousness as she tried to piece together who she had been before the dream theft conviction, before the isolation, before the world began its slow death. <words>221</words>

Thunder, she knew, lived in the space between serving and striking, between the mathematical precision she lacked and the instinctive grace captured in these crumbling photographs. <words>242</words> She could feel the storm gathering in her chest, a quiet madness that promised revelation if she could just surrender completely to the fall. <words>263</words>

Standing at the treehouse window, Zara pressed the album against her heart and prepared to plunge into the canopy below, carrying these tennis-playing ghosts of herself toward the waiting earth. <words>286</words> The wind finally stirred, responding to her fractured prayers, and she laughed as the first rumble echoed across the empty world. <words>304</words> In that moment, all her scattered selves aligned like the perfect geometry of a tennis ball's arc, and she understood that some equations could only be solved through falling. <words>330</words> The album's pages scattered as she leaped, each photograph catching the sudden lightning that split the sky, finally coaxing thunder from the silence that had held the world captive since the last birth, since the last dream worth stealing. <words>363</words> As she fell through the branches, Zara felt whole for the first time in decades, her mathematical chaos finally finding rhythm in the storm she had summoned through sheer force of quiet, beautiful madness. <words>388</words> The thunder rolled across the empty earth like applause, welcoming home the last dream thief who had learned to steal storms from herself. <words>408</words>
