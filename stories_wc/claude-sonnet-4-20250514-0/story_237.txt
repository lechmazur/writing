Zara clutched the chipped dice against her chest as the space pirate ship's brig hummed around her, its metal walls reflecting the distant glow of the last star fading into morning light. <words>30</words> The psychic genealogist had been captured while investigating her own bloodline across the galaxy's forgotten transit routes. <words>47</words> Her captors didn't understand that she wasn't just another scholar—she was proudly humble about her gift to trace ancestral threads through time and space. <words>68</words>

The dice had belonged to her great-grandmother, a conductor on the old bullet train lines before they were abandoned in deep space. <words>87</words> One die showed six dots, the other five, but the chipped corner on the second die revealed a hidden seventh dot underneath. <words>106</words> Zara had discovered this during her research into the puzzle of destiny that haunted her family line. <words>122</words>

She closed her eyes and let her psychic abilities lengthen beyond the brig's confines, reaching toward the derelict bullet train she'd been exploring when captured. <words>142</words> There, scattered across empty passenger seats, lay dozens of diaries left behind by travelers who had sought to escape their fates. <words>161</words> Each diary contained fragments of stories, love letters, and desperate confessions—all connected to her bloodline in ways that defied coincidence. <words>179</words>

The heartbreak alarm bells in her mind had been ringing since childhood, warning her of some cosmic tragedy approaching her family. <words>197</words> She had spent years trying to hush these psychic warnings, traveling from planet to planet, following genealogical breadcrumbs. <words>213</words> The abandoned bullet trains held the key—mobile libraries of human experience drifting through space like ghost ships. <words>228</words>

Her captors burst into the brig with grave playfulness, their leader grinning wickedly while pointing a plasma rifle at her. <words>244</words> "The psychic fortune-teller thinks she can escape destiny," he sneered. <words>255</words> "We know about your family's curse." <words>262</words>

Zara rolled the dice across the floor with deliberate calm. <words>272</words> Seven and six—thirteen, the number that appeared in every diary entry, every family death record, every moment of cosmic significance she had traced. <words>292</words> "You're wrong," she said softly, her psychic energy now stretching across light-years to touch every abandoned train car simultaneously. <words>309</words> "I'm not trying to escape destiny—I'm trying to understand it." <words>320</words>

The diaries began to whisper their secrets through her consciousness as the last star's light finally dissolved into the endless morning of space. <words>340</words> Her great-grandmother had been more than a conductor; she had been the first to recognize that the bullet trains weren't just transportation—they were vessels collecting human stories for some greater purpose. <words>365</words> The chipped die wasn't damaged; it was modified to reveal hidden possibilities. <words>377</words>

Zara smiled as the cosmic puzzle pieces aligned, her humble pride in her genealogical gift finally justified. <words>392</words> The alarm bells of heartbreak weren't warnings—they were invitations to heal the wounds of destiny itself. <words>407</words>
