Marcus had walked dogs for Manhattan's elite long enough to perfect his carefully careless demeanor—appearing indifferent while cataloguing every secret whispered behind gilded doors. <words>24</words> Tonight, at the Ashworth mansion's annual blood drive charity event, he stood in the cavernous dining room where shadows danced between towering botanical specimens that Mrs. Ashworth obsessively collected from around the world. <words>49</words>

The room thrummed with loud silence, conversations muted by unspoken tensions as color bled from day into night through stained glass windows. <words>68</words> Marcus watched the wealthy donors navigate around the exotic plants—carnivorous orchids and midnight jasmine—their silent agreements about what could and couldn't be discussed hanging heavy in the air like incense. <words>93</words>

"You're not here for the donation," Mrs. Ashworth materialized beside him, her voice barely audible above the murmur of guests. <words>110</words> Her prized Afghan hound, Duchess, pressed against Marcus's leg as if seeking protection from the mansion's notorious reputation. <words>127</words>

Marcus had walked these halls before, felt the weight of their history—three mysterious deaths, whispered hauntings, and now this elaborate charade of philanthropy. <words>147</words> "The dogs always know," he replied, his motivation clear: to stand where fear dares not tread, to uncover what others wouldn't dare investigate. <words>167</words>

Mrs. Ashworth's botanical collection seemed to watch them, leaves rustling without any breeze. <words>179</words> "You think you can justify poking around my home because you walk my dog?" <words>194</words> Her laugh was sharp, cutting through the oppressive atmosphere. <words>203</words>

"I think your late husband didn't die from natural causes," Marcus said, maintaining his carefully careless tone while noting how her hand trembled near a particularly venomous-looking vine. <words>227</words> "And I think you've been using these charity events to create alibis." <words>239</words>

The dining room fell into deeper silence as other guests unconsciously moved away, sensing the shift in energy. <words>256</words> Mrs. Ashworth's carefully cultivated plants seemed to lean closer, their exotic blooms opening like hungry mouths in the growing darkness. <words>274</words>

"The police ruled it accidental," she whispered, but Marcus caught the admission hidden in her defensive tone. <words>289</words>

"Accidental poisoning from your rare botanical collection," Marcus pressed, watching as Duchess whimpered and backed toward the door. <words>305</words> "But tonight, surrounded by witnesses giving blood for charity, you thought you could finally silence the one person who suspected the truth." <words>325</words>

Mrs. Ashworth's mask slipped as the last natural light faded completely, leaving only the amber glow of antique chandeliers to illuminate her confession. <words>344</words> "He was going to expose everything—the money laundering, the silent agreements with my donors," she hissed. <words>360</words>

Marcus smiled grimly, his hidden recording device capturing every word as the mansion's ghosts seemed to exhale in relief. <words>378</words> Sometimes walking dogs for the ultra-rich meant walking directly into their carefully buried secrets. <words>392</words> Tonight, justice would finally bloom in this garden of lies. <words>402</words>
