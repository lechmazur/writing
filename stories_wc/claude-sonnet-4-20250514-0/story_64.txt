Elara pressed her trembling fingers against the cracked dragon scale, its iridescent surface catching the morning light filtering through the balloon-suspended marketplace. <words>20</words> The ancient artifact pulsed with residual magic, promising the immortality she desperately needed—not for herself, but to complete her life's work mapping the ever-shifting forest trails below. <words>41</words>

The floating bazaar swayed gently in the mountain winds, its wooden platforms tethered to a constellation of hot air balloons painted in faded carnival colors. <words>62</words> Merchants hawked their wares with practiced enthusiasm, treating levitation and enchanted goods as routine as selling bread. <words>76</words> Here, mundane miracles were simply Tuesday's inventory. <words>83</words>

"The court will reconvene in five minutes," announced the bailiff from the central platform where makeshift legal proceedings occurred daily. <words>99</words> Elara's heart hammered during this hush before judgment—her unauthorized experiments with life-extension had finally caught the Guild's attention. <words>115</words> If convicted, they would confiscate her maps and destroy decades of cartographic research documenting the technically wild forest paths that sprouted new routes each season. <words>135</words>

She knelt beside the centuries-old marble floor salvaged from some forgotten temple, now serving as the marketplace's foundation. <words>151</words> Her fingers traced the coded scuffs worn into its surface—a secret language developed by previous alchemists who had faced similar persecution. <words>169</words> The markings revealed hidden formulas, including the precise incantation needed to properly activate dragon scales. <words>182</words>

As an uncertain alchemist, Elara had always questioned the ethics of her craft, but the forests below were dying from a mysterious blight. <words>201</words> Only someone with unlimited time could map safe passages for the evacuating woodland creatures and document which trails led to untainted groves. <words>220</words> The price of immortality seemed insignificant compared to the cost of extinction. <words>232</words>

She began the ritual, whispering the ancient words while the scale grew warm in her palm. <words>247</words> Around her, vendors continued their cheerful bartering, floating children chased soap bubbles between platforms, and elderly passengers sipped tea while watching clouds drift past. <words>267</words> The extraordinary had become so ordinary that no one noticed her transformation beginning. <words>279</words>

"All rise for the honorable Judge Wickham," called the bailiff. <words>289</words>

Elara stood, feeling the immortality serum coursing through her veins like liquid starlight. <words>301</words> She had successfully safeguarded her mission through forbidden magic, ensuring she could spend eternity protecting the wilderness below. <words>317</words> As the judge approached with her verdict, Elara smiled peacefully, knowing that conviction no longer mattered. <words>331</words> She had transcended mortal justice and could now dedicate infinite years to preserving the secret paths that connected all living things. <words>348</words> The cracked scale crumbled to dust in her pocket, its power fully transferred, while the coded marble floor had already begun erasing itself to protect future seekers. <words>371</words> Below the floating marketplace, the forest waited for its eternal guardian to descend and begin her work mapping trails that would outlast civilizations. <words>390</words>
