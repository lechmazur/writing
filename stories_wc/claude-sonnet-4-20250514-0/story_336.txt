In the reconstructed halls of what once housed Persian kings, now a museum of forgotten sciences, Cyrus hunched over the intricate astronomical clock that had consumed three decades of his life. <words>28</words>

The weary undertaker turned horologist worked by candlelight, his fingers tracing brass gears that mapped celestial movements with impossible precision. <words>46</words>

Outside, a car backfired in the silent street, the sharp crack echoing through stone corridors like a gunshot, but Cyrus barely flinched. <words>64</words>

In that sudden hush that followed, he felt the weight of tribal knowledge pressing against his consciousness—generations of Persian astronomers whispering secrets through metal and mathematics. <words>85</words>

His grandfather had been the last keeper of the old ways, teaching him to read sun paths across ancient courtyards, knowledge that seemed rarely practical in a world of digital timepieces and satellite navigation. <words>110</words>

Yet here, in this moment of absolute dark following the streetlight's failure, Cyrus understood why the ancients had built such elaborate mechanisms. <words>128</words>

The clock wasn't merely measuring time—it was imprisoning it, capturing the eternal dance of planets and stars within bronze wheels and crystal faces. <words>147</words>

His placid fury had driven him through decades of ridicule from colleagues who called his work obsolete, their skepticism only strengthening his resolve. <words>165</words>

Each gear he calibrated was an act of defiance against the modern world's dismissal of accumulated wisdom. <words>180</words>

By following sun paths etched into the palace floors, he had learned to align the clock's mechanisms with cosmic rhythms that pulsed beneath contemporary chaos. <words>200</words>

The tribal knowledge flowed through his weathered hands as he adjusted the final escapement, feeling the heartbeat of ancestors who had mapped heaven's geometry. <words>219</words>

In burying the dead for thirty years, Cyrus had witnessed how quickly human achievements crumbled, but the stars remained constant, offering the only reliable hope against mortality's darkness. <words>240</words>

The astronomical clock suddenly chimed midnight, its golden sun and silver moon wheels rotating in perfect harmony, casting dancing shadows across Persian tile work. <words>260</words>

Outside, streetlights flickered back to life, but Cyrus smiled grimly, knowing that when civilization's lights failed again, his clock would continue marking time according to eternal patterns. <words>281</words>

The rarely practical knowledge of his forebears had become his sanctuary, a bridge spanning centuries of accumulated understanding about humanity's place within cosmic order. <words>300</words>

As the clock's gentle ticking filled the restored palace chambers, Cyrus felt the peaceful satisfaction of having successfully imprisoned time itself within mechanical poetry. <words>319</words>

The tribal knowledge lived on, practical in ways the modern world couldn't comprehend, offering hope through continuity when everything else dissolved into forgetting. <words>337</words>

His placid ferocity had transformed into quiet triumph as the astronomical clock marked another moment in the endless dance between human ambition and celestial permanence. <words>356</words>

In the absolute dark of doubt, he had found illumination through inherited wisdom, proving that some knowledge transcends the practical to become sacred. <words>374</words>

The undertaker's life work hummed softly, keeping perfect time with the universe, holding hope steady against the darkness. <words>390</words>
