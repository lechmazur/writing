Marcus ran his calloused fingers along the torn corner of a flyer, the fragment barely legible in the dim bioluminescent glow of his mushroom house walls. <words>23</words> The tradesman's scarred hands trembled as he tried to vectorize the fading memories the paper scrap triggered—converting fleeting recollections into something concrete, measurable. <words>41</words> Outside, the ancient windmill creaked through its final rotation, a sound that had marked time in this fungal settlement for decades. <words>59</words>

His synchronized pocket watch ticked in harmony with seven others scattered throughout the cavernous mushroom interior, each timepiece a anchor point in his deteriorating mind. <words>78</words> Marcus had installed them after realizing his memories were becoming unreliable, distorted like reflections in warped glass. <words>92</words> The flyer fragment bore partial text about someone named Sarah, but whether she was his daughter, sister, or lover remained frustratingly unclear. <words>109</words>

The mushroom's fibrous walls pulsed with a comfortingly pessimistic rhythm, as if the house itself understood that hope was a luxury neither of them could afford. <words>131</words> Marcus had always been edgy, prone to dark humor and cynical observations, but his pessimism now felt like a warm blanket against the harsh reality of his condition. <words>153</words> At least acknowledging the inevitable felt honest. <words>160</words>

Through the translucent ceiling, he watched the windmill's blades slow to their final stop, marking the end of an era no one else seemed to remember. <words>181</words> The watches chimed in unison, their synchronized melody creating a temporal map he could navigate when his mind wandered into fog. <words>199</words> He pulled a flickering candle from his workbench, its flame dancing like a tiny lighthouse beacon. <words>214</words>

This was his purpose now—to carry this light through the endless void of his fragmenting consciousness, illuminating whatever truth remained. <words>231</words> The candle's blurry vividness painted the mushroom walls in shifting amber patterns, each flicker revealing and concealing details in equal measure. <words>248</words> He had been a skilled craftsman once, building furniture and fixing broken things, but now his only project was assembling the scattered pieces of his own existence. <words>272</words>

Marcus held the torn paper closer to the flame, studying its edges where memory had worn away context. <words>287</words> The synchronized watches ticked their steady countdown, marking moments he might not remember tomorrow. <words>300</words> But tonight, in this glowing sanctuary carved from living fungus, he would vectorize what remained—plotting coordinates of love, loss, and identity before they dissolved completely. <words>322</words> The windmill stood silent now, its work finished, but Marcus continued his methodical preservation of fragments. <words>336</words> Even if the memories were distorted, even if the candle eventually guttered out in the void, the act of bearing witness felt sacred. <words>357</words> His weathered hands steady despite everything, he carefully folded the paper scrap and placed it with dozens of others in a wooden box he'd crafted when his fingers still remembered certainty. <words>382</words> Tomorrow he would begin again, guided by ticking anchors and trembling flame through the beautiful, terrible maze of what remained. <words>400</words>
