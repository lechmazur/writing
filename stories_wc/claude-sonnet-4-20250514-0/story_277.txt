Lyra pressed her empty coin purse against her chest, its worn leather a comfort in the towering vastness of the giant's workshop. <words>19</words> Throughout the golden age, she had catalogued countless artifacts here, yet today felt different—precedents were breaking like morning frost. <words>36</words>

The workshop's ceiling disappeared into shadows, massive tools hanging like metallic constellations above workbenches the size of houses. <words>53</words> As the realm's most unsure archivist, Lyra had always questioned her methods, but the empty purse reminded her why she'd come. <words>70</words> Her grandmother's final words echoed: "Cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners, child." <words>82</words>

Lyra began walking the labyrinthine path between the giant's abandoned projects, her steps precisely playful—a dance of discovery she'd perfected over decades. <words>102</words> Each turn revealed forgotten wonders: half-finished clockwork birds with jeweled eyes, mirrors that reflected memories instead of faces, books whose pages turned themselves. <words>123</words>

The labyrinth's pattern guided her deeper, past broken marble gods and crystal gardens where light fractured into rainbow shards across the floor. <words>144</words> This was fractured beauty at its finest—imperfection that somehow achieved greater wholeness than any finished masterpiece. <words>160</words>

In the workshop's heart, she discovered something that made her breath catch: a collection of masks, each bearing the face of a different civilization from the golden age. <words>184</words> But one mask felt different beneath her fingers, its surface warm despite the workshop's chill. <words>198</words>

Following the labyrinth's logic, she lifted the mask to reveal a hidden chamber below, where thousands of tiny lights flickered like captive stars. <words>220</words> Here were the sparks her grandmother had spoken of—not literal flames, but the creative impulses of every artist, inventor, and dreamer throughout history. <words>242</words>

Lyra understood now why her coin purse was empty; this treasure couldn't be bought or sold. <words>257</words> The giant hadn't been crafting objects—he'd been collecting inspiration itself, storing it in this forgotten corner of creation. <words>274</words>

As she reached toward the nearest spark, it merged with her skin, filling her with visions of unwritten stories and undreamed inventions. <words>293</words> The broken precedents suddenly made sense; the golden age wasn't ending, it was transforming. <words>306</words>

She began gathering sparks into her empty purse, feeling it grow warm and light, not with weight but with possibility. <words>324</words> Each spark she collected revealed another turn in the labyrinth's pattern, another corner where wonder waited patiently to be found. <words>343</words>

When she finally emerged from the giant's workshop, Lyra was no longer unsure. <words>355</words> The fractured beauty of broken precedents had shown her the truth: sometimes the most precious things could only be discovered by those brave enough to wander lost paths. <words>381</words> Her grandmother's empty coin purse now held the seeds of a new golden age, ready to bloom in whatever unlit corners she chose to tend. <words>404</words>
