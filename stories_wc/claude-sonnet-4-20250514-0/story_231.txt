Enkidu clutched the antique hairpin against his weathered chest as the great anchor lifted from the palace harbor, its bronze chains groaning like ancient prayers. <words>25</words> The sentimental shepherd had spent decades tending flocks in the shadow of these ziggurat walls, but today's maiden voyage would carry him toward justice—or destruction. <words>48</words>

"I'll boast no more of my righteousness," he whispered to the chaos-blessed winds, his habit of spontaneous declarations finally serving a sacred purpose. <words>68</words> The hairpin, carved from ivory and inlaid with lapis lazuli, had belonged to his murdered sister, stolen by the palace guards who claimed divine authority. <words>89</words>

Years of humble servitude had taught Enkidu that chaos itself could be the greatest teacher, showing him paths that rigid order never revealed. <words>108</words> When the mysterious coordinates had appeared scratched into his shepherd's staff—39.1 north, 35.8 east—he recognized them as directions to the hidden chamber beneath the royal granaries. <words>132</words>

The ship lurched forward, its cedar hull creaking with anticipation as Enkidu descended into the palace's bowels, following stone corridors that reeked of incense and conspiracy. <words>154</words> Each spontaneous step deeper into darkness felt like surrendering to the divine madness that governed all justice. <words>171</words>

In the secret meeting place, three hooded figures waited beside an altar carved with cuneiform warnings about the price of righteousness. <words>189</words> "You came," breathed the central figure, revealing herself as the high priestess who had secretly witnessed his sister's death. <words>206</words>

"Chaos taught me to welcome uncertainty," Enkidu replied, his voice trembling with chaotic humility as he held forth the hairpin like an offering. <words>225</words> "This pin was my sister's pride, but I learned that pride itself can corrupt justice if we're not careful." <words>244</words>

The priestess nodded solemnly, accepting the sacred relic. <words>252</words> "The guards who killed her believed their authority made them untouchable," she explained, "but chaos shows us that even the mightiest can fall through their own spontaneous cruelties." <words>276</words>

As the ship's horn echoed across the Euphrates, signaling their departure from shore, Enkidu felt the weight of true justice settling upon his shoulders. <words>298</words> He had learned that righteousness demanded sacrifice—not just of enemies, but of one's own certainties and treasured possessions. <words>316</words>

"Will my sister's spirit find peace?" he asked, watching the priestess place the hairpin upon the altar's ancient stones. <words>333</words>

"Peace comes not from vengeance, but from understanding that chaos teaches us humility," she replied, lighting sacred flames that would carry their prayers to the gods. <words>357</words> "Your spontaneous courage in bringing this here proves that justice's true price is learning to surrender our need for control." <words>378</words>

Enkidu smiled through his tears, finally understanding that his greatest boast would be admitting how little he truly knew about divine justice. <words>398</words>
