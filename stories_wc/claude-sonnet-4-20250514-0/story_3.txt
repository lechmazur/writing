Grimbold squatted among the weathered headstones of the sailor's graveyard, his watchman's coat whipping in the autumn-winter wind. <words>17</words> The surly keeper of this forsaken place had grown tired of his mundane duties, yearning for something greater than counting the dead. <words>36</words> Between his gnarled fingers, he rolled a short piece of yarn—red wool his grandmother had spun decades ago when she taught him the ancient art of knot-reading. <words>59</words>

"Tell me the riddle of the stars," he muttered to the tempestuous sky, his voice carrying both desperation and reverence. <words>77</words> The yarn trembled serenely frantic in his grip, as if possessed by the same restless energy that churned within his weathered soul. <words>96</words> His grandmother's words echoed: "Every knot holds market wisdom, boy—the sailors knew which winds brought fortune and which brought ruin." <words>114</words>

Grimbold began weaving the yarn through his fingers, forming intricate patterns his elder had shown him by candlelight. <words>129</words> Each twist and loop corresponded to celestial movements, a traditional craft that merged the practical knowledge of merchants with cosmic understanding. <words>146</words> The graveyard's salt-crusted monuments seemed to lean closer, as if the buried mariners recognized the sacred geometry taking shape. <words>164</words>

The yarn pattern grew complex—a miniature map of trading routes that sailors once followed across treacherous seas. <words>179</words> But Grimbold sought deeper meaning in the dignified chaos of overlapping strands, searching for the universal rhythms that governed both commerce and cosmos. <words>200</words> His grandmother had whispered that those who mastered this craft could read the great market of existence itself. <words>217</words>

As the final knot tightened, the yarn configuration suddenly made sense—a revelation both elegant and chaotic. <words>232</words> The pattern revealed how seasonal shifts influenced trade winds, how lunar cycles affected tides, and how stellar positions guided both ships and fortunes. <words>251</words> Grimbold's surly expression softened into wonder as he glimpsed the vast interconnected web that linked merchant calculations to planetary dance. <words>269</words>

"The riddle isn't separate from the answer," he breathed, understanding flooding through him like morning light across tombstones. <words>285</words> The cosmic patterns he'd desperately sought were already present in every practical decision sailors made—when to depart, which routes to follow, how to read weather signs. <words>307</words> Market wisdom and celestial knowledge were one truth expressed in different languages. <words>318</words>

The wind calmed as Grimbold carefully untied the yarn, each released knot returning ancient secrets to the restless air. <words>335</words> He tucked the wool into his coat pocket, no longer a surly guardian of the dead but a keeper of living wisdom. <words>354</words> The graveyard felt different now—not a place of endings but a repository of navigational knowledge, where departed sailors had left their cosmic understanding etched in stone. <words>377</words> Between autumn's death and winter's contemplation, Grimbold had found his answer woven in tradition's threads. <words>391</words> The universe's grand marketplace revealed itself to those patient enough to learn its dignified, chaotic patterns. <words>405</words>
