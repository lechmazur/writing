Father Marcus pressed the brittle wildflowers between his trembling fingers, their papery petals crackling like whispered confessions in the cramped observation deck of Station Erebus. <words>25</words> The orbital debris field stretched endlessly beyond the reinforced glass, twisted metal remnants of humanity's abandoned dreams spinning in silent ballet against the star-drunk void. <words>49</words> His grandmother's journal lay open beside him, its pages revealing decades of fabricated exorcisms, phantom possessions, and congregations bilked of their faith through elaborate theatrical deceptions. <words>72</words> The inheritance of lies weighed heavier than any demon he'd ever claimed to banish. <words>86</words>

Marcus had never been usual among the clergy—his stage fright made public ceremonies a nightmare of stuttered Latin and sweating palms. <words>104</words> Yet here, surrounded by the detritus of collapsed civilizations, he found his voice in defiant hush. <words>118</words> The toy assembly kit his grandmother had left him—a final, cruel joke—contained no child's plaything but rather components for a genuine spirit trap, its ancient symbols etched into polymer parts designed to look innocuous. <words>148</words>

The sound of a key turning in a lock echoed through the station's corridors, impossible since he'd sealed himself inside. <words>166</words> Marcus rose, clutching the pressed flowers that had marked each false exorcism in his grandmother's ledger, their preservation a testament to her methodical dishonesty. <words>185</words> But something moved in the debris field—not the lazy drift of cosmic refuse, but purposeful, hungry motion. <words>201</words>

The entities his grandmother had pretended to cast out were real, and they had followed her fabricated trail across the void to this forgotten outpost. <words>222</words> Marcus felt his throat constrict with familiar terror, but his motivation burned brighter than his fear: to sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never." <words>241</words> Never honest, never brave, never worthy—all the nevers that had defined his lineage. <words>254</words>

He began to submerge himself in the genuine ritual his grandmother's notes had unknowingly provided, assembling the trap with hands steadied by righteous fury. <words>273</words> The pressed wildflowers crumbled as he spoke the true words, not the theatrical Latin of his grandmother's performances, but the older tongue that made reality bend. <words>295</words> His voice carried now, no longer trapped by stage fright but freed by authentic purpose. <words>308</words>

The lock turned again, and darkness seeped through the station's walls like oil through cheesecloth. <words>321</words> Marcus smiled grimly, completing the final connection in his grandmother's unwitting masterpiece. <words>332</words> The entities that had fed on her false promises would find no sanctuary here among the orbital graves. <words>347</words> For the first time in his bloodline, someone would tell the truth—even if it meant confronting the very demons his family had profited from denying. <words>369</words> The pressed flowers turned to ash in his palm as the trap engaged, and Marcus whispered his defiance into the void. <words>387</words> No more lies, no more theater—only the terrible, liberating weight of absolute honesty echoing through the debris field's endless night. <words>405</words>
