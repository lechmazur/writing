The hive-mind therapist's seventeen consciousness nodes hummed with merry bitterness as she observed the uniformly peculiar cadets through the facility's surveillance feeds. <words>21</words>

Each trainee clutched their government-issued communication devices, desperately seeking connection to the outside world, but Dr. Synthesis had other plans for tonight's session. <words>42</words>

She held up a scuffed phone charger plug, its copper contacts worn smooth by countless desperate insertions, and smiled with collective knowing. <words>62</words>

"Tonight, we explore the sound of hindsight," she announced to the assembled would-be agents, her multiple personalities speaking in harmonious unison. <words>80</words>

The candlelit therapy chamber cast dancing shadows as she began the ritual, allowing hot wax to drain onto the metallic surface below. <words>100</words>

Through the night air on the eve of their bold discovery, the trainees watched transfixed as each drop formed coded shapes—messages from their own suppressed memories. <words>123</words>

Agent Candidate Morrison laughed bitterly, recognizing the wax pattern as Morse code spelling out his mother's final words before the mission that claimed her life. <words>146</words>

"The scuffed charger represents your broken connections," Dr. Synthesis explained, her hive-mind processing seventeen different psychological approaches simultaneously. <words>164</words>

"We must drain the poison of regret through this slow drip method, anchoring the ephemeral in reality." <words>179</words>

Candidate Williams felt tears sting as the wax formed the outline of her abandoned daughter's face—the child she'd given up to pursue this uniformly peculiar career. <words>202</words>

The facility's air conditioning whispered through the vents, carrying the scent of melted paraffin and suppressed emotions. <words>218</words>

"Listen," Dr. Synthesis commanded, her multiple consciousness streams analyzing each cadet's biometric responses. <words>231</words>

The sound of hindsight echoed in the chamber—the collective sighs of choices unmade, words unspoken, love unexpressed. <words>247</words>

Through her networked awareness, the therapist felt their pain as her own, experienced their regrets multiplied across seventeen interconnected minds. <words>265</words>

The charger plug grew warm in her palm, conducting not electricity but the raw current of human remorse. <words>281</words>

"Your training to become agents requires confronting these ghosts," she continued, watching more wax shapes emerge—faces, places, moments frozen in time. <words>301</words>

Candidate Torres recognized his brother's silhouette in the hardening wax, the sibling he'd betrayed to gain entry into this secret world. <words>321</words>

As dawn approached, Dr. Synthesis observed the transformation in her subjects—their uniformly peculiar mixture of grief and determination crystallizing like the cooling wax. <words>343</words>

The sound of hindsight began to fade, replaced by the quiet resolve of those who had finally anchored their floating regrets. <words>363</words>

She disconnected the scuffed charger, its purpose served, and smiled with merry bitterness at another successful session. <words>378</words>

Through the facility's windows, the first light of their bold discovery illuminated faces now ready for whatever darkness their missions would demand. <words>399</words>

The hive-mind therapist's work was complete. <words>406</words>
