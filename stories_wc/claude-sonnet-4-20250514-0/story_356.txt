Captain Meren found Kix in the cargo hold again, hunched over his makeshift star charts, clutching that ridiculous piece of chalk like a talisman. <words>21</words>

"Still playing astronomer with stolen freight manifests?" she asked, her voice carrying that familiar blend of affection and exasperation that had kept this crew together through seven systems. <words>44</words>

Kix glanced up from where he'd been sketching cloud formations on the metal floor, his weathered face creasing into what might have been a smile. <words>65</words>

"These aren't just clouds, Captain," he said, gesturing to his chalk drawings that mapped the nebular drift patterns they'd been following for three months. <words>85</words>

The ancient communicator in the corner wheezed its dial tone, that steady electronic heartbeat that had become their only connection to civilized space. <words>104</words>

Kix had been the ship's caretaker for fifteen years, tending to both cargo and crew with the same warmly aloof efficiency, never quite letting anyone get close enough to see how the endless what-ifs consumed him. <words>135</words>

"You're tracking time itself," Meren realized, studying his intricate patterns. <words>146</words>

"Time's just another current," Kix replied, his chalk scratching against metal as he traced another cloud path. <words>162</words>

"We follow these formations, we can slip between moments, vanish from Imperial scanners before they even know we were there." <words>179</words>

The dial tone flickered, wavered, then cut to silence—their last link to the past severed. <words>194</words>

Meren felt the familiar weight of endless possibilities pressing against her skull, the what-if siren song that had driven them to piracy in the first place. <words>217</words>

What if they'd taken different routes, different jobs, different lives? <words>228</words>

"The clouds don't ask what if," Kix said quietly, understanding her expression with the intuition that came from years of caring for broken things. <words>248</words>

"They just move forward, carrying time with them." <words>256</words>

His chalk completed the final curve of a spiral nebula, and suddenly the cargo hold felt different—suspended, weightless in a way that had nothing to do with artificial gravity. <words>281</words>

"We follow this path," Kix continued, his voice gentle but implacable, "and we hush all those voices telling us about roads not taken." <words>301</words>

Meren nodded, watching as her caretaker's drawings seemed to pulse with their own light, mapping not just stellar phenomena but the very flow of possibility itself. <words>325</words>

"Set course for the Helix Nebula," she ordered over the ship's comm. <words>337</words>

As the engines hummed to life, Kix carefully pocketed his chalk and brushed the metal floor clean. <words>352</words>

"No more what-ifs?" Meren asked. <words>358</words>

"No more what-ifs," he confirmed, his tone carrying the gentle harshness of truth. <words>371</words>

Outside the viewport, the first wisps of cloud began to embrace their ship, pulling them forward into the merciful silence of predestined motion. <words>392</words>

Time, at last, had stopped asking questions. <words>400</words>
