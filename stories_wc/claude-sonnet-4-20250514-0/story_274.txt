The final page curled from the typewriter with a mechanical sigh, and Vera felt nothing. <words>15</words> She had spent three years documenting the slow death of everything she'd once loved, yet the completion brought only hollow satisfaction. <words>33</words> Her fingers traced the embroidered bookmark she'd used to mark her progress through countless research journalsâ€”a gift from her grandmother, now as faded as her own enthusiasm for botanical science. <words>60</words>

"Another masterpiece of mediocrity," she muttered to the philodendron drooping on her windowsill. <words>72</words> The plant, which she'd named Darwin in a moment of graduate school optimism, seemed to wilt further at her words. <words>89</words>

*You're projecting again,* Darwin thought, though his leaves barely stirred with the effort. <words>102</words> He'd been watching Vera's apathetic devotion to her failing dissertation for months, tending to her unspoken despair with the same mechanical precision she showed in watering him. <words>125</words> Neither acknowledged the other's consciousness directly, yet both understood their symbiotic misery. <words>137</words>

Vera stuffed the bookmark into her jacket pocket and made a spontaneous decision that surprised even her: she would explore the abandoned drive-in theater she'd passed every day for years but never entered. <words>166</words> Perhaps hidden knowledge waited in forgotten places, some fragment of wonder that could resurrect her withered curiosity. <words>182</words>

She carried Darwin's pot, not from affection but from habit, like taking keys. <words>195</words> The drive-in's cracked asphalt stretched before them, weeds pushing through concrete with more determination than Vera had shown in months. <words>213</words> Rusted speaker posts stood like tombstones, and the massive screen bore holes that let starlight leak through. <words>228</words>

*This place understands decay,* Darwin observed, his roots sensing the strange chemistry of abandonment in the soil beneath the pavement. <words>246</words> Vera set his pot down and began walking the rows where cars once parked, her scalding ambivalence toward everything finally finding its proper cathedral. <words>266</words>

She discovered them in the projection booth: boxes of letters from couples who'd met at this drive-in, decades of hidden romance preserved in moldering cardboard. <words>286</words> Her hands shook as she read declarations of love written on movie ticket stubs, profound emotions condensed into margins. <words>303</words>

Darwin watched her tears fall onto his soil, the first genuine moisture he'd received in months. <words>317</words> She was crying not from sadness but from relief at finding proof that passion could exist, even in ruins. <words>335</words>

As dawn approached, they would need to outrun the security guards who occasionally swept the property. <words>350</words> But for now, Vera sat cross-legged beside her plant, reading love letters by moonlight, finally tending to the unspoken truth that she'd lost herself somewhere between data and despair. <words>375</words> Darwin's leaves turned imperceptibly toward her face, offering the only comfort he could: silent, patient witness to her rediscovered capacity for wonder. <words>395</words> The embroidered bookmark marked a new beginning. <words>402</words>
