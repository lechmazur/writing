Marcus descended through the flooded ruins of the Celestial Planetarium, his welding torch casting ethereal beams through the murky water. <words>18</words> The ancient star projector now served as the centerpiece for Neptune's Den, the city's most exclusive underwater nightclub. <words>35</words> As an underwater welder, he'd seen strange things, but tonight felt different—patiently impatient energy crackling through the water like electricity before a storm. <words>54</words>

His grandmother's vintage button box, sealed in waterproof glass, floated beside him as he worked. <words>68</words> She'd claimed the ornate brass container held buttons from two different timelines, a family secret that had always seemed like folklore. <words>87</words> But when the planetarium's temporal displacement accident occurred last month, creating a crossing where past and present collided, Marcus began to believe. <words>107</words>

The club's patrons swam above him in their breathing apparatus, dancing to muffled music while he repaired the structural supports. <words>125</words> Through the vintage mirrors salvaged from the planetarium's gift shop, Marcus glimpsed something impossible—reflections showing the venue as it once was, filled with children gazing at projected constellations. <words>148</words>

The button box began to glow. <words>154</words> Inside, each button pulsed with starlight, and Marcus realized they weren't clothing fasteners at all—they were temporal anchors, each one tethering a specific moment in time. <words>176</words> His grandmother hadn't been a seamstress; she'd been a guardian of chronology. <words>188</words>

The inherited mystery suddenly unraveled as memories flooded his mind—not his own, but hers. <words>202</words> She'd worked here decades ago, preventing temporal breaches that could unravel reality itself. <words>215</words> Now the planetarium's accident threatened to merge timelines permanently, and only he could wield the improbable power contained within those ancient buttons. <words>234</words>

Marcus opened the box underwater, watching the buttons spiral upward like luminous fish. <words>247</words> Each one found its place on the damaged star projector, transforming the nightclub's chaotic energy into something transcendent. <words>262</words> The dancers above stopped moving, suspended in wonder as ghostly constellations materialized around them. <words>275</words>

Through the mirrors, he saw both timelines begin to separate—the club's neon future and the planetarium's educational past slowly disentangling. <words>293</words> His welding torch became a conductor's baton, sealing not just metal joints but temporal rifts. <words>307</words>

As the last button settled into place, Marcus felt the moment of unraveling reverse itself. <words>321</words> The timelines stabilized, each finding its proper place in the cosmic order. <words>333</words> He surfaced to find the club transformed—still futuristic, but now harmoniously balanced with its astronomical heritage. <words>348</words>

The patrons applauded, believing they'd witnessed an elaborate light show, never knowing how close reality had come to collapse. <words>367</words> Marcus carefully retrieved the empty button box, understanding now that he would pamper this family legacy, preparing for whatever temporal storms might threaten the future. <words>387</words> Some inheritances came with mansions or money; his came with the responsibility to guard time itself. <words>403</words>
