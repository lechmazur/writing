Kael clutched the blank postcard with trembling fingers, his sword hanging awkwardly at his side as bitter wind swept across the impossible orchard. <words>20</words> The fruit trees defied nature here, their roots drinking from steaming geothermal vents that carved bright wounds through the frozen ground. <words>38</words> When the final piece of evidence had been filed away three days ago, proving the old masters' corruption, everything Kael believed crumbled like ice in spring. <words>58</words>

He stumbled between the trees, naturally awkward even without the weight of betrayal crushing his shoulders. <words>72</words> The traditional sword forms his disgraced teachers had drilled into him felt like chains now, each movement a reminder of their lies. <words>90</words> Steam rose from the vents in ghostly spirals, and through the mist, something caught his eye—hermit crabs scuttling between discarded shells near a bubbling pool. <words>110</words>

Kael watched, mesmerized, as one crab carefully selected a new home, abandoning its cramped shell for something larger. <words>125</words> The creature's vulnerability during the transition struck him with sudden clarity—naked, defenseless, but moving toward growth. <words>140</words> Another crab emerged from a different shell, then another, each following the same ancient pattern of renewal. <words>156</words>

His anger flickered like the heat shimmer above the vents—ephemeral rancor that had sustained him through the investigation now giving way to something else. <words>176</words> The postcard remained blank because he didn't know what world he belonged to anymore. <words>189</words> The old ways were poison, but complete abandonment felt like another betrayal. <words>200</words>

Watching the hermit crabs, Kael began to understand. <words>208</words> Perhaps restoration didn't mean returning to exactly what was before. <words>218</words> Perhaps bridging worlds meant taking the good from the old shell while having courage to grow into something new. <words>235</words> The crabs didn't destroy their abandoned homes—they left them for others who might need them, smaller and less experienced. <words>252</words>

He drew his sword hesitantly, the familiar weight now feeling different in his palm. <words>264</words> Instead of the rigid forms his masters taught, he let the blade flow like steam from the vents, incorporating movements that felt right to his naturally awkward frame. <words>285</words> The traditional stance became a foundation rather than a prison. <words>294</words>

The orchard around him seemed to hum with approval—ancient trees rooted in new warmth, thriving impossibly in this harsh place. <words>310</words> Kael finally understood what to write on the postcard. <words>319</words> Not an address from the old world or the new, but coordinates for this strange middle ground where both could coexist. <words>337</words>

He sheathed his sword and pulled out a pencil, no longer hesitant. <words>348</words> Like the hermit crabs, he would emerge from his old shell while honoring the protection it had provided. <words>364</words> The traditional systems could be restored through transformation rather than rigid preservation. <words>375</words> As he wrote, steam from the vents carried his words toward two horizons, bridging the gap between what was and what could be. <words>395</words>
