Marcus stood seven feet tall with fists like hammers, yet he spoke only in whispers to the carnivorous orchids. <words>17</words> The greenhouse labyrinth stretched endlessly around him, its glass walls fogged with the breath of venus flytraps and pitcher plants that had tasted human flesh. <words>36</words> He'd been groundskeeper here for three years, ever since the language center of his brain had been scrambled by a construction accident. <words>54</words> Words came to him in fragments now—English mixed with phantom tongues he'd never learned but somehow understood. <words>68</words>

The drum solo echoing from the conservatory above made the greenhouse floor vibrate, shaking loose decades of accumulated soil from between the floorboards. <words>87</words> Marcus knelt with disturbingly calm precision, brushing dirt from what appeared to be shredded parchment. <words>100</words> His massive hands, surprisingly gentle, began piecing together the fragments like a child's puzzle. <words>113</words>

The map revealed itself slowly—a treasure chart leading through the labyrinth's deadliest sections to something marked with a simple drawing: a conductor's baton. <words>132</words> Marcus had heard the whispers from the plants themselves, speaking in their chemical language of pheromones and root-songs. <words>147</words> They told him the baton could raise the dead, could give voice to the voiceless. <words>161</words>

The drums above crescendoed as Marcus navigated past snapping dragon flowers and strangling vines that recognized his scent and grudgingly allowed passage. <words>178</words> He'd fed them well over the years, sometimes with trespassers who ventured too deep into the maze. <words>193</words> His broken speech made explanations impossible when bodies were discovered; better to let the plants handle problems quietly. <words>207</words>

At the map's end, buried beneath a massive sundew plant, lay an ornate case. <words>219</words> Inside, the conductor's baton hummed with otherworldly energy, its silver surface etched with symbols that hurt to look at directly. <words>236</words>

Marcus grasped it, and suddenly the greenhouse erupted in symphony. <words>246</words> Every plant began to sing—not metaphorically, but with actual voices, harmonizing with the drums above. <words>259</words> The baton translated everything: the venus flytraps' hunger-songs, the pitcher plants' digestion-hymns, his own fractured thoughts finally flowing in coherent streams. <words>276</words>

But the twist came when the plants began singing of their former meals—the voices of every person they'd consumed, now conscious and aware within their living prisons. <words>297</words> Marcus realized he hadn't found a tool to raise the dead; he'd found proof that in this place, death was just another form of cruel immortality. <words>318</words>

With brash tenderness, he conducted his chorus of horrors, molding from the mud of this terrible reality a myth that would make the world remember: some gardens grow nightmares, and some gardeners tend them with love. <words>342</words> The drum solo reached its finale as Marcus raised the baton higher, his gentle giant's heart finally finding its voice in the screams of the beautifully damned. <words>363</words> He would be their conductor now, their translator between the language of the living and the eternal hunger of the green. <words>382</words> In the greenhouse labyrinth, surrounded by his singing, flesh-eating congregation, Marcus smiled with the disturbing calm of someone who had finally found his true calling. <words>402</words>
