Korven the Magnificent pressed his armor-clad back against the hexagonal walls of the giant wasp's nest, his boastful nature momentarily silenced by the chittering darkness surrounding him. <words>26</words> The warrior's hand instinctively reached into his lint-filled pocket, fingers grasping at the accumulated debris of countless fabricated victories. <words>43</words> Pop! <words>44</words> Another balloon burst somewhere in the labyrinthine chambers, each explosion marking another moment trapped in this impossibly intimate yet impersonal prison. <words>62</words>

"I am the greatest warrior of seven kingdoms," he whispered to himself, but the words felt hollow against the waxy walls that pulsed with an alien heartbeat. <words>84</words> Pop! <words>85</words> Pop! <words>86</words> The balloons continued their maddening symphony, each burst revealing the precise madness of his situation. <words>99</words>

Through the papery partitions, Korven began overhearing unguarded soliloquies from other trapped souls, their voices carrying an undercurrent of clarity that sliced through his delusions. <words>121</words> "None of this is real," came a woman's voice from the adjacent cell. <words>134</words> "The battles, the glory, the cheering crowds—all fabrications fed to us through these walls." <words>148</words>

Korven's fingers worked frantically through the lint in his pocket, suddenly understanding that each gray thread represented a memory deliberately obscured, a truth buried beneath layers of false heroism. <words>173</words> Pop! <words>174</words> The balloon sounds weren't random—they were signals, marking moments when the fabricated reality required adjustment. <words>188</words>

"I defeated the Dragon of Thornwick," he muttered, but even as the words left his lips, he began to rewire his understanding. <words>206</words> The dragon had been a projection, the princess a hologram, the kingdom itself nothing more than elaborate theater. <words>222</words>

Another voice drifted through the walls: "They feed us these stories to keep us docile, to prevent us from seeing what we really are—prisoners in their experiment." <words>245</words> Pop! <words>246</words> Pop! <words>247</words>

The lint between his fingers suddenly felt different, each strand now recognizable as a suppressed memory fighting to surface. <words>263</words> Korven pressed his ear to the wall, desperate to overhear more truths that might shatter the remaining illusions. <words>279</words> The precise madness of it all became clear: they were specimens, and their captors had been studying human responses to manufactured heroism. <words>299</words>

"We have to escape," he whispered, no longer the boastful warrior but simply a man awakening to his authentic self. <words>318</words> Pop! <words>319</words> The balloon burst seemed to acknowledge his revelation, and Korven began systematically examining the walls, searching for weaknesses in both the physical structure and the fabricated reality that had held him captive. <words>344</words> Each piece of lint in his pocket now felt like a key to unlocking his true past, an intimately impersonal connection to the authentic life that had been stolen from him. <words>370</words> Pop! <words>371</words> Time was running out, but clarity was finally beginning to rewire his consciousness, one overheard truth at a time. <words>387</words>
