Marcus had been a car mechanic for seventy-three years before he discovered his consciousness could slip through steel and chrome into the machines themselves. <words>23</words>

Now, in this subterranean orchard where crystalline fruits hung from silver branches and an underground river of liquid starlight carved channels through the obsidian floor, he studied the broken souls of automobiles with repulsive fascination. <words>59</words>

Each rusted chassis that descended through the earthen ceiling carried fragments of human confessions—whispered arguments, tearful phone calls, desperate prayers uttered during midnight drives. <words>80</words>

Marcus gathered these emotional shards like puzzle pieces, sorting them methodically in the fountain where stardust swirled instead of water. <words>98</words>

Through his vintage opera glasses, inherited from his grandmother who had once listened to society's secrets from theater balconies, he could magnify the microscopic memories embedded in corroded metal. <words>122</words>

The work filled him with exultant grief—joy at witnessing humanity's raw honesty, sorrow at their pain. <words>137</words>

Today, a 1987 Honda Civic materialized, its dashboard cracked from decades of Arizona sun. <words>150</words>

Marcus approached, his weathered hands trembling as the car's consciousness merged with his own. <words>163</words>

Inside the metal memory banks, he found Sarah, age thirty-four, gripping the steering wheel as she practiced breaking up with her fiancé. <words>181</words>

"I can't marry you," she had whispered to the empty passenger seat, rehearsing words she would never actually speak. <words>198</words>

Marcus carefully extracted this confession, placing it beside thousands of others in the fountain's luminescent depths. <words>213</words>

Within the concept of infinity, he had been collecting these unsaid truths, understanding that mechanical objects absorbed human secrets like sponges. <words>230</words>

Cars were repositories of our most private moments—the spaces where we revealed ourselves when we thought no one was listening. <words>247</words>

The starlight river gurgled approvingly as Marcus arranged Sarah's confession puzzle piece next to a fragment from a father who never told his son he was proud, adjacent to a piece from a woman who never admitted she was afraid of dying alone. <words>280</words>

His repulsive attraction to these intimate sorrows made him both voyeur and priest, violating privacy while offering absolution. <words>297</words>

The fruit trees above him pulsed with bioluminescent approval, their roots drinking from the stellar current that powered this eternal workshop. <words>315</words>

Marcus raised his opera glasses again, focusing on the Honda's transmission, where he discovered Sarah's wedding day—the moment she said "I do" while her heart screamed the truth. <words>337</words>

He wept as he gathered this final fragment, understanding that some confessions were too heavy for human voices but perfect for the silent steel that carried us through our daily deceptions. <words>361</words>

In this infinite moment beneath the earth, Marcus continued his sacred work, assembling humanity's unspoken puzzle one mechanical confession at a time. <words>379</words>

The river of stars sang lullabies to broken transmissions while he sorted truth from the beautiful wreckage of human hearts. <words>398</words>
