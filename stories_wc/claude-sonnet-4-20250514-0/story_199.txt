Ranger Kessie clutched her grandmother's plain notebook, its pages fluttering as she sprinted through the urban orchard perched impossibly on the defunct Interstate 95 overpass. <words>23</words>

After the last human dream had been dreamt three months ago, the apple trees here began whispering in voices that felt familiarly unknown—like distant relatives speaking forgotten languages. <words>47</words>

Her grandmother's hastily scribbled notes fluctuate between lucid observations and cryptic warnings about "the echo that comes before silence." <words>64</words>

Kessie had discovered through chance encounters with sleepless wanderers that her grandmother, supposedly a simple botanist, had been tracking something far more significant in these elevated groves. <words>86</words>

The notebook's chaotic organization—pressed flowers mixed with star charts, soil pH readings beside goddess mythology—initially frustrated Kessie's methodical ranger mind. <words>104</words>

But now she understood: Grandma Elena had been trying to catch the echo of a goddess, the same ethereal presence that called to Kessie from between the branches. <words>128</words>

As twilight settled over the city below, the orchard's bioluminescent fruit began pulsing in patterns that matched her grandmother's sketched diagrams. <words>146</words>

"Officer, you shouldn't be here after dark," called Maria, a former subway conductor who now collected fallen apples for the underground communities. <words>166</words>

Kessie's zealous dedication to protecting this sanctuary had earned her a reputation, but tonight felt different—urgent, final. <words>182</words>

"My grandmother left instructions," Kessie said, showing Maria a page covered in spiraling text that seemed to shift when viewed directly. <words>201</words>

Maria squinted at the writing, her weathered face brightening with recognition. <words>212</words>

"Elena spoke of you—said you'd know when the dreams ended that the real work would begin." <words>227</words>

The trees around them hummed with increasing intensity, their luminescence fluctuating between amber and silver as if responding to some cosmic rhythm. <words>246</words>

Through chance encounters like this, Kessie had pieced together her grandmother's true mission: maintaining a bridge between the waking world and whatever came after human consciousness. <words>267</words>

The notebook's final entry, written in Elena's deteriorating handwriting, simply read: "When silence falls, listen deeper." <words>281</words>

Now Kessie understood why the orchard felt familiarly unknown—it existed in the space between endings and beginnings, tended by those who refused to let wonder die. <words>302</words>

As Maria helped her align crystalline markers according to her grandmother's diagrams, Kessie felt the goddess's echo growing stronger, reverberating through root and branch. <words>322</words>

The last human dream had ended, but perhaps, in this chaotic organization of science and magic suspended above a sleeping city, something new was beginning. <words>342</words>

Kessie smiled, finally understanding her overzealous devotion: she wasn't just protecting trees, but safeguarding the threshold where echoes of divinity could still reach those brave enough to listen. <words>367</words>

The notebook warm in her hands, she began transcribing the goddess's whispered instructions for tomorrow's uncertain world. <words>383</words>

Above them, the first post-dream aurora painted the sky in colors that had no earthly names. <words>398</words>
