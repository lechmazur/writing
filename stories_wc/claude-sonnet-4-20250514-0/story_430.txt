Kael crouched beneath the twisted carousel in Kaleidoscope Park, its fractured mirrors casting rainbow shards across his scarred face. <words>18</words> The closed-off reaver had witnessed three generations of his bloodline fall to the same curse—each promising themselves they'd be different, each ultimately succumbing to the darkness that ran through their veins like poison. <words>50</words> In his calloused hand, he held a child's drawing on crumpled paper, the crayon marks depicting a family holding hands beneath a smiling sun. <words>71</words> His daughter Maya had pressed it into his palm this morning, her eyes bright with the innocence that would soon wither, just as his had, just as his father's had before him. <words>99</words>

"You'll leave us," the drawing seemed to nag at him, its charmingly grotesque stick figures dancing mockingly in his peripheral vision. <words>118</words> Maya had inherited his gift for seeing beauty in broken things—the carousel's chipped horses became unicorns in her eyes, the park's dying flowers transformed into fairy crowns. <words>140</words> But Kael knew the pattern: first the wonder, then the hunger, then the inevitable corruption that turned reavers into monsters. <words>159</words>

He pulled out his worn journal, its margins already crowded with scrawled poems—desperate verses he'd been composing for weeks, searching for words that might break the cycle. <words>179</words> "Little star-dreamer," he wrote beside a sketch of Maya's face, "your father seeks to taste the stars in a single kiss, to steal heaven's light before hell claims his soul." <words>203</words> The poem felt inadequate, like everything else he'd tried. <words>213</words>

This moment existed before the first lie would be told—before he'd have to explain why daddy couldn't come home anymore, why his touch had grown cold, why his eyes now held shadows that moved independently. <words>242</words> The reaver curse demanded isolation, but Maya's laughter echoed through the park like silver bells, taunting him with everything he'd lose. <words>261</words>

"Sweet child," he scribbled frantically, "you draw us whole when we are fragments, see light where darkness grows—but patterns repeat like clockwork, and I am my father's son." <words>286</words> His handwriting grew more erratic as the familiar hunger stirred in his chest. <words>299</words> The park's kaleidoscope beauty—spinning colors and impossible angles—matched the chaos in his mind as he fought against his nature. <words>318</words>

Standing slowly, Kael folded Maya's drawing with reverence and tucked it against his heart. <words>332</words> Perhaps this time would be different; perhaps love could overpower genetics. <words>343</words> But as shadows lengthened around the carousel's broken dreams, he knew the truth—he would leave before corrupting her innocence, perpetuating the pattern that had claimed his lineage for generations. <words>368</words> The mocking affection in his final poem read: "Goodbye, little artist of impossible things; your father flees to keep your colors bright." <words>387</words> With that, Kael disappeared into the kaleidoscope's shifting maze, carrying her drawing like a talisman against the darkness he couldn't escape. <words>405</words>
