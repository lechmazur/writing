Meredith traced the rim of the chipped bowl with trembling fingers, morning light filtering through the dusty windows of what locals called the witch's incantation chamber. <words>23</words> She'd bought the crumbling cottage precisely because of its reputation—who would look for a black market genealogist in a place decent people avoided? <words>42</words>

The bowl held her latest collection: funeral programs and obituary clippings, each one a breadcrumb leading to someone's desperate search for family. <words>61</words> Her clients never asked how she obtained death records or accessed sealed adoption files; they simply paid her exorbitant fees and looked the other way. <words>82</words>

This morning's walk had yielded something different. <words>89</words> Mrs. Henderson's eulogy for her stillborn grandson contained the usual platitudes, but buried in the subtext was a confession—she'd given away another child decades ago. <words>112</words> Meredith recognized the coded language immediately; she'd become atypically typical at reading between the lines of grief. <words>127</words>

The irony wasn't lost on her. <words>133</words> While reuniting other families, she remained estranged from her own daughter, who'd discovered Meredith's illegal methods three years ago. <words>149</words> "You profit from people's pain," Sarah had said, her voice thick with disappointment before walking out forever. <words>166</words>

Meredith's laptop chimed—another client requesting her services. <words>174</words> She could zoom into the pixels of any document, enhance watermarks, decode official seals, but she couldn't undo the hurt in her daughter's eyes. <words>195</words>

The morning ritual continued as she spread the funeral programs across her makeshift altar—an old table scarred with candle wax and coffee rings. <words>215</words> Each eulogy revealed family secrets: affairs, abandoned children, disputed inheritances. <words>226</words> People laid themselves bare in grief, unknowingly providing the very information Meredith sold to others. <words>241</words>

She picked up Mrs. Henderson's program again, studying the careful phrasing about "the child we never got to hold." <words>258</words> This wasn't just another case—this was her chance at redemption. <words>269</words> Instead of selling the information, she could quietly connect Mrs. Henderson with her surviving child, asking nothing in return. <words>285</words>

The chipped bowl seemed to glow in the morning light, transforming from a vessel of guilt into something resembling hope. <words>302</words> Meredith understood that self-forgiveness couldn't be bought or stolen—it had to be earned through genuine service to others. <words>319</words>

She reached for her phone, her voice steady despite years of shame. <words>331</words> "Mrs. Henderson? <words>333</words> This is Meredith Cross. <words>337</words> I believe I have information about your family that you should know." <words>348</words> For the first time in years, she felt herself standing on the brink of renewal, ready to transform her guilt into grace. <words>368</words>

The witch's chamber had witnessed many transformations over the decades, but none quite as quiet—or as powerful—as this moment of brazen modesty, when a woman chose redemption over profit. <words>393</words> Outside, her morning walk route beckoned, but today it would lead somewhere entirely new. <words>407</words>
