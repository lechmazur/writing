The fact-minded oracle clutched her brass compass as reality folded around her like origami made of starlight. <words>16</words> In this unstable dimension where seconds stretched into eternities, she had learned to navigate by pure data rather than intuition. <words>33</words> The compass needle spun wildly, searching for magnetic north in a realm where directions were merely suggestions. <words>48</words>

She had come here desperately casual, wearing her favorite torn jeans and a ratty sweater, as if dressing down could somehow make the cosmic horror more manageable. <words>71</words> Her motivation burned clear: to find forgotten places where empathy had been lost, buried beneath layers of human indifference. <words>87</words>

The heartbreak had started three months ago when her sister died, alone and bitter, their relationship fractured by years of misunderstanding. <words>105</words> Now, in the cradle of a whispered minute, visions crashed through her mind like waves against stone. <words>121</words>

She saw her sister as a child, reaching for comfort that never came. <words>134</words> She witnessed herself, cold and analytical, dissecting every emotion until nothing warm remained. <words>147</words> The oracle had always prided herself on facts, on knowing rather than feeling, but the visions forced her to recompose everything she thought she understood about truth. <words>169</words>

The brass compass suddenly stilled, pointing toward a shimmering tear in the dimensional fabric. <words>182</words> Through it, she glimpsed fragments of forgotten places: a playground where lonely children waited for friends who never came, a nursing home where residents spoke to empty chairs, a teenager's bedroom where silent screams echoed off poster-covered walls. <words>212</words>

Each vision hit like a physical blow, but she pressed forward with optimistic desperation, believing that understanding these moments could somehow matter. <words>229</words> The path to empathy, she realized, wasn't paved with facts and statisticsâ€”it was carved through the raw territory of shared pain. <words>247</words>

As she stepped through the dimensional tear, the compass grew warm in her palm. <words>260</words> The unstable dimension began to stabilize around her, responding to her newfound emotional clarity. <words>273</words> She found herself in a vast library where forgotten sorrows were shelved like books, waiting to be read and understood. <words>291</words>

Here, she could finally recompose her approach to truth. <words>300</words> Facts remained important, but they were incomplete without the context of human experience. <words>313</words> The oracle opened the first book, her sister's story, and began to read with both her mind and her heart. <words>331</words>

In this place between dimensions, in the space of a whispered minute that lasted forever, she learned that the most crucial facts were often the feelings people tried hardest to hide. <words>356</words> The brass compass now pointed not north, but toward understanding, its needle steady and sure. <words>371</words> She had found the forgotten place she sought: the space where knowledge and compassion finally converged, where being desperately casual about cosmic mysteries somehow made perfect sense. <words>395</words>

For the first time since her sister's death, the oracle smiled. <words>407</words>
