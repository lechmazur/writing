The aged minstrel Corvain traced his weathered fingers along the rusted bars of the empty birdcage, its door hanging open like a mouth mid-scream. <words>21</words> For seventy-three nights, he had studied the ancient tavern sign across the mushroom village square, watching another flake of paint surrender to time's relentless appetite. <words>42</words> Tonight, as the final crimson letter crumbled away, the last of the old prohibitions would die with it. <words>58</words>

The phosphorescent caps of the great fungi cast their ethereal glow across the settlement, their pale light dancing with feral elegance through the perpetual twilight. <words>77</words> Corvain's innocently mischievous smile belied the dangerous knowledge he sought—the forbidden melodies that could reshape reality itself. <words>92</words>

"You see, young Pip," he explained to the tavern keeper's daughter, his voice carrying the practiced cadence of countless performances, "each night that sign loses another piece of its former glory, just as our village sheds another layer of the old ways." <words>127</words> The girl's eyes widened as she clutched her own small cage, this one still occupied by a trembling songbird. <words>143</words>

"But why does it matter when the paint is gone?" she whispered, glancing nervously at the elders who dozed beneath the largest mushroom caps. <words>162</words>

Corvain's fingers danced across invisible strings, muscle memory from decades of harp-playing creating phantom melodies in the air. <words>177</words> "Because, little sparrow, when the last letter falls, so too will the final ward that binds the Melody of Unmaking." <words>194</words> His voice dropped to a conspiratorial murmur, tinged with wild anticipation. <words>204</words> "For generations, our ancestors painted over that sign each full moon, maintaining the seal that kept certain songs locked away in the deep places beneath our village." <words>228</words>

The child's songbird began to sing, its voice pure and untainted by the corruption Corvain craved. <words>242</words> He had released his own bird decades ago, when he first learned that empty cages could capture more than feathers and flesh—they could hold echoes of power, whispers of transformation. <words>265</words>

As the final paint chip drifted to the moss-covered ground like a dying ember, the very air seemed to shiver with possibility. <words>282</words> The mushroom caps pulsed brighter, their bioluminescence responding to forces stirring in the earth below. <words>296</words> Corvain felt the ancient melodies beginning to seep upward, threading through the village's foundations like hungry roots. <words>311</words>

"The old tradition ends tonight," he breathed, lifting his empty cage toward the glowing fungi. <words>325</words> "And with it, all the gentle illusions that have kept us safe." <words>337</words> His laugh carried notes of madness and wonder as the forbidden knowledge finally began to flow, transforming the peaceful mushroom village into something far more dangerous and beautiful. <words>359</words> The crumbling of their protective innocence had begun, and Corvain would be its elegant, feral conductor. <words>374</words>

Pip's songbird fell silent, sensing the approaching storm of unbound music that would reshape everything they had ever known. <words>390</words> The empty birdcage hummed with dark potential, ready to capture what was coming. <words>402</words>
