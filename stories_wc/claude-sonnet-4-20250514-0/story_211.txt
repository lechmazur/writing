Marcus whistled a jaunty tune while shuffling his worn cards in the abandoned schoolhouse, where dust motes danced like confetti in the apocalyptic sunlight. <words>22</words> The lucky gambler had found something extraordinary among the debris—a leather-bound botanical diary filled with pressed flowers and handwritten notes about plants that could grant impossible abilities. <words>44</words> In this forgotten future where civilization had crumbled and hope was a luxury few could afford, Marcus typically never stayed anywhere long, but this discovery changed everything. <words>68</words> The diary belonged to Dr. Sarah Chen, a botanist who had documented her experiments with genetically modified flora before the world ended. <words>87</words> Each pressed specimen was labeled with cheerful descriptions of their devastating potential: "Mimosa duplicata—creates perfect copies of living tissue!" and "Gravitas nullius—defies physical laws beautifully!" <words>108</words> Marcus grinned as he realized he'd stumbled upon the ultimate jackpot, though he knew such power would corrupt anyone who wielded it. <words>127</words>

The schoolhouse had become his laboratory and casino combined, where he experimented with the plants while playing solitary games of chance. <words>146</words> When lonely travelers occasionally wandered into the ghost town, Marcus would invite them for rounds of spin-the-bottle confessions, using the game to extract their deepest secrets before testing his botanical weapons on them. <words>172</words> The mimosa duplicata proved most entertaining—he could duplicate their memories, their fears, even their physical forms. <words>187</words> With each success, Marcus felt the intoxicating rush of godlike power, though he maintained his cheerful demeanor even as his humanity slowly withered away. <words>207</words>

Tonight, spinning an empty whiskey bottle on the teacher's desk, Marcus confessed to his latest victim's duplicate, "I typically never cared about saving the world, but now I want to remake it entirely." <words>233</words> The duplicate stared back with hollow eyes, a perfect copy of the traveler he'd already consumed with carnivorous vines. <words>249</words> His botanical arsenal had grown formidable, each plant more terrible than the last, yet Marcus hummed cheerfully as he tended his garden of horrors. <words>268</words> The corruption was complete now—what had started as a desperate attempt to defy the gravity of hopelessness had transformed him into something far worse than the apocalypse itself. <words>290</words> In the hush of this unremembered future, Marcus had become the very force that would ensure humanity stayed forgotten. <words>307</words>

He closed the botanical diary with a satisfied sigh, already planning tomorrow's experiments. <words>318</words> Outside, the ghost town waited in eternal silence, while inside the schoolhouse, a lucky gambler had finally hit the jackpot that would doom them all. <words>338</words> Marcus began shuffling his cards again, whistling that same jaunty tune, because in this new world he was creating, even monsters could maintain a cheerful disposition. <words>359</words> After all, power was the ultimate game of chance, and he had never been one to fold a winning hand, no matter how dark the stakes became. <words>383</words> The botanical diary lay open again, its pressed flowers whispering promises of greater corruption yet to come. <words>399</words>
