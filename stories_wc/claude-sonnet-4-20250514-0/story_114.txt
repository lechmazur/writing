The last breath of the dying god still echoed through the shared dream recording studio when Kira discovered the rustic coffee grinder among the scattered equipment. <words>25</words> She turned the wooden handle with characteristic enthusiasm for doing absolutely nothing productive, watching the ancient mechanism unfold its mysteries with the same detached interest she brought to most things. <words>50</words> The empty frames hanging in the deserted hall began to shimmer, their matching borders suddenly alive with visions that made her pause mid-grind. <words>70</words>

As an apathetic summoner, Kira had grown weary of conjuring spirits for others' grand purposes, but these frames revealed something different—dying coral reefs bleached white as bone, their skeletal remains testament to humanity's indifference. <words>101</words> The coffee grinder's rhythm seemed to pulse in harmony with the visions, each turn revealing new scenes of underwater graveyards where rainbow fish once danced. <words>122</words>

"River wisdom," she murmured, remembering her grandmother's phrase about understanding the flow of things rather than fighting against them. <words>139</words> The frames showed her how coral polyps built their homes grain by grain, much like the coffee beans breaking down under her lazy but persistent grinding. <words>160</words> For the first time in years, something stirred beneath her cultivated indifference—not passion exactly, but a gentle recognition of purpose. <words>178</words>

She began to understand that rebuilding required the same patient enthusiasm she brought to avoiding real work. <words>193</words> The empty frames started filling with her own visions: new coral gardens growing from her summons, spirit-touched polyps that could withstand warming waters, magical symbiosis between the living and the called. <words>219</words> Each frame matched the next in an unfolding sequence, showing how small, seemingly meaningless actions could cascade into transformation. <words>236</words>

The coffee grinder's mechanism clicked to a stop, its contents now fine powder ready for brewing. <words>251</words> Kira smiled with gentle sharpness, finally seeing how her gift for summoning could serve something beyond her own comfortable apathy. <words>268</words> The studio around her hummed with residual dream energy, the god's final breath having awakened possibilities she'd been too enthusiastically lazy to notice before. <words>287</words>

She began her first summoning in months, calling not to ancient spirits of power, but to the small, patient entities that understood coral growth and oceanic healing. <words>308</words> The frames glowed brighter as her magic unfolded through them, each one showing a different reef beginning its slow resurrection. <words>325</words> River wisdom had taught her that the strongest currents move with deceptive gentleness, carrying sediment and life to where they're needed most. <words>343</words> As she worked, Kira realized that sometimes the most profound changes come from those who care just enough to keep turning the handle, one grain at a time. <words>368</words> The empty frames were full now, each matching vision a promise that laziness and purpose could dance together in the slow, essential work of healing worlds. <words>390</words>
