The unsteady sentinel swayed against the rusted bulkhead of the abandoned space freighter docking bay, his augmented legs struggling to maintain balance as distant tremors shook the station. <words>26</words>

Above him, the strange automaton bird perched on a corroded beam, its brass wings folded tight while copper eyes tracked his movements with mechanical precision. <words>47</words>

"You feel it too, don't you?" he whispered to the bird, watching through the viewport as two massive worlds crawled toward their inevitable collision, their gravitational dance pulling apart the very fabric of space around them. <words>81</words>

The sentinel's coyly furious expression betrayed his inner turmoil—part bitter amusement, part seething rage at the cosmic joke unfolding before them. <words>100</words>

For decades, he had stood guard over this prophecy, believing it foretold salvation rather than destruction. <words>116</words>

The bird's head tilted, then it opened its beak to release a cascade of shredded paper fragments that fluttered down like metallic snow. <words>135</words>

With trembling hands, the sentinel began collecting the pieces, recognizing the torn remnants of ancient letters that had guided his faith for so long. <words>155</words>

As he worked by the eerie light of the approaching worlds, reassembling each fragment with desperate precision, the true message slowly emerged from the chaos. <words>176</words>

"I recommend," the bird suddenly spoke in a voice like grinding gears, "that you read more carefully this time." <words>192</words>

The sentinel's breath caught as the reassembled letters revealed their secret: the prophecy had never promised salvation—it had warned of necessary destruction, the clearing away of old worlds to birth new ones. <words>221</words>

His cheerless ecstasy bubbled up like poisoned wine as understanding flooded through him. <words>234</words>

The fog of his misguided interpretation finally lifted, revealing the terrible beauty of cosmic truth. <words>248</words>

He had been guarding not against the apocalypse, but for it. <words>259</words>

The automaton bird spread its wings as the docking bay shuddered more violently, debris raining from the ceiling as the worlds' gravitational pull intensified. <words>280</words>

"The ambush of fate," the sentinel laughed bitterly, watching the letters crumble to dust in his hands. <words>296</words>

All those years of faithful service, believing he protected something precious, when he had actually been ensuring its destruction. <words>314</words>

The bird took flight, circling once before disappearing into the shadows between the massive support struts. <words>328</words>

Through the viewport, the worlds touched at last, their surfaces buckling and reforming in waves of molten light. <words>344</words>

The sentinel closed his eyes, feeling the station begin its final descent toward the newborn star being forged from planetary collision. <words>364</words>

In the distance, he could hear the automaton bird's mechanical song, a funeral dirge for old worlds and a birth cry for what would emerge from their ashes. <words>387</words>

His duty was finally complete, the prophecy fulfilled through his unwitting guardianship of destiny's perfect trap. <words>402</words>
