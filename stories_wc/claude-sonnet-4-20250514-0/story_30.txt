Captain Zara traced the ancient tapestry fragment with trembling fingers, its woven dragons seeming to pulse beneath starlight filtering through the navigation room's viewport. <words>23</words> The medieval cloth held inscriptions in a lost agricultural dialect her grandmother had whispered about during planting ceremonies on their ancestral farm. <words>41</words> Now, aboard this stolen merchant vessel drifting through the Epsilon Nebula, those sacred secrets felt both impossible and essential. <words>57</words>

Her telekinetic dice clattered across the star charts, their weighted cores responding to her desperate concentration. <words>71</words> Each roll revealed coordinates where the old farming worlds might still exist, planets where the ancient soil-singing languages hadn't been erased by corporate terraforming. <words>89</words>

"The symbols flame to life when I focus," she murmured, watching ethereal fire dance across the tapestry's threads. <words>104</words> Her crew thought her obsession with preserving agricultural wisdom was madness, but Zara understood the philosophically practical truth: without the old ways, humanity would starve among sterile stars. <words>127</words>

The dice spun without her touching them, guided by intuition bred through generations of high-stakes gambling. <words>141</words> Her great-grandmother had planted oak saplings for each family birth, whispering seed-songs in the forgotten tongue while tiny hands learned to coax life from earth. <words>161</words> Those same words now pulsed within the tapestry's golden threads, a linguistic DNA preserved in wool and prayer. <words>177</words>

"Computer, analyze these coordinates," she commanded, her telekinetic focus splitting between dice and navigation console. <words>191</words> The ship's systems hummed, cross-referencing her grandmother's whispered stories with stellar cartography. <words>202</words> Three systems registered positive: worlds still practicing the old agriculture, still speaking the soil-songs. <words>216</words>

Sacred disorder ruled her thoughts as memories of harvest festivals collided with the chaos of her pirate life. <words>232</words> She'd stolen this ship not for treasure, but to preserve something infinitely more valuable than gold. <words>247</words> The tapestry fragment had cost her everything in a midnight game against a museum curator, the dice dancing to her will until victory was assured. <words>268</words>

Now the navigation computer chimed success. <words>275</words> The first coordinates led to Verdania, where farming colonies supposedly maintained pre-exodus traditions. <words>287</words> Zara's telekinetic energy made the dice hover like tiny planets, each facet reflecting her determination. <words>301</words> She would find the keepers of the lost languages, learn their earth-singing secrets, and carry her grandmother's wisdom to whatever worlds would listen. <words>321</words>

The tapestry's dragon eyes seemed to approve as flame-like energy coursed through its ancient fibers. <words>335</words> Her family's tradition lived on: instead of planting trees, she would plant knowledge across the galaxy, one forgotten word at a time. <words>354</words> The dice settled into a perfect formation, pointing toward humanity's agricultural future hidden among the stars. <words>369</words>

"Set course for Verdania," she whispered, honoring both sacred tradition and necessary rebellion. <words>381</words> The lost languages would not die with her generation, not while she could still make the dice dance and dragons flame. <words>400</words>
