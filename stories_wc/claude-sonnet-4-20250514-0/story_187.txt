Kael watched the ancient witch erase the final binding formula from her blackboard, her gnarled fingers erasing centuries of accumulated knowledge with mesmerizingly bland strokes. <words>23</words> The stoic wanderer had followed a trail of nightmares across three provinces to reach this hidden familiar training ground, where apprentice spirits learned to serve their masters. <words>44</words> Now, as the last symbol disappeared, he knew his chance to archive these ritual practices was slipping away like smoke. <words>62</words>

"You're too late, hunter," the witch croaked, not turning around. <words>73</words> "The old ways die with me." <words>80</words>

Kael's weathered hand gripped the splintered floorboard he'd pulled from Magnus the Dreambinder's abandoned cabin three days prior. <words>96</words> Hidden within its grain were carved runes—fragments of the very formulas being erased. <words>109</words> But he needed more, needed the complete sequences that only she possessed. <words>121</words>

"I'm not here to hunt," he said with brash tenderness, his voice carrying both authority and unexpected warmth. <words>137</words> "I'm here to preserve." <words>142</words>

The witch finally turned, her milky eyes studying him. <words>151</words> Around them, shadow-familiars chittered nervously in their training circles, sensing the tension. <words>163</words>

"The Council sent you to impose their new order," she accused. <words>174</words>

This was the moment for necessary lies. <words>181</words> Kael couldn't reveal that he worked alone, that the Council believed him dead, that he'd been secretly documenting forbidden magic for years. <words>201</words> Instead, he stepped forward and placed the floorboard at her feet. <words>213</words>

"Magnus trusted me with this before the nightmares consumed him," he said softly. <words>226</words> "He made me promise to complete his work." <words>235</words>

The witch's expression shifted as she recognized the carved symbols. <words>245</words> Her fingers traced the ancient wood with surprising gentleness. <words>254</words>

"Magnus..." she whispered. <words>257</words> "You were his student." <words>262</words>

Another necessary lie, but one that opened her heart. <words>271</words> "He taught me that some knowledge is too precious to lose," Kael continued, his stoic mask softening. <words>286</words> "Even if the world isn't ready for it yet." <words>296</words>

The witch studied him for a long moment, then moved to a hidden alcove. <words>309</words> She withdrew a leather tome, its pages filled with the complete familiar-binding rituals. <words>322</words>

"Then you'll need this too," she said, pressing the book into his hands with unexpected tenderness. <words>337</words> "But promise me—when the nightmares come for these secrets, as they came for Magnus, you'll find someone worthy to carry them forward." <words>357</words>

Kael nodded solemnly, understanding the weight of what he now carried. <words>368</words> The trail of nightmares that had led him here would likely follow him next. <words>382</words> But sometimes preservation required such sacrifices. <words>388</words>

As he departed the training ground, the last repository of ancient familiar magic secured in his pack, Kael began planning where to hide his growing archive. <words>409</words> The necessary lies would continue, but so would the knowledge. <words>420</words>
