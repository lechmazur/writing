Evangeline Thorne adjusted her silk mourning dress as she stood before her computer screen, meticulously updating her late client's social media profiles with final memorials. <words>24</words> As the city's most glamorous undertaker, she understood that death in the digital age required preserving both body and online presence. <words>42</words>

Her fingers paused over the keyboard as she opened her family's archived messages from Great-Grandmother Cordelia, the first Thorne to practice their peculiar tradition. <words>61</words> While other funeral directors relied on modern tools, the Thornes had always used an ancient brass measuring tape to elongate the deceased through careful positioning, creating the illusion of height and dignity that families desperately sought. <words>91</words>

Evangeline felt fruitlessly patient as she watched her assistant mix paint for tomorrow's viewing, the prussian blue and ivory combining into the perfect shade of eternal serenity. <words>116</words> She had been waiting three years for the Funeral Directors Association to acknowledge her family's methods, but they remained dismissive of anything beyond their sterile protocols. <words>141</words>

The myth of ordinariness plagued her profession—people assumed undertakers simply processed death like factory workers. <words>156</words> They couldn't fathom the artistry, the sacred responsibility of transforming loss into something beautiful. <words>170</words> Cordelia's archived letters spoke of this same frustration: "We are sculptors of farewell, darling, not mere technicians." <words>186</words>

Evangeline's motivation to preserve ancient practices burned fierce and joyful, even as grief surrounded her daily work. <words>202</words> Each use of the brass tape honored generations of Thornes who had elongated not just bodies, but moments of grace for the bereaved. <words>222</words> The measuring tape itself was a marvel—tarnished green but still perfectly calibrated, its numbers worn smooth by countless gentle hands. <words>242</words>

As paint fumes filled the preparation room, Evangeline uploaded another memorial post, her jeweled fingers dancing across keys with practiced elegance. <words>261</words> The social network archive would preserve these digital epitaphs long after the brass tape lost its precision. <words>278</words> She felt jubilant remorse watching the paint swirl—joy for continuing Cordelia's legacy, sorrow that so few understood the profound intimacy of their calling. <words>301</words>

Tomorrow she would use the family measuring tape again, extending Mrs. Patterson's frame with the same reverence Cordelia had shown a century ago. <words>322</words> The brass would gleam under fluorescent lights as Evangeline worked her inherited magic, elongating more than flesh—elongating dignity, memory, love itself. <words>342</words> She posted a final tribute online, then closed the archive with trembling satisfaction. <words>355</words> The myth of ordinariness would never touch the Thorne legacy; she would ensure their ancient artistry survived in both brass and pixels. <words>375</words> As the paint reached perfect consistency, Evangeline smiled through her tears, knowing Cordelia would approve of this digital preservation of their sacred calling. <words>396</words> The measuring tape caught the light, ready for tomorrow's transformation. <words>407</words>
