The cavern orchard grew silent beneath the moon as Mira descended the mosaic path, her lantern casting restless shadows across the underground trees. [24] She was a conjurer by practice, though secretive by nature, and she had told no one about the work she conducted here after nightfall. [47] The stalactites above dripped their mineral-rich water in patient rhythms, nourishing apple trees that had never known sunlight yet bore fruit the color of pale honey. [73]

Three years ago, her brother Eli had walked deeper into these tunnels and never emerged. [87] No body surfaced from the underground rivers. [94] No final word arrived via the message-bats that navigated the cavern systems. [106] The healers called it ambiguous loss, a grief without confirmation, a door left permanently ajar. [120] Mira called it an equation she couldn't solve. [129]

She'd come here originally to search, then to mourn, then to understand. [142] Now her motivation had crystallized into something stranger: to understand the mathematics of emotion itself, to map the formulas that governed love and absence. [165] She believed, in her gently inventive way, that feelings followed patterns as precise as any spell. [181] If she could only find the right variables, perhaps she could make sense of what remained. [196]

In her pocket, she carried a taxidermist's glass eye pair, amber-gold with dark pupils. [211] They'd been meant for a fox Eli never finished, found on his worktable beside half-empty jars of preserving salts. [229] Sometimes she held them up to fissures in the cavern ceiling where moonlight seeped through, watching the eyes fracture the silver light into mathematics she almost understood. [256]

Tonight she stopped at the central stepping stone where Eli had laid his finest mosaic work. [272] Years of footsteps and mineral deposits had chipped the colored tiles, wearing new patterns into the original design. [290] Mira had learned to read meaning via the chipped patterns on this mosaic stepping stone, the way others read tea leaves or bird flights. [313] The damage wasn't random; it followed stress fractures in the glaze, revealing the stone's hidden architecture. [329]

She knelt and placed the glass eyes at the pattern's center, arranging them to face opposite directions. [346] Her spell required precision, a way to dovetail emotion with incantation, grief with geometry. [360] She'd attempted this ritual many times, each failure teaching her something new about the angles of loss. [377]

The dripping stalactites marked time around her. [384] Moonlight shifted through the ceiling cracks as clouds moved in the world above. [397] The orchard's peculiar trees stood witness, their roots drinking from underground streams, their branches heavy with fruit that tasted of minerals and patience. [421]

Mira began whispering the calculation she'd devised, watching the mosaic's broken patterns as she worked. [436] The glass eyes warmed beneath her fingertips. [443] And then, for the first time in three years of trying, something answered. [456]

Not Eli himself, she knew immediately. [462] Nothing so simple as resolution. [467] Instead, the patterns seemed to rearrange themselves in her understanding, showing her how the pieces of her grief could dovetail together without forcing closure. [488] Ambiguous loss, she suddenly realized, wasn't a problem demanding solution but a relationship requiring tending. [502]

The brother she couldn't confirm gone still existed in the mathematics of her continued becoming. [516] Every memory was a variable, every unanswered question a constant that shaped her trajectory. [530] The equation didn't solve for his return; it solved for her survival alongside the not-knowing. [545]

A buried optimism rose in her chest, unexpected as spring water. [556] She had believed that understanding meant finding answers, but perhaps understanding meant learning to hold questions without crumbling beneath their weight. [575] Perhaps love persisted in the calculation itself, not in the solution. [587]

Mira gathered the glass eyes and stood, her joints stiff from kneeling on stone. [601] Above her, stalactites continued their patient nourishment, drop by drop by drop. [614] The apples hung luminous in the lantern light, growing toward nothing yet growing still. [628]

She would return to the surface carrying the same uncertainty she'd always carried. [642] But now it felt like something she'd chosen rather than something inflicted upon her. [656] The mathematics of emotion, she understood at last, wasn't about closure. [668] It was about the patterns that emerged from damage, the beauty that arose from incompleteness, the way broken things could still hold together if you learned their new geometry. [695]

She walked the spiral path upward, footsteps echoing among silent trees. [707] Tomorrow she would tend the orchard again. [714] Tonight, she would sleep without dreaming of answers that never came. [725] The glass eyes clicked gently in her pocket, seeing nothing, remembering everything. [737] And somewhere in the deeper tunnels, water continued to fall. [748]
