Vera stood at the center of the abandoned control room, her breath visible in the diminishing cold. [17] Water dripped steadily through cracks in the ceiling where decades of ice had begun surrendering to spring. [34]

"And now," she announced to no one, her voice echoing off dead monitors, "the glassblower prepares her materials with the precision of a surgeon and the hope of a fool." [64]

This was her method—dramatically narrating the mundane—a habit she'd developed during the long frozen years when silence threatened to swallow her whole. [88] It kept her thoughtfully spirited when despair would have been easier. [99]

She arranged her portable torch, the salvaged silica, the copper oxide for color. [112] The control panels around her were relics from when this facility had monitored weather systems, back when people believed they could still command the climate rather than simply survive it. [142]

"She selects the cracked leather bookmark," Vera continued, lifting the worn object from her pocket, "not as a tool, but as a reminder." [165]

The bookmark had belonged to her father, a man who'd spent his final years documenting everything he knew about making things—useful things, beautiful things, things that could hold light. [195] She'd found it marking a page in his notebook about creating vessels strong enough to preserve seeds, medicine, curiosity. [214]

Above her, ice groaned and shifted. [220] The thawing had accelerated these past weeks. [227] Rivers were returning. [230] People were emerging from their shelters, blinking at a world made new and terrible and possible again. [247]

"The glassblower heats the rod," she narrated, flame roaring blue, "transforming rigid silica into something that bends to intention." [266]

This was why she'd claimed the abandoned control room. [275] Not for its dead machines, but for its space, its high ceilings, its central location where three migration routes would converge once the passes cleared. [300] She was building something here—not just glass, but a safe zone for inquiry. [314] A place where wanderers could stop and ask questions without fear. [325] How do we purify water? [330] How do we grind lenses? [335] How do we begin again? [340]

Her father had understood this. [345] The thawing heart, he'd written in that notebook, requires containers for its questions before it can hold answers. [363]

She'd been frozen too, she knew. [369] Not just by the endless winter but by grief, by the necessity of mere survival. [384] Now something in her was softening alongside the glaciers, dangerous and necessary. [396]

"The artisan must know when to shape," she murmured, turning the molten glass, "and when to abandon control." [414]

That word—abandon—had terrified her once. [421] Her mother had abandoned them early. [427] The world had abandoned sense. [432] She'd nearly abandoned hope a hundred times in the dark years. [443]

But watching the glass take form, she understood abandon differently now. [454] Sometimes you had to release your grip to let something become what it needed to be. [470] The glass couldn't be forced into beauty. [477] Neither could people. [480] Neither could this strange new era being born from ice and patience. [492]

She finished the piece: a simple vessel, clear with threads of green running through it. [507] Tomorrow she would make another. [512] And another. [514] By the time the passes opened, she would have dozens—containers for seeds, for medicines, for the questions people would bring. [535]

"And so the glassblower sets down her work," she concluded softly, "in an abandoned room that refuses to remain empty." [555]

Outside, water ran in channels it hadn't touched in thirty years. [566] Somewhere, a bird called—the first she'd heard since autumn. [576]

Vera tucked the cracked leather bookmark back into her pocket, its familiar weight against her hip. [592] Her father had bookmarked a page about resilience, about materials that could withstand thermal shock. [607] She was still learning that lesson. [613]

The control room dripped and echoed around her. [621] But it was warming, and she was here, and tomorrow someone might come with questions she could help them hold. [641]

The ice was melting. [645] So, finally, was she. [649]
