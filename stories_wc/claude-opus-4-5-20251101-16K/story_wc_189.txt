Mira had spent forty years watching the spaces between—the moments when water neither advanced nor retreated, when creatures held their breath between two worlds. [27] She called herself a tidal-pool chronicler, though others used different names, some respectful, others not. [42] Tonight she sat in the ancient grotto beneath the fractured ceiling of stone that opened to stars, where her grandmother had sat before her, and her grandmother's grandmother before that. [68]

The young woman across from her had stopped speaking. [77] The question she'd asked still hung in the salt air: whether her father would survive the winter. [92] Mira understood why the silence stretched so thin it might snap. [103] Some questions demanded direct answers that direct answers could never provide. [114]

In her palm, Mira turned the jade cicada, its wings carved with such precision that light passed through them like stained glass. [133] Her grandmother had pressed it into her hand decades ago, saying only: "This teaches patience and transformation." [149] The cicada knew seventeen years of darkness before its single summer of song. [162] It understood transition periods the way Mira understood tidal pools—as sacred, necessary passages that could not be rushed. [178]

"Your father," Mira began, then stopped, watching the young woman's face tighten. [190] She would not approach this directly. [196] That was not her way. [201]

"Have you ever watched a hermit crab between shells?" [210] Mira asked instead. [213]

The young woman blinked. [217] "I don't—no. [220] What does that have to do with anything?" [228]

"Everything and nothing." [231] Mira smiled, warmly observant of how the starlight caught in the young woman's wet eyes. [245] "There is a moment when the crab has left its old shell but hasn't yet claimed the new one. [263] Completely vulnerable. [265] Terrifying to watch. [268] But that moment—that pause—is where all possibility lives." [278]

She held up the jade cicada. [284] "My grandmother gave me this when my own mother was dying. [295] I asked her the same question you're asking me now." [306]

The young woman's breath caught. [311]

"She didn't answer me directly either," Mira continued. [319] "She spoke about cicadas instead. [324] How they spend years in darkness, becoming something new. [333] How their emergence isn't an ending or a beginning but a doorway between." [346] Mira paused, feeling the cool weight of the jade against her skin. [358] "I hated her for it. [363] I wanted certainty." [366]

"Did your mother survive?" [370]

"For three more springs." [374] Mira closed her fingers around the cicada. [381] "But that isn't what matters now. [387] What matters is what I learned about the texture of time—how it isn't smooth but ridged, full of these threshold moments where everything could go either way." [412]

The grotto breathed around them, the distant sound of waves marking rhythms older than human grief. [426] Mira had learned to foresee not through prophecy but through this tangential approach, circling toward truth like water circling a drain. [445] The future revealed itself in patterns: in tidal pools, in cicada songs, in the pauses between words where fear and hope wrestled silently. [466]

"Your father is in a transition period," Mira said finally. [476] "I cannot tell you which shore he will reach. [485] No one can. [488] But I can tell you that these between-spaces are not empty—they are where transformation happens. [503] Where love becomes its own kind of time." [511]

The young woman reached out, and Mira placed the jade cicada in her palm. [525]

"Watch the tidal pools tomorrow," Mira said. [532] "See how the creatures there live in the pause between worlds, neither fully sea nor fully shore. [548] They do not fight the uncertainty. [554] They become part of it." [559]

For a long moment, neither spoke. [565] The pause in their difficult conversation had become its own territory, vast and strange and somehow sacred. [580] Above them, through the grotto's ancient opening, stars wheeled in their slow migration across the sky—another transition, another threshold, another patient becoming. [601]

The young woman's fingers closed around the jade cicada. [610] "Will you teach me to watch the way you watch?" [620]

Mira nodded, recognizing in that question the same hunger that had driven her own life—the need to discover not what would happen, but how time itself moved through the living world, textured and tender and terribly beautiful. [657]

"Come at dawn," she said. [662] "When the tide turns. [666] That's when the in-between reveals itself most clearly." [675]

They sat together as the stars shifted overhead, two chroniclers now—one old, one newly born—holding space for all the uncertain, precious transitions yet to come. [700]
