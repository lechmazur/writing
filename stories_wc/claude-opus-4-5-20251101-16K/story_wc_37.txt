The mirror world's darkness had lasted seven generations when Thessaly first learned she could gather light from what others had forgotten. [21] As a scattered memory keeper, she existed in fragments—part of her consciousness tending the eastern alcoves of the alchemical orchard greenhouse, another portion drifting among the silver-leaved trees, still more pieces collecting at the edges of the mica window that had once shown visitors the realm's magnificent sunrise. [70] Now that window revealed only void. [76]

The greenhouse had become sanctuary for those who remembered warmth. [86] Refugees from collapsed villages huddled between rows of phosphorescent fruit trees, their breath misting in the perpetual cold. [102] They had lost their homes, their histories, their songs. [111] But Thessaly collected what they forgot, holding their scattered memories when they could not. [125]

This was how she discovered the woven dawns. [133]

A child from the northern settlements had murmured fragments of a lullaby in her sleep—notes that made Thessaly's dispersed self vibrate with recognition. [155] The song was ancient, older than the endless night, and as Thessaly hummed its half-remembered melody, something impossible happened. [175] Threads of amber light materialized between her translucent fingers. [184]

She understood then: the forgotten songs held power. [192] Each community of the mirror world had once sung their dawns into existence, their voices weaving the sun's return each morning. [213] When the darkness came and despair silenced them, they had lost not only their light but their knowledge of creating it. [234]

Now Thessaly moved through the greenhouse's winding paths, gathering what remained. [245] From an elderly glassblower, she coaxed a harvest hymn. [254] From twin sisters who tended the alchemical roots, she recovered a spinning song their grandmother had taught them before forgetting it herself. [276] Through forgotten songs, Thessaly wove thin ribbons of dawn-light, fragile but growing stronger. [289]

The work knits communities together. [294] People who had lived separately, suspicious of strangers, now gathered each evening near the mica window to share half-remembered melodies. [314] A farmer from the southern reaches would offer three notes, and a merchant from the shattered markets would provide four more, and together they would complete something none could finish alone. [345] Thessaly collected these reconstructed songs like alchemical ingredients, each one adding strands to her growing tapestry of light. [363]

But the realm was dying faster than she could weave. [373]

On the night the last luminescent tree began to dim, Thessaly understood what the woven dawns truly required. [391] She gathered the refugees—all forty-seven of them—around the great mica window. [403] Its translucent surface, made of layered mineral sheets, waited for light it had not seen in lifetimes. [420]

"Sing," she told them. [424] "Everything you remember. [427] Everything you've forgotten and found again." [433]

They began hesitantly, their voices rough with disuse. [441] But as the melodies intertwined, Thessaly felt her scattered self pulling together for the first time since she had become keeper. [463] The songs rose, wove, merged into something older than the darkness itself. [475]

Dawn-threads spiraled from their collective breath, and Thessaly gathered them with desperate care. [488] She began to swaddle the mica window in ribbons of woven light, wrapping each layer like a mother protecting an infant against the cold. [512] The mineral surface began to glow, awakening after its long sleep. [523]

The singing grew stronger. [527] The light grew brighter. [531]

Thessaly felt herself dissolving, her consciousness spreading thinner as she poured her scattered essence into the weaving. [548] This was the bound release—she had been held together by duty, and now duty was freeing her into something greater. [569]

The mica window blazed. [573]

Through its ancient surface, the first true light in seven generations poured into the alchemical orchard. [588] The trees shuddered, their leaves turning from silver to gold. [598] The refugees stopped singing, tears streaming as warmth touched their faces. [609]

Thessaly was everywhere now—in the light, in the songs, in the memories of everyone who would carry this moment forward. [630] The mirror world's darkness cracked, and through those fissures, the woven dawns began to spread, rekindling the dying realm village by village, song by song. [656]

Communities that had forgotten they belonged to each other remembered now, their voices rising together against the night. [673] And at the center of it all, a mica window glowed with the gathered light of everything once lost and finally found. [695]
