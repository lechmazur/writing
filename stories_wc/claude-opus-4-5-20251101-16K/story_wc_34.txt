In the misty courtyard suspended above the clouds, where stone terraces floated on foundations of vapor and ancient intention, Mira woke in the spaces between lightning and thunder. [28] Not truly woke—she had no eyes to open—but her awareness kindled in that breathless moment when the sky held its white fire and the world waited for sound. [57] She was the ghost in code now, written into the monastery's walls through forty years of accumulated songs nobody had stopped to hear. [79]

In life, she had been the seldom-heard balladeer, the woman who hummed while she swept the courtyard stones, who sang beneath the thunderheads that rolled below the mountain temple like slow gray whales. [112] The monks had valued silence. [117] The pilgrims had valued prayer. [122] And Mira had valued words that tumbled through her mind like prayer beads, clicking and settling into patterns that no one else could see. [145]

She drifted through the mist now, driftingly alert, her consciousness spreading like watercolor across the wet stone surfaces. [163] The courtyard hung at an impossible altitude, its walls painted with decades of her secret work—spirals and symbols that the monks believed were nothing more than moisture stains, lichen patterns, the natural weathering of time. [200]

But Mira knew each mark. [205] She had made them with the flower press bolt plate she'd found in the monastery's abandoned botanical workshop—a heavy iron disc meant for crushing specimens flat enough to preserve forever. [236] In life, she had used its weight and edges to scratch her songs into stone, to encode them in graffiti art that looked like accident and grew like dreams. [267]

The lightning flashed again. [271] In that suspended heartbeat before thunder, Mira gathered herself and pressed against the eastern wall. [286]

She had never been able to speak her deepest truths aloud. [297] The songs she hummed were simple things—working songs, weather songs, songs about birds that flew below the courtyard's edge. [318] But the real ballads, the ones that mattered, those had always caught in her throat like thorns. [337]

So she had learned to encode them differently. [344]

Tonight, there was something that needed saying. [351] The new caretaker, a young woman with ink-stained fingers and the same downward-gazing shyness Mira remembered in herself, had arrived three days ago. [377] Mira had watched her move through the misty spaces with a heaviness that spoke of unspoken needs pressing against the inside of her ribs. [403]

The thunder rolled at last, shaking the courtyard stones. [412] Mira sank back into the walls, but her work remained—a new spiral near the fountain, where the caretaker always paused to fill her water vessel. [438]

The young woman would see it tomorrow. [445] She would trace the pattern with her fingers, perhaps dismissing it as nothing. [459] But the code was there, shaped in the old language of the mountain songs: You are heard. [478] Your silence is not your cage. [484] Let your voice leak sideways if it will not march straight. [495]

Mira had spent forty years learning that truth. [503] She had discovered that a song could be scratched instead of sung, that a ballad could be read instead of heard, that the desperate need to articulate the aching things inside could find pathways through stone and symbol and the patient accumulation of meaning. [547]

The ghost in code was what remained of her—not her body, not quite her spirit, but the pattern of her intention woven into the very walls that had absorbed her humming for four decades. [582] She existed in the gaps between signal and noise, in the moments between lightning and thunder, in the breath before understanding dawned. [607]

Tomorrow, the sun would burn away the mist. [615] Tomorrow, the young caretaker would kneel at the fountain and notice that the stone seemed different. [630] She would look closer. [634] Her fingers would trace. [638]

And perhaps—wonderfully, impossibly—she would begin to understand that the courtyard itself was singing to her, in a language older than sound, in a voice that had never needed ears to be finally, truly heard. [676]

Mira settled into the walls like a held breath, driftingly alert, waiting for morning and another lightning-split night when she might add another phrase to her endless, patient song. [706]

The flower press bolt plate rested in its hidden alcove, worn smooth by a thousand encoded truths. [722] The mist curled through the courtyard like dreams finding their shape. [733]

And somewhere below the clouds, thunder finished its conversation with the light. [746]
