The letterpress operator known only as Vesper worked in the topaz workshop when the third star vanished that night. [18]

She stood at her press, the crystalline walls catching the diminished starlight in fractured amber patterns. [33] The workshop had been carved from a single massive topaz centuries ago, a relic of when stars were plentiful and the mathematics of emotion remained a mystery worth solving. [61]

Vesper reached for the halo fragment that hung above her type cases. [73] It pulsed with borrowed light—not her own light, she had none, not anymore. [86] The fragment had belonged to something celestial once, before it fell through the atmosphere between vanishing stars and landed in her garden of equations. [108]

She was a cryptic woman by necessity, not choice. [117] Her words, when she spoke them, arrived wrapped in deliberate ambiguity, designed to disorient those who sought simple truths. [134] This was her method, her protection. [140]

"Who are you tonight?" asked the apprentice, Lumen, who sat counting the remaining stars through the skylight. [156]

Vesper paused, fingers hovering over the lead type. [164] She had borrowed the personality of a grieving mathematician that morning—had worn his anguish like a coat, felt the precise geometry of his loss. [187] Now she could feel his formulas settling into her chest, the way sorrow described a perfect parabolic curve. [204]

"I am the sum of everyone I've been," she answered, which was true and deliberately unhelpful. [219]

This was transposed empathy: not feeling with someone, but feeling as someone. [231] Vesper had discovered long ago that emotions followed mathematical principles, but she could only perceive those principles by inhabiting other selves. [250] She borrowed personalities the way others borrowed books—temporarily, compulsively, with the intention of learning something essential. [265]

The halo fragment was her instrument. [271] When pressed against the type, it transferred the borrowed emotions into the very metal, imprinting them onto paper. [288] Her pamphlets didn't just convey information. [294] They transmitted experience. [297] Readers found themselves suddenly devastated by a stranger's divorce, exhilarated by a child's first snowfall, paralyzed by an old woman's fear of dying alone. [319]

"Another star," Lumen said quietly. [324] "That's four tonight." [327]

Vesper didn't look up. [331] She knew the stars were vanishing because the universe was forgetting how to feel. [344] The celestial mathematics were unwinding. [349] This was why she worked so feverishly, printing pamphlet after pamphlet, distributing emotional equations to whoever would read them. [367]

If she could map every human feeling—chart its angles, measure its velocity—perhaps she could teach the cosmos to remember. [385]

The press clanked and groaned as she pulled the lever. [395] The topaz walls hummed in resonance, their golden facets multiplying the starlight that remained. [410] The lucid turbulence of her work consumed her: everything was clear, every movement precise, yet chaos swarmed beneath the surface of each printed page. [435]

"Why do you do this?" Lumen asked, not for the first time. [446]

Vesper lifted a fresh page, still warm with transferred grief. [456] "Because empathy is the only mathematics that matters. [464] And if I transpose enough of it—if I can make others feel what others feel—perhaps the stars will stop forgetting." [483]

She hung the page to dry beside a hundred others, each one carrying someone's borrowed soul. [499]

Above the workshop, another star trembled, hesitated, and then winked out. [511] Vesper felt the loss in her chest—a sharp crystalline ache, like topaz fracturing. [524] She couldn't tell anymore if the feeling was borrowed or her own. [536] Perhaps, after so many transpositions, there was no difference. [545]

She picked up the halo fragment and pressed it against her heart, absorbing whatever light it still held. [562] Tomorrow she would borrow someone new—perhaps a child, perhaps a dying astronomer. [575] She would learn the shape of their feelings, transcribe them into lead and ink, and send those feelings out into a darkening universe. [596]

Between vanishing stars, in her topaz workshop, the cryptic letterpress operator continued her impossible arithmetic. [610] Each pamphlet was an equation. [615] Each borrowed personality was a variable. [621]

And somewhere in the mathematics, she believed, lay the answer to why the stars still shone at all. [639]
