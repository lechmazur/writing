The carnival's lights had dimmed three days ago, leaving behind only the ghost-glow of emergency strips along the terminal's corridors. [20] Maya pressed her palm against the cold duraglass window, watching the last shuttle tracks fade into the rust-colored desert beyond. [40] The Stellaris Spectacular had moved on to greener colonies, taking with it the only crowds this spaceport had seen in eighteen years. [62]

She was here to survey structural damage for the reclamation committee—a straightforward internship assignment that had become anything but. [82]

The abandoned spaceport passenger terminal stretched before her like a cathedral built for departures that never came. [99] Dust motes drifted through angled light from shattered skylights. [108] Departure Gate Seven still displayed a flight to Kepler-442b, frozen mid-countdown since the industry collapse. [123] Maya walked beneath vaulted ceilings where holographic advertisements flickered in broken loops, advertising resort planets that had long since been abandoned themselves. [145]

Her engineering tablet catalogued fractures and stress points, but her curious mind wandered deeper into the structure's architecture. [162] The original designers had been ambitious—perhaps too ambitious. [171] She traced the blueprints on her screen, noting how multiple expansion projects had intersected, each team pursuing different visions. [190] A maze of intentions, she thought, built into the very bones of this place. [204] Water reclamation systems crossed ventilation shafts at impossible angles. [213] Power conduits had been rerouted so many times that the schematic looked like abstract art. [228]

It was in Maintenance Corridor 17-C that she found the box. [239]

Someone from the carnival had left it behind—a dented metal case wedged behind a defunct climate regulator. [257] Inside, wrapped in oil-stained cloth, lay a fragment of brass and glass: an explorer's sextant piece, the kind used by the first generation of stellar navigators before quantum positioning made such instruments obsolete. [291]

Maya turned it over in her hands, marveling at its weight, at the precision of its craftsmanship. [308] Etched along its arc were coordinates she didn't recognize, and a name: Chen Wei-Lin. [323] The founder of the Frontier Engineering Corps. [330] The woman who had designed this terminal's original water circulation system—the only system that still functioned perfectly after all these years. [352]

Maya felt something shift in her chest, a quiet recognition. [362]

She spent the next forty hours mapping Chen's original design philosophy, barely sleeping, driven by questions that wouldn't rest. [381] The woman had been functionally creative in ways that defied the era's conventions, using natural pressure differentials and gravity wells to move water through the station without pumps. [409] Elegant. [410] Sustainable. [411] Forgotten beneath layers of inferior modifications. [417]

The reclamation committee wanted Maya to recommend demolition. [425] The terminal was too broken, they said, too tangled in its own contradictions. [438] But as she traced Chen's flows through the chaos, Maya began to see something else: a path forward. [456]

She couldn't fix everything. [460] No one could. [463] But through redirected flows—rerouting the surviving water system to power a small hydro-turbine, which could restart the atmospheric processors in the eastern wing—she could resurrect one section of the terminal. [496] Just one. [498] Enough for a waystation. [502] Enough for travelers passing through to rest, to refuel, to remember that this place had once meant something. [519]

It wasn't the grand revival the old blueprints promised. [528] But Maya had learned to puzzle out new equations for hope, formulas that accounted for loss and limitation alongside possibility. [546] The mathematics of realistic dreams. [551]

She submitted her alternative proposal at dawn, the sextant piece heavy in her pocket like a talisman. [567] Outside, the desert stretched endless and indifferent, but the emergency lights had steadied into something that almost resembled warmth. [586]

The terminal would never be what it was. [594] But perhaps it could become what it needed to be. [604]

Maya thought of Chen Wei-Lin, charting courses through impossible distances with nothing but brass and starlight. [620] Navigation wasn't about reaching a predetermined destination. [627] It was about finding your position in the darkness and choosing a direction anyway. [641]

She chose forward. [644]
