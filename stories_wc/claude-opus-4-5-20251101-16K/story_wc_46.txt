Maren had watched the stars for forty years, her feet forever rooted to the earth's cool skin. [17] She worked in the serpentine grotto as mist curled through its winding passages, soft as breath, patient as grief. [36] The cave twisted like a living thing, its walls smooth from centuries of water's touch, and somewhere in its deepest chamber, she had made her home. [62]

Each morning, she walked to the shore where the tide left its offerings. [75] Sea glass, mostly—green and amber and blue, tumbled soft by salt and time. [89] She gathered these fragments in her apron, remnants of bottles and windows from ships long swallowed by the deep. [108]

Fire was forbidden to her now. [114] Not by law, but by memory. [120]

As memories resurfaced, Maren found herself at her workbench more often, hands moving in the old rhythms of gem polishing. [140] The motion soothed her—wheel and water, pressure and patience. [150] She'd learned the craft from her father, who had polished stones for the lighthouse keepers. [165] He'd taught her to find the light already sleeping inside each piece, waiting to be woken. [181]

The lighthouse had burned when she was seventeen. [189] Her father inside it. [193]

So Maren had sworn off fire, all those years ago. [203] But the coast still needed light. [209] Ships still foundered on the rocks when clouds swallowed the moon. [220] And she, an earthbound star watcher who could never climb to hang lanterns in the sky, had found another way. [240]

She would share light without using fire. [247]

The sea glass, polished until it gleamed, became her medium. [257] She'd discovered that certain pieces, worked to the proper curve and clarity, could catch starlight and hold it. [275] Not trap it—nothing so violent. [281] The glass simply remembered the light, the way skin remembers warmth. [292]

Maren would weigh each piece in her palm before beginning, testing its heft and promise. [307] The best fragments had a certain density, a willingness. [316] Those she polished for hours, days, until they emerged reflectively vibrant, casting back more luminance than they received. [334]

Her finest creation sat on a stone shelf in the grotto's heart: a pearl of stillness, she called it. [353] It wasn't pearl at all, but sea glass so perfectly shaped and polished that it seemed to exist outside of time. [374] In the chamber's darkness, it glowed with borrowed starlight, a soft beacon that fishermen had learned to seek when the mist grew too thick for other signs. [401]

Tonight, as she worked, memories pressed close. [408] Her father's laugh. [411] The smell of whale oil. [416] The way he'd lift her to the lighthouse gallery so she could see the beam sweep across the water, a great slow heartbeat of light. [441]

She'd thought, once, that watching stars was a lonely calling. [451] But loneliness was just another kind of mist—it obscured, but it didn't erase. [465] The connections remained, even when she couldn't see them. [474]

A new piece of glass turned beneath her fingers, cloudy with salt residue but promising underneath. [490] She polished with long, circular strokes, and slowly the glass surrendered its fog. [503] Blue emerged, deep as evening. [508]

The mist in the grotto shifted, and for a moment, starlight found its way through a crack in the stone ceiling. [529] It fell upon her workbench, upon the blue glass, and Maren held her breath. [543]

The glass drank the light. [548] Held it. [550] Began to glow. [553]

She lifted it, this newest small sun, and carried it to the chamber's entrance where the passage opened toward the sea. [574] There she set it on a natural ledge, another point of guidance for those navigating the dark waters. [592]

She didn't need fire to share light. [599] She only needed patience, and skill, and the willingness to find radiance in broken things. [614]

The stars wheeled overhead, impossibly distant. [620] But their light reached her anyway, traveling years to land softly in her palms. [634] And from her hands, through polished glass, that ancient light reached out again—to ships, to strangers, to anyone lost in the mist who needed to find their way home. [664]

Maren returned to her bench, to her wheel, to her work. [675] The grotto breathed around her, and she was still. [684]
