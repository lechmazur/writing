The package arrived wrapped in kelp and silence, settling on Maren's desk like a held breath finally released. [18]

She was the undertaker of the Drowned Archives—the forgotten underwater city library of Thessaly Below, where the dead came not to be buried but to be cataloged. [46] After forty years of this work, weariness had become her second skin, worn so long she'd forgotten the shape of her first. [68]

Inside the package: a broken lighthouse lens, cracked through its center like a wounded eye. [82]

Maren turned it in her hands. [88] Light still lived inside the glass, but wrong—fractured, desperate. [97] A distress signal frozen in crystal. [103]

She recognized the signature. [107] The Beacon of Last Words had stood on the eastern shelf for three centuries, guiding restless spirits to their final entries in the Archive's books. [131] Someone—something—had destroyed it. [135]

"I'm retired from fieldwork," she told the lens. [143] But her fingers kept tracing its cracks, inadvertently stubborn in their attention. [154] This was her curse: she could never quite let go of things that needed mending. [168] Not the broken. [171] Not the lost. [174] Not even her own exhaustion. [179]

The lens pulsed again. [183] More distress signals, weaker now. [188]

Maren sighed and descended. [192]

The library occupied impossible spaces—that was its nature and its protection. [203] Corridors existed in the gaps between water molecules. [211] Reading rooms unfolded in the pressure differentials of ocean depths. [221] Maren had learned long ago to walk sideways through reality, slipping into crevices that shouldn't hold a human body, much less a human soul. [245]

She found the Beacon's remains in the Hall of Unfinished Stories, where books wrote themselves with the memories of those who died mid-sentence. [268] Glass shards littered the seafloor, each one crying out in that strange fractured light. [281] Distress signals, dozens of them, overlapping into cacophony. [289]

Among the shards: three spirits, trapped. [295] They couldn't find their books without the Beacon's guidance. [304] They couldn't rest. [307]

This was why Maren had become an undertaker. [315] Not for the dead themselves, but for what they needed: to give rest a permanent address. [330] Every soul deserved a final entry, a last word, a place where their story could close with grace instead of fraying into silence. [352]

"I'll fix it," she said, though she didn't know how. [362]

The spirits wailed—not in gratitude, but in doubt. [370]

She gathered the shards anyway, occupying the impossible spaces between their jagged edges, pressing herself into the geometry of broken light. [390] It hurt. [392] Everything hurt, these days. [396] But stubbornness didn't ask permission; it simply stayed. [404]

In the deepest reading room, Maren laid out the pieces. [414] The lens couldn't be repaired—too much was missing, dissolved into the salt dark. [427] But perhaps it could be revitalized. [433] Given new purpose in old bones. [439]

She opened her own archive entry—the book that had been writing itself since her birth, recording every burial she'd performed, every spirit she'd shelved. [465] Forty years of endings, dense as prayer. [472]

Maren pressed the broken lens to the pages. [480]

Light bled between them. [484] Her weariness, her stubbornness, her desperate need for others to find the peace she'd never quite touched herself—the lens drank it all. [506] Not taking. [508] Transforming. [509]

The cracks remained, but they glowed now with purpose instead of pain. [520] A new beacon, born from borrowed light. [527]

She carried it back to the Hall of Unfinished Stories. [537] The three spirits turned toward its glow, and Maren watched them drift—finally, gently—toward their waiting books. [553] Pages turned. [555] Stories ended. [557] Rest found its permanent address. [562]

The library settled into chased stillness: not the absence of motion, but motion that had finally caught what it pursued. [580]

Maren sat among the shelves, the repaired lens warm in her lap. [592] Distress signals still pulsed through the water—there were always more—but softer now, like heartbeats instead of screams. [609]

She was still weary. [613] Still inadvertently stubborn. [616] Still the undertaker of the Drowned Archives. [622]

But for this moment, in this impossible space, the stillness had stopped running. [634]

And so had she. [638]
