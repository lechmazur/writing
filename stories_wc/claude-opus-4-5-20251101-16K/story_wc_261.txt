Vera woke in the quiet tower at dawn, the anesthesia wearing off in slow waves like fog lifting from a valley. [18] Through the frosted window, the sky held that meteor hush—the silence of something vast passing overhead, leaving the world below breathless. [39] She was a closure seeker by trade, though her clients called her something crueler: the one who opens wounds. [55] For years she had examined their scars—surgical, accidental, self-inflicted—and told them the stories written there. [69] But to read, you must first trace. [76] To trace is to touch. [81] To touch old wounds is to open them again. [90]

Now she lay in this tower, bearing a fresh scar of her own, the tumor excised but its absence burning beneath the bandages. [112]

The ivy on the walls spoke to her. [120]

She didn't understand it at first—a murmur like static, like wind through impossible lungs. [134] *We tunnel,* the ivy said. [139] *Through mortar and time, we tunnel toward light.* [148]

Vera closed her eyes, wondering if the drugs still gripped her. [159] But no. [161] Her mind felt sharp now, clearer than it had been in months. [173] Accidentally telepathic with plants—the surgeon's notes hadn't mentioned this side effect. [184]

On the bedside table sat a frosted hourglass, left by the tower's keeper, an old woman named Sol who brewed coffee strong enough to wake the dead. [209] The hourglass was cold to touch, its sand frozen mid-fall, suspended like doubt. [222] Sol claimed it measured something other than time. [231]

"Miracles," Sol had said the night before, her voice like dry leaves, "sometimes land in the wrong place. [247] Like letters delivered to a dead man's house." [255]

Vera remembered now. [258] There had been another patient—a botanist named Iris, dying in the room directly below. [271] Iris had prayed for one thing: to hear her garden speak before the end, to know if her thirty years of tending meant anything at all. [296] But Iris died on the table, and the miracle arrived moments late, displaced upward through the tower's stone, landing instead in Vera's unwilling mind. [320]

A displaced miracle. [323] A gift for a ghost. [328]

Vera sat up slowly, wincing at the pull of stitches. [338] On Sol's abandoned coffee cup, rings layered like tree bark, like growth patterns of something living and patient. [354] She'd learned to read futures in such things—by examining coffee rings, the overlapping stains left by a cup set down and lifted through long nights of watching and waiting. [381] The rings showed her fragments: Iris's final hours, the hope that brightened her failing eyes, the surrender that followed, the miracle that missed its window by thirty-two seconds. [406]

*You seek closure,* the ivy whispered, its voice tunneling through stone and silence. [418] *But we know you. You open.* [424]

Vera looked at her bandaged torso. [430] Her whole life had been devoted to reading others' scars, driven by the motivation to learn to read the stories in scars, as if bodies were libraries and pain was text. [459] Now she had her own chapter to study. [467]

Her purpose had always been selfish, she realized. [475] To analyze was to distance. [480] To seek closure for others was to avoid confronting her own gaping wounds. [492]

The frosted hourglass began to thaw. [498]

Sand moved—just a grain at first, then a whisper of more, then a gentle cascade. [513] The miracle was accepting her as its reluctant host, warming to her grief. [525]

*Tell them,* the ivy urged. [530] *Tell Iris's garden that she loved them. We tunnel to each other across miles, root speaking to root. We remember. The network will carry your message.* [555]

Vera understood then. [558] This was the closure she could finally offer—not to the dead, but from them. [571] She would become a conduit between worlds, between miracles displaced and hearts abandoned, tunneling through the boundary that separates the living from the lost. [593]

She pressed her palm against the wall where the ivy threaded through ancient cracks. [606] She felt the vast green network beneath the city, roots speaking to roots across parks and graveyards and private gardens tended by grieving hands. [627]

"She loved you," Vera whispered, her voice cracking. [635] "Iris loved you until her last breath and beyond it." [645]

The response came like rainfall on stone: gratitude, grief, and the quiet persistence of growth. [659] Somewhere across the city, a garden stirred, leaves turning toward a sun that felt different now, warmer somehow, touched by acknowledgment. [680]

Dawn broke fully, light flooding the tower in gold and rose. [691] The meteor hush lifted, replaced by birdsong and the gentle rasp of ivy climbing higher. [706]

Vera touched her scar through the bandages, finally ready to read its story. [718] She traced its edges, felt its heat, listened to what it wanted to say. [732]

It whispered: *You opened others to heal yourself. [740] Now open yourself to heal them.* [747]

She let the tears fall, watering the ivy at her fingertips, and began. [760]
