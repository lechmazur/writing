The elevator groaned upward through the icebound spire, and Mira pressed the worn leather journal against her chest. [18]

She had found it that morning, tucked beneath the floorboards of Captain Aldric's old quarters—the room she cleaned every week despite no one having lived there for three years. [48]

The diary was encrypted, filled with symbols she couldn't decipher. [58]

But she had also found the goggles. [65]

Mira held them now, the brass rims cold against her fingertips. [76]

They had been her mother's once, before the accident that sent her airship spiraling into the cloud sea below. [95]

Captain Aldric had worn them for thirty years before that, navigating storms and sunsets from the spire's docking platforms. [114]

The elevator passed the second floor, its cage rattling against ice-crusted walls. [126]

Mira was warmly inquisitive by nature—the other servants teased her for it, the way she asked questions about everything, the way she lingered over letters and ledgers left carelessly on desks. [158]

She couldn't help herself. [162]

Every person carried a story encrypted inside them, and she had always believed that understanding was a form of love. [182]

Third floor. [184]

She opened the diary carefully, watching the pages unfold like wings. [195]

The symbols remained meaningless, a code designed to keep secrets buried. [206]

But through the frosted windows of the elevator shaft, dawn light began to pierce the ice. [222]

Fourth floor. [224]

The spire was beautiful in morning, Mira thought with affectionate detachment. [235]

She had lived here all twenty-three years of her life, climbing and descending, serving and cleaning. [251]

She loved it the way one loves a childhood home—completely, but from a distance that acknowledged its limitations. [270]

Fifth floor. [272]

The light shifted. [275]

Fractured by ice crystals embedded in the shaft walls, it scattered into prismatic ribbons that danced across the diary's pages. [295]

Mira gasped. [297]

Where the scattered light touched the symbols, they transformed. [306]

Hidden text emerged beneath, written in invisible ink now made visible. [317]

Her hands trembling, Mira lifted the captain's goggles to her eyes. [328]

The rose-tinted lenses were designed for navigating the blinding brightness above the clouds, but here they filtered the chaos of refracted light into something readable. [353]

Sixth floor. [355]

"Today I buried my husband," the first visible passage read. [365]

"The spire masters gave me his ashes in a tin box. [376]

I stood at the docking platform and let the wind take him into the clouds. [391]

I thought I would feel only grief. [398]

Instead, I remembered how he laughed at my terrible jokes, how he burned every breakfast he ever made, how he once got lost in a spire he'd lived in for twenty years. [430]

I wept, but I was also smiling." [437]

Seventh floor. [439]

Mira's throat tightened. [442]

She turned pages, chasing the scattered light across entries spanning years. [453]

Aldric had written about loss after loss—friends who disappeared into storms, a daughter who chose the ground over the sky, a body that slowly failed him. [480]

But buried within every anguish, he had recorded something else. [490]

Eighth floor. [492]

A violet sunset glimpsed between thunderheads. [498]

The taste of honeyed tea after a long journey. [507]

A servant girl—her mother, Mira realized—who asked so many questions that he finally started keeping this diary just to capture the answers she helped him find. [535]

Ninth floor. [537]

"I am dying," the final entry began. [544]

"I have hidden this diary where only someone curious enough might find it. [557]

If you are reading this, you are seeking something. [566]

Perhaps you are seeking the same thing I sought all my life—the joy that lives beneath anguish, small and stubborn and absolutely necessary. [590]

It does not erase the pain. [596]

It simply sits beside it, like light scattered through ice, revealing what was always there." [611]

The elevator shuddered to a stop. [617]

Tenth floor. [619]

Mira removed the goggles and pressed them gently against the diary's final page. [632]

Outside, the sun had fully risen, painting the ice in gold and rose. [645]

Below, the cloud sea stretched infinite and soft. [653]

Somewhere beneath it, her mother's airship still rested in whatever grave the sky had made for her. [670]

She missed her. [673]

She would always miss her. [678]

But she was also smiling. [683]

Mira tucked the diary into her apron pocket and stepped out of the elevator, ascending once more into the bright and frozen morning, carrying with her a captain's final gift: the permission to hold sorrow and gladness in the same trembling hands. [725]
