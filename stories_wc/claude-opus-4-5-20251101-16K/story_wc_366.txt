Maren had been delivering supplies to Gull Point Light for seventeen years before she learned the stones were letters. [19] She was not the sort who asked questions. [27] Reticent by nature, she piloted her skiff through fog and storm, unloaded crates of oil and salt pork, accepted the keeper's nod as sufficient conversation. [52] But she noticed things--always had. [58] The way Keeper Thorvald's hands trembled in autumn. [66] How he arranged pebbles on the eastern ledge in patterns that changed with the tides. [80] She filed these observations away like sea charts, warmly observant of a man who spoke as little as she did. [98]

The anonymous letter chain began, she later understood, decades before her time. [110] Keepers came and went at Gull Point--some driven mad by isolation, others simply swallowed by the hungry sea. [127] Each left messages in stacked stones for whoever followed: warnings, confessions, small kindnesses encoded in granite and basalt. [144] A vertical stack meant peace. [149] Horizontal meant beware. [152] Three stones descending westward: I am lonely tonight. [160] It was a language without names, a way of reaching across time to protect the next soul who would tend this flame. [180]

Thorvald had been the last. [185]

The night the lamp flickered out, Maren was already rowing toward the lighthouse, though no signal had called her. [202] She told herself it was the falling barometer, the need to check his stores before the storm. [218] But her hands knew. [222] After seventeen years, her hands always knew. [229]

The lantern room was cold when she climbed into it. [239] Thorvald lay beneath the great Fresnel lens, his face turned toward the mainland he had watched for forty years. [256] The lamp above had surrendered its final breath, leaving only the ghost-light of the moon through salt-crusted glass. [272] They said the lantern room was haunted--every keeper who died here left something of themselves behind. [288] Maren felt them now, crowding gentle in the darkness: all those anonymous souls who had stacked their hearts into stone. [306]

In Thorvald's curled fingers, she found a piece of sea glass. [317] It was the green of deep water, of kelp forests, of the world beneath the waves where drowned men found new names. [338] She pried it loose and held it to the dim window, watching light filter through in trembling shades. [355] She understood. [357] He had meant to add it to his final stack--a color the stones had never held, a way of saying something the old language lacked. [381]

Maren built the message herself. [386] Three stones descending, for the loneliness he had carried. [394] A horizontal warning, for the winters that could kill. [403] Then the sea glass balanced at the apex, catching what light remained: I was here. [417] I mattered. [419] Remember. [420]

She stayed until dawn bled through the storm clouds. [429] The lighthouse would be decommissioned now--she knew this as certainly as she knew the tides. [444] No keeper would come to read Thorvald's final letter. [453] Yet Maren found she could not leave it unfinished. [462] She thought of all the keepers before, reaching through decades to protect strangers they would never meet. [477] She thought of the safety this beam had meant to fishermen lost in the dark, how they must have felt when that golden sweep found them. [503]

That was what she wanted to bottle. [510] Not the light itself, but the feeling of being found. [520]

She would return each month, she decided. [527] She would add to the stones, continue the chain. [536] Let the ghosts in the lantern room know they were not forgotten. [548] Let any soul who stumbled here understand that someone had stood watch, had noticed, had cared enough to build small cairns against the vast indifference of the sea. [576]

Maren descended the spiral stairs as the sun rose, the sea glass warm in her pocket. [592] Behind her, the Fresnel lens caught the morning and scattered it into a thousand fractured rainbows--one final luminous ache, a ghost-lamp burning bright. [616]
