Maren had spent her life drawing creatures that no one else could see: the translucent moths that drank moonlight, the fish that swam through stone. [27] As a natural history illustrator, she catalogued the invisible margins of the world, filling journals with specimens of impossible biology. [44] But she had never found the one thing she sought most: the birthplace of echoes. [58]

The infinity symbol pendant around her neck hummed warm against her collarbone. [70] Her grandmother had claimed it could sculpt time itself, bending moments like soft clay between careful hands. [85] Maren had dismissed this as senility until the day she accidentally paused a hummingbird mid-flight, its wings frozen in iridescent stillness while she sketched. [106]

Now she stood at the edge of the rooftop canal system that wove between the city's ancient towers, watching the Giant of the Eastern Ridge settle into sleep. [133] His body curved across the horizon like a mountain range finding rest. [145] His breathing changed the pressure of the air, and his dreams would last perhaps three hours. [160] Three hours to navigate the waterways, find the Source Cavern, and return before his waking footsteps shattered the delicate canal network. [178]

She pushed her small skiff into the current. [186] The canals ran copper-bright beneath her, channeling rainwater and starlight between spires that had stood for centuries. [201] Here, where the city touched the sky, the world operated by different rules. [214]

The pendant pulsed, and Maren understood its mechanism at last. [224] She could not create time, only borrow it, pulling seconds from the future and spending them now. [240] Every moment she sculpted would be owed back eventually. [249] She hoped she would live long enough to repay the debt. [260]

The first time-lock appeared at the junction of four towers: a frozen waterfall where the canal should flow. [277] Someone had interrupted the natural cadence here, breaking the rhythm that kept the waters moving. [291] Maren touched her pendant and pushed, borrowing three seconds to restart the cascade. [304] The water remembered its purpose and flowed again. [312]

More interruptions followed. [315] At each junction, the cadence had been deliberately broken, creating a labyrinth of frozen moments. [329] Someone wanted the Source Cavern protected. [335]

As she navigated deeper, Maren understood why. [342] She heard them first: voices layered upon voices, the original sounds that all echoes descended from. [357] They were singing, or had been, until the song was caged. [368]

The Source Cavern opened beneath a tower of white stone, and there she found them. [383] Hundreds of echo-spirits hung suspended in temporal amber, their mouths open in interrupted song. [396] They were luminous, barely corporeal, and heartbreakingly beautiful. [404] Someone had frozen them mid-note, silencing the source of all the world's reverberations. [416]

Maren's fingers flew across her sketchbook, documenting what she witnessed. [426] This was why silence had crept into the valleys, why mountains no longer answered calls. [440] The echoes could not be born because their parents were imprisoned. [451]

She pressed the infinity pendant with both hands and borrowed deeply. [462] Time rushed through her like a river, minutes pulled from her future flooding into the present. [477] She felt herself age, felt possibilities close, felt the weight of debt accumulating. [490]

But the amber cracked. [494]

The first echo-spirit broke free with a sound like glass singing. [505] Then another, and another, their interrupted cadence finally resolving into harmony. [516] They spiraled upward through the tower, relearning their ancient song, and Maren wept as she drew them. [532]

The Giant's breathing shifted. [536] He was stirring. [539]

She raced her skiff back through the canals, the echo-spirits accompanying her, their voices filling the spaces between towers. [555] They dove into the water, into the stone, into the air itself, resuming the work of repetition that gave the world its depth. [576]

Maren reached the canal's edge as the Giant opened his eyes. [587] His first waking breath scattered clouds, but the waterways held. [597] The uncaged echoes absorbed the sound of his movement, carrying it outward in endless beautiful repetition. [612]

She examined her reflection in the canal water and saw silver threading through her hair. [627] The borrowed time had taken its toll. [634] She was older now, measured in minutes she would never reclaim. [645]

But her sketchbook held new wonders. [651] The echo-spirits danced across her pages, the first illustrations ever made of their kind. [665] She had found where echoes were born, and she had set them free to sing again. [681]

Above her, the towers resonated with returning voices. [689] Every sound now had its answer, every call its response. [699] The interrupted cadence was complete at last, and the world remembered how to listen to itself. [715]

Maren smiled, touched her pendant, and began the long walk home, her footsteps followed by faithful, singing shadows. [732]
