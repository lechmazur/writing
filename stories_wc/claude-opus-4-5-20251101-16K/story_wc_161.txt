Elara had trained courier pigeons for eleven years, but only in the attic for three—since the fire, since the lies, since she became someone else entirely. [28]

The vintage bookshop below belonged to her grandmother on paper, though that grandmother had never existed. [42] Elara had reinvented her personal history with forged documents and careful omissions, leaving paper trails that led nowhere, erasing the ones that led back to the woman she'd been: Miriam Voss, soprano, daughter of the famous composer who stole melodies from dying languages and called them his own. [91]

She kept his victims' songs in her memory. [99] That was her penance—to preserve the echo of lost songs he'd silenced, even as she silenced herself. [117]

The attic smelled of old ink and feather dust. [126] Seventeen pigeons cooed in their coop near the window, their messages more honest than any words she'd spoken in years. [145] They carried love letters across the city for romantics who paid well, carried secrets between collectors who trusted birds more than wires. [169]

Above it all, a single skylight filtered morning into the space, and Elara performed her daily ritual: mapping the swirl of dust motes under its beam. [198]

It had started as meditation, a way to quiet her mind. [210] But it became something else—a method of teaching herself to balance between watching and being watched, between stillness and flight. [232] The dust moved in patterns she'd learned to read like music, each mote a note in an unwritten symphony. [251]

Some mornings the pattern spelled grief. [257] Others, something like hope. [261]

Today, it spelled the name of a visitor. [270]

Marcus Chen stood at the attic door, clutching a small velvet pouch. [282] She recognized him from the newspapers—ethnomusicologist, crusader for indigenous rights, the man who'd exposed her father's theft five years ago and sent her world into flames. [309]

"You're hard to find," he said. [315] "Miriam." [316]

The name struck like a bell. [322] Her pigeons startled, wings thrashing. [327]

"That's not my name." [331]

"I know what you've done. [336] The paper trails—impressive work, really. [341] But a collector in Prague mentioned a soprano who vanished after your father's disgrace. [354] One who knew all the songs he'd stolen." [362]

She should run. [365] She'd rehearsed this moment, planned escape routes. [372] But running meant abandoning the pigeons, the attic, the fragile peace she'd constructed. [385]

"What do you want?" [388]

He opened the pouch and withdrew a small dark stone, veined with rust-red. [401] "A Mars meteorite chip. [405] It belonged to a woman named Kaya Oren—Tuvan throat singer, one of your father's victims. [419] She kept it as a reminder that even things from impossible distances can find their way to us." [436]

Elara's throat tightened. [439] She remembered Kaya—her laugh like water, her voice like wind across frozen steppes. [452] Her father had recorded her songs and claimed them as reconstructions from dead civilizations. [465]

"She died last month," Marcus continued. [470] "Left instructions. [472] The meteorite goes to whoever can sing her grandmother's lullaby correctly. [483] She said you would know it." [489]

The dust motes swirled. [493] Elara watched them trace their ancient choreography, blooming in the light, withering into shadow, blooming again. [508] Everything cycled. [510] Everything returned. [512]

She had spent three years learning not to sing, not to trust, not to be found. [526] But preservation meant more than memory—it meant voice. [535]

Slowly, Elara began to sing. [540]

The lullaby emerged rough at first, unused muscles remembering forgotten shapes. [551] But then it rose, pure and aching, the melody Kaya's grandmother had sung to her, the melody Elara's father had stolen and repackaged, the melody Elara had kept alive in secret for years. [586]

Marcus's eyes filled. [589] The pigeons settled, listening. [593]

When she finished, he placed the meteorite in her palm. [603] It was cold, impossibly dense, a piece of another world that had traveled millions of miles to rest here, in an attic full of paper and birds and a woman rebuilding herself from ashes. [637]

"There are others," Marcus said. [642] "Other songs. [644] Other singers who need someone to remember them." [651]

Trust was a muscle too, Elara realized—one that atrophied with disuse, one that required daily practice, like mapping dust motes, like training birds, like learning to balance between the person you were and the person you might become. [693]

She looked at the meteorite, then at the skylight, then at this stranger who had found her and offered something other than destruction. [715]

"Tell me about them," she said. [721]

Outside, a pigeon launched itself toward the city, carrying someone's secret heart. [733] Inside, Elara began the slow, blooming work of letting hers be found. [745]
