The umbral grotto hung suspended in eternal twilight, cradled by clouds that moved like slow breath. [16] Mira had been its caretaker for longer than she could measure in mortal terms—seasons didn't touch this place, and neither did clocks. [38] She was tending to the garden when the new soul arrived. [49] They always came the same way: confused, translucent, carrying the weight of their last breath. [64]

"Am I dead?" the woman asked. [70]

"Resting," Mira said, her voice carrying that kindly decisiveness the souls seemed to need. [84] "Between what was and what will be." [91]

This was her purpose now—guiding souls through the cycle of rebirth, preparing them for new lives. [108] She understood the necessity of forgetting, of shedding old griefs so fresh ones could grow. [123]

The antique hairpin caught her eye. [129] The woman wore it still, threaded through phantom hair—jade and gold, with scalloped edges that caught the grotto's dim light. [150] Mira recognized it instantly. [154] She had given that hairpin to her daughter, thirty years and countless rebirths ago. [168]

Her hands did not tremble. [173] She had learned stillness. [177]

"That's beautiful," Mira said, touching the scalloped curves of jade. [187]

"My mother gave it to me. [193] I never knew her—she died when I was three. [203] But I kept it always." [208]

The vineyard hush of the grotto seemed to deepen. [217] Mira had tended these clouds since forgiving the unforgivable—since accepting that her daughter's father had taken their child and disappeared, that he had fed the girl lies about her mother's death, that he had stolen a life Mira should have lived. [260] She had climbed the great tree at the grotto's center to think better, its roots drinking from clouds, its branches piercing into starlight. [283] She had sat among its silver leaves for what might have been decades, turning her rage into something quieter. [302]

Forgiveness had not come easily. [307] It had come necessarily. [311]

And now her daughter stood before her, soul-soft and waiting, and Mira made her decision with the same kindly firmness she applied to all souls. [337]

"You lived well," Mira said, reading the woman's essence. [346] "You were loved. [349] You loved." [351]

"I tried." [353]

"That's all any of us do." [359]

She guided her daughter to the pool at the grotto's heart, where souls slipped into new bodies, new chances. [377] The woman—her daughter—did not recognize her. [385] The cycle required forgetting. [389]

"Will I remember anything?" [393]

"Feelings," Mira said. [396] "The shape of love, if not its face. [404] The sense that somewhere, someone is watching over you." [413]

The woman smiled—and oh, it was Mira's own smile, reflected back through a lifetime of separation. [430]

"I feel that now," her daughter said. [437] "I've always felt it." [441]

Mira removed the hairpin gently. [446] "This stays. [448] Physical things don't cross over." [453]

"Will you keep it safe?" [458]

"I will." [460]

Her daughter stepped into the water, dissolving into possibility. [469] Somewhere below the clouds, a baby would draw first breath carrying an old soul toward new contentment. [486]

Mira climbed the great tree afterward, settling into her thinking branch. [497] She turned the hairpin in her fingers, its scalloped jade warm now with transferred memory. [512]

She had forgiven her daughter's father because hatred would have consumed her purpose. [525] She had become this grotto's caretaker because lost things needed tending. [536] But she had never found the source of contentment she sought—only glimpses, moments like vineyard stillness before harvest. [555]

Perhaps contentment wasn't a destination. [560] Perhaps it came in cycles too, blooming and fading, requiring its own rebirth. [573]

She would wait. [576] She would tend. [579] And when her daughter's soul returned again—as all souls eventually did—she would be here, kindly and decisive, ready to guide her home once more. [605]

The hairpin caught the starlight, scalloped edges gleaming like small smiles. [616]

Mira kept her vigil in the hush. [623]
