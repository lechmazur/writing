The court seer had delivered the final warning three days past, her voice cracked like dry riverbed: "The dreams will devour you, Majesty, if you seek their source." [31]

Queen Thessaly had listened. [35] Then she had stopped listening. [41]

Now she began to climb. [46]

The path to the ember grotto on the ridge revealed itself in switchbacks carved by pilgrims who had stopped believing centuries ago. [68] Thessaly understood them—that hollow space where faith once lived. [78] She had ruled for seventeen years, watched her kingdom flourish into something that no longer needed her hands to guide it, and found herself disenchanted with the very crown that had once felt like purpose made manifest. [113]

The recurring dreams had started in winter: that impossible blue cavern suspended above clouds, the light that dripped like wound-water from distant stars. [137] Each night the vision grew sharper. [143] Each morning she woke with the taste of copper on her tongue and the certainty that answers waited in the heights. [163]

Her attendants had begged. [167] Her advisors had threatened resignation. [172] After the final warning, they had simply grown silent, watching her prepare her climbing gear with the resignation of those who serve rulers touched by fate or madness. [199]

The ridge air thinned as she ascended. [206] Her breath came in silver plumes, her will softly commanding her body to continue despite burning lungs and trembling limbs. [224] This was the attribute she had cultivated through decades of court intrigue—that gentle authority expecting obedience from flesh as readily as from subjects. [247]

Hours dissolved. [249] The world below vanished into a white sea of clouds. [259]

Then she saw it. [263]

The cobalt grotto above clouds opened like a wound in the mountainside, its walls shimmering with that impossible blue from her dreams. [283] Thessaly stepped inside, and the temperature shifted—not warmer, but differently cold, as though the air itself came from some other realm. [305]

She was not alone. [309]

A figure waited at the grotto's heart: a woman made of shadows and starlight, her outline fraying at the edges like old lace unraveling. [332] There was menace in her beauty, threat woven through her elegance. [344]

"You received the warnings," the figure said. [351] "Three of them, as tradition demands." [357]

"I received them." [360] Thessaly's voice echoed against blue stone. [366] "I came anyway." [369]

"Why?" [370]

"To unravel the mystery of recurring dreams." [377] The queen moved deeper into the cavern. [384] "You have been calling me. [389] I would know why." [393]

The shadow-woman smiled, and her smile was a blade wrapped in silk. [406]

Above them, through a fissure in the grotto's ceiling, the sky had darkened to reveal stars—but stars bleeding, weeping trails of luminescence that dripped like honey, like tears, like the slow hemorrhage of dying light. [443] Bleeding starlight pooled on the cavern floor, and where it touched, the blue stone turned to ember, glowing with captured heat. [464]

"I am what waits when queens grow tired of queening," the figure said. [477] "I am the path not taken, the crown never worn, the woman you might have been." [493]

Thessaly understood then. [496] The dreams had not been summons but mirrors. [504]

The shadow-woman extended her hand. [509] "Breathe with me. [512] See what I see." [516]

They stood at the grotto's edge where stone met sky, clouds churning far below like a frozen ocean. [533] As twilight deepened, small lights began to rise from the mist—fireflies, impossibly, at this altitude, in this cold. [551] The first fireflies of summer, ascending like souls departing earth. [561]

A shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer bound them together in that breath—the queen and her shadow becoming one perception, one understanding. [583]

"The dreams end when you choose," the figure whispered. [592] "Return to your throne and forget. [598] Or stay, and become something else entirely." [606]

The bleeding starlight continued its slow descent, painting ember paths across cobalt stone. [618] Lacy menace hung in every shadow, every glimmer—the beautiful threat of transformation, of losing the self one had built to find the self one had buried. [646]

Thessaly watched the fireflies dance against the wounded sky. [655]

She had been disenchanted for so long, hollow in her gilded halls. [667] Perhaps disenchantment was simply the first step toward re-enchantment—toward magic that demanded more than she had been willing to sacrifice. [688]

Slowly, deliberately, the queen removed her crown. [695] It clattered against stone, ordinary metal now, nothing more. [704]

"I choose," she said, and her voice carried the softly commanding certainty of someone finally speaking truth. [720]

The shadow-woman's smile widened. [724]

The stars continued to bleed their ancient light, and somewhere far below, a kingdom slept, dreaming of a queen who would not return. [746]

In the cobalt grotto above clouds, transformation began its patient, terrible work. [758]
