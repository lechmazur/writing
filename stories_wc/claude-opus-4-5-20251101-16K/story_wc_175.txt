The grotto hung between earth and sky, a pocket of green suspended in the clouds. [14] Mira had tended this place for seventeen years, though "tended" suggested permanence she did not possess. [29] She was transiently rooted here, like the mosses that clung to stone only until the next hard rain. [46]

She was what the old texts called an esoteric realist—one who believed in the hidden orders of the world but approached them with the practicality of a carpenter measuring twice before cutting. [77] Magic existed, certainly, but it followed rules. [85] It left traces. [88] It could be documented. [92]

Today, she was building. [96]

The structure rose from the grotto floor like a delicate skeleton—birch twigs, dried grasses, threads of spider silk she had gathered at dawn. [120] She worked methodically, each knot tied with intention. [129] This was her method: building temporary structures as signals, ephemeral architecture meant to catch the attention of those who moved between worlds. [152]

In her pocket, wrapped in cloth, she carried a single moth wing. [164] It had belonged to a Xerces blue—a species extinct now for eighty years, overlooked in its dying, mourned by almost no one. [187] She would weave it into the structure's heart. [196]

This was the timeframe that mattered: the migration of the last monarch butterfly. [209] The scientists had confirmed it last month—population collapse complete, no recovery possible. [221] Somewhere below the clouds, the final generation was making its journey south, following a map written in their blood that they would never pass on. [247]

Mira worked in blushing stillness, the only sounds her own breath and the soft creak of twigs accepting their new shapes. [269] The verdant grotto seemed to hold itself quiet, as if embarrassed by its own lush beauty in the face of such loss. [292]

She understood interrupted cadence now. [297] She had spent years expecting resolution—the pattern would continue, the monarchs would return, the world would remember what it had been given. [318] But some melodies simply stopped. [323] The expected note never came. [328] You were left hanging in the space where completion should have lived. [340]

Her fingers knotted another joint, and another. [348] The structure grew into something resembling a doorway, or perhaps a cage with no bars, or perhaps a prayer made visible. [369] She did not name her creations. [375] Naming suggested understanding, and she had learned that honoring something meant accepting you might never fully comprehend it. [393]

The moth wing emerged from its cloth wrapping, iridescent even in the grotto's green-filtered light. [408] She positioned it at the structure's center, securing it with a final knot. [421] A memorial for one forgotten species, built during the death of another. [433] This was why she did this work: to honor overlooked histories, to create markers for the passages no one else witnessed. [454]

The clouds below shifted, and for a moment, golden afternoon light poured up through the grotto's mouth. [470] Mira held still. [473] She watched. [475]

Nothing came. [477] No butterfly. [479] No sign. [481]

But this was the work of the esoteric realist—understanding that absence was also presence, that silence was also answer. [499] The structure would stand for three days, perhaps four, before weather claimed it. [513] Someone might see it from a passing plane and wonder. [523] Something might notice it from whatever realm lay adjacent to this one. [535]

Or nothing would. [538] The signal would go unreceived. [543] The cadence would remain interrupted. [548]

Mira sat beside her creation as evening gathered. [556] The clouds turned rose and amber. [562] Somewhere far below, the last monarchs were flying their ancient route for the final time, their wings beating a rhythm that had sounded for millions of years and would soon simply stop. [596]

She did not cry. [600] She was not the crying kind. [606] But she stayed, transiently rooted in this verdant space between worlds, keeping watch over what remained. [623]

The moth wing caught the fading light and held it, just for a moment, like a small blue flame. [641]

Then the clouds closed over, and the grotto returned to its blushing stillness—that tender, embarrassed quiet of a world that knows it is losing something precious but cannot seem to stop. [675]
