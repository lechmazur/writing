The tower had fallen three seasons past, and still Mira tended the roses. [13]

Within the glass-domed enclosure, the desert heat pressed against transparent walls like a living thing, creating what her father once called a "tranquil blaze" - that paradox of fierce warmth contained within stillness. [46]

She moved between the rows of desert roses, their crimson blooms defiant against sand-colored stems, and spoke to them as she always did. [68]

"Patience," she murmured, her fingers brushing a young bud. [77]

"You'll bloom when you're ready." [82]

This was her method: inculcating plants with values. [90]

It had seemed foolish once, even to her. [98]

But after the tower fell and scattered civilization like seeds across barren ground, Mira had learned that meaning could root anywhere if you planted it deliberately enough. [126]

She was senselessly perceptive - her father's words again, spoken half in admiration, half in frustration. [141]

He'd wanted her to join him in his hunting, to read prey instead of petals. [155]

But she sensed the tremor of a rootlet seeking water, the chemical whisper of a leaf detecting blight. [172]

She felt the dome's pressure shifts before storms arrived. [181]

Today, something else stirred at the edge of her awareness: footsteps approaching across the dunes. [195]

Mira straightened, wiping soil from hands calloused by peaceful labor. [205]

Her fingers drifted to the blade at her hip. [213]

Once, in the chaos after the tower fell, she had drawn it when raiders approached, then could not bring herself to strike. [234]

She had sheathed the weapon with trembling hands, vowing never to draw it again. [247]

That was her oath, her inheritance of rejection. [255]

The bounty hunter's daughter had chosen cultivation over killing. [264]

She walked to the dome's entrance and waited. [272]

The stranger emerged from the heat-shimmer, carrying only a pack and exhaustion. [283]

Young, perhaps her age, with eyes that had seen the tower fall. [294]

Everyone who wandered now carried that particular hollow weight. [303]

"The dome," he said. [307]

"I didn't believe it was real." [313]

"Most don't." [315]

Mira stepped aside, granting entry. [320]

The glass walls created an engraved quiet here, a silence carved deliberately from the world's noise. [335]

Sound behaved differently inside - softer, rounder, held. [343]

He collapsed beside her irrigation channel, drinking carefully. [351]

His pack spilled open, revealing nothing of value except a scrap of heavy fabric - airship ballast sandbag material, the weave unmistakable. [371]

Mira's breath caught. [374]

Her father had worked the airship routes before turning to hunting. [384]

She remembered the texture from childhood, the weight of those bags that kept vessels stable through storms. [400]

"Where did you find that?" [405]

"The tower's wreckage. [408]

The airships that tried to escape..." [414]

He didn't finish. [417]

Mira lifted the scrap, feeling its density, its purpose. [426]

Ballast. [427]

Balance. [428]

The thing that kept you level when winds sought to tear you apart. [440]

"May I keep this?" [444]

He shrugged, too tired to question. [450]

That night, after the stranger slept in her guest quarters, Mira worked by lamplight. [463]

She cut the ballast scrap into strips, wove them into a covering for her seed trays. [478]

Weight against wind. [481]

Continuity against chaos. [484]

This was her motivation - not merely to grow flowers in a dying world, but to weave threads between what was and what might be. [507]

In the morning, she taught the stranger her method. [516]

"You speak to them?" [520]

"I tell them what matters," Mira said. [527]

"Resilience. [528]

Compassion. [529]

The importance of growing toward light without denying darkness." [537]

She planted a cutting, pressing the soil with deliberate care. [546]

"When I'm gone, the roses will remember. [553]

They'll teach whoever tends them next." [559]

He laughed, uncertain. [562]

"Plants can't learn values." [566]

"Everything learns what we repeat." [571]

Her father had taught violence through repetition. [578]

She taught otherwise. [581]

The stranger stayed through summer, then left carrying rose cuttings wrapped in ballast scrap. [594]

Others came after. [597]

Some stayed, some didn't. [601]

Mira taught them all: how to listen to roots, how to speak to leaves, how to carry weight gracefully. [619]

The tower had fallen, and the world kept falling. [628]

But within the glass dome, where desert roses bloomed in careful rows and silence held its shape like something carved from crystal, a bounty hunter's pacifist daughter wove her quiet rebellion against entropy. [660]

She would never hunt. [664]

She would never harvest violence. [669]

She would only grow what deserved to outlast her, patient as petals waiting for their season. [684]
