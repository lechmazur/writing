The reclaimed silo library stood where grain once waited to become bread, its curved walls now holding something equally essential to what humans had been. [26]

Morrow was the historian who worked there, though colleagues—back when there had been colleagues—called her odd. [41] She did not catalog books. [46] She collected the stories walls have heard. [53]

This was after the last human dream was dreamt, in the years of bronze quiet that followed the displaced axis—that strange tilting of consciousness that left humanity awake forever, eyes open to an eternal, dreamless present. [89]

Morrow was sensitively perceptive in ways that mattered now. [98] She could press her palm to stone and feel the residue of conversations, the sediment of secrets whispered when speakers thought only air was listening. [123]

The silo's curved walls held centuries. [129] Farmers had argued about weather here. [135] Children had played in its shadow. [141] Later, when the books came and the shelves spiraled upward like a chambered nautilus, readers had wept into pages, laughed alone, fallen in love with characters who never existed. [169]

All of it remained, layered like geological strata, and Morrow was perhaps the last person alive who could read such stone. [191]

Today she worked with half-burned diaries found in a fireplace—her preferred method to probe the before-times. [207] Someone had tried to destroy these pages, and that attempt at erasure told her more than preservation ever could. [225]

The diaries had belonged to a woman named Elise, who had lived in a manor house three hundred kilometers east. [243] The fireplace where Morrow found them had been cold for forty years. [255]

Most pages crumbled at touch. [260] But Morrow was patient, and patience was the only currency that still held value. [274]

Elise had written about dragons. [279]

Not metaphorical dragons—actual ones, or the belief in them. [289] In her final entry, dated two weeks before the displaced axis shifted everything, Elise described finding a fragment of medieval tapestry showing dragons in her grandmother's attic. [316]

"The dragons looked sad," Elise had written in handwriting that grew increasingly cramped toward the charred edge. [332] "As if they knew they would be forgotten. [340] As if they dreamed of being remembered." [347]

Morrow set down the diary page and pressed her palm against the silo wall. [361]

She felt the familiar layers: grain dust and book must, laughter and grief, the particular vibration of pages turning in quiet hours. [382] But beneath it all, something else surfaced—a resonance she had never detected before. [396]

Dreams. [397]

The walls had heard dreams. [402]

Before the axis displaced, before humanity lost access to that other realm, people had dreamed in this silo's shadow. [420] They had fallen asleep against these curved walls, books in their laps, and slipped into that country of dragons and impossible flight. [443]

And the walls remembered. [447]

Morrow's eyes, dry for years—no one truly wept anymore—grew suddenly wet. [459]

She understood now why she had been drawn to Elise's burned diaries, why the mention of the tapestry fragment had quickened something in her chest. [483]

Dragons were the last symbols of the dreaming mind. [492] Fire-breathers who lived in the space between waking and sleep, in liminal territory that no longer existed. [509]

She climbed the spiral stairs to the silo's highest shelf, where uncatalogued items waited in dust. [525] There, wrapped in deteriorating cloth, she found what Elise's diary had described: a fragment of medieval tapestry showing dragons, their scales threaded in amber and bronze. [552]

Someone had brought it here after Elise died. [560] Someone had known this was where it belonged. [568]

The dragons in the weaving were indeed sad—their eyes tilted downward, their wings half-folded, as if perpetually descending from flight they knew they would never resume. [595]

Morrow hung the fragment on the curved wall where the bronze light fell warmest each afternoon. [611]

The walls would hear what she could not say: that even without dreams, the memory of dreaming persisted. [628] That dragons lived on in tapestry thread and burned diary pages and the inexplicable ache humans still felt when they stared too long at the sky. [655]

She pressed her palm to the stone one final time and felt the silo absorb her grief, her wonder, her stubborn hope. [677]

Another story for the walls to keep. [684]

Outside, the dreamless world continued its bronze quiet turning, but inside the reclaimed silo library, something like sleep descended—not true sleep, never again, but its echo, its memory, its ghost. [717]

Morrow sat beneath the dragon tapestry until the light shifted and faded. [729]

She was still there when darkness came, listening to what the walls remembered, finding everything in nothing. [745]
