The lighthouse keeper's daughter had told Maren about the library three years ago, before she stopped sitting for portraits, before she became just another face Maren couldn't finish. [32]

Now Maren climbed the spiral stairs with a broken tarot card box pressed against her chest, its hinges snapped, its velvet lining frayed into loose threads that caught on her fingers. [60]

The library existed in the space between the keeper's quarters and the lamp room—a forgotten pocket of shelves and shadow that the lighthouse's blueprints had never shown. [87] Books stood spine-out against curved walls, their titles worn to whispers. [98]

Maren set down the box. [103] Inside lay seventy-eight cards, each one a portrait she'd painted over twelve years. [116] The Fool wore her father's young face. [123] The Empress had her mother's tired eyes. [130] Every soul she'd ever captured on canvas, miniaturized and shuffled into a deck she once believed could tell fortunes. [147]

Now the images bled into each other. [154] The Hanged Man's rope had become the Hermit's lantern chain. [164] The Tower's flames consumed the Star's waters. [172] Fragmented reality—that's what the old woman at the market had called it, when Maren showed her the cards. [190] "You've put too much of them inside. [197] Now they're trying to get out." [203]

Was that even possible? [207] Did the portraits remember the people they'd stolen? [215] These were the questions Maren asked herself, knowing no answer would come, knowing she asked only to hear her own voice in this cylindrical silence. [239]

The walls seemed closer than when she'd entered. [248] She felt them—not physically moving, but pressing inward with accumulated memory. [260] The books exhaled dust and longing. [266] This was the timeframe she'd been waiting for, dreading: when the walls close in and there's nowhere left but down. [286]

Down into necessary darkness. [290]

She began by untangling threads. [295] First the velvet strands from the box's lining, laying them in parallel lines across the wooden floor. [312] Then the threads within each card—the brushstrokes she'd made years ago, the moments she'd frozen. [328] With her fingernail, she traced where colors intersected, where one person's essence had leaked into another's. [345]

The High Priestess had her grandmother's hands but a stranger's knowing smile. [357] Somewhere in the blending, Maren had lost the original. [366] How many others had she lost this way? [374] How many faces now existed only as components in this shuffled, broken deck? [386]

Outside, the lighthouse beam swept its eternal arc. [394] Each rotation sent a knife of light through the library's single porthole window, illuminating dust motes that hung like suspended souls. [414]

Maren understood now what she had to do. [422] Redesign. [423] Not repair—the box was beyond saving, and the cards had never been what she'd pretended. [437] She had to dismantle every portrait, separate each thread of identity she'd wound together in her desperate attempt to keep people with her after they'd gone. [463]

Her father was not the Fool. [470] Her father was ash in an urn on a mantle in a house she no longer visited. [487] The card had been a theft, a way of avoiding the necessary darkness of grief. [502]

She picked up the Fool first. [508] In the sweeping light, his painted eyes caught the beam and released it, a luminescent ache that made her chest seize. [528] Then she began to pull. [533]

Thread by thread, color by color, she unwound the image. [543] Blue became blue again, not her father's eyes but merely pigment. [554] The gold lost its meaning, became simply gold. [562]

It hurt like dying. [566] Like letting die. [569]

When she finished, she had a blank card and a small pile of colored threads. [583] The walls had stopped closing in. [589] Beyond the porthole, dawn was arriving, turning the sea to hammered copper. [601]

Maren reached for the next card. [607] The Empress. [609] Her mother's tired eyes. [613]

She asked herself if she was strong enough to unmake everyone she'd loved. [625] The question hung without answer, rhetorical as all the others. [634] But her hands knew what to do. [641]

By morning, she would have seventy-eight blank cards, a rainbow of threads, and a heart finally empty enough to fill with something living. [662]
