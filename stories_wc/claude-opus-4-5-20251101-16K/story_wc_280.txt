The theater closed at nine, but Margot stayed until the last tourist shuffled out, their footsteps fading like dying applause. [20] She worked the closing shift at the Avalon Estate, once home to Celeste Morrow, the great stage actress whose career ended in 1923 when she vanished during her final bow. [50]

Margot was synesthetically blessed—or cursed, depending on the day. [60] Sounds bloomed as colors before her eyes. [67] The creak of old floorboards painted amber streaks; the wind through the hedges traced silver ribbons across her vision. [86]

Tonight, those ribbons pulled her toward the hedge maze behind the main house. [99] She shouldn't have followed. [103] The maze was off-limits after hours, deemed unsafe by management. [113] But the silver threads sang with a voice she almost recognized, and Margot had spent six months on the brink of despair, wondering if anything could make her feel alive again. [145]

The hedges twisted impossibly, their paths refusing to obey the map she'd memorized. [158] Time felt strange here—elongated, fractured. [163] She passed the same stone bench three times, but each time it showed different weathering, different moss patterns. [180] Once, roses bloomed beside it. [185] Once, the roses were dead. [190] Once, they hadn't been planted at all. [197]

A fractured timeline, she realized. [202] The maze existed in multiple moments at once. [210]

At its heart, she found the orchard garden. [218] Apple trees heavy with fruit despite the autumn chill. [227] Pear blossoms falling like stage snow. [233] Impossible seasons overlapping in a sanctuary concealed from the ordinary world. [244]

And there, beneath a lantern that burned without oil, stood Celeste Morrow. [256]

The ghost shimmered between ages—young ingenue, seasoned performer, silver-haired legend. [267] Her eyes held a century of waiting. [274]

"You hear me," Celeste said. [279] Her voice tasted of copper and honey. [286] "You actually hear me." [290]

"I see you too," Margot whispered. [296] "As colors. [298] You're gold and violet, overlapping." [303]

Celeste laughed, and the sound painted fireworks across Margot's vision. [313] "Then perhaps you'll understand. [317] I've been calling for so long." [323]

She reached into her costume and produced a hand-painted tarot coin, its surface showing a wheel of fortune rendered in faded pigments. [345] "This was my grandmother's. [349] I held it during every performance for luck. [357] When I disappeared, I took it with me—through every layer of time, every version of this garden." [374]

"Why?" Margot asked. [377]

"To lure possibility from the brink of despair." [385] Celeste's form flickered. [388] "I was not the last person to lose hope in this place. [400] The maze calls to those who are breaking. [408] It brought you here tonight." [413]

Margot's throat tightened. [416] She thought of the emptiness that had followed her for months, the gray fog that made each day feel pointless. [435]

"I don't need saving," she said, though her voice cracked. [445]

"Neither did I. [448] I needed reminding." [451] Celeste began to move, her gestures theatrical, sweeping. [459] By producing echoes, she filled the garden with fragments of her past performances—not recordings, but living moments pulled from the fractured timeline. [481]

A younger Celeste sang an aria, gold ribbons streaming from her mouth. [493] An older Celeste delivered a monologue about loss, purple shadows pooling at her feet. [507] The echoes began to intertwine, threads of different lives weaving together until Margot stood at the center of a tapestry made of memory and hope. [534]

"Every performance I gave," Celeste said, "was an act of belief. [546] Belief that beauty matters. [550] That feeling matters. [553] That even in darkness, we reach for the light." [562]

She pressed the tarot coin into Margot's palm. [570] It was warm, impossible, real. [575]

"I've waited a hundred years for an audience who could truly see. [587] For a final encore." [591] Celeste's voice swelled, and Margot saw it as sunrise colors. [601] "Take this. [603] Remember that possibility never dies—it only waits for someone brave enough to reach for it." [618]

The echoes intensified, timeline fragments collapsing together. [625] Celeste performed her final bow, radiant and whole, and then dissolved into light that Margot heard as music—a symphony of closure and release. [649]

When Margot emerged from the maze, dawn was breaking over the estate. [661] Her hands trembled around the tarot coin. [668] The world looked the same, but she didn't feel the same. [679]

The gray fog had lifted. [684] In its place, she felt the first stirring of something forgotten: the belief that tomorrow could hold more than emptiness. [703] That life, like theater, deserved an encore. [710]

She walked toward the sunrise, the coin warm against her palm, carrying with her the ghost's final gift—not rescue, but reminder. [731]

Some performances end. [734] But their echoes, properly tended, can ripple forever. [742]
