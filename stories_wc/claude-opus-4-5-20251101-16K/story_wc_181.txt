The orchard bloomed silver-gold against the void, its crystalline branches heavy with fruits that resembled small, trapped suns. [20] Maren stood beneath the nearest tree, bewildered, clutching the artifact that had brought her here—or perhaps had always meant to bring her here, even before she was born. [46]

In her palm rested a pistachio shell cameo blank. [55] Simply complicated, her grandmother had called it. [62] A shell, split and smoothed, awaiting a portrait that would never be carved. [74] Or that had already been carved. [80] Or both. [82]

Nonlinear inheritance was like that. [87]

"I don't understand," Maren whispered to the luminous fruit above. [97] "I was cataloging the Meridian Collection. [103] I was organizing provenance documentation." [108]

She was a curator. [112] She dealt in what was—artifacts with histories, objects with linear stories. [124] But her grandmother's estate had operated by different rules. [134] The letter had arrived sixteen years after the funeral. [143] The key had materialized in Maren's pocket last Tuesday. [152] And this place—this astral orchard blossoming on a lonely asteroid—had existed in her memories since childhood, despite her never having visited until now. [174]

The disquiet should have overwhelmed her. [180] Instead, it brightened at the edges, shot through with terrible wonder. [191]

She walked deeper into the grove. [197]

The trees bore no labels, no plaques explaining their significance. [207] Between the first and last page of the journal her grandmother had left—a journal that began mid-sentence and ended with an incomplete word—Maren had found only this instruction: Inquire. [237]

So she did. [240]

"What is this place?" [244]

A fruit dropped. [247] Where it struck the asteroid's soft, moss-like surface, words appeared: A LIBRARY OF WHAT WAS FORBIDDEN TO KNOW. [265]

Maren's heart raced. [268] This was why she had come—not for the inheritance itself but for what it contained. [283] Forbidden knowledge had always called to her, that same hunger that made her break into restricted archives at eighteen, that drove her career into increasingly esoteric collections. [308] She wanted the buried truths, the sealed records, the names that histories had tried to erase. [323]

"Why me?" [325]

Another fruit fell: YOU ASKED FIRST. [331]

"I don't remember asking." [335]

THE QUESTION PRECEDES THE QUESTIONER. [340]

That made no sense. [344] That made perfect sense. [348] Maren rubbed her temples and noticed, between two flowering trees, a small structure. [362] Porcelain-white, improbably mundane: a bathroom. [368]

She laughed—a sound bright with unease—and entered. [376]

This was also her grandmother's legacy. [382] Philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms, the old woman had insisted. [391] Something about water, about privacy, about the liminality of such spaces. [402] Maren sat on the closed lid of a toilet that existed on an asteroid in the void between stars, and let her mind unspool. [425]

Nonlinear inheritance. [427] She had received this orchard at age five, in a story. [438] At age twenty-one, in a dream. [444] At age thirty-eight, in a letter. [450] At age forty-five—now—in the flesh. [456] She had always been inheriting it. [462] She would always be inheriting it. [468] The pistachio shell was blank because the portrait was hers to carve, but also because it already depicted everyone who had ever held it, superimposed, simultaneous. [494]

Simply complicated. [496]

She emerged transformed. [499]

The orchard seemed different now—not changed, but revealed. [508] Each tree was a question someone had asked. [516] Each fruit was an answer forbidden to speak aloud. [525] The void around the asteroid was not emptiness but the space between utterances, pregnant with meaning. [541]

Maren approached the tallest tree, where a single fruit pulsed like a heart. [554]

"What happens," she asked, "to those who learn what they were not meant to know?" [569]

The fruit did not fall. [574] Instead, it opened, revealing a mirror. [581] In it, Maren saw herself: not one self but infinite selves, inheriting this orchard across all timelines, all the questions and answers nesting inside each other like shells within shells. [611]

She understood then. [614] The forbidden knowledge was not a secret to possess. [623] It was a state of being: to exist between the first and last page, perpetually mid-story, forever asking. [641]

She tucked the pistachio shell cameo blank into her pocket. [651] Someday she would give it to someone—had already given it, would always be giving it. [667]

The orchard bloomed on, bright and disquieting, on its lonely asteroid in the infinite dark. [682]
