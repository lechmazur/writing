Mira had been a loom spinner all her life, but she hadn't touched a loom in seven years—not since her daughter Lien vanished into the fold between worlds. [28]

She found the box at a rummage sale in the village at the bamboo forest's edge: just a collection of jigsaw puzzle pieces, their edges worn soft by countless hands. [57] Something in those scattered cardboard shapes called to her, whispered of connections and completions she'd long abandoned hope of finding. [76]

Now she knelt in the forgotten orchard deep in the bamboo forest, where apple trees grew wild among green stalks, their branches laden with fruit no one would ever harvest. [104] This place existed through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry, a pocket where seasons blurred and years meant nothing. [122] Mira had discovered it while searching for any trace of her daughter, and she returned because here, the boundaries grew thin. [143]

The puzzle pieces lay scattered on the moss before her. [153] She understood now what they were—not entertainment, but a map of fractures, each edge corresponding to a tear in the fabric separating worlds. [177] Through jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box, messages could pass across impossible distance, reaching places no voice could carry. [199]

Around her, a raveling silence had begun. [206] She could hear it coming undone, thread by thread, as though her presence had started to unweave the quiet that held this place apart from ordinary time. [233] Each loosened strand of silence revealed whispers beneath—voices caught between moments, echoes of those who'd passed through this orchard before and paid the price she was preparing to pay. [263]

Mira lifted the tree sap amber bead from the cord around her neck. [275] Lien had made it for her years ago, pressing the golden drop between small palms until it hardened, stoically sparkling even in shadow. [297] Inside, a single fruit fly had been preserved—Lien had cried when she realized she'd trapped it, but Mira told her the fly would carry their love forever now. [328]

That memory sustained her as she prepared to recommence the work she'd abandoned. [340] Not weaving cloth anymore, but weaving intention—fitting puzzle piece against puzzle piece until she found the configuration that resonated with the amber's warmth. [364]

The latent sacrifice of this method was something Mira understood but refused to speak aloud. [378] Each message sent through these fractures cost something irreplaceable: a memory, a sensation, a piece of herself that could never return. [398] She had already given the taste of cherries, the sound of her mother's voice, the feeling of rain on her face. [419] These she'd traded for single words that might have reached Lien—"safe" and "waiting" and "home." [434]

Tonight, she would give more. [439]

The puzzle edges clicked into place, forming not an image but a doorway—a space between cardboard fragments that shimmered like heat rising from summer stone. [463] Mira held the amber bead to her lips and whispered every word she hadn't been able to say: the apologies, the promises, the desperate plea to return or at least send word that she still existed somewhere. [499]

The bead absorbed her voice until it glowed from within, the ancient fly casting shadows like calligraphy across its golden surface. [519] Then she pushed it through the puzzle's center, watching it hover in that between-space before being pulled gently, inevitably, into distances that had no name. [546]

The silence finished raveling completely. [551] In its absence came a sound Mira had forgotten—her own heartbeat, loud and steady, proof she remained even as pieces of her scattered across the void. [577]

She would wait here among the wild apples and whispering bamboo. [588] She would recommence this ritual as many times as necessary, giving away memory after memory until she was hollow enough for Lien's response to fill her completely. [618]

The wistful loom spinner had learned that love was a kind of weaving too—patterns thrown across impossible distance, hoping something on the other side would catch the thread and hold. [649]

Above her, the sky darkened toward evening, stoically sparkling with emerging stars. [661] Somewhere, perhaps, a golden bead was finding its way to a daughter lost but never forgotten. [677]

And Mira waited, as she always had, a mother still spinning, still sending, still willing to sacrifice everything she had left for one word in return. [703]
