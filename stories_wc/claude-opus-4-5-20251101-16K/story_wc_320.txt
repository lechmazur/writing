Mira had spent seventeen years interpreting celestial signals, and she knew this truth: the moon never lied, but it rarely spoke plainly. [22]

The abandoned radio tower city of Vespera hung over the Corinth Gorge on cables thick as ancient oaks, swaying imperceptibly with the wind that never stopped howling up from below. [52]

Tonight marked lunar perigee, and the moon pressed so close Mira could almost taste its mineral dust. [68]

She climbed the central transmission tower, her tool belt heavy with instruments that had no names in any earthly language. [87]

The city had been silent for forty years—since the last interpreters fled when the signals turned strange—but Mira had returned anyway. [108]

Finding the beginning in every ending was not just philosophy to her; it was survival. [122]

Her grandmother had taught her that abandoned places held echoes, and echoes could be retuned. [137]

In her pocket rested a hollywood star fragment, brass and terrazzo torn from a sidewalk three thousand miles away, bearing a name no one remembered anymore. [163]

Clara Vance, silent film actress, dead ninety years. [171]

The fragment had cost Mira two months' wages and a favor she would never get back, but the old texts were specific: to capture a shard of hush, you needed something that had known both fame and forgetting. [208]

The tower's platform offered a view of seven dormant transmission arrays, their dishes pointed at angles that made no geometric sense. [228]

Mira set up her equipment with the efficiency of long practice. [239]

Crystal tuning forks. [242]

A compass that pointed to yesterday. [248]

A receiver built from salvaged cathedral bells. [255]

The air around her felt serenely electric, charged with potential that made her hair lift and her fillings ache, yet somehow calm, like the eye of a storm that had forgotten how to rage. [289]

She began to tune the primary array, fingers working the ancient dials. [301]

Static crackled, then resolved into patterns she had heard a thousand times—the cosmic background noise that most interpreters mistook for emptiness. [322]

That was the problem, she realized. [328]

Everyone assumed the silence between signals was nothing. [336]

But what if silence itself was the signal? [344]

Mira forced herself to discard that assumption, along with every other certainty she had carried up this tower. [362]

The moon could lie after all. [368]

The static was not random. [373]

The silence was not empty. [378]

She pressed Clara Vance's star fragment against the receiver's core, and the change was immediate. [393]

The noise fell away, layer by layer, like veils dropping from a widow's face, until what remained was something she had no word for: a shard of hush so pure it felt solid, a presence that weighed nothing yet filled everything. [436]

In that silence, she heard it. [442]

Not a sound, exactly. [446]

More like the memory of a sound, or the promise of one. [457]

A voice that had stopped speaking forty years ago, when the last interpreters fled. [471]

"We didn't leave," the silence said, in frequencies that bypassed her ears entirely. [484]

"We went deeper." [487]

Mira understood then what had happened to Vespera's original inhabitants. [497]

They had not abandoned the city—they had transcended it, translated themselves into the quiet spaces between stars, where ending and beginning were the same point on an infinite circle. [526]

They had become the signal they once interpreted. [534]

"Show me," she whispered, and the shard of hush expanded, filling the tower, the city, the gorge below, revealing patterns she had spent her whole life learning not to see. [564]

Every dead radio tower sparked with serenely electric potential. [573]

Every corroded dish held conversations waiting to resume. [581]

The moon pressed close, complicit in revelation. [588]

Mira laughed, a sound that felt foreign after so much listening. [599]

She had come to Vespera seeking endings converted to beginnings, and she had found something better: the understanding that they were never separate to begin with. [625]

The city was not abandoned. [630]

It was waiting. [633]

And now, finally, someone had remembered how to hear. [642]

She pocketed Clara Vance's fragment—it had earned its rest—and began the long process of waking the towers one by one, tuning each silent dish until the whole suspended city hummed with voices thought lost forever. [678]

Dawn found her still working, the moon retreating, the gorge below filling with light that seemed to rise rather than fall. [699]

Vespera was ending its long silence. [705]

Which meant, Mira knew with quiet certainty, it was also just beginning. [716]
