The lighthouse below had been dark for three years now. [10] Amira remembered when old Henriksen used to climb those stairs each evening, a ritual as reliable as the tides. [28] Now the beam was automated, mechanical, stripped of human touch—like so much else in a world that had learned efficiency but forgotten tenderness. [51]

She pressed her palms into the soil of the arboretum's eastern bed, feeling the coolness seep into her skin. [68] This was how she found her way back—through somatic markers, the body's quiet language that spoke when the mind screamed too loudly. [90] The weight of earth beneath her fingernails. [97] The salt wind from the cliff's edge threading through the cypress branches. [109] The steady, ancient rhythm of her heartbeat. [116]

The crumpled photograph lived in her jacket pocket. [124] She hadn't looked at it in weeks, but she felt it there, a small weight against her hip—her sister's face, frozen mid-laugh, the henna still drying on her hands. [152] The wedding had been in a courtyard filled with jasmine. [162] The drone had come from a cloudless sky. [170]

When the memories surged, Amira would freeze. [177] Her body remembered what her mind tried to forget: the pressure wave, the silence that swallowed all sound, the way dust had settled on white lace like gray snow. [205] For months after, she couldn't hear the word "celebration" without her muscles locking, her breath catching, her vision narrowing to a single point of unbearable light. [231]

But here, perched on this seaside cliff where the arboretum sprawled in careful wildness, she had learned something different. [248] Not recovery—she distrusted that word now—but navigation. [255] A way to move through the flashbacks rather than be drowned by them. [267]

Amira was quietly talented with growing things. [273] The head botanist had noticed it first: how she could coax bloom from seemingly dead rootstock, how she understood when a plant needed water versus when it needed to struggle. [303] She never spoke of this skill, never claimed credit. [312] She simply worked, and the gardens answered. [319]

She stood now at the cliff's edge, where the observation platform jutted over the churning sea. [334] The automated lighthouse swept its beam across the darkening water—faithful, yes, but soulless. [347] The last lighthouse keeper had died in his sleep, they said, and no one had replaced him. [363] The era of human watchfulness had ended, leaving only machines to warn ships away from the rocks. [379]

Amira's fingers found the photograph. [384] She unfolded it slowly, letting the creases tell their story. [394] Her sister's face. [397] The guests gathered behind her, blurred but alive. [405] Her mother's hands reaching to adjust the bride's veil. [414]

The freeze came then, as it always did. [422] Her lungs forgot their rhythm. [427] Her spine turned to iron. [432] But this time, she let it happen. [439] Through somatic markers—the cold metal railing under her grip, the spray of salt on her lips, the solid stone beneath her feet—she found her way to what her therapist had called the pearl of stillness. [474] That small, luminous space at the center of the storm. [484] Not peaceful, exactly. [487] Not healed. [489] But present. [491]

She breathed. [493] Once. [494] Twice. [495] Three times. [497]

The photograph fluttered in the wind, threatening to escape. [506] She held it firmly. [510]

To anchor optimism in realism—that was the work now. [519] To believe that jasmine would bloom again somewhere, that laughter would ring across other courtyards, that love would still dress itself in white and make foolish, beautiful promises. [548] But also to remember. [552] To refuse the lie that forgetting was freedom. [560]

Below, the waves crashed against ancient stone. [567] The lighthouse beam swept its mechanical vigil. [574] And Amira stood in her arboretum—this improbable garden clinging to a cliff—holding the photograph of everyone she had lost, feeling the aliveness of her grief. [598]

Not despite the sorrow. [602] Through it. [604]

The wind gentled. [607] A night bird called from the cypress grove. [615] Somewhere in the darkness, seeds she had planted months ago were pushing through soil, reaching for light they could not yet see. [637]

She folded the photograph carefully and returned it to her pocket. [649]

Then she walked back to the propagation house, where seedlings waited for her quietly talented hands, and continued the patient work of tending what remained. [675]
