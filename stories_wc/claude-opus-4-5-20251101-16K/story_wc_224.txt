The mountain had devoured a thousand libraries before it was satisfied. [11] Now the Hollow Peak rose against a perpetual gray sky, its interior carved into endless corridors of shelves, staircases that folded back on themselves, and reading alcoves lit by phosphorescent moss. [42]

In its deepest chamber lived Sirel, the mercury-glass seer. [51]

Her skin caught light strangely, as though she were half-reflection, half-flesh. [62] When customers found their way to her for guidance, they often looked away quickly, disturbed by the visions that swam just beneath her surface. [86] She had worked in the labyrinthine bookstore for decades, maybe centuries—time moved differently inside the mountain, and Sirel had stopped counting years after remembering became painful. [113]

Each night, she performed the same ritual. [120] Before sleep, she would press her palms to her temples and substitute her reality, replacing the ruins of memory with invented dreams. [142] Cities she had never visited. [147] People she had never loved. [152] Histories that had never burned. [157]

This was her buried talent used against itself—the gift of vision turned inward, creating rather than seeing. [172] She had been trained to read what was, but she had taught herself to write what wasn't. [188]

The lost language stone sat on her desk, untouched for years. [199] It was a tablet of volcanic glass, its surface carved with script that no living tongue could speak. [217] Sirel had found it in the eastern wing, wedged behind a collapsed shelf, its words humming with something that felt like home. [239]

That was the problem. [243] She could not read it—would not read it—because she recognized the curves and angles. [257] They belonged to her people, her childhood, the village that had existed before the soldiers came. [272] The shape of those letters was the shape of everything she had lost. [285]

She had come to the mountain to forget, and the mountain had been generous. [299] The bookstore demanded nothing but organization, repair, guidance for lost travelers. [310] It asked no questions about who she had been. [319]

But tonight, something shifted. [323]

A scholar had visited, seeking texts on extinct civilizations. [332] When she departed, she left behind a single feather—gray-barred, soft as breath, from a bird Sirel recognized instantly. [350] The crest-wing. [352] They had nested in the eaves of her mother's house. [362]

Sirel held the feather for a long time, her mercury-glass skin rippling with suppressed visions. [377] She could feel the old gift stirring, the talent she had buried so deeply it had almost calcified. [395]

Via the texture of that feather—the impossible softness, the memory-weight of it—she understood something had changed. [413] She could not substitute this reality away. [420] The feather was too real, too specific. [427]

She carried it to the stone. [433]

Her fingers trembled as she traced the carved words, and this time she let herself read them. [450] The language rushed through her like hidden thunder, a storm that had been building for decades behind the walls of her forgetting. [472]

The inscription was simple. [476] A child's prayer. [479] The words her grandmother had taught her to speak each morning upon waking: [492]

Let me understand the shape of home, that I might carry it wherever I go. [507]

Sirel wept. [509] Her tears seeded the stone, filling its ancient channels with light. [520]

Something happened that she had not expected. [527] The words began to glow. [532] Warmth spread through the volcanic glass, and she felt her buried talent crack open at last—not the vision turned inward, but the true gift: sight. [558]

She saw her village as it had been. [566] She saw the crest-wings circling. [571] She saw her grandmother's hands, weathered and sure, pressing the same prayer into clay. [585]

Home was not a place. [590] Home was a shape she carried inside her, a geometry of love and language and loss. [606] She had tried to bury it, but it had only been sleeping. [618]

The mountain groaned softly around her, shelves resettling. [626] Somewhere in the corridors, new books would appear tomorrow—translations, perhaps, in a language scholars thought had vanished forever. [645]

Sirel pressed the feather to her heart. [652]

She would not substitute reality tonight. [658] Tonight, she would remember. [662]

And tomorrow, she would begin the slow work of teaching others to read. [675]
