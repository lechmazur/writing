Kira had flown through the stone arches of Veridian for twenty years, but she had never ventured to the planet's northern hemisphere during the Hour of Rising. [29]

The inversion began at dawn. [35] She felt her stomach lurch as gravity reversed, and her small orchard glider lifted from its mooring pad without engine power, rising instead of falling. [57] Below her—now above—the orchards hung like green chandeliers, their fruit straining upward on stems that had evolved to flex both ways. [77] This was Veridian's peculiar rhythm: one hour each day when everything that should fall chose instead to ascend. [94]

Kira was an intrepid orchard pilot, one of the few who dared navigate during inversion. [108] Most pilots grounded themselves, waiting out the chaos. [117] But the source of resilience she sought could only be found when the world turned inside out. [133]

The orchards were dying. [137] Not all at once, but grove by grove, the trees succumbed to a blight that no treatment could touch. [155] Only one grove had survived—the ancient planting near the Meridian Arch, where Kira had discovered a broken arrow tip buried among roots that refused to wither. [180] When she had touched the artifact to a dying sapling, the tree had surged with new growth, leaves unfurling in minutes, branches thickening before her eyes. [204] The arrow tip accelerated plant growth, but its power was fading, and Kira needed to find where it had come from. [223]

She followed the water. [227] During inversion, rivers lifted from their beds and flowed upward through the floating rock arches in ribbons of silver. [244] The old pilots had mapped these inverted currents centuries ago, using them as highways through the sky. [261] Navigating by water flow required patience and instinct—the currents shifted with wind and temperature, never quite the same twice. [280] Kira read their movements like language, tilting her glider to catch the spray as she wove between monolithic arches crusted with moss and vine. [302]

The whirling silence surrounded her. [307] That was what the old pilots called it—the profound quiet of inversion, when even the wind made no sound, when water flowed upward without a whisper. [332] Yet within that silence, motion spiraled everywhere: leaves rotating, stones drifting, the whole world in gentle upheaval. [349]

Ahead, the arches converged into a natural amphitheater. [358] Kira had heard legends of this place—the Gathering, where echoes collected like water in a basin. [374] She guided her glider through the final arch and cut the engine. [386]

Sound struck her immediately. [390] Voices layered upon voices, a chorus of whispers spanning generations. [400] Every word ever spoken within these stones had lingered, reflected, accumulated. [411] A gathering of echoes, preserved by some acoustic miracle of curved stone and inverted gravity. [425]

Kira drifted through them, catching fragments: prayers, arguments, songs, confessions. [435] Then one voice rose clearer than the others—a woman speaking in the old dialect, describing a ritual. [451] Kira listened, heart pounding in the soundless air. [460]

The voice described arrows shot into the heart of the planet during inversion, each tip coated with essence harvested from the oldest roots. [480] The arrows carried resilience downward—or upward, depending on gravity's whim—seeding it through stone and soil. [497] The ritual had been performed for centuries until the knowledge was lost, the arrows broken and scattered. [514]

Kira pulled the broken arrow tip from her flight suit. [524] It hummed against her palm, resonating with the echoes. [534] She understood now: the source of resilience was not a place but a practice, a cycle that needed restoration. [551] The dying orchards were not cursed; they were starving, cut off from the regeneration the arrows once provided. [568]

As the final minutes of inversion slipped away, Kira made her choice. [580] She would learn to forge new arrows, coat them with root essence, fire them into the depths during each Rising. [598] The old pilots had passed down the navigation; she would resurrect the rest. [612]

Gravity shifted back without warning. [617] Her glider dropped, caught air, and leveled out beneath the arches. [628] The silence broke into birdsong and rustling leaves. [637] Kira tucked the arrow tip safely away and banked toward home, carrying echoes with her—not just sounds, but knowledge, purpose, and the quiet certainty that some things, once discovered, could never be unfound. [673]

Behind her, the Gathering held its breath, waiting for the next inversion, the next seeker, the next voice to join its endless chorus. [696] And the orchards below, still clinging to their branches, seemed to sense that their pilot was returning with something stronger than medicine. [718] She brought them memory itself, the resilience of continuity, the stubborn echo of those who had loved these trees before her and who whispered still among the floating stones. [750]
