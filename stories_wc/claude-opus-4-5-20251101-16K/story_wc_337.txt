Mira had not always been broken. [6] Before the fire took her family's workshop, before her hands learned to tremble at the sight of uncracked porcelain, she had been whole. [28] Now she lived in the prism sanctuary beneath the mountain's hollow peak, where starlight fractured into a thousand silent colors and the walls themselves seemed to breathe with accumulated stillness. [56]

She was a mask restorer by trade, but the masks she mended were not ceramic or wood. [71] They were the faces the dead wore when they could not remember how to rest. [85]

Tonight, a young woman named Sela had climbed the seven hundred steps to find her. [99] Sela carried grief in the hollows beneath her eyes and a question she could not yet speak. [116] Mira recognized this. [119] She had worn the same expression once. [126]

"Sit," Mira said, gesturing to the cushion opposite her workbench. [136] Between them lay a fisherman's net so old its fibers had turned the color of bone. [152] The net had belonged to a man who drowned three centuries ago, and in its knots, he had tied every word he never said to his daughter before the storm took him. [182]

Sela stared at the net. [187] "You called me here. [191] You said you could help my mother find peace." [200]

"I can." [202] Mira lifted her tapestry needle, its steel length catching the prismatic light until it glowed like a sliver of dawn. [220] "But first, you must understand what I do. [229] Across the sharing of this secret, something will change in you. [240] Are you willing?" [243]

Sela nodded. [245]

Mira began to work the needle through the first knot, her movements precise despite the tremor in her fingers. [262] "Silence is not absence," she explained. [268] "It is presence. [271] Every word swallowed, every grief unspoken—they gather like sediment in the cracks of old things. [286] This net accumulates silence. [290] Generations of it. [293] The fisherman's. [295] His daughter's. [297] Her children's. [299] All the way down to your mother, who inherited the silence without knowing its source." [313]

The first knot loosened. [317] Mira felt it release—a cold whisper that brushed past her cheek and settled into the sanctuary's crystalline walls. [333] The prisms absorbed it, held it, wove it into the interlaced hush that protected this place from the screaming world outside. [353]

"My mother hasn't slept in three years," Sela whispered. [362] "She says she hears voices in the walls. [370] She says they're asking for something she can't give." [379]

"They're asking to be exhumed." [384] Mira unraveled another knot, and another presence stirred—older this time, heavier with regret. [398] "Not their bodies. [401] Their truths. [403] The restless spirits your mother hears are tangled in this net, trapped in knots their living hands once tied. [420] To ground them, we must free what they hid." [429]

The work was slow. [433] Each knot required patience, the needle threading through fibers that wanted to hold their secrets forever. [449] Sela watched in silence, and Mira understood that the girl was learning what words could not teach—that some inheritances were invisible, that some hauntings had nothing to do with malice and everything to do with unfinished sentences. [485]

"My mother never talked about her grandmother," Sela finally said. [495] "She refused to even say her name." [502]

"The silence passed down." [506] Mira freed another knot, and this time the presence that emerged carried the weight of a woman's shame—something buried so deep it had calcified into a curse. [532] The prisms around them pulsed with starlight, absorbing the old grief, transmuting it into peace. [547]

By the time the last knot surrendered to Mira's needle, the net lay flat and soft, no longer a trap but a simple cloth. [570] The sanctuary hummed with its interlaced hush—all those silences woven together, finally at rest, finally grounded. [588]

Sela's eyes glistened. [591] "Will she sleep now? [595] My mother?" [597]

"Yes." [598] Mira set down her needle. [602] Her hands, for once, were still. [608] "And so will the ones who came before her. [616] The net remembers nothing now. [621] The knots are undone." [625]

Sela rose, but hesitated at the sanctuary's entrance. [633] "How did you become this? [638] A restorer of broken masks?" [643]

Mira looked at her own reflection in the nearest prism—fractured, multiplied, reassembled in light. [657] "I was broken once," she said. [663] "Someone helped me gather my pieces. [669] Now I do the same for the dead." [677]

The girl descended into the night, carrying the secret Mira had shared. [689] Above, the stars wheeled in their ancient silence, and the prisms sang with all the grief they had transformed, and Mira sat alone with her lucid unrest—awake, aware, forever mending what the living could not bear to face. [730]

She picked up another net from the pile beside her. [740] There were always more knots. [745] There were always more spirits waiting to be freed. [754]

And so she worked, accumulating silence, until the stars gave way to dawn. [767]
