Maren waited until after the drawbridge rose, its ancient mechanisms groaning as they lifted the only passage between the mainland and the flooded district. [26] This was her ritual now—official work completed, equipment stowed, then the private archaeology of twilight. [40]

The submerged pavilion stood knee-deep in brackish water, its marble columns rising from the flood like the bones of something that refused to disappear entirely. [64] As a firm shore surveyor, Maren had documented hundreds of structures claimed by the encroaching sea, but this one had become her obsession. [85]

She waded through the water, her reflection fragmenting around her legs. [96] In her satchel, wrapped in oilcloth, she carried her grandmother's antique traveling inkwell—a brass piece with compartments for different inks, hinged like a tiny coffin. [122] Her grandmother had been a cartographer. [128] Maren had inherited both the inkwell and the need to make sense of disappearing worlds. [142]

The pavilion had once hosted summer concerts. [149] She'd found photographs in the municipal archives: women in white dresses, men with straw hats, children racing between chairs. [167] Now the chairs were gone, the stage collapsed into murk, and only the colonnade remained, marking the perimeter of what had been. [190]

Interlaced absence—that was what Maren had come to understand this place represented. [202] Not a single loss, but losses woven together: the music, the laughter, the particular quality of light on a July evening, the couple who'd met here and married and raised children who themselves had children, all scattered now to higher ground. [244] Each absence threaded through the others, creating a fabric of what was no longer. [258]

She uncapped the inkwell and withdrew a sheet of waterproof paper. [269] The notes she wrote here were not for her surveyor's reports. [280] Those documents dealt in measurements and structural assessments, cold data for insurance adjusters and demolition planners. [294] These notes were different. [297]

"Found: A child's marble, green glass with a white spiral. [307] Lodged in a column crack at the northeast corner. [316] Someone lost a game here. [321] Someone cheered." [323]

Stoically sensitive—her father had called her that once, not understanding it was a compliment. [337] She had learned to present composure while feeling everything, to measure and document while grief moved through her like tide through this broken pavilion. [361]

When the notes were complete, Maren folded them into tight packets and moved toward the foundation repairs she'd ordered last month. [381] The concrete patches were meant to slow the structure's collapse, but they served another purpose. [396] She pressed the notes into small gaps, placing them where future hands might discover what she'd witnessed. [412] Marine epoxy sealed each message. [417] Future surveyors might find them. [422] Or no one would. [426] Either possibility felt acceptable. [430]

She was trying to wrest meaning from dissolution. [438] That was her true work now, to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams. [451] Every flooded district held them—the hopes people had pinned to places, the futures they'd imagined before the water came. [470] Someone had to document what the official records would never capture. [481]

The sun had dropped below the treeline, casting the pavilion in amber light that seemed to burn without heat. [500] A hushed blaze, Maren thought, like the last of someone's faith. [512]

She found another artifact: a brass button, military style, pressed into the silt near where the bandstand had stood. [530] A musician's? [532] A soldier come home to dance? [538] The stories branched infinitely, and she would never know which was true. [550] That was the nature of this work—certainty was impossible, but witness was not. [563]

Maren wrote the button's coordinates, her grandmother's inkwell steady in her hand. [575] The water had risen another centimeter since her last visit; she could tell by the new waterline on the columns. [595] Soon the pavilion would be fully claimed. [602]

But not erased. [605] Not while she continued this strange devotion. [612]

The drawbridge would lower again at dawn, and she would return to her official duties, firm in her assessments and precise in her measurements. [635] No one would know about the notes multiplying in the foundations, the secret archive of what people had once hoped for in a place that was drowning. [662]

Maren capped the inkwell. [666] The last light burned quietly across the water, and she stood among the columns like someone keeping vigil for a world that had already ended but refused, somehow, to be entirely gone. [699]
