After the energy beings arrived, time became something you could almost touch. [12]

The poet named Mira carried very little: her words, her worn boots, and a frayed coil of rope she had kept from the night she escaped the detention center in the old world, before the arrival. [47] She kept it not from sentiment but as reminder—that sometimes the only ethical choice was the forbidden one. [65]

She found the terra-cotta grotto by following the pattern the energy beings made in the sky, constellations that moved and pulsed with meaning she did not yet understand. [93] The grotto opened beneath the desert like a wound turned beautiful, its clay walls warm even under starlight, shaped by water that had long since vanished into some other layer of time. [125]

The beings gathered here. [129] Not in bodies—they had none—but in impressions, in the way light bent differently near certain stones. [145] Mira had spent three years drifting from settlement to settlement, trading roadside poems for food, searching for this place. [163] She wanted to discover the texture of time itself, to understand why, since their arrival, moments sometimes stretched like taffy and others collapsed into sharp instants. [189]

She descended into the grotto, and the rope in her pack seemed to grow heavier with each step. [207]

The beings spoke to her by uncovering layers—not in words, but in revelation. [221] They peeled back her memories like onion skin. [229] The prison first: the cold concrete, the unjust sentence for speaking against the regime that no longer existed. [245] Then deeper—her mother's garden, the way morning light had its own particular weight in summer. [261] Deeper still, to something before memory, something cellular and ancient. [271]

"You're reading me," she whispered, and the word reading echoed strangely, as if the grotto were testing its meaning. [289]

WE PATTERN MEANING FROM LIVED TIME. [295] YOUR TIME HAS TEXTURE WE CANNOT FULLY COMPREHEND. [303]

The voice was not sound but understanding that arrived fully formed. [314]

Mira laughed—she had always been ethically playful about the boundaries between species, between states of being. [330] "I came to learn from you, and you're learning from me." [341]

EXCHANGE IS THE ONLY HONEST TRANSACTION. [347]

The beings showed her then: the pattern of time as they perceived it. [360] Not linear, not even circular, but layered like geological strata. [370] Every moment still existed, compressed beneath the present, accessible to those who knew how to dig. [385] This was what they had brought to Earth—this gift and this curse. [397]

Then came the impossible choice. [402]

WE CAN SHOW YOU HOW TO MOVE THROUGH THESE LAYERS. [412] BUT THE KNOWLEDGE CHANGES THE KNOWER. [418] YOU WILL NO LONGER EXPERIENCE TIME AS YOUR KIND DOES. [428] YOU WILL BE BETWEEN. [432]

"Between what?" [434]

BETWEEN WHAT WAS AND WHAT IS. [440] BETWEEN YOUR PEOPLE AND US. [445] YOU WOULD DRIFT NOT THROUGH ROADS BUT THROUGH MOMENTS. [454]

Mira touched the rope in her pack. [461] The night of her escape, she had faced a similar precipice: stay imprisoned but remain part of the human system, or sever herself from it entirely. [486] She had chosen severance. [490] The frayed fibers remembered. [494]

But this was different. [498] This choice meant leaving not just a society but the human experience of time itself. [513] She would become a bridge—but bridges belong fully to neither shore. [524]

"If I refuse?" [527]

YOU REMAIN BEAUTIFUL AND LIMITED. [532] THE TEXTURE OF TIME STAYS BEYOND YOUR TOUCH. [540] YOU WRITE POEMS ABOUT WHAT YOU CANNOT FEEL. [548]

She sat on the warm terra-cotta floor, starlight filtering through the grotto's aperture. [561] The beings waited with a patience that itself felt like a lesson in time's texture. [575]

"And if I accept, can I still write poems?" [584]

YOU CAN PATTERN MEANING FROM LIVED TIME. [591] WHETHER THAT IS POETRY, WE CANNOT SAY. [598]

Mira pulled out the rope, ran her fingers along its frayed length. [610] Every fiber told a story of breaking, of escape, of choices that could never be unmade. [626] She thought of all the roadsides where she had traded verses for bread, all the strangers who had wept at words she barely remembered writing. [651]

"Show me," she said finally, her voice carrying the passionate subtlety of someone who understood that the greatest surrenders were the quietest ones. [675] "Show me how to dig." [680]

The beings began to unpeel the layers of now, and Mira felt time's texture at last: rough as rope, warm as terra-cotta, endless as the spaces between stars. [710]

She would write poems still, she realized, but in a language of duration rather than words. [727] The drifting would continue—only now through depths instead of distances. [738] And somewhere in those depths, she would find the moment before she had to choose, and she would hold it gently, as one holds anything that can never be returned to. [770]
