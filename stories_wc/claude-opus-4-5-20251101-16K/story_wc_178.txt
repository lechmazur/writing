The Ishtar Observatory rose from the ruins of ancient Babylon, its ziggurat silhouette reconstructed with steel and glass that caught the dying light like amber tears. [28] Between regimes, the palace existed in suspension—the old king deposed, the new council not yet crowned—and in this interregnum, the astronomers worked uninterrupted by political theater. [54]

Mira preferred it this way. [59]

She had spent seventeen years in these halls, counting stars and counting coins with equal precision. [74] A frugal astronomer by necessity and nature, she reused her observation charts until the margins disappeared, mended her telescope's housing with copper wire, and ate the same lentil stew each evening because variation cost money she would rather spend on glass lenses. [115] Her colleagues called her austere; she called herself efficient. [125]

Tonight, she descended into the palace's lowest chamber, where Babylonian stonework remained untouched beneath modern flooring. [141] The renovation committee had exposed it accidentally, and Mira had claimed the space before anyone thought to seal it away. [160] Here, she had found something extraordinary: a magic square tile, fifteen centuries old, its surface etched with numbers arranged so that every row, column, and diagonal summed to the same sacred total. [193]

The ancients had believed such squares held power over celestial forces. [205] Empirically ironic, she thought, that her own mathematical analysis had revealed they were right—not through mysticism, but through astronomy. [224] The numbers corresponded to stellar positions, encoding observational data within devotional geometry. [236]

Encrypted devotion. [238] That was what she had uncovered through schematic representations—her walls now covered with diagrams mapping the tile's numbers onto star charts, orbital calculations, and temporal cycles. [262] The Babylonian priests had hidden their cosmic knowledge within prayer, their science within worship, so thoroughly intertwined that destroying one meant losing the other. [286]

Mira traced the tile's grooves with her fingertip, feeling the centuries beneath her skin. [300] The chamber held a dusky harmony at this hour, amber light filtering through high slits, dust motes suspended like distant galaxies. [320] She understood now why she had devoted herself to this work with such single-minded intensity. [335] It was not merely academic curiosity. [341]

She wanted to seal a covenant with the unknown. [350]

The priests had done so through ritual and number, through patient observation spanning generations. [363] They had encoded their devotion because they knew regimes would fall, libraries would burn, but mathematics would endure. [380] Fifteen centuries later, a woman with patched robes and secondhand instruments could still hear their message across the abyss of time. [400]

Tonight, she would uncloak the final sequence. [408]

Her schematic representations had revealed a pattern—the magic square was not static but dynamic, its numbers shifting meaning with the seasons. [429] At the autumn equinox, which arrived in precisely forty minutes, the encoded coordinates would align with a celestial event the ancients had predicted but never named. [455]

Mira climbed to the observation deck, tile clutched against her chest. [467] The sky deepened from copper to violet, stars emerging like scattered salt. [479] She positioned her telescope—a magnificent instrument she had built over eight years from salvaged parts—and waited. [495]

At the predicted moment, a faint nebula became visible through atmospheric clearing, its shape matching the tile's central symbol exactly. [515] The ancients had seen it too, had encoded its existence for future seekers, had trusted that devotion transcribed into mathematics would outlast empires. [537]

Mira wept. [539]

Not from sorrow, but from the overwhelming sense of connection—to the priests who had watched this same sky, to the cosmos that had waited patiently for her to understand, to the unknown that had finally acknowledged her long fidelity. [576] She had spent her life being careful, being precise, being frugal with everything except her commitment to the stars. [595]

Now the covenant was sealed. [600]

She placed the tile on the observation ledge, where it caught the nebula's ancient light. [614] Tomorrow, another regime might claim this palace. [622] New administrators might dismiss her work, defund the observatory, pave over the Babylonian chamber. [635] It did not matter. [639]

The devotion was already encrypted—in her notebooks, her schematics, her careful records that would wait for the next seeker. [657] The harmony between past and future hummed through her like a frequency beyond hearing. [671]

Mira descended to her chamber, ate her lentil stew, and began encoding her own observations into a new magic square. [691] Fifteen centuries from now, someone equally devoted, equally frugal, equally willing to listen to the silence between stars, would uncloak what she had hidden. [717]

The unknown required patience. [721] Mira had always been good at patience. [728]
