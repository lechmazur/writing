The tree trunk library would fall within the hour. [8] Mira pressed her palm against the bark-lined walls, feeling the centuries of knowledge embedded in the hollowed ancient oak. [26] The scholar's guild had carved their sanctuary from living wood three hundred years ago, and now the city had condemned it—unstable, they said, though Mira suspected the real instability was in people's willingness to preserve what they couldn't immediately use. [66]

She was a portrait artist who could not recognize faces. [76] Prosopagnosia had been her companion since birth, turning every human countenance into a puzzle of features that refused to cohere. [95] Yet she painted portraits that made people weep, because she had learned to see differently—the way a jawline caught shadow, the particular geometry of wrinkles, the fractally precise patterns of pores and imperfections that most artists smoothed away. [134]

But she had discovered her limits. [140] She could capture the surface, never the soul. [149] Her subjects said her portraits looked like strangers wearing their skin. [160]

That was why she had come here in the final hush, seeking the secret book safe her mentor had mentioned on her deathbed. [182] "Third alcove, eastern trunk. [186] A book that is not a book. [193] Inside, the technique of Aldric Vane." [199]

Vane had been the guild's greatest artist, legendary for murals that seemed to breathe. [213] His life's work had been singular: to mirror the sky inside walls. [225] He painted ceilings that made viewers forget they stood enclosed. [235] He captured infinity within limits. [240]

Mira found the alcove, ran her fingers along spines until one felt wrong—too light, too hollow. [255] The secret book safe opened with a whisper. [263] Inside lay only a centuries-old coin and a scrap of parchment. [274]

The parchment read: "Not in seeing, but in feeling. [283] The coin remembers." [286]

She held the coin to the dim light filtering through the bark. [298] Its surface seemed smooth, but when she closed her eyes and let her fingertips drift across it, she felt them—faint indentations forming a pattern so complex it spiraled inward forever. [330] Fractally precise. [332] Someone had labored to craft this impossibility, a map of infinite detail pressed into finite metal. [347]

She traced the indentations again, letting their logic sink through her skin. [360] And suddenly she understood. [364]

Vane had also been face blind. [370] He had spent his life learning that limitation was not absence but redirection. [383] He couldn't see faces the way others did, so he had learned to see everything else with terrifying intensity. [401] The coin was his proof: that within constraint, infinity still lived. [412] The sky could be mirrored inside walls because the sky was not about vastness—it was about the quality of light, the depth of color, the way the eye lost itself in blue and found it again. [449]

Mira had thought her portraits failed because she couldn't see souls. [461] But souls weren't visible. [465] They were felt. [468] She had been trying to craft with the wrong sense entirely. [479]

A rumble shook the library. [484] Dust sifted from the ceiling. [489] Minutes now. [491]

She pocketed the coin and walked toward the exit, passing shelves of books that would soon be splinters. [508] The heightened stillness wrapped around her—that breathless moment when everything held its shape one last time before transforming into something else. [530]

She thought of the portraits she would paint now. [540] She would close her eyes and let her fingers learn her subjects' faces the way she had learned the coin through faint indentations on a centuries-old surface pressed by Vane's own hands. [572] She would trace their features until the pattern emerged, fractally precise, infinitely detailed within the boundaries of skin and bone. [592]

The limit was the doorway. [597] It always had been. [601]

Outside, the demolition crew waited in their machines like patient giants. [612] Mira stepped into morning light, the coin warm against her palm, carrying infinity in her pocket. [627] Behind her, the tree trunk library groaned—three centuries of knowledge about to become memory, sawdust, and silence. [644]

But Vane's secret had escaped. [649] And Mira understood now that to mirror the sky inside walls, you first had to accept the walls. [668] You had to love the constraint that made the infinity possible. [679]

The first timber cracked. [683] She did not look back. [688] The sound of collapse followed her like distant thunder as she walked toward her studio, toward the faces waiting to be touched rather than seen, toward the portraits that would finally hold souls. [721]

She was discovering her limits, and they were not barriers. [732] They were the very shape of her gift. [740]
