Mira had been root-bound for forty-seven years, her visions tangled with the hedge maze like vines choking ancient stone. [20] She could not leave the garden without her foresight dimming to static, so she stayed, pruning possibilities alongside the boxwood and yew. [40] But the eclipse came three decades early, swallowing the sun on a Tuesday afternoon when prophets had promised it for the next generation. [59] The future had arrived without permission, and now everything written in dream and covenant had to be rewritten in desperate haste. [78]

She stood at the maze's heart, her weathered hands trembling around the topiary clipping she had severed that morning. [95] The small branch still held its shape—a spiral, the symbol of convergence—and its leaves gleamed with an impossible viridian light. [114] This was her ticket out, the only piece of the maze that could travel beyond the boundary. [130] She had cut it with the blade that bore her blood, linking through scars the way her grandmother had taught her. [149]

The eclipsed covenant demanded witnesses at the intersection of dreams, the place where every sleeping mind briefly touched the same infinite shore. [170] Seven families had sworn the oath two centuries ago, but time had made them forget. [185] Wars scattered them, prosperity dulled their purpose, and the covenant fell into shadow. [197] Only Mira remembered, because the maze remembered, and she was part of the maze now. [212]

Purposefully curious, she had spent decades piecing together the location: a cobalt glade three miles east, where twilight pooled like liquid sapphire and the boundary between waking and sleeping grew thin enough to tear. [245] Tonight, at dusk, the intersection would manifest. [253] If no one stood witness, the dreams would scatter permanently, and humanity would lose its shared unconscious, becoming seven billion isolated minds screaming into separate voids. [276]

She walked through the garden gate, and the familiar weight of prophecy lifted slightly from her shoulders even as a new terror settled in. [299] The world outside was louder than she remembered, full of birdsong and distant engines and wind that carried no whispered futures. [319] Her feet found the old path through muscle memory she didn't know she possessed. [333]

The clipping pulsed in her palm, warm and insistent, guiding her east. [345]

When she reached the glade, the sky had deepened to the precise shade of cobalt that appeared in her oldest visions—the color of transition, of thresholds. [370] She felt anxious elation surge through her chest, a giddy terror that made her want to laugh and weep simultaneously. [389] This was the moment. [393] Forty-seven years of waiting, and now she had perhaps forty-seven minutes to succeed or fail. [408]

Others emerged from the treeline: a young woman with silver scars across her palms, an old man whose forearm bore the same spiral mark Mira had cut into herself decades ago. [437] Descendants of the covenant families, drawn by the clipping's call. [447] They did not speak, but Mira understood—the scars connected them, ancient blood recognizing ancient blood across generations of forgetting. [465]

"We must heed the old words," Mira said, her voice rough from disuse. [479] She raised the clipping, and the others extended their scarred hands toward it. [492]

The light began at their wounds, silver threads weaving between them, pulling tight until they formed a living constellation at the glade's center. [514] Mira felt dreams flooding through her—not her own visions, but the sleeping hopes of millions. [530] A child dreaming of flight. [535] A grieving father dreaming his daughter alive. [542] A soldier dreaming of silence. [547] They intersected here, in this moment, in these witnesses who remembered what the world had forgotten. [562]

The threads anchored themselves to the earth, to the sky, to the clipping that bridged Mira's rooted past and unrooted future. [583] The covenant renewed itself in their collective breath, no longer eclipsed but blazing. [596]

When dawn came, Mira found herself lying in dew-soaked grass, the clipping now sprouting roots into the soil of the glade. [618] A new maze would grow here. [624] A new visionary would eventually tend it. [631] But for now, she was free—unbound, purposeless, and impossibly, terrifyingly alive in a future that had arrived before anyone was ready, yet had been met anyway. [659]

She walked into the morning, carrying no visions, only the memory of intersection. [673] That would be enough. [677]
