The falcon returned at dusk, its wings cutting through the grey air like a rumor through silence. [17] Maren watched from the outpost window, her breath creating small clouds of condensation against the frozen glass. [34] The bird landed on the rusted rail outside, shaking frost from its feathers. [47]

"About time," she muttered, though relief softened the edges of her voice. [59] "Another hour and I'd have started editing your obituary." [69]

For thirty years, Maren had edited atlases. [77] She knew every mapped river from the Amazon to the Zambezi, had corrected cartographic errors that would have sent ships into oblivion. [98] But there was one thing no atlas had ever shown her: the singular convergence. [112]

The theory had consumed her for the past decade. [121] Every river flowed from somewhere, and every somewhere connected to something else. [133] Water cycled, yes, but cycles had centers. [140] Origins. [141] She believed—no, she knew with a subtly confident certainty that unsettled her colleagues—that somewhere on this frozen earth, all water began. [162] Her motivation was simple: to find where the rivers begin. [172] Everything else was cartographic trivia. [177]

The outpost creaked around her, rust eating through walls that had once housed weather researchers. [192] Now it housed only her, her instruments, and the phrasebook. [203]

She retrieved the falcon, extracting the tiny capsule from its leg. [214] The message inside was written in Evenki, the language of nomads who had traversed these frozen lands for millennia. [232] Maren flipped to the dog-eared page in her phrasebook—a gift from a polyglot linguist who had died seeking the same truth she now chased. [257] The fold was crisp, deliberate, marking a section on directional vocabulary. [268]

"The mouth drinks from the eye that never closes," she translated slowly. [280] "North. [281] Always north." [283]

The frozen lake outside stretched toward nothing visible. [291] The tranquility here was absolute—no wind, no animals, no distant engines. [303] Just ice and silence. [307] It worried her, that calm. [312] It felt like the world holding its breath before deciding whether to exhale or swallow. [326]

She set water to boil on the small stove, more for warmth than thirst. [340] As steam rose, condensation gathered on the cold window glass. [350] Maren almost didn't notice the pattern at first—she was tired, her eyes playing tricks. [365]

But no. [367] The droplets weren't forming randomly. [372]

They traced lines. [375] Tributaries. [376] A river system mapping itself in moisture, as if the water remembered where it came from and was trying to tell her. [397]

Her hand trembled as she traced the pattern of condensation on glass. [409] Every line converged at a single point, northwest of her current position. [421] The singular convergence. [424] Not a metaphor. [427] Not a theory. [430] A place. [432]

"You're real," she whispered. [436]

The condensation held for one moment longer, then began to weep down the glass, the message dissolving. [452] But Maren had memorized it. [457] Thirty years of editing maps had trained her mind to capture geography in an instant. [472]

She began packing immediately, her movements efficient despite the strange calm that pressed against the outpost walls. [488] The lake ice would hold her weight. [495] The falcon could scout ahead. [500] In three days, she would reach the coordinates. [508] In three days, she would stand at the source of all waters, ready to herald the discovery that would rewrite every atlas she'd ever touched. [532]

The falcon watched her from its perch, eyes unblinking. [541] Outside, the frozen lake reflected a sky the color of old pewter. [554] Everything was still—too still, as if creation was waiting to see what she would bring back from the edge of all maps. [576]

Maren paused at the door, looking back at the window where the condensation had spoken to her. [593] Already frost was reclaiming the glass, erasing any evidence. [602]

"Typical," she said dryly. [606] "Even the water wants editorial control." [612]

She stepped into the crystalline silence, the phrasebook pressed against her chest, its dog-eared page marking words in a dead linguist's hand. [633] Behind her, the rusted outpost groaned once, like a warning. [643]

Ahead, the ice stretched toward a convergence that every river knew but no cartographer had ever shown. [660]

Maren walked forward anyway, subtly confident that some truths were worth the worrying quiet that surrounded them. [677]
