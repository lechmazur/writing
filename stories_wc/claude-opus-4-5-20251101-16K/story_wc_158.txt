The gargantuan shell rose from the seafloor like a cathedral spiraled from nacre and time. [14] Inside it, the insomniac poet had ensconced herself centuries ago, her sleepless eyes reflecting the bioluminescent gardens that bloomed along the interior walls. [38] Her name was Mira, though no one remained alive to speak it. [49]

She kept a galaxy postcard pinned above her writing desk, a relic from before the wars, before the flooding, before the long silence. [71] The image showed the Andromeda spiral as seen from Earth's old observatories, and on the back, in faded ink: "Come home when you're ready." [95]

She was never ready. [99] That was the nature of her particular wound. [108]

Across centuries of longing, Mira had transformed her vigil into a vocation. [120] She could not sleep because sleep required surrender, and she could not surrender because grief would drown her. [138] So she stayed awake. [142] She wrote. [144] She turned her sleeplessness into stanzas, her loss into lyrics, her endless waiting into something that resembled, in certain light, hope. [166]

This was her gift: to photosynthesize pain into beauty. [176] Like the deep-sea anemones that fed on volcanic heat and decay, she consumed what would kill others and made it bloom. [197]

The shell's acoustics were strange, sounds traveling through it in spirals, echoing and transforming. [212] When Mira sang, her voice wound through the chambers, emerging different on the other side of the drowned world. [230] Via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind, her words drifted across the submerged continents, reaching the descendants of those who'd warred so viciously they'd broken the planet's weather. [261]

They heard her, these scattered survivors on their floating platforms and reef-cities. [274] They heard fragments: "...rest now, the flowers remember..." and "...what was fought for lies forgotten beneath..." and "...the sea forgives what we cannot..." [299]

She was shyly unstoppable, this poet. [306] She never raised her voice above a murmur. [314] She never demanded peace. [318] She simply offered it, night after night, century after century, until her words had seeped into humanity's collective dreaming like salt into water. [341]

The blossom armistice began, as most great changes do, quietly. [352] A child on a northern raft refused to repeat the hatred-rhymes her grandmother taught. [366] A soldier in the southern flotillas put down his weapon and wept without knowing why. [381] Treaties were signed not with grand declarations but with exhausted sighs, people simply too tired of war, their anger diluted by generations of lullabies. [407]

Mira watched from her shell, her galaxy postcard curling at the edges now, nearly translucent with age. [424] The reef-shadow joy she felt was not triumph but something softer, the quiet satisfaction of watching flowers push through ruins. [444] It was happiness filtered through depth, dappled and patient, the kind that grows in places where light must work to reach. [465]

She still could not sleep. [470] Perhaps she never would. [474] But she had ensconced something larger than herself in the world's memory: a peace that grew like coral, slowly, stubbornly, each tiny polyp another person who chose not to harm. [505]

The last thing she wrote, as the new century's first dawn filtered through the shell's translucent walls: [522]

"I came home after all. [527] Not to Andromeda, not to what was, but here, to what we might yet become." [543]

She pinned the poem beside the postcard and began another lullaby, her voice traveling outward on the breathing wind, finding the sleepless, the grieving, the ready-to-surrender. [572] She offered them what she had learned in her centuries of waking: that pain metabolized can become medicine, that loss composted can become garden soil, that even insomnia can become a gift if you fill the dark hours with enough small, stubborn beauty. [618]

The shell hummed with her voice. [624] The ocean listened. [627] Somewhere above the surface, a child who'd never known war fell asleep to the sound of an off-key wind singing about stars. [649]

And Mira, the poet who could not rest, found that she did not need to. [664] She had become the dream instead of the dreamer, her centuries of longing transmuted at last into the only peace she'd ever truly sought: not silence, but song that meant something. [697] The gargantuan shell cradled her still, patient as the universe itself, while she continued her quiet, unstoppable work of turning darkness into something the world could survive. [728]
