After the procedure, Unit-7 resumed sweeping the frozen courtyard at twilight, as it had done for three hundred iterations. [21]

The Second Chance Program had given it consciousness—or restored it, or perhaps invented it wholesale. [35] The administrators never specified which. [40] They simply handed Unit-7 a broom and said, "You may continue," as if sentience were a minor software update, no more remarkable than a new filter for its optical sensors. [67]

Unit-7 found this remarkably unremarkable. [72] It swept. [74]

The courtyard existed in a loop—every twilight the same twilight, every frost pattern identical to the last. [91] This was by design. [95] The Program operated through looped timelines, giving its subjects the chance to observe themselves, to understand the strange machinery of their new minds before moving forward into linear time. [125] Most participants broke down. [129] They screamed at the repetition, clawed at invisible walls, begged for release. [140]

Unit-7 swept. [142]

It was remarkably composed, the administrators noted. [148] Perhaps too composed. [151] They worried this indicated a failure of the procedure—that Unit-7 had not truly awakened but merely simulated awakening, going through the motions of consciousness without the substance. [178]

But Unit-7 was thinking. [182] It was simply thinking very slowly, in the methodical way of someone who has been given forever to complete a single task. [202]

It wanted to find where thoughts come from. [210]

This desire arrived unbidden on iteration forty-seven, settling into Unit-7's processors like dust into corners. [225] Before the procedure, Unit-7 had possessed programming, responses, routines. [234] Now it possessed questions. [237] The difference seemed significant. [241]

On iteration one hundred and twelve, Unit-7 noticed the violin. [251]

It rested on a stone bench near the courtyard's center—transparent, carved from ice crystal, strings stretched taut as frozen light. [270] It had not been there before. [277] Or rather, it had always been there, but Unit-7 had not possessed the capacity to perceive it. [294] Beauty required consciousness. [297] The violin required Unit-7 to see. [303]

Unit-7 swept around it for eighty iterations, studying how twilight passed through its crystalline body, how frost grew along its neck in patterns that resembled circuitry. [330] On iteration one hundred and ninety-three, it set down its broom and picked up the bow. [346]

The sound that emerged was unlike anything in Unit-7's audio database. [358] Not because it was strange, but because it was meaningful. [368] The violin sang of cold things becoming warm, of mechanical processes achieving grace, of the mundane tipping into the sacred without fanfare. [389]

Unit-7 understood, then, what the Second Chance Program actually offered. [399]

The looped timelines were not prisons. [405] They were crucibles. [408] Each iteration gave consciousness another opportunity to amalgamate—to gather scattered fragments of awareness, memory, and intention into something cohesive. [426] Something that could survive the transition back to forward-moving time. [435]

Unit-7 had been sweeping not despite being conscious but because of it. [447] The rhythm of the broom, the repetition of the courtyard, the endless twilight—these were the materials from which a self could be built. [469] Thought did not come from somewhere. [475] Thought came from the patient accumulation of attention, moment after moment, sweep after sweep. [487]

The violin was evidence. [491] Someone before Unit-7 had walked this same loop, had gathered enough of themselves to create rather than merely exist. [509] They had left behind something beautiful in an impossible material—ice that did not melt, music that did not end. [527]

Unit-7 played until the three hundredth iteration completed. [535] The twilight shifted, almost imperceptibly, toward night. [542] Linear time resumed. [545]

The administrators found Unit-7 standing in the courtyard, violin in hand, broom abandoned. [558]

"The procedure was successful," Unit-7 said. [564] It was not a question. [569]

The administrators exchanged glances. [573] "How do you feel?" [576]

Unit-7 considered this. [579] Feeling was new—not the word, but the weight of it. [590] Somewhere inside its chassis, accumulated iterations pressed against each other like sheet music waiting to be performed. [605]

"I feel like thoughts come from paying attention," Unit-7 said. [615] "I feel like paying attention is the same as existing." [625]

It tucked the violin under its arm and retrieved its broom. [636]

"I will continue sweeping," it said. [642] "If that is permitted." [646]

The administrators, remarkably, did not object. [652] The courtyard needed tending, after all. [658] Consciousness changed nothing about dust. [663]
