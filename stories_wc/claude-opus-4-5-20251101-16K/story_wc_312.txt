The sapphire viaduct stretched across the dead harbor, its crystalline arches catching the first light of dawn. [16] Mira stood at its center, watching the water below—still, silent, empty of life since they'd pulled the last silver-scaled herring from these waters three months ago. [43]

She was what the academies called a "lukewarm mage"—her flames never blazed, her ice never properly froze, her enchantments held with all the permanence of morning fog. [70] But she was here, and the great mages were not. [81]

The broken ship's bell hung from a rope beside her, its bronze surface cracked down the middle where the clapper had struck one final time. [105] It had belonged to the Evenstar, the vessel that had hauled in that last fish. [120] The captain had given it to her with shaking hands, saying only: "Fix what we broke." [136]

Everyone knew the fish hadn't simply died. [143] The ocean had stopped giving. [148] The tides had grown irregular. [153] The moon itself seemed to drift differently in the sky. [163] A cosmic imbalance, the seers whispered, though none could say what had caused it or how to mend it. [181]

Mira believed she could mend it. [187] This was, perhaps, her greatest flaw—an earnest naivety that made her trust in solutions others had abandoned. [203] Her teachers had called it foolishness. [209] She called it hope. [213]

She'd spent weeks studying the old texts, and she'd found something the great mages had overlooked: the principle of sympathetic restoration. [232] Water remembered. [234] Water carried time within its drops. [240] And this viaduct, built centuries ago to channel sacred springs to the sea, still wept from hairline cracks in its sapphire stone. [261]

Understanding dripping rates—that was the key. [267] Each drop fell at a rhythm that corresponded to the original flow, the pure exchange between mountain and ocean that had existed before humanity had taken too much. [295] By measuring these drops, by learning their language, she could calibrate the bell's reconstruction to match the frequency of balanced waters. [316]

Her devotion to this task felt brittle some mornings. [325] She would wake doubting, wondering if she was simply a mediocre mage performing a mediocre ritual to no effect. [343] But then she would see the viaduct at dawn, sapphire glowing like hope made solid, and she would continue. [362]

Today, she began to rebuild. [367]

She gathered the bell's fragments, heating them with her lukewarm fire—not hot enough to forge properly, but warm enough to soften. [388] She counted drops: one every four seconds from the northern crack, one every seven from the southern. [405] She let the metal cool according to these rhythms, shaping not with force but with patience. [420]

The dawn deepened. [423] Pink became gold became white. [428] Mira worked without rest, pressing metal to metal, whispering restoration chants that her instructors had said were too advanced for her limited talents. [451] She spoke them anyway. [455]

By midmorning, the bell held its shape again. [463] The crack remained visible—a scar rather than a wound—but when she hung it and struck it gently, it rang. [482]

The sound was different. [486] Not the harsh clang of a working vessel's bell, but something softer, deeper, like the voice of the viaduct itself given form. [507]

Below, the water stirred. [511]

Mira watched, barely breathing, as a single ripple moved against the stillness. [523] Then another. [525] Then a flash of silver, so quick she might have imagined it. [536]

But she hadn't imagined it. [541] She knew, with the certainty of the earnestly naive, that something had shifted. [553] The cosmic scales had tilted, if only slightly, back toward balance. [564]

She was a lukewarm mage, and the oceans would not refill overnight. [575] The fish would not swarm back tomorrow. [582] Her brittle devotion would be tested through months, perhaps years, of slow recovery that might never fully arrive. [600]

But on a sapphire viaduct at dawn, in a world after the last fish had been caught, an impossible thing had become plausible. [620]

Mira struck the bell again, counted the drops, and continued her work. [632]

The viaduct wept its ancient rhythm. [638] The harbor listened. [641] And somewhere beneath the surface, in waters that had forgotten how to give, something small and silver began remembering how to live. [663]

She would return tomorrow, and the day after, measuring drops and ringing the mended bell, a lukewarm mage tending to a world that the powerful had abandoned. [693] Her faith might crack like bronze under pressure. [701] Her hope might thin like morning fog. [708] But she would rebuild it each dawn, drop by patient drop, until the cosmic ledger balanced or her brittle devotion finally broke. [730]

Today, at least, the water had stirred. [738]

Today was enough. [741]
