In the canyon of endless echoes, where sound refused to die, Mira climbed the spiraling stairs of the westernmost tower. [18] The bones beneath her feet had yellowed over centuries, remnants of leviathans whose names the wind had long forgotten. [36] She paused at a narrow window. [42] Through the mist, the pale spire rose--the Confessor's Tower, where tomorrow's ritual would demand her truth. [57]

One truth. [59] Unbroken. [60] Whole. [61]

But Mira was a defiant artist, and she knew that truth, like light, could be refracted. [76]

In the chamber above, a dozen others waited--the condemned and the curious, those who gathered each night before their own reckonings. [96] They sat among scattered bones and guttered candles, their faces drawn with the same quiet desperation that lived in Mira's chest. [117]

"Tell us something," whispered Fen, the youngest among them, his voice carrying that innocently mischievous quality that made even grim requests sound like games. [141] "Before they take your words tomorrow, share them with us tonight." [152]

This was how it worked in the bone towers. [161] Through impromptu poetry sessions, the condemned practiced their confessions, breaking them apart like bread shared among the starving. [179] Mira had attended dozens of these gatherings, listening to others refract their single truths into many--guilt becoming sorrow becoming anger becoming loss. [202] By morning, the original sin grew so diffuse that even the Confessor's Tower struggled to name it. [219]

The price of forgiveness in this place was not penance. [229] It was precision. [232] You had to confess one exact truth, and if you could not, if your truth had shattered into fragments no ritual could reassemble, then forgiveness became impossible. [259] You would wander the canyon forever, your echoes overlapping until you forgot which voice was yours. [275]

Mira drew breath. [278] The forged hush of the chamber pressed against her, that deliberate silence these gatherings created--sound swallowed before it could escape and multiply in the canyon's vast acoustics. [306]

"I killed my brother," she began. [312]

The words fell like stones into still water. [320]

"No," she continued, her voice strengthening with each variation. [329] "I let my brother die. [334] No--I chose not to save him. [341] No--I hesitated, and in that hesitation, he was lost." [351]

Fen's eyes widened with that innocent delight, as though watching a magician pull scarves from empty air. [368] He didn't understand the weight of what she carried. [377] To him, this was poetry, performance, the beautiful breaking of language against itself. [390]

"Again," someone urged from the shadows. [396]

"My hands were clean," Mira said. [402] "My hands were covered in his blood. [409] My hands reached for him too late. [416] My hands never reached at all." [422]

The words refracted, each version true, each version incomplete. [431] By the time she finished, there were seventeen different deaths, seventeen different guilts, seventeen different sisters who had failed in seventeen different ways. [454]

Tomorrow, when she climbed the pale spire in mist and stood before the Confessor, she would be asked to choose one. [475] To collapse all versions into a single confession. [483] Only then could forgiveness flow--that was the ritual's design, its cruelty and its mercy intertwined. [499]

But Mira was defiant. [503] She had spent years among these towers precisely because she refused to simplify. [516] Her brother's death deserved every truth, not just one convenient enough for absolution. [529] To pick a single version would be to forget all the others, to erase the full architecture of her grief. [549]

The poetry sessions were not preparation for the ritual. [558] They were rebellion against it. [563]

Fen began his own verse, his young voice lifting something about stolen bread and a sister he'd betrayed for hunger. [583] The others leaned in, helping him refract, helping him forget which version was real. [597]

Mira watched the pale spire through the window, its outline softening in the deepening mist. [612] The echoes of their poetry would travel the canyon all night, multiplying, becoming impossible to trace to any single throat. [632]

This was the price of forgiveness she had chosen to pay--not the ritual's price of precision, but her own: eternal wandering, eternal remembering, every truth held at once. [661]

Before the ritual came, she would climb down from this tower and disappear into the canyon, her echoes joining all the others who had refused to be reduced. [689]

Defiance, she had learned, was its own kind of art. [699]
