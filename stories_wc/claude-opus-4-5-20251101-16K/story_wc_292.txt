The weather station groaned with each gust, its instruments spinning uselessly against skies that no longer obeyed prediction. [18]

Mira pressed her palm against the observation window, watching the gray horizon where cargo ships had once traced reliable routes. [38]

After the jet stream shifted, everything changed--currents reversed, coastlines drowned, and the exiled became legion. [54]

She was an idealistic map librarian by training, though her collection now consisted of whatever the new ocean delivered to this experimental outpost. [77]

Her fingers closed around the copper nail in her pocket--pulled from a coffin lid three weeks ago, when the sea finally released her great-grandmother's remains. [103]

The body had been wrapped in oilcloth and chains, weighted for a pauper's burial that somehow refused permanence. [121]

Mira had spent seventeen nights since then trying to understand why the corpse had traveled four hundred miles against the current to reach her. [145]

The answer was beginning to emerge through coded stanzas in shipwrecked journals. [157]

She returned to her worktable, where seven water-damaged books lay spread beneath preservation lamps. [171]

Sailors had carried these journals when their vessels foundered in the new storms. [184]

Most entries were mundane: weather observations, coordinates, supply lists. [193]

But threaded through the pages were poems--strange, stilted verses that made no logical sense until Mira recognized the pattern. [213]

Her great-grandmother, Vera, had been a cartographer in the years before the shift. [226]

When the government began designating climate refugees as criminals, exiling them to drowning territories, Vera had drawn escape routes into her official maps. [249]

Hidden channels. [251]

Survivable islands. [253]

She had encoded the locations in verse and taught the pattern to those she trusted. [268]

Mira traced her finger along a stanza: "Where copper teeth bite coffin wood, the mapmaker's children understood." [285]

The nail. [287]

Her nervously confident hands turned it over, examining the green patina, the deliberate bend at its tip. [304]

A marker. [306]

A key. [308]

The station shuddered, and outside, the monitoring equipment registered another pressure anomaly. [320]

The others had evacuated to higher ground last month, but Mira remained, driven by the need to question everything her family had accepted as shame. [345]

Vera's exile had been declared reversible--a clause buried in the emergency statutes that allowed descendants to appeal if new evidence emerged. [367]

No one had told Mira's mother this. [374]

No one had suggested Vera was anything but a traitor who had helped criminals escape legal consequences. [391]

But the journals told a different story. [398]

Vera had saved two thousand people. [404]

She had drawn them pathways through the flooding, given them maps that transformed death sentences into difficult survivals. [422]

The government had discovered her network and made an example of her--exile to a territory that was already underwater, a death dressed in bureaucratic euphemism. [448]

The copper nail had marked her coffin so her people could find her. [461]

So the truth could be exhumed. [467]

Mira copied the decoded coordinates onto fresh paper, her handwriting steady despite the dread pooling in her stomach. [485]

That spongey feeling had lived in her since childhood--the sense that something terrible lurked beneath the surface of accepted reality, soft and yielding until you pressed too hard and it swallowed you. [518]

She was pressing now. [522]

To honor an ancestor's overlooked bravery meant confronting the system that had buried it. [536]

It meant submitting the journals as evidence, presenting the nail as proof of identity, standing before officials who might prefer the old narrative. [559]

Through the window, debris from another wreck drifted toward shore. [569]

Mira wondered how many more coded messages waited in those waterlogged pages--how many other families lived with inherited shame that was really inherited courage. [594]

The jet stream would not shift back. [601]

The maps would never describe the same world twice. [610]

But reversible exile meant something still could be reclaimed: names, lands, the simple recognition that Vera had been brave when bravery was treason. [633]

Mira pocketed the copper nail and began composing her appeal. [643]

Outside, the experimental instruments spun, measuring forces that exceeded their design parameters. [655]

She wrote anyway, her idealism outlasting the weather, her questions carving channels through carefully maintained silence. [671]

The sea continued bringing evidence. [676]

She would continue reading it. [681]

And somewhere beneath the new currents, Vera's maps still guided those who knew how to look--routes drawn in defiance, pathways that refused to drown. [706]
