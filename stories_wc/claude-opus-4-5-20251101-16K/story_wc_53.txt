The waters above the clouds never quite settled. [8] They churned in slow spirals, luminous and gray, catching fragments of sunlight that pierced through from somewhere Mira could no longer remember. [29]

She had been the lagoon's sole scavenger for years, or perhaps weeks, or perhaps always. [44] Time moved strangely here, after the carousel halted. [52] Its great brass arms had once turned the seasons in measured rhythm, but now it stood silent at the lagoon's center, and the hours scattered like startled birds. [81]

Mira waded through the shallows, her nets trailing behind her. [91] She was resolute in her work, even when she forgot why she worked at all. [105] The lagoon gave up small treasures—buttons, letters, the broken stems of spectacles—things that drifted up from the world below on thermal currents she didn't understand. [131]

But what Mira truly collected were stories. [138]

Voices traveled upward too, fractured conversations that emerged from the mist in whispers. [151] She would stand perfectly still, her ears tilted toward the water, and listen. [164] A mother telling her daughter about patience. [171] Two strangers laughing about a missed train. [178] An old man's confession that he'd wasted everything on wanting to be remembered. [191]

She wrote nothing down. [195] She simply gathered these fragments, held them in her chest like small coins she might spend someday on something she needed desperately. [216]

Today, she found the camera wheel in the shallows—a small plastic disc with serrated edges, the advance mechanism from a disposable camera. [238] She turned it between her fingers, and a memory struck her sideways, arriving from the wrong direction in time. [256]

She was twenty-three again, briefly. [262] Standing in a darkroom, surrounded by the chemical smell of developer fluid. [273] She had planned to be a photographer then, to document stories rather than scavenge for their remnants. [289] The ambition felt enormous in that remembered moment, and then it felt like nothing at all, a shape eroded by currents she couldn't name. [313]

Mira looked up and saw herself standing on the far shore. [324]

Her ghost wore the face she'd had at twenty-three—sharp-eyed, certain. [336] This was who she had come here to find, she remembered now. [348] This was the negotiation she had postponed across a hundred scattered days. [360]

"You're late," the ghost said. [365] "Or early. I can never tell anymore." [372]

"I brought something for you." [377] Mira held up the camera wheel. [383]

The ghost didn't move. [387] "That's mine." [389]

"It was." [391] Mira waded closer, and the lagoon's waters resisted, then relented. [401] "I need you to take it back. Take back wanting something that badly." [415]

"You think that's how this works?" [421]

Mira stopped. [423] The stillness of the lagoon pressed against her, fractured only by the distant drip of water falling upward into clouds. [442]

"I've listened to so many stories," she said. [450] "Everyone regrets something they didn't become. Everyone carries a ghost of their ambitions." [462] She could hear them even now—a woman murmuring about the novel she never finished, a child wondering about the astronaut he'd stopped dreaming of being. [488] "I thought if I collected enough of them, I could understand. I could make peace with you." [505]

"With me." [507] The ghost smiled, sad and knowing. [513] "I'm not the one you need to negotiate with." [522]

Mira understood then. [525] The carousel hadn't stopped because something broke. [532] She had stopped it herself, long ago, when she first felt the weight of her own wanting and chose to flee upward, into the clouds, into a place where time couldn't hold her accountable for what she'd failed to become. [572]

She was chronologically confused because she had scattered herself deliberately. [582] Every misplaced memory was a refusal to stand in one moment and feel the full weight of regret. [599]

The ghost began to fade. [604]

"Wait," Mira called. [607]

But her younger self was already gone, dissolving into the mist that fed the kinetic waters. [622] And Mira stood alone with the camera wheel, this small relic of enormous want, turning it over and over in hands that had learned to hold fragments instead of wholes. [652]

The lagoon churned. [655] The carousel remained still. [659]

She waded back toward the shallows, and for the first time in longer than she could measure, she let herself remember the darkroom in proper sequence—the chemicals, the hanging prints, the moment she had looked at her own work and decided it wasn't enough. [705]

The regret arrived whole. [709]

She sat with it, there in the fractured stillness, and wondered if this was how peace began—not by scattering the weight, but by finally agreeing to carry it. [739]

Above her, the clouds parted briefly, and light fell through. [749]

She lifted the camera wheel toward it, watching light catch its serrated edges, and imagined, just for a moment, the photographs she might still take. [774]
