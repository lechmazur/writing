The oasis shouldn't exist. [4]

Mira knew this as she crossed the final ridge of ash-colored earth, her wheel strapped to her back, her hands still carrying the calm of ten thousand centered pots. [32] Below, impossibly, green persisted. [36] The abandoned beekeeping oasis spread like a wound healing wrong—or perhaps healing right—against the scorched wasteland that had claimed everything else. [54]

She had come to understand why some places resist change. [64]

The sun hung low as Mira descended, and across the wasteland, where distant settlements still burned their meager fuel, chimney smoke flattened against the cooling air. [88] This was the hour between. [93] The hour when things revealed themselves. [99]

Her teacher had spoken of such places. [106] Fractures, he called them. [110] Points where timelines had split and tangled, where different possibilities layered over each other like glazes on fired clay. [127] Most people walked through them unknowing. [133] But a zen-minded potter learns to feel where the world has cracked. [145]

The hives stood in rows, bleached white by years of sun, empty of their swarms. [160] Yet Mira heard something—a thrum beneath silence, a vibration in the air that moved through her chest like a second heartbeat. [181] Memory of bees, perhaps. [185] Or bees that existed in another when. [192]

At the oasis center, she found the keeper's cottage, its chimney cold for decades. [206] Inside, on a table thick with dust, sat a faded lantern glass, its surface clouded by heat damage and time. [225] Mira picked it up and held it toward the dying light. [236]

And saw. [238]

Through the glass, the oasis existed in three states simultaneously. [248] She saw it lush and tended, a woman in a sun hat moving between hives while children ran laughing. [266] She saw it burning, flames eating the green while someone screamed. [277] She saw it now—abandoned, suspended, somehow choosing neither death nor full life. [289]

Mira understood, with sharp gentleness, that she was looking at fractured timelines. [301] All three were real. [305] All three had happened, were happening, would happen. [313]

But this place had learned to hold them all. [322]

She stepped outside, following sun patterns as her teacher had taught—noting where light fell longest, where shadows suggested doorways. [341] The vegetation here grew strangely, she realized. [348] Not toward the sun exactly. [353] The leaves turned toward her as she passed, not when she moved, but when she felt tenderness. [369] When she let her heart soften toward this broken, stubborn place. [380]

Phototropic to kindness. [383] The oasis could feel intention. [388]

Mira knelt and pressed her palms to the earth. [397] The thrum intensified, and she understood: this place hadn't resisted change. [408] It had absorbed it. [412] Every possible outcome lived here, layered, and the oasis had grown strong enough to hold contradiction. [427]

Like a potter centers clay, she thought. [434] Not by fighting the spin, but by accepting the chaos into her hands and finding the stillness within it. [452]

The smoke on the horizon flattened further, spreading into night. [462] Mira assembled her wheel by feel and began to gather clay from the oasis edge—clay fed by three timelines of rain and drought and burning. [486] She worked in darkness, the faded lantern glass placed before her, and by starlight through its clouded surface, she threw pot after pot. [509]

Each one held fractures. [513] Hairline cracks that should have meant failure. [520] But when she touched them with gentleness, the cracks sealed—not disappearing, but becoming part of the design. [536] Stronger for their breaking. [540]

At dawn, she would leave these vessels by the empty hives. [551] Offerings. [552] Conversations. [553] Questions: Why do some things break and stay broken? [561] Why do others break and become more? [568]

She didn't need answers. [572] A zen-minded potter knows that asking well matters more than knowing. [583] The wheel hummed beneath her hands. [589] The oasis held its breath. [594]

Somewhere, in a timeline layered like glaze, bees returned to find her gifts. [607] Somewhere, they never left. [611] Somewhere, they had burned with everything else. [618]

All of it was true. [623]

And in the morning, when chimney smoke rose sharp and straight into the windless air, Mira shouldered her wheel and walked back into the scorched world. [648] The faded lantern glass hung at her belt. [656]

She would find other fractures. [661] Other places where change had bent but not broken. [670]

There was always more clay. [675] There was always more wheel. [680]

There was always the spin seeking center. [687]
