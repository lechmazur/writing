The canyon had been singing since before the first word was spoken, and Verai knew it would sing long after the last speaker of her tongue drew their final breath. [30]

She stood on the highest platform of the bone tower, copper veins glinting beneath her translucent skin—the mark of her lineage, the storytellers who had swallowed molten metal to carry their ancestors' voices in their blood. [65]

Below her, the canyon stretched into forever, its walls carved from the fossilized remains of creatures older than memory. [83] Towers of bone rose from the depths like fingers reaching toward an indifferent sky, and between them, echoes traveled in endless loops, words spoken centuries ago still whispering through the stone arteries of the earth. [119]

In her palm rested the diamond—flawed, fractured, rumored to be cursed. [131] It had passed through seventeen hands before reaching hers, and twelve of those hands had belonged to speakers of languages now silent. [152] Some said the stone devoured tongues. [158] Verai believed it merely witnessed their deaths, helpless as any mourner. [168]

She was the last who could speak the old way. [177] Her children had learned the conqueror's language, practical and sharp. [187] Her grandchildren didn't understand why she wept when they couldn't pronounce the word for the color of dawn reflected in canyon mist—a word that existed nowhere else, that captured a hue no other tongue could name. [226]

Her motivation had crystallized slowly, like the diamond itself: she would translate texture into sound. [241] Every rough edge of bone, every smooth canyon wall, every gust of wind that carried the scent of ancient things—she would give them voices. [265] The language might die in human throats, but it would live in the echoes. [279]

The method had come to her in dreams: through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight. [295] She watched them now, the canyon swifts that nested in hollow bones, their formations shifting like thoughts taking shape. [313] They knew something about translation—how to turn air currents into movement, movement into survival, survival into beauty. [330]

When she lifted the flawed diamond to the light, it fractured the sun into spectra that painted her copper veins gold. [349] The crack in its center formed a tunnel of echoes in miniature—a flaw that was also a doorway. [368] She had discovered that when she pressed the stone against the tower walls, it absorbed the texture and, if she listened with her whole body, released it as sound. [399]

Quietly articulate, she began her work. [405] Each texture became a syllable. [410] The porous surface of ancient bone sang in low, breathy tones. [421] The smoothed pathway where generations of storytellers had walked hummed with accumulated presence. [433] The sharp edge of a broken rib produced a cry like grief given voice. [446]

She worked across the death of her language, season into season, watching the last speakers fade like stars at dawn. [465] Her grandson visited once, asking what she was doing. [474] She tried to explain, but the words for "memory made physical" and "sound that holds shape" existed only in the dying tongue. [494] He smiled, not understanding, and left. [500]

But the birds understood. [504] They began to fly in patterns that matched her transcriptions, their formations spelling out textures she hadn't yet translated. [522] They showed her how to harness the canyon itself, how to use its endless echoes as an instrument. [539]

When Verai finally pressed the diamond to her own copper-veined arm, the sound it produced was neither word nor music but something between—the texture of a storyteller who had refused to let silence win. [574]

The echo carried into the canyon and didn't return. [583] It traveled instead through the tunnel of echoes, joining the ancient whispers, becoming part of the canyon's eternal song. [601]

Years later, travelers who passed through the bone towers reported hearing voices they couldn't understand speaking words that felt like colors, like the rough grain of wood, like the particular sorrow of watching something beautiful end. [639]

They didn't know they were hearing the last dictionary of a dead language, written in texture, spoken in echo, kept alive by the flight patterns of birds who had learned to read the air. [672]

The diamond, they said, was never found. [679] But on certain mornings, when the light fractured just right through the canyon mist, observers swore they could see its flaw still transmitting—still cursed, perhaps, but also still translating, still refusing to let the silence have the final word.
