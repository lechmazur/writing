The cobalt terrace overlooked a shore that maps had forgotten. [9] At dusk, when the sky bled indigo into the water, Maren returned to count her sins among the driftwood. [27]

She had been a genealogist once, a legitimate one, before the money turned her into something else. [43] Now she manufactured false memories for clients who paid well to forget their blood, to claim ancestors they had never possessed, to erase shameful branches from their family trees. [72] She was good at it. [77] Documents aged under her careful hands. [84] Photographs warped to include faces that had never stood together. [94] She created pasts that felt more real than truth. [104]

But guilt had teeth, and hers had been gnawing for three years now. [117]

Maren descended the terrace steps, carrying a single object in her pocket: a watch hand, bent and tarnished, its gold plating worn to copper beneath. [143] It had belonged to Elena Voss, or rather, to the woman who should have been Elena Voss, before Maren had erased her from the family record entirely. [172]

The job had seemed simple enough. [178] The Voss family wanted their matriarch's past cleaned. [187] An illegitimate daughter, born during the war, given away to an orphanage and never spoken of again. [203] They wanted no record of her existence. [210] They paid Maren handsomely to ensure that when anyone searched the Voss genealogy, they would find only silence, a sieved hush where a whole life had been. [240]

Maren had done her work thoroughly. [246] She had altered certificates, corrupted databases, manufactured memories in the minds of elderly relatives through careful suggestion and forged photographs. [264] The daughter became a ghost. [269] The daughter became nothing. [273]

But the daughter had been looking too. [280]

Maren had discovered this by accident, a letter returned to her post box, addressed to a woman seeking her birth family. [301] The woman had come so close to finding the truth before Maren's work had closed every door. [318] The watch hand had fallen from the envelope, a fragment of a timepiece the woman's biological mother had given to the orphanage as a token, as a promise to return. [350]

She had never returned. [354] The daughter had died still searching, still carrying that broken piece of a watch, living under the weight of unspoken words that should have been spoken, that Maren had ensured would never be spoken. [387]

Now Maren walked the forgotten shore at dusk, sifting through driftwood carvings that locals had made and abandoned here for decades. [408] Each one told a story: a face, a symbol, a name etched into salt-bleached wood. [424] The shore was a memorial for forgotten people, for those whose names had been lost to time and tide. [443]

She was looking for one carving in particular. [451] Before the erasure, she had learned that the daughter had come here once, had carved something into a piece of driftwood and left it among the others. [480] A message, perhaps. [483] A prayer. [485] A curse for the family that had abandoned her. [493]

Maren needed to find it. [498] She needed to discover the weight of that withheld truth, to understand exactly what she had stolen when she had sieved the hush of history and left only silence. [528]

Her fingers moved through the carvings, reading names and dates, hearts and anchors, the small desperate hopes of anonymous hands. [548] The terrace above her had turned fully cobalt now, the last light dying against ancient stone. [564]

She found it wedged between two larger pieces: a palm-sized curve of wood, worn smooth by decades of salt air. [584] The carving was simple, a clock face with no hands, and beneath it, a single question. [601]

"Did she ever think of me?" [607]

Maren held the carving and let the question settle into her chest, heavy as the watch hand in her pocket. [626] She could not answer it. [631] She could not undo what she had done. [639] But standing here, holding evidence of a daughter's hope, she could at least stop trying to quell her guilt with justifications and silence. [661]

She placed the watch hand on the sand beside the carving. [672] Let them rest together, finally. [677]

The tide would take them both by morning. [685] But tonight, in the failing light, Maren sat on the forgotten shore and allowed herself to feel the full weight of every life she had unmade with her careful, terrible work. [716]

Tomorrow she would begin making amends. [722] Tonight, tempered regret was enough. [727]
