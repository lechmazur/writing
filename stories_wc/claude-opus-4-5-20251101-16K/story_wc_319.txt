The frozen garden existed at the boundaries of light, where luminescence frayed into mist and certainty dissolved into vapor. [19] The guardian had learned this place through the veil of sleep, arriving here from a dimension that now felt like a half-remembered book—pages scattered, spine broken, text bleeding into margins. [50]

She was feral now. [54] That was the word the Others had used before they stopped visiting. [65] Feral: meaning she had forgotten the postures of civilization, the small courtesies that made beings comfortable in each other's presence. [83] She moved on all fours sometimes, circling the frozen rose bushes, sniffing at the crystallized petals that held their shape like eternal questions. [105]

The library she guarded existed between the garden's ice-locked hedges—not a building but an accumulation, books stacked in columns that grew from the frozen earth like stalagmites. [133] Knowledge had accreted here at the crossroads of dimensions, and someone had needed to protect it. [148] She no longer remembered volunteering. [153]

Around her neck hung a cultist's pendant, an obsidian disc etched with symbols that meant doorway in a language she could no longer read. [175] She had taken it from a visitor who came seeking forbidden texts, then stayed too long, dissolved into the mist like the others. [197] The pendant was supposed to be her way home. [206] Instead, it had become her anchor to homesickness itself—dimensionally homesick, they called it, when your cells remembered a gravity that no longer pulled. [229]

She had learned to wait. [234] Not as patience, which implied purpose, but as practice—a devotional act of pure presence. [248] The frozen garden demanded nothing else. [254] Time moved strangely here, pooling in some corners, rushing through others. [265] Through the veil of sleep, she experienced years as moments and moments as epochs. [278] She dreamed of the library she had guarded before this one, its orderly shelves, its catalogued silence. [294] She woke to find ice forming on her eyelashes, mist curling through her thoughts like prose. [310]

The method she had developed for survival was interiorizing exteriors—taking the frozen garden into herself until the boundary between guardian and guarded dissolved. [334] She breathed the mist into her lungs and felt it settle in her bones. [348] She pressed her palms against the ice and absorbed its patience. [360] The garden became her bloodstream; her heartbeat became the garden's pulse. [372]

This was how she learned to make friends with uncertainty. [382] Not by conquering it, not by mapping its edges, but by letting it occupy her. [397] The mist taught her that unclear was not the same as unknown. [410] The boundaries of light showed her that endings could be gradual, could be gentle, could be beautiful in their ambiguity. [430]

Sometimes visitors still came. [434] They emerged from the mist with demands—for knowledge, for power, for passages home. [448] She watched them from behind columns of frozen books, her eyes reflecting the weak light that filtered through the garden's eternal twilight. [471] Most grew frightened by her silence, her stillness, her refusal to perform recognizable behavior. [485] They left. [487]

But occasionally, one would sit among the ice-locked roses and simply wait with her. [502] These were the ones who understood that some libraries cannot be searched, only inhabited. [517] Some knowledge cannot be extracted, only absorbed. [524]

The pendant grew warm against her chest when these visitors appeared. [535] She wondered sometimes if it was trying to tell her something—that home was not a dimension but a recognition, not a place but a practice of presence. [562]

The fog lifted occasionally, revealing glimpses of other gardens, other libraries, other guardians keeping their own vigils at the boundaries of light. [584] She raised her hand to them through the mist. [593] They raised their hands back. [598] None of them moved closer. [603] None of them needed to. [608]

She had made friends with uncertainty, and uncertainty had introduced her to patience, to presence, to the particular peace of existing at edges. [632] The frozen garden bloomed in its own fashion—not with flowers but with accumulated stillness, with the weight of waiting, with the quiet companionship of other creatures who had forgotten how to perform certainty. [668]

Through the veil of sleep, she dreamed of dimensions she no longer ached to return to. [685] She woke to mist and ice and the steady pulse of her interiorized garden. [700] She waited. [702] The books accreted around her like time made visible. [712] The boundaries of light held, neither advancing nor retreating, suspended in their eternal, foggy lucidity. [728]
