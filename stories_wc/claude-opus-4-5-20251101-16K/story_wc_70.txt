The lightning collection tower stood against the amber sky like a needle threading gold through clouds. [15] Mira climbed the copper stairs as the last light of day painted everything in nectar dusk—that particular honey-colored hour when the world seemed suspended between what was and what could be. [47]

At the tower's first landing, the toll keeper sat in his booth, exactly as he had for thirty years. [65] Beside him rested a lacquer box, its black surface reflecting the dying sun like still water. [80]

"The city needs answers," Mira said. [86] "The blackout lasted twelve hours. [91] People are afraid." [94]

The toll keeper—everyone called him Candid Cal—looked at her with those pale, unsettling eyes. [108] His condition was well-known: involuntarily truthful since birth, unable to lie even when mercy demanded it. [123] Most people avoided him. [127] Mira had learned to value what others feared. [135]

"You already suspect the truth," he said. [142] "You smell of hive smoke." [147]

She did. [149] She'd been at the apiary district when the drone bees began falling from the sky like metal rain. [167] The automated hives that pollinated the city's gardens and, more importantly, regulated the biological batteries feeding the tower's capacitors—all of them, silent now. [192]

"The drone beehive failure," she said. [198] "Is that what caused the blackout?" [205]

"The failure didn't cause it. [210] The failure was a symptom." [215] Cal's honesty was never simple; truth rarely was. [223] "Someone sabotaged the queen algorithms. [228] The hives stopped producing the enzymatic compound that stabilizes the lightning cells. [239] Without it, the tower couldn't hold the charge. [247] It all leaked away like water through cracked clay." [256]

"Who would do this?" [260]

Cal opened his lacquer box. [265] Inside, nestled in velvet, were dozens of matchboxes, each hand-painted with symbols she didn't recognize. [280]

"My predecessor left me these," he said. [287] "I've been keeper of this tower for three decades, and my purpose has been singular: to preserve wonder in routine. [307] People climb past me every day without seeing me. [316] They forget that lightning is a miracle. [323] They forget that bees—even mechanical ones—are sacred architects of connection. [333] So I collect riddles. [337] I give them to those who remember to ask questions." [347]

He selected one matchbox, its surface decorated with a tiny painted bee circled by lightning bolts. [362]

"I found this riddle fourteen years ago, tucked into the queen algorithm's original programming notes. [377] I never understood it until tonight." [383]

He slid the matchbox across to her. [390] Inside, a slip of paper read: "When the keeper becomes the kept, the sweetness turns to ash. [407] What feeds the thunder will poison the garden. [415] The cure sleeps in the first sting." [422]

Mira read it three times. [427] "This is a warning. [431] Someone knew this would happen." [436]

"The original programmer," Cal said. [441] "She knew her creation could be corrupted. [448] The 'first sting'—the original queen bee, the prototype. [456] It's kept in the archive vault beneath this tower. [465] Its programming is uncorrupted, isolated from the network." [473]

"You're telling me the solution has been here all along?" [483]

"I'm telling you the truth. [488] I have no choice in that." [494] A sad smile crossed his weathered face. [501] "But I chose to reveal it through wonder rather than plain speech. [513] That's the only freedom I have—not whether to tell the truth, but how." [526]

The nectar light was fading now, purple shadows climbing the tower's copper struts. [539] Somewhere below, the city waited in darkness, afraid of another night without power. [552]

Mira pocketed the matchbox. [556] "Thank you, Cal." [559]

"Thank the programmer who left breadcrumbs in riddles. [567] Thank the original designers who knew that routine makes us blind, and wonder makes us see." [582] He closed his lacquer box gently. [588] "The vault combination is 7-19-42. [594] The truth of that, I give you freely." [602]

She climbed higher as stars emerged above the dormant lightning rods. [613] Tomorrow, the drone bees would fly again, guided by uncorrupted code. [624] The tower would drink the sky's fire once more. [633]

But tonight, ascending through nectar dusk into genuine darkness, Mira carried something more precious than a solution—she carried a reminder that miracles hide in plain sight, waiting for someone candid enough to name them. [668]
