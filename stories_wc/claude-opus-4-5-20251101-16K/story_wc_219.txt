The tower stood rainwashed in spring, its stones darkened to the color of old iron, and Vera Solis climbed its spiral stairs in the bronze quiet of early morning. [31]

She had been called a luminous skeptic by her colleagues at the Institute, a term meant to wound but which she wore like armor. [54] Her reputation for being academically rebellious preceded her—the xenobiologist who argued that the Visitors' gift of interstellar navigation was less transformative than humanity's own stubborn attachment to Earth. [82] Now, three years after making first contact, while others mapped wormholes and negotiated trade routes with beings from Kepler-442b, Vera walked an overgrown sculpture path toward an abandoned observation tower, following footprints not her own. [117]

The dusty footprints troubled her with their precision. [125] Someone had walked this path recently, perhaps many someones, their traces converging toward this same destination despite the weeds threading through cracked stone and the bronze statues listing with neglect. [154] The artificial pilgrimage had begun as her private research protocol—a controlled journey to sites of personal significance, measuring cortisol and oxytocin, cataloging the neurochemical signatures of return. [181] But others had joined, drawn by the same questions that drove her. [192]

In her pocket, she carried the fly amber. [200]

Her grandmother had given it to her decades ago, a teardrop of golden resin containing a single preserved fly, wings still catching light after forty million years. [227] "Everything that matters," her grandmother had said, "eventually becomes suspended in something beautiful." [240] Vera had dismissed this as sentiment then. [247] Now, after watching the Visitors regard Earth with the detached interest of scientists examining specimens, she understood it differently. [265]

The tower's top chamber opened to gray spring skies, and she was not alone. [279]

Three others had converged here via that same dusty path: a former astronaut who had touched the Visitor ship and come back changed, a linguist who had decoded the first transmission, and a child—perhaps twelve—who simply said she had dreamed of this place. [323] None of them had arranged to meet. [330] The artificial pilgrimage, Vera realized, had ceased to be artificial somewhere between intention and arrival. [345]

"You're studying homecoming," the astronaut said, not asking. [354] His voice carried the same bronze quiet as the morning itself, muted and heavy with accumulated time. [369]

Vera nodded, withdrawing the fly amber and letting it rest in her palm where they could all see. [386] "I wanted to understand the chemistry. [392] Why humans need to return to places. [399] The Visitors don't have this compulsion—they've told us their species experiences no attachment to location. [414] They find it quaint." [418]

"And what have you found?" the linguist asked. [426]

The fly in the amber stared outward with compound eyes that had last perceived Oligocene forests. [441] Vera thought about her measurements, her charts of neurotransmitter cascades, her careful documentation of the biological mechanisms underlying nostalgia. [458] She thought about how the data was accurate and complete and explained nothing that mattered. [472]

"I found that homecoming isn't chemistry at all," she said finally. [483] "Or rather, the chemistry is just the shadow of something else. [494] We don't return to places because of oxytocin. [502] We produce oxytocin because returning matters. [508] The need comes first." [512]

The child moved to the tower's edge and looked out over the sculpture path, where more footprints were visible now, new ones layering over old, converging from multiple directions through the overgrown grass. [546] "More are coming," she said. [551]

Vera watched them approach—small figures at first, then clearer, humans walking toward this rainwashed tower in the spring light as if pulled by something older than language or explanation. [579] The Visitors had given humanity the stars, but they had also, inadvertently, given this: a reminder that leaving required first understanding what was being left behind. [607]

She held the fly amber up to the morning. [616] The preserved insect had been flying toward something when the resin caught it—food, perhaps, or light, or home. [634] Now it hung suspended forever in that moment of yearning, beautiful because it would never arrive, tragic because it had never stopped trying. [658]

This was the chemistry of homecoming, she understood at last. [669] Not the destination, but the turning back. [677] Not the place, but the ache for it. [685] The Visitors would never understand because they had never needed to return to anything. [699] They traveled forward eternally, free and unfettered and ultimately alone. [710]

But humans—luminous skeptics and dreamers and those who had touched other worlds and come back different—humans would always converge on places like this, following footprints through overgrown paths, seeking the bronze quiet of towers where something essential waited. [752]

Vera descended the spiral stairs to join the others gathering below, the fly amber warm against her palm, finally home. [771]
