The wind turbines turned their slow revolution above the farmhouse, casting shadows that swept across the kitchen floor like the hands of an indifferent clock. [26] Mira sat at the table, knife in hand, whittling a small bird from a block of pine. [43] Her face held no expression—hadn't for three years now, since the happiness mandate changed everything. [57]

"And now," she announced to the empty room, her voice rising with theatrical gravity, "the performer selects her next piece of wood. [78] She examines it for flaws, for the hidden bird within. [88] This is a moment of profound significance." [95]

No one laughed. [98] No one was there to laugh. [104]

The dried flower bouquet on the windowsill had been her mother's last gift—lavender and roses, preserved in the final weeks before the mandate made grief illegal. [131] Before the Serenity Officers began their patrols. [138] Before they took the tears away. [144] They had come to the farmhouse twice in the first year, checking her biometrics, scanning her face for unauthorized sorrow. [164] She had learned to remake the hush inside her into something acceptable: not peace, but its convincing mask. [181]

"The shaving falls to the floor," she continued, sweeping her arm dramatically. [193] "A small tragedy. [196] A loss that cannot be quantified. [202] The performer does not weep." [207]

She didn't weep. [210] She hadn't wept in so long that she wondered if the ability had atrophied entirely, like an unused muscle. [229]

The turbines groaned outside, their blades cutting through clouds heavy with rain that never seemed to fall. [246] The farmhouse had belonged to her family for four generations, standing here long before the towers rose around it. [264] Now it belonged to the Energy Collective, and she was merely a permitted resident—a performer who had once toured the compliance circuits, demonstrating acceptable joy to crowds of the recently bereaved. [297]

This was her moral ambiguity, the weight she carried beneath her blank expression: she had taught others to bury their grief. [317] She had shown them how to smile when their children were taken to the Contentment Centers, how to laugh at mandatory celebrations while their hearts turned to stone. [345] She had been good at it. [351] The best, they said, before they retired her here. [360]

"The performer rises," she narrated, standing from the table. [369] "She approaches the sacred bouquet. [374] She touches one dried petal—observe the controlled motion, the complete absence of trembling." [387]

The lavender crumbled slightly under her finger. [394] Each year, more of it disintegrated. [400] Each year, less remained of her mother. [407]

Cultivating lightness in grief—that was what the Ministry called their program. [418] They wanted people to float above their sorrows, untouched and untouchable, productive members of a society that had outlawed darkness. [437] But Mira had learned that lightness was not the same as joy. [449] It was hollowness. [452] It was becoming so empty that nothing could hurt you because nothing could reach you. [467]

She returned to her whittling, carving the bird's wings with precise strokes. [479]

"The wings take shape," she declared to the shadows and the dust. [491] "Soon this creature will appear to fly, though it will never leave the shelf. [505] The performer finds this acceptable. [510] The performer finds everything acceptable." [515]

The words fell into the silence of the farmhouse, absorbed by walls that had heard four generations of laughter and weeping. [535] Now they heard only her performances—her way of speaking without saying anything true, of filling the void without disturbing it. [555]

The turbines turned. [558] The shadows swept. [561] The dried flowers waited for their final dissolution. [569]

When night came, Mira placed the finished bird beside the bouquet. [580] A small wooden creature with blank eyes and frozen wings, joining the others. [592] She had made dozens over the years, a flock of stillness watching over the remnants of her mother's garden. [611]

"The performer retires for the evening," she said to no one, to everyone who had ever listened to her teach them emptiness. [633] "She has successfully completed another day. [639] She has cultivated the required lightness. [645] She has not grieved." [649]

In the darkness, the turbines hummed their mechanical lullaby. [658] Mira lay with her blank face turned toward the ceiling, practicing the remade hush that had replaced her heart—that careful silence where grief existed but made no sound, where love persisted but asked for nothing, where a woman could survive by becoming her own ghost. [704]

Outside, the wind turned the turbines. [710] Inside, nothing moved at all. [715]
