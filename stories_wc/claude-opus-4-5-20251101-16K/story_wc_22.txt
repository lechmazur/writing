The coachman arrived at twilight, when the blooming jetty stretched like a narrow tongue into the gray expanse of water. [20] The reef had been dead three seasons now—skeletal beneath the surface, bleached white as old bone. [36] What the war hadn't killed, the aftermath had. [44]

He carried a leather satchel worn soft with years, and inside it, his collection of dried seed pods rattled like small prayers. [64] Fennel. [65] Meadowsweet. [66] Sea thrift from the northern cliffs. [72] He'd gathered them from every hill his coach had crossed since the armistice, saving them for this moment. [90]

The locals called him the gloom-hill coachman because that was the route he'd driven during the war—ferrying the wounded up that dark slope to the field hospital, returning empty or with supplies scavenged from the dead. [125] The horses had known the path so well they could navigate it blind. [138] After the fighting stopped, so did the need for coaches. [148] But he couldn't stop driving, couldn't stop moving, until he'd found something worthy of all that motion. [165]

He stepped onto the jetty where the stones still bore scorch marks from the naval bombardment. [180] Wild poppies had pushed through the cracks—the first colonizers, the ones that always find scorched earth. [195] But they weren't enough. [199] A battlefield needed more than red flowers to become something other than itself. [212]

A tern called overhead, three short notes followed by a long descending cry. [225] The coachman tilted his head, listening. [231] He'd learned to understand bird calls from an old scholar who'd also taught him dead languages—Etruscan, Sumerian, the maritime pidgin that fishermen had spoken here before the empire standardized their tongues. [261] The scholar believed all communication stemmed from the same source, that birdsong and ancient hymns shared a grammar of necessity. [279] The tern's call meant the tide was turning, that the underwater currents had shifted. [293] It meant the sediment from the dead reef was settling into new patterns. [306]

This was how he knew where to fertilize the soil—by listening. [317]

He walked the length of the jetty, scattering crushed seed pods where the birds told him the nutrients were gathering, where the water's patient work had softened the salted earth enough for roots to take hold. [351] His hands moved with the certainty of ritual, and his lips shaped words in languages no living community spoke. [369] Prayers, perhaps, or apologies—it was hard to tell the difference anymore. [381]

The submerged concord was an old treaty, signed by four nations, promising this coastline would remain neutral ground. [397] It had been weighted with stones and sunk in the harbor as symbolic burial. [412] The war had dredged it up, torn it apart, and scattered its fragments across the seafloor. [428] The coachman had seen a piece of it once, washed ashore after a storm—waterlogged parchment with words in a dead dialect, promising peace in perpetuity. [454]

Now he sought to honor that drowned agreement the only way he knew how. [468] Not through signatures or sanctions, but through roots. [477] Through the slow green work of reclamation. [484]

The jetty bloomed with evening primrose and sea lavender, hardy plants that had somehow survived the chemical runoff, the shelling, the years of neglect. [506] They glowed pale in the twilight, and beyond them stretched the water—vast and narrow at once, an endless horizon compressed into the corridor of his vision. [533] The narrow vastness of aftermath, where everything that mattered fit into a small space surrounded by incomprehensible emptiness. [549]

He opened the last seed pod and let the wind take its contents. [562] Cornflower seeds, blue as the peace the treaty had promised. [573] They scattered across the stones where soldiers had died, where shells had fallen, where the reef had thrived before the poison and the fire. [597]

The terns continued their evening chorus, and he translated their calls into action—a handful of fertilizer here, a prayer in Sumerian there, the slow and patient grammar of restoration. [626]

By the time full dark came, he had emptied his satchel. [637] The seeds lay invisible among the stones, waiting for rain, for root, for the garden that would eventually swallow every memory of war. [659] It would take years. [663] It would take longer than he had left. [671]

But the birds would remember his work. [678] They always did. [681]

He walked back toward the shore, his footsteps echoing on the old stones, leaving the blooming jetty to its twilight vigil. [703] Tomorrow he would find more seeds. [709] The battlefield was patient, and so was he. [718]
