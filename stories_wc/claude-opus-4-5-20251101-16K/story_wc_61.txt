Vael moved through the nebula garden with the deliberate grace of one who had learned that hurrying accomplished nothing across the span of eternities. [24] The garden approximated infinity—a sprawling cathedral of stellar dust and ionized gases that bloomed in spirals of violet, crimson, and gold. [45] Here, in the spaces between dying stars and nascent worlds, Vael cultivated something no mortal vocabulary could name. [62]

They were a sentimentalist, this otherworldly keeper, though the word felt too small for what they carried. [78] Every particle of light that drifted past triggered memories of civilizations they had watched rise and crumble, of children born into hope and buried under the weight of their ancestors' repeating failures. [108]

Vael's translucent fingers curled around the calculating machine gear they always kept close—a toothed wheel of brass-like alloy, the last remnant of an instrument their own people had once used to chart generational patterns. [142] The machine itself had dissolved into the void epochs ago, but this single gear remained, its teeth worn smooth from Vael's constant, unconscious touching. [166]

To transit across the garden's immensity, Vael employed sonar pinging—pulses of light-encoded sound that rippled through the nebular medium, bouncing off stellar nurseries and dark matter knots to map pathways only they could read. [201] Each ping returned laden with information: temperature, density, the faint signatures of organic compounds seeding themselves into the cosmos. [220]

Ping. [221] A colony world three light-centuries distant was approaching its industrial threshold. [232] Ping. [233] Another civilization was discovering atomic fire. [240] Ping. [241] A third was already choking on its own emissions. [250]

The patterns. [252] Always the patterns. [255]

Vael had watched seventeen thousand sentient species follow the same trajectory—the discovery of combustion, the addiction to burning, the inevitable consumption of everything they loved until only ash remained. [284] Fire had given them light, yes, but fire was hungry. [294] Fire was a teacher that devoured its students. [302]

This was Vael's burden, their motivation carved into whatever served as their soul: to share light without using fire. [321] To find another way. [325]

The nebula garden was their laboratory. [331] Here, bioluminescent spores drifted on solar winds, carrying genetic templates that would teach emerging species to cultivate light through chemistry rather than combustion. [354] Here, crystalline structures grew that could capture starlight and release it slowly across millennia. [368] Here, Vael designed alternatives to the burning path. [377]

A petal fell. [380]

In the garden, petals were sheets of plasma that cooled and separated from stellar formations, descending through the nebular currents across the quiet sigh of falling petals—a timeframe that could span human centuries but felt, to Vael, like the duration of a held breath. [426]

In that suspended moment, Vael watched the calculating gear catch the light of a distant pulsar. [442] The teeth cast shadows that reminded them of graphs—the predictive charts their people had once drawn to track generational patterns, how trauma and wisdom alike passed from parent to child, how entire civilizations inherited their ancestors' blindnesses. [479]

The troubling serenity of the garden pressed close. [487] Everything was beautiful here. [491] Everything was doomed to repeat. [496]

But not, Vael hoped, forever. [501]

They released a new cluster of spores toward the colony world approaching its threshold. [514] Perhaps this species would be different. [520] Perhaps the bioluminescent gift would reach them before they discovered their first match. [533] Perhaps the children would not inherit the patterns of their parents. [544]

The gear's teeth pressed into Vael's palm as they watched the spores drift into the void. [559]

Ping. [560]

The sonar returned with data about the colony world. [569] Signs of early toolmaking. [573] Curiosity about the stars. [577] No fire yet. [580]

Still time. [582]

Vael exhaled—a release of particles that joined the nebula's glow—and continued their eternal transit through the garden, tending infinite possibilities, carrying the weight of seventeen thousand failures and the stubborn hope that one species might finally break free from the burning cycle that consumed all the rest. [631]

Another petal fell, plasma cooling into gossamer sheets that drifted past Vael's shoulders. [644] They caught one, examined its structure, found in its crystalline formation the same mathematical progressions that the calculating gear once measured—generational patterns written into the universe's very fabric. [674]

The serenity remained, vast and encompassing, beautiful enough to break whatever hearts Vael might possess. [690] The trouble persisted beneath it, a current of grief that never stilled. [702]

Somewhere, a civilization was striking its first spark. [710]

Somewhere else, Vael's spores were taking root. [717]

The race continued, as it always had, as it always would, across the quiet sigh of falling petals that measured out infinity one impossible moment at a time. [746]
