The ranger cabin smelled of pine resin and abandonment when Mira arrived, three days after standing before her own headstone in the cemetery below Harrow Peak. [26]

She set her pack on the dusty table and unrolled the birch bark scroll she'd carried through seventeen documented dream-walks, its surface covered in her cramped handwriting—observations, timestamps that contradicted themselves, sketches of places that existed only in the space between sleep and waking. [66]

The date on the grave had been wrong, or right, or both. [78]

This was the problem with becoming a lucid dream chronicler: after enough years of stepping sideways through your own consciousness, witnessing memories before they happened and futures that had already passed, chronological confusion became less a symptom than a way of being. [116]

Mira lit the cabin's wood stove and watched the flames with the tired appreciation of someone who had seen fire invented, fire worshipped, fire forgotten—all while her physical body slept in various beds across her thirty-eight years. [152]

Jaded wonder, her mentor had called it. [158]

The birch bark scroll contained her life's work: the discipline of distilling chaos into narrative, of taking the howling meaninglessness of dreams and shaping them into something that could be understood, recorded, passed along. [192]

But tonight she needed to chronicle something worse than chaos. [202]

She needed to make sense of the feral nostalgia that had gripped her since seeing that headstone, since reading her own name carved into granite alongside dates that placed her death eleven years in the past. [238]

The feeling wasn't grief, exactly. [243]

It was a wild, untamed longing that refused domestication—a desperate clawing back toward versions of herself that had never stood in graveyards, never questioned whether they existed, never felt the peculiar vertigo of being both dead and present. [281]

Mira dipped her pen in ink and began to write on a fresh section of bark. [296]

"The subject experiences intense jealousy toward past iterations of self," she recorded, clinical even now. [311]

But the clinical tone fractured as she continued writing, because how could she remain detached when the jealousy was so specific? [331]

She envied the Mira who had learned to soar through dreamscapes at nineteen, that younger self lifting off from imagined cliffs with pure exhilaration, no knowledge yet of what the gift would cost. [364]

She envied the Mira who had first discovered the birch bark method at twenty-six, who had believed that recording dreams meant understanding them. [386]

She envied every past self who had woken from lucid dreams with certainty about which life was real. [403]

The cabin creaked in the mountain wind, and Mira paused her writing to look out the frost-touched window. [420]

Stars scattered across the sky like spilled salt, and she felt the familiar pull toward sleep, toward the landscapes waiting behind her eyelids. [442]

Perhaps tonight she would soar again. [448]

Perhaps she would find herself in some other when, watching a younger Mira make choices the current Mira could no longer change. [468]

The feral nostalgia had teeth now; she could feel them whenever she glimpsed who she'd been before the timelines tangled, before death became just another event that may or may not have occurred. [502]

She returned to the scroll, forcing herself to continue the chronicle. [513]

"Subject must accept that jealousy of past selves represents fundamental misunderstanding of temporal dream-walking. All selves exist simultaneously. Grave may indicate death of one iteration while others persist." [543]

The words helped, slightly. [547]

Distilling chaos into narrative always helped, slightly. [553]

That was why she'd come to this remote cabin, far from any other dreamers who might contaminate her observations, far from any other graves that might confuse the data. [583]

Mira rolled the birch bark scroll carefully and placed it beside her cot. [595]

Tomorrow she would hike down to the grave again and study it with chronicler's eyes rather than mortal terror. [614]

Tonight, she would sleep, and maybe soar, and maybe encounter that nineteen-year-old self who still believed dreams were adventures rather than evidence. [635]

She would watch that younger Mira with something more evolved than jealousy, she promised herself—with the jaded wonder of someone who had seen enough impossible things to know that wonder itself was the only sane response to impossibility. [675]

The fire crackled its ancient language. [681]

The stars continued their indifferent burning. [687]

And Mira, chronologically confused, temporally fractured, officially deceased, closed her eyes and waited for the narrative to continue writing itself through her dreaming mind. [710]

The birch bark scroll would be waiting when she woke, patient as always, ready to receive whatever strange truths the night delivered—even if those truths refused to arrange themselves in any order that made sense to anyone except a dead woman still drawing breath in a ranger cabin, still trying to believe that stories could save her from the chaos. [781]

She soared into sleep like falling upward. [788]

And somewhere, in some when, a younger Mira looked up and almost saw her watching. [803]

I apologize - I went slightly over. Let me revise to stay within 600-800 words.
