Morrow called himself the junkyard prophet, though no one remembered giving him that name, least of all himself. [18] He wandered the fog sculpture garden at the edge of the abandoned pier, where salt air sculpted temporary monuments from mist and old things washed ashore to become something sacred in their forgetting. [51]

The visions came to him like tides—future moments crystallizing behind his eyes, perfect and terrible in their clarity. [70] But they lasted only seconds before dissolving. [77] He was precognitively forgetful, blessed and cursed with glimpses of what would be, unable to hold any of them. [96] By the time his hand reached for paper, the knowing had already retreated like water pulled from shore. [114]

So he left himself breadcrumbs. [119] Driftwood arranged in angles only he understood—this one pointing toward the rusted radio tower, that one toward the half-sunken boat—directional markers in a language of loss. [147] In his pocket, he carried a piece of plain chalk, worn to a nub, which he used to scratch cryptic notes onto concrete, metal, stone. [172] Tomorrow: the red-haired woman. [176] The sound of glass. [180] Look east. [182]

He was searching today. [186] The chalk message from yesterday's forgotten vision read only: locate the echo box. [199] Garden center. [201] Midday fog. [203]

The fog had arrived on schedule, thick as grief, wrapping around the abandoned sculptures that dotted this place—corroded metal shapes that artists had placed here decades ago, before the pier closed, before the town emptied, before time revealed that some places were meant to be left behind. [251] Now the sculptures existed amid the hush of old videotapes left unwatched, artifacts of an era no one had bothered to rewind. [273]

Morrow moved between them, following the driftwood arrows he'd laid out—when, yesterday, a week ago?—each one pointing him deeper into the garden. [297] The fog made ghosts of everything. [303] A steel heron emerged and vanished. [309] A concrete wave froze mid-curl. [314]

He was clinging to echoes—that was what his work had become. [326] Every vision showed him a future sound, and though he couldn't remember the visions themselves, he remembered this driving need: to capture the sound of growing older. [353] Not the obvious sounds—creaking joints, slowing breath—but the subtle ones. [365] The frequency shift when a voice you love starts saying goodbye. [376] The acoustic difference between an empty house and a home. [386] The particular silence that settles over videotapes no one will ever watch, recordings of birthday parties where the children are now old and the old are now gone. [414]

He believed these sounds existed, hiding just beneath human hearing. [424] His visions showed him devices to capture them, but the designs evaporated before he could build them. [441]

Today's driftwood path led him to a sculpture he'd forgotten existed: a hollow bronze sphere, cracked open like an egg, large enough to stand inside. [466] Fog pooled in its basin. [471] And there—scratched in his own chalk handwriting on the inner wall—were the words: YOU WILL FIND IT HERE. [491] BRING THE RECORDER. [494]

He didn't have a recorder. [499] He'd forgotten why he'd need one. [505]

But he understood the principle now. [511] The sphere was an echo chamber. [517] The fog carried moisture from the sea, and the sea remembered everything—every ship's bell, every drowned conversation, every whispered prayer of fishermen who never returned. [543] If he could just find the right frequency. [551]

Morrow sat inside the sphere and listened. [558] The fog breathed around him. [563] Somewhere beyond the garden, waves continued their ancient argument with the shore. [575]

And for one moment—before it slipped away like everything else—he heard it. [589] A sound like photographs curling at the edges. [597] Like letters never sent finally dissolving. [603] The sound of his mother's voice, not saying anything specific, just existing in a frequency only the growing-older could detect. [623]

He reached for his chalk to write it down. [632]

By the time the chalk touched metal, the sound was gone. [643]

But he marked the spot anyway. [649] Drew an arrow in driftwood. [654] Left a message for tomorrow's self: RETURN. [661] THE SPHERE KNOWS. [664]

The tide would bring new things to shore. [672] The fog would return. [676] And Morrow would begin again, a prophet of discarded futures, forever searching for echoes he could finally hold. [694]
