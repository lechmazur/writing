Mira stood at the observation dome of Bathys-7, her fingers wrapped around the single anchor chain link that hung from her neck. [23] The benthic city sprawled before her—a constellation of bioluminescent spires and pressure-sealed corridors, beautiful in its alien architecture, yet eternally sunken beneath three kilometers of Pacific darkness. [52] She was a navigation instructor, one of the last trained in the old ways. [64] Before the Visitors came, before humanity learned that the universe was far stranger and more populated than they had imagined, navigation meant charts and compasses and stars. [89] Now it meant edge geometry—the mathematics of folded space that the Visitors had shared, the equations that let ships slip between the pleats of reality. [114]

The anchor chain link was cold against her chest. [123] Her grandmother had given it to her, salvaged from a fishing vessel that had sailed the surface before the great migration downward. [144] "Remember the surface," her grandmother had said. [151] "Remember the stars." [154]

Mira's motivation was considered quaint by her colleagues. [162] She wanted to learn to navigate by starlight—truly learn it, not just understand it theoretically. [177] In Bathys-7, no one had seen unfiltered starlight in two generations. [188] The Visitors' technology had made it unnecessary. [195] Why look up at distant suns when you could fold the horizon itself and step across light-years? [213]

But Mira remained balancedly curious—fascinated by the new without abandoning the old. [225] She taught her students edge geometry because it was necessary, because the unfolded horizons of interstellar space demanded it. [244] Yet she also taught them about Polaris and the Southern Cross, about sextants and the patient mathematics of celestial navigation. [264]

Today, everything would change. [268]

The Visitors had announced an expansion—not of territory, but of understanding. [280] They were opening their archives, sharing navigation methods that predated their own mastery of edge geometry. [295] And buried in those archives, Mira had found something remarkable: the Visitors, too, had once navigated by starlight. [314] Before they learned to fold space, they had looked up at their alien sky and mapped their way across oceans of darkness. [336]

She stood now in the ascending chamber, clutching her anchor link, as the transport pod began its slow rise toward the surface observation platform—the first time it had been opened in decades. [370] The Visitors had arranged this, a gift for the human who had shown such reverent interest in their ancient ways. [391]

The pressure shifted. [394] The darkness thinned. [397]

And then she saw them. [402]

Stars. [403]

Thousands upon thousands of them, scattered across the black velvet of a moonless night. [417] Mira's breath caught, and her eyes burned with tears she hadn't expected. [430] This was what her grandmother had meant. [437] This was why the old navigators had mapped these lights with such devotion. [450]

The somber marvel of it overwhelmed her—the knowledge that these points of light were suns, many of them hosting worlds, some of them home to the Visitors themselves. [478] The universe had expanded beyond imagination after first contact, yet here, in this moment, it also felt intimate. [496] Personal. [497] These were the same stars humanity had used to cross oceans, to find their way home. [513]

She held up the anchor chain link, letting starlight fall upon its corroded surface for the first time in a century. [533]

Edge geometry could fold horizons. [538] But starlight unfolded them—revealed the true vastness, the patient distance, the ancient light still traveling through void to reach her eyes. [559] Both were navigation. [562] Both were true. [565]

Mira began to trace patterns in the sky, matching them to charts she had memorized from old books. [582] There was Orion. [585] There was the wandering red eye of Mars. [593] There was the faint smudge of Andromeda, another galaxy, impossibly far and impossibly present. [608]

Tomorrow, she would return to the benthic city. [616] She would teach her students about edge geometry and folded space. [627] But she would also tell them about this night, about standing beneath stars her ancestors had known, about the way ancient and modern navigation were not opposites but partners in understanding the cosmos. [661]

The Visitors had given humanity technology to compress distance, but they had also reminded her that wonder required expansion—the willingness to let vastness exist without reducing it. [690]

She removed the anchor chain link from her neck and held it toward the horizon where ocean met sky. [708] It had once held ships fast against currents and storms. [718] Now it held her fast to memory, to continuity, to the truth that some forms of knowledge should never be abandoned. [738]

The unfolded horizons stretched infinite above her. [745]

Mira was finally learning to find her way home. [754]
