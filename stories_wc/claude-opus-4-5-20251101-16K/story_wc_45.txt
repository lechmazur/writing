After the substitute body was found in the collapsed root cellar, Maren stopped sleeping through the night. [17]

For thirty years, she had been a forgiving skeptic—she'd forgiven her mother for the changeling stories, forgiven the endless rituals meant to summon back a "real" son who was just her odd brother Thomas. [54]

She'd dismissed it all as grief's strange language. [62]

But the wooden figure unearthed from the cellar, roughly child-sized, carved with features that seemed to shift in lamplight—that opened a cleft in her certainty she couldn't close. [93]

The hedge maze had grown wild since her mother's death. [103]

Maren had returned to settle the estate, armed with practicality and a surveyor's appointment. [116]

But she found herself drawn to the overgrown labyrinth, remembering her mother's whispered maps, the turns she'd memorized as a child. [135]

Left, left, right, through the archway of thorns. [143]

The secret garden existed. [147]

She had stopped believing in it, had decided it was another of her mother's inventions. [162]

But here it was—a circular clearing where moonflowers still bloomed, where a stone bench sat beside a fountain long silent. [183]

And sitting on that bench, waiting, was someone who looked like Thomas might have looked, if Thomas had aged. [200]

"You're the sister," he said. [205]

His voice held something shrewdly innocent—wise and wondering at once, as if he understood more than he let on but still found the world genuinely astonishing. [231]

"Thomas was my brother." [235]

"Thomas was a name you gave to something that wasn't me." [246]

He stood, and she noticed he moved carefully, as if his body was something he'd borrowed and hadn't quite figured out. [265]

"I've been yearning to meet you properly, all those years I watched through the gaps." [280]

"You're saying you're—what, a fairy?" [286]

He smiled. [288]

"I'm saying your mother knew what she knew. She made mistakes—kept me away, tried to burn the stock, said terrible things. But she also kept this garden, left the door unlocked, in her way." [323]

He held out his hand. [328]

In his palm lay a small white tooth, curved and sharp at the root. [341]

"A changeling's baby tooth," he said. [347]

"The one your mother found under Thomas's pillow when he was six. She knew then, but she also loved him. Both things were true." [370]

Maren's hands trembled as she took it. [377]

The tooth was cold, heavier than it should have been, and something in her chest shifted—bone setting, the slow, painful realignment of everything she'd believed. [404]

"Why now?" she asked. [408]

"Because you found the stock. Because certainty only matters until it doesn't." [420]

He sat back down, and the moonflowers seemed to lean toward him. [431]

"Your mother wanted to turn her mistakes into constellations—something to navigate by instead of stumble over. She couldn't finish the work. She hoped you might." [456]

"What does that even mean?" [461]

"It means you could dismiss this, walk away, sell the property, forget. Or you could forgive her—and me—and yourself for all the years of not-believing that were also years of protection." [493]

He tilted his head, birdlike. [498]

"It means the old stories might become new maps." [507]

Maren sat beside him. [511]

The garden smelled like her childhood, like her mother's perfume and the herbs she'd grown, like the fear and wonder Maren had worked so hard to outgrow. [538]

Nostalgic innovation, she thought without knowing where the phrase came from—keeping what mattered while letting it become something else. [556]

"She loved you," Maren said finally. [562]

"Even knowing." [564]

"She loved both of us. The one she lost and the one she kept." [576]

He touched the fountain's edge, and water began to trickle, impossible but undeniable. [588]

"That's not a contradiction. That's just how love works." [597]

The tooth was still in her palm. [604]

She closed her fingers around it—proof, or perhaps just a permission slip for wonder. [618]

The cleft in her certainty was still there, but she understood now it wasn't something to close. [635]

It was a doorway, same as the gap in the hedge, same as the silence between heartbeats. [651]

"Teach me the new maps," she said. [658]

He smiled, and the garden seemed to breathe with them, ancient and immediate, remembering and becoming. [673]
