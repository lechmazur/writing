Seren had negotiated for the end of the Forever War for thirty-seven years, and tonight, as Mars and Venus traced their ancient waltz above the terrace, she would either succeed or die trying. [33]

The ebony clipboard in her hands held not military positions or territorial demands, but names—four thousand three hundred and twelve names of children orphaned by the conflict she had once helped ignite. [66]

That was the price of redemption: to carry every consequence. [76]

The ancient terrace stretched before her, its cracked marble drinking in the midsummer heat that still radiated from the stones hours after sunset. [99]

Torches marked the perimeter where representatives of both the Valen Compact and the Iron Sovereignty would soon gather—if they honored the summons at all. [124]

Seren touched the scarred tissue along her jaw, a gift from an assassination attempt in her nineteenth year of negotiations. [144]

She had learned to be operatively gentle after that, understanding that force only bred more force, that true leverage came from patience and the careful architecture of trust. [172]

But gentleness had its limits. [177]

"They won't come." [180]

Her aide, Corin, stood at the terrace's edge, watching the road that wound up from the valley where armies had clashed for three generations. [204]

"The Valen delegates turned back at the ridge. [212] They say the ritual means nothing anymore." [219]

"Then we must make it mean something." [226]

Seren moved to the central altar, where her predecessors had conducted seven failed peace attempts. [241]

The stones still bore their blood. [247]

She began to muster what little remained—not soldiers, not leverage, but the weight of ritual significance itself. [265]

The midsummer gathering on this terrace predated the war by eight hundred years. [278]

Before nations drew borders with swords, before her grandfather led the cavalry charge that began three generations of slaughter, people had climbed this mountain to watch the celestial bodies align and remember they were small. [313]

During the slow dance of celestial bodies, the old texts said, even enemies must recognize their shared mortality. [331]

Seren opened the ebony clipboard and began to read. [340]

"Alira Voss, age seven, orphaned in the siege of Coldmarsh." [350]

Her voice carried across the empty terrace, steady and clear. [360]

"Tommin Reyes, age four, orphaned when both parents fell at the Battle of the Narrows." [375]

Corin stared. [377] "What are you doing?" [381]

"Anchoring ideals in practice." [385]

Seren did not pause. [389] "Mira Southwell, age nine. [393] Kell Darkhollow, age two." [397]

The names were a litany, a prayer, an accusation. [406]

They floated into the night where stars wheeled overhead in their eternal patterns, indifferent to the small violences of humankind. [426]

For an hour she read, her throat growing raw, her legs aching from standing on the uneven stones. [444]

The flawed beauty of the ritual was in its imperfection—one woman's voice against the vastness, a gesture that changed nothing and everything. [467]

She did not see the first delegates arrive. [475]

They came silently, drawn by the sound of their own people's children named and mourned. [490]

A Valen commander whose niece appeared on page forty-three. [499]

An Iron Sovereignty general who heard his brother's orphaned son counted among the cost. [513]

By midnight, the terrace held two dozen people who had spent their lives trying to kill each other, now standing in the light of the aligned planets, listening to what the war had made. [547]

Seren's voice gave out at name two thousand eight hundred and four. [559]

A Valen woman—the commander who had ordered Seren's assassination twenty years ago—stepped forward and took the ebony clipboard from her trembling hands. [583]

She continued reading. [586]

Then an Iron Sovereignty captain took his turn. [594]

The names passed from enemy to enemy, each voice adding to the ritual's weight, each reader accepting a portion of the shared guilt. [617]

When the last name fell silent, the celestial dance had shifted overhead. [629]

Dawn touched the ancient stones. [634]

Seren looked at faces transformed by grief and exhaustion into something almost unrecognizable: people instead of soldiers. [651]

"We will never undo what we've done," she said, her voice a ruin. [664]

"But we can stop adding names to this list. [673] That is the only redemption any of us will find." [683]

The flawed beauty of peace, she had learned, was that it required accepting you could not be made whole again. [703]

You could only choose to stop breaking. [710]

As the assembled delegates began to speak—really speak, for the first time in thirty-seven years—Seren sat on the ancient stones and let the midsummer sun warm the scars on her face. [743]

The clipboard lay between them all now, belonging to everyone, a shared weight. [756]

The Forever War would not end today. [763]

But perhaps, through this ritual made significant by grief and witnessed by the slow-moving stars, it had finally begun to end. [784]

And perhaps that was enough. [789]
