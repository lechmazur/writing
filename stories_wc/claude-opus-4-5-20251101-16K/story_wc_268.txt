The temple library existed in the spaces between heartbeats of stars, suspended in the pause where constellations shifted their ancient patterns. [23] Among its infinite shelves, a figure no taller than a child moved with the measured grace of something far older than the crumbling scrolls she tended. [47]

Mira had once been called Titan—not in mockery of her stature, but in recognition of her magnitude. [63] She had held cosmic foundations in her palms, shaped the architecture of heavens. [76] Now she shuffled between towering bookcases, her worn robes dragging against dust that had settled for millennia, regally unpretentious in her exile. [97]

The library had forgotten itself long ago, lost to the memory of time. [111] Its columns still reached toward vaulted ceilings painted with celestial maps now obsolete, its windows opening onto nothing but pearl-grey void. [132] Mira was its only living inhabitant, though she sometimes wondered if "living" still applied to her condition. [149]

She paused at a reading desk and withdrew from her pocket a small iron gall ink pellet—one of her last. [169] She had been rationing them carefully, each one precious, each one a weapon. [183] The pellet dissolved in her water dish, releasing its dark, corrosive bloom. [195] The ink would eat through paper eventually, but slowly enough to serve her purpose. [210]

For three celestial alignments now, she had been leaving messages. [220]

The books here possessed a peculiar quality: they drifted. [229] Volumes from this library would appear in other places, other times, slipping through the cracks of reality like dreams escaping sleeping minds. [250] A scholar in a distant kingdom might find a treatise on alchemy suddenly on his shelf, not remembering where he acquired it. [272] A princess studying for her coronation might discover a history book with handwriting in the margins that hadn't been there before. [293]

Mira dipped her brush and began to write, her script small and deliberate. [306]

The blood of the true line runs with starlight. [315] Ask him to bleed. [319]

She placed the message within a genealogical record of the Ascending Dynasty, positioning it carefully beneath a passage about birthright verification. [339] Then she traced the rune of drift along the book's spine—a symbol that looked like a river learning to fly—and felt the familiar tug as the volume began its journey elsewhere. [370]

She had unmasked pretenders before, in the time when she still stood among the council of Titans, when her word could sunder empires. [394] But that was before Valdris had taken the celestial throne through deception and false prophecy, before he had banished her to this gentle purgatory. [418]

Valdris was no god. [422] His blood ran red and mortal, a truth Mira had witnessed but could not prove from exile. [438] So she proved it differently: through cryptic messages left in library books, through carefully placed revelations that found their way to historians, rebels, doubting priests. [462]

The constellations shifted again outside her windows—she felt it like a change in pressure, a breath drawn and held. [482]

Her work was nearly complete. [487] Across a hundred books, scattered across a thousand years, she had seeded the truth. [501] The messages formed a pattern that patient scholars were finally beginning to see. [514] Already, Valdris's priests faced questions they could not answer. [524] Already, the faithful demanded the ancient blood-rite that would expose divinity—or its absence. [537]

Mira set down her brush as the library trembled. [546] Not with violence, but with release. [552] The shelves sighed. [555] Dust rose like incense. [559]

This was the graceful collapse she had always known would come. [570] The library had sustained itself on purpose, and now that purpose was fulfilled. [584] As Valdris's false throne began to sunder far away in the world of solid time, this place between moments began to dissolve. [605]

Mira walked to her favorite window, the one that looked onto nothing, and felt herself becoming nothing alongside it. [623] She had been a diminutive titan, overlooked and underestimated, and she had toppled a false god with ink and patience and the quiet drift of dangerous books. [651]

The last constellation shifted. [655]

The library breathed out. [659]

And Mira, who had held worlds in her hands, let go. [670]
