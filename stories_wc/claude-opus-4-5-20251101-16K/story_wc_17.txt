Mira pressed her palm against the cold stone, feeling vibrations no one else could sense. [15] She was a corridor echo cartographer—one of the last—mapping the acoustic memories that buildings had absorbed over centuries. [32]

After the climate shifts, vegetation had reclaimed everything. [40] What had once been pristine institutional hallways now breathed with wild growth, their geometric precision softened by relentless green life. [57]

The ivy-veiled passage before her had once belonged to her grandmother's research facility. [69] Legacy's burden hung heavy: the inheritance of listening equipment, hand-drawn frequency maps, and an obsession Mira had never asked for but couldn't abandon. [90]

She was sensitively perceptive—always had been. [97] As a child, she'd heard conversations from rooms she'd never entered, sounds that had embedded themselves in plaster and stone decades before her birth. [121] Her grandmother had recognized this gift and shaped it into purpose. [132]

The motivation was singular, strange: to discover what walls dream about. [143]

It had seemed absurd when Grandmother first explained it. [152] But she'd demonstrated—played back recordings that shouldn't exist, whispers from empty rooms, conversations between people long dead. [169] The walls remembered. [172] And if they remembered, perhaps they also imagined. [180]

Mira ducked beneath a curtain of ivy and entered the ruined atrium. [192] Rain had collapsed the ceiling years ago. [199] Now ferns grew from the exposed beams, and moss carpeted what had been a marble floor. [214]

The fireplace caught her attention. [219] Something had been burning there recently—impossible, since the facility had been abandoned for thirty years. [232] She knelt, sifting through ash and debris. [239]

Half-burned diaries emerged from the wreckage. [245]

Her grandmother's handwriting. [248] Pages brittle, edges charred black. [253]

Through half-burned diaries found in a fireplace, she pieced together what had driven the old woman's final years. [269] The entries spoke of breakthrough and terror in equal measure. [279] Grandmother had learned to not just record wall-memories but to communicate with them. [291] The architecture had responded. [295]

"They dream of what they've lost," one entry read. [304] "The voices of children in schools demolished decades ago. [313] The laughter from hospitals where patients recovered. [320] They mourn. [322] The walls mourn." [325]

Another passage, barely legible: "I've gone too far. [333] They know I'm listening. [337] They're starting to listen back." [342]

A film negative strip slipped from between pages. [350]

Mira held it toward the light filtering through the ruined ceiling. [361] The images showed her grandmother standing in this very atrium—but the walls behind her were covered in dark patches. [378] Writing, perhaps. [381] Or something growing from within the stone. [388]

In the final frame, she could glimpse something terrible: her grandmother's face turned toward the camera, mouth open in warning, while behind her the ivy had arranged itself into shapes that looked almost like letters. [422] Almost like words. [425]

The building groaned. [428]

Not wind. [430] Not settling foundations. [433] The sound rose from deep within the walls—a frequency Mira recognized from her grandmother's recordings. [447] The architecture was speaking. [451]

She should have run. [455] Legacy's burden kept her rooted. [460]

"What do you dream about?" she whispered, pressing both palms flat against the stone. [472]

The answer came not as sound but as image, flooding her sensitively perceptive mind: endless corridors folding into themselves, rooms that existed only in memory, faces of everyone who had ever passed through these halls. [503] The walls dreamed of wholeness—of the building as it had been before abandonment, before decay, before the climate shifts had unleashed nature's slow revenge. [527]

They dreamed of being inhabited again. [533]

And they'd been waiting for someone who could hear them. [543]

"Grandmother tried to warn me," Mira breathed. [550] "She burned her research to stop anyone else from—" [559]

The ivy tightened around her ankle. [565]

The walls had learned patience from centuries of standing still. [575] Now they had someone who could understand them. [583] They would not let her go. [589]

Mira closed her eyes and listened as the building drew her deeper into its memory, its mourning, its terrible green-wrapped dreams. [609] She understood now why her grandmother had tried to end this work. [621]

Some legacies weren't meant to be carried. [628]

Some walls dreamed of never being alone again. [636]
