Maren had always believed that grief needed companions other than itself, and so she carried laughter into Echo Gorge like medicine wrapped in morning light. [27]

She was a lost soul collector, one of few who wandered the territories between death and memory, gathering spirits too confused or wounded to find their own way forward. [54] The gorge earned its name honestly—every sound returned sevenfold, transformed, layered upon itself until whispers became choirs and footsteps became thunder. [73] It was here, in the hush of a hidden sunrise that only the dead could witness, that the most reluctant souls gathered. [93]

Around her neck hung a crocodile's tooth on a leather cord, yellowed with age and worn smooth by her grandmother's fingers before her own. [115] The old woman had been a collector too, and she'd taught Maren that this tooth was a key—crocodiles dwelt between worlds, between water and earth, and their teeth could open passages that otherwise remained sealed. [148] Maren pressed it against her chest now, feeling its warmth, its reminder that boundaries were negotiable things. [165]

Her harp leaned against the canyon wall, its frame warped from years of exposure to the gorge's strange acoustics. [182] She'd never fixed its misalignment. [187] The distorted notes it produced were imperfect, broken, and that brokenness was precisely what summoned the spirits who felt too ashamed to approach anything whole. [210]

She began to play. [214]

The sound rippled outward, bent and strange, each note colliding with the canyon walls and returning transformed. [230] Through the distorted notes of the misaligned harp, the first confession drifted toward her—a voice like autumn leaves. [247]

"I never told my daughter I was proud of her." [257]

Maren nodded, letting the words settle. [263] This was the work: spectral confessions, the unburdening of souls who had carried their secrets into death and found them heavier than expected. [281] But confession alone had never been enough for Maren. [290] Her grandmother's method had been different, revolutionary among collectors. [298]

"Tell me something that made her laugh," Maren said, still playing. [309]

The spirit flickered, uncertain. [313] Most collectors simply absorbed confessions and guided souls onward, a transaction of guilt and release. [326] But Maren had learned that guilt was only half the weight spirits carried—the other half was joy they'd forgotten how to claim. [346]

"She—she used to laugh when I burned toast," the voice said, trembling. [358] "Every morning. [360] I'd curse at the smoke, and she'd laugh until milk came out her nose." [374]

Maren smiled, and the smile changed the music, lifted its broken notes into something warmer. [388] "Hold that," she said. [392] "Hold the milk and the smoke and her ridiculous snorting." [402]

The spirit began to glow, not with sorrow but with something gentler—grief's cousin, tenderness. [416]

She was modestly fearless, Maren. [421] Not bold enough to challenge death itself, but brave enough to pursue the moments between its shadows. [437] She believed that to integrate laughter into healing was to honor the dead completely, to acknowledge that their lives had contained more than regret. [458]

Another voice emerged from the canyon's depths, then another. [467] The harp's twisted harmonics drew them like moths to imperfect flame. [479] Each brought confessions—cruelties committed, love unexpressed, opportunities abandoned—and each, in turn, Maren asked to remember something absurd, something tender, something that had once made them human in the fullest sense. [513]

The hidden sunrise crept higher, its light reaching the gorge's floor only briefly before the canyon walls stole it back. [533] In that narrow window, the collected souls began their passage, carrying both their shadows and their light. [550]

Maren watched them go, the luminous ache settling into her chest as it always did. [564] This was the cost of her work—she absorbed fragments of every story, every laugh, every regret. [579] Her grandmother had warned her that collectors eventually became repositories, filled with the lives of others until their own grew thin. [598]

But Maren played on, the crocodile's tooth warm against her skin, the harp singing its beautiful wrongness into the echoing stone. [617] Somewhere ahead, more souls wandered lost, burdened by confessions they'd never spoken and joys they'd forgotten to claim. [635]

She would find them. [639]

She would ask them about burned toast and snorting laughter and all the ridiculous moments that made existence bearable. [655]

And in the asking, in the luminous ache of bearing witness, she would carry them home. [669]

The gorge fell silent as the sunrise vanished, but Maren remained, patient as the tooth around her neck, waiting for the next voice to emerge from the stone and confess its way toward light. [703]
