Sir Corwin had not spoken in three seasons, not since the war that unmade his certainties. [16] He moved through the world like a shadow sewn to nothing, withdrawn from court and comrade alike, carrying only his armor's weight and a folded paper salvaged from a burned city. [46] The paper was an abandoned marionette theater program, its ink faded to whispers, its diagrams showing movements he could not forget. [66]

Tonight he stood before the alchemical orchard greenhouse, where trees of silver and mercury grew beneath a sky of permanent darkness. [87] No sun had touched this place in centuries. [95] The endless night here was factually mystical—scholars documented it, cartographers mapped its boundaries, yet no explanation survived scrutiny. [113] Glass walls rose around phosphorescent fruit that pulsed like slow hearts, and Corwin pressed his gauntleted hand against the entrance, feeling the structure breathe. [135]

He had come to capture the shape of possibility. [144] Not a specific future, but possibility itself—the raw material from which choices crystallized. [158] His old life offered none. [163] The paths before him had collapsed into a single gray road leading nowhere. [176] But the greenhouse, according to the theater program's margin notes, held patterns that could crack open sealed fates. [193]

The door yielded. [196] Inside, the air tasted of copper and growing things, of potential oxidizing in the darkness. [211] Corwin walked the rows between trees whose leaves were thin sheets of hammered gold, whose roots drank from channels of glowing solution. [232] The program trembled in his grip as he unfolded it further, revealing choreographic notation—steps for marionettes, yes, but also something older beneath the ink. [258]

Forgotten patterns. [260] The puppeteers had encoded something ancient in their movements, sacred geometries disguised as entertainment. [274] Corwin recognized military formations buried in the dance sequences, alchemical symbols hidden in the stage directions. [289] His predecessors had known this language. [295] He had once known fragments himself, before he chose silence over screaming. [307]

As he began to walk the patterns, reality shifted. [316] The greenhouse expanded and contracted like breathing lungs. [325] Trees relocated between his blinks. [330] The endless night pressed closer, then receded, and Corwin felt time become thick and navigable, a medium rather than a current. [351] His boots traced the program's paths between mercury-bark trunks, each turn precise, each pause measured against the phantom rhythm of puppet strings. [372]

Something caught at his throat—the clasp of his gorget, his armor's protection. [385] To complete the pattern, he understood, he would need to unsnap it. [398] To open himself. [401] The armor had been his withdrawal made manifest, his refusal to let anything reach him again. [416]

His fingers found the mechanism. [421] Cold metal against colder metal. [426] The click echoed impossibly through the greenhouse as the gorget fell away, and with it, something in his chest unlocked. [445]

A voice emerged from the phosphorescent fruit, or from the air, or from inside his own silence. [462] It asked for something he had buried: allegiance. [470] Not the loud oaths of ceremony, but something softer and more binding. [482] A murmured allegiance to possibility itself, to remaining open when closure felt like safety. [495]

Corwin's voice cracked from disuse. [500] The words came in fragments, reassembling as they left his lips—an oath to not-knowing, to the terror and shivering bliss of unwritten futures. [521] He swore himself to uncertainty the way he had once sworn to kings. [534]

The greenhouse responded. [537] Reality folded one final time, and before him hung a shape made of light and absence—possibility captured, not as a single path but as an infinite branching frozen mid-bloom. [565] It was beautiful and terrible, a tree of might-bes that dwarfed the alchemical orchards around it. [582]

He reached for it. [586] His bare throat felt the cold air for the first time in years, vulnerable and alive. [601] The shape entered him not through his hands but through his willingness, filling the hollow spaces his withdrawal had carved. [621]

When Corwin walked out of the greenhouse, the endless night remained, but he carried dawn inside him. [638] The program crumbled to dust, its purpose fulfilled. [647] He did not know what he would become, only that becoming was possible again. [661]

Behind him, the alchemical trees swayed in a wind that did not exist, celebrating or mourning in their factually mystical way. [682] Sir Corwin spoke aloud for the first time in three seasons, testing his voice against the darkness. [699]

He said nothing profound. [703] He simply said "yes"—a continuation, a beginning, a murmured allegiance renewed with every breath. [718] The withdrawn knight walked forward into all the shapes his life might still take, trembling with possibility, shivering with bliss. [738]
