Father Mattias pressed the loop pedal with his bare foot, and the last note of his humming circled back through the chamber like a patient ghost. [26] He stood at the center of the dimensional anchor, that impossible room where five realities met and held each other in reluctant equilibrium. [46] The walls shifted between stone, water, light, void, and something that resembled breathing skin, depending on which angle you viewed them from. [68] He had worked here for eleven years, decorating with silence the spaces between moments, filling fractures in existence with the absence of sound. [89]

On the altar before him lay Sister Corrine, her body rigid, her eyes cycling through colors that did not belong to the human spectrum. [112] The possession had begun three hours ago when she'd touched the artifact they'd recovered from the collapsed dimension. [130] Now something older than language was threading itself through her consciousness, and Mattias could see by the flickering of her aura that he had perhaps twenty minutes before the integration completed. [159]

Beside the altar sat his only tool apart from the pedals: an artist's palette bearing a single color. [177] The pigment was called Threshold Gray, neither dark nor light, extracted from the membrane between dimensions. [193] He dipped his finger in it and traced a symbol on Corrine's forehead while his earlier hum continued looping, layering, building a cage of repetition. [217]

"What do you believe you deserve?" he asked her, his voice cutting through the accumulated sound with muffled clarity. [235] This was his method, refined over years of exorcism—not commands, not prayers, but questions. [250] Through rhetorical devices, he would plumb the depths where assumptions lived unexamined. [263] Possessions, he had learned, required invitation. [270] Something in the host had opened a door, and only by illuminating that hidden assumption could he help her close it again. [291]

The thing wearing Corrine's face smiled. [298] "She believes she deserves nothing," it said in a voice like wind through broken glass. [314] "That made the entrance easy." [320]

Mattias added another loop—a whispered prayer that overlapped itself into a texture of devotion. [335] The room's walls stabilized slightly, the anchor strengthening as the sound architecture grew. [349] "Corrine," he said, not to the entity, "is that true? [360] Do you believe you are worthless?" [366]

Her body convulsed. [369] The entity hissed, but beneath it, he heard her voice, small and truthful: "I believed I had to earn love." [386]

"And if love must be earned," Mattias continued, pressing the pedal to capture her whisper, letting it loop and surround her, "then who profits from your endless labor?" [410]

The unraveled stillness that had characterized the anchor began to re-weave itself. [423] Where the possession had torn gaps in the room's equilibrium, threads of calm were stitching back together. [439] Corrine's own voice, repeating, became a counter-frequency to the entity's hold. [452]

"What if worthiness was never the question?" he asked. [462] He painted another gray symbol over her heart. [471] "What if the door you opened was built on a lie someone else taught you?" [487]

The entity screamed in a frequency that made two of the walls flicker into void. [502] But Corrine was crying now, human tears, and her cycling eyes settled briefly into brown—her true color. [520] "My mother," she gasped. [524] "She said I was too much." [530]

"Was she correct?" [533]

"No." [534] The word came stronger. [538] "No, I was just—I was just a child." [546]

Mattias let the loops build to their crescendo, then released the pedal. [559] Silence crashed into the chamber like a wave, and he wielded it deliberately, letting it decorate the moment with its profound weight. [580] In that absence, Corrine's assumption—the hidden architecture of her unworthiness—collapsed. [592]

The entity shrieked and tore free, unable to anchor itself in a host who no longer believed the lies it required. [613] It dissipated into the void-wall and was gone. [623]

Corrine sat up, trembling, the gray symbols fading into her skin like absorbed medicine. [638] The dimensional anchor hummed around them, its stillness restored, no longer unraveling. [651]

"How did you know?" she whispered. [657]

Father Mattias cleaned the palette with a cloth that existed in three dimensions simultaneously. [671] "The possession always reveals the wound it entered through," he said. [683] "My job is only to ask the questions you were afraid to ask yourself." [698]

She looked at him with clear, human eyes. [707] "And the loops?" [710]

"Sometimes," he said, "we need to hear our own truth repeated before we can believe it." [727]

He pressed the pedal once more, capturing the silence, saving it for the next soul who would need its particular decoration. [750]
