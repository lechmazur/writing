After the great fire, the plaza remained. [7] Broken, yes - ash-stained stones and scorched columns that once held up the grand arcade. [22] But it remained. [25] Above, the sky hung shattered, rent by whatever cataclysm had ended the old world, showing through its jagged cracks a deeper darkness where stars should have been. [51]

The woman they called Vera walked barefoot across the mosaic stepping stones, feeling history beneath her heels. [67] She had been a librarian once, then an arsonist of censorship, then something harder to name. [82] A gentle radical, the survivors called her - dangerous in her softness, revolutionary in her refusal to hate even now, even after everything. [103]

She was retrocognitively trapped. [106] That was the price the fire had exacted from her flesh and mind. [119] Every surface she touched might pull her backward into what-was, drowning her in memories that belonged to others, to the dead, to time itself. [143] The chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone could become a doorway to centuries past. [157] A fragment of tile could swallow her whole. [165]

She knelt now in the plaza's heart, where the central minaret had stood before it collapsed into rubble. [182] In her palm: a single tessera, no larger than her thumbnail, still holding its ancient blue despite the fire, the ash, the years. [206] It had been part of something beautiful once. [214] Now it was just a chip of meaning without context. [224]

But that was why she had come. [231] To give it context again. [236]

Her mechanical arm whirred softly as she adjusted her grip - the arm of steel that held what flesh could not. [256] The prosthetic had been necessary after the burning, when her own limb had been sacrificed to pull a child from beneath a fallen beam. [281] She had not hesitated then. [286] That was her aberrant mercy: to save those who had once condemned her books to flame, to shelter those who had called her dangerous, to offer grace that defied all logic. [320]

The minaret mosaic tessera grew warm in her palm. [328] She felt the pull beginning. [333]

The plaza dissolved into its former self - crowded with merchants and pilgrims, the minaret whole and glorious, singing with the call to prayer. [357] She saw a woman placing this very tile centuries ago, pressing it into wet mortar with careful devotion. [374] The tile-maker's name formed in Vera's mind like light through water: Safiya. [386]

Safiya, who had believed beauty could outlast empires. [394]

The vision released her. [398] Vera gasped back into the broken present, ash on her tongue and tears on her cheeks. [413] The shattered sky pressed down like a wound that would never heal. [425] But she knew now. [429] She knew the name. [433]

This was her work after the great fire - not rebuilding, but renaming. [445] Finding the names that had been lost, the identities the flames had tried to erase. [459] Via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone, via shattered pottery and scorched door-frames, she reached backward and retrieved what fire had tried to consume forever. [490]

Some called it madness. [494] Others called it pointless sentimentality. [499] What good were names when their bearers had become ash? [509]

But Vera understood something the others did not. [517] Memory was not merely sentiment. [522] It was infrastructure. [525] To rebuild a world, you needed to know what had been worth building in the first place. [541] You needed to cradle empathy in arms of steel, protecting tenderness with whatever strength remained, shielding the soft heart of civilization behind will and metal. [571]

She pressed the tessera to her forehead like a blessing. [581] "Safiya," she whispered to the broken air. [588] "I see you." [591]

Warmth bloomed in the coldness of the plaza. [599] Not heat - warmth. [603] The distinction mattered profoundly. [607] Heat had destroyed everything. [611] Warmth might yet restore it. [616]

She placed the tessera carefully into her satchel, where hundreds of other fragments waited, each one now married to a name she had pulled from the past. [644] Later, she would add Safiya to her chronicle. [653] Later, she would teach others how to listen to what the stones remembered. [666]

For now, she rose on unsteady legs and continued across the ancient plaza, her steel arm glinting faintly in the fractured light filtering through the broken sky. [695] Behind her, the stepping stones held their secrets, patient as ever, waiting for the next gentle touch that would unlock them. [717]

The sky remained shattered. [721] But beneath it, mercy took its aberrant forms - not forgiveness, not absolution, but something stranger and more necessary. [739] The simple insistence that what was lost deserved to be known. [750] That even the ashes held names worth speaking aloud. [759]

Vera walked on. [762] The work would take lifetimes. [767] She would give it all of hers. [773]
