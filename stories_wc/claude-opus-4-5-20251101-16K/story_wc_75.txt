Mira pressed the emerald-tinted opera glass lens to her eye, peering through the thundering veil of water that separated Vellanor from the world that had forgotten them. [27] The lens had belonged to her grandmother, who once watched performers in gilded theaters before the displacement, before their people became shadows dwelling in stone. [50] Now Mira used it to watch for danger, the green tint casting the outer forests in the color of memory. [68]

Spring had arrived, and the ice rimming the great waterfall had begun to thaw. [82] Droplets loosened from ancient formations, trickling down cavern walls like tears the city itself was weeping. [97] The thaw meant exposure, meant the curtain of ice that had thickened their concealment all winter was thinning, revealing glimpses of the grotto city to anyone who might look closely enough. [128]

It had been three weeks since the beekeeper's last visit. [138] Old Tomasz had been their only tether to the outside, trading honey and news through a secret passage behind the falls. [158] His absence gnawed at Mira with a sweetness turned sour, like rosewater left too long in the sun. [176] She feared what his silence meant for them, for the two hundred displaced persons who called these dripping halls home. [195]

As the settlement's museum guide, Mira was historically oriented by necessity and by grief. [209] She had catalogued every artifact carried through the waterfall seventeen years ago: embroidered wedding veils, hand-painted icons, a single opera glass missing one lens. [231] Her father had given her the emerald piece separately, pressing it into her palm as soldiers burned their village. [248] "Remember who we were," he had whispered, and then the flames took him. [262]

Now she guided children through the museum's damp corridors, teaching them about a homeland they had never seen. [278] This was her motivation, the fire that warmed her despite the perpetual chill: to rescue dying arts from the drowning tide of exile. [299] She taught them to paint eggs in the old patterns, to sing laments in their forbidden tongue, to embroider rivers and mountains onto cloth so the landscape might survive even if they did not. [332]

But her most sacred duty came each morning before dawn. [342]

In the bakery carved from limestone, Mira continued her family's custom of baking bread shaped like initials. [358] Her mother had done this every name day, every birth, every death. [370] Now Mira baked for the community, pressing dough into the letters of ancestors: an "A" for her father Andrei, an "E" for her grandmother Elena. [393] The bread emerged golden from the clay oven, and families gathered to eat the shapes of those they had lost, consuming memory so it might live inside them. [420]

This morning, young Katya watched with flour-dusted hands. [428] "Why do we shape them?" she asked, and Mira recognized the sacred question, the one that meant a tradition might survive another generation. [448]

"Because names have weight," Mira answered, forming a "T" for Tomasz, hoping he was merely delayed, not dead. [466] "When we eat the bread, we carry those we love. They become part of our bodies, our blood, our children's children." [488]

The waterfall roared its eternal song. [494] Through the emerald lens, Mira later spotted movement in the forest—not soldiers, but a single figure carrying a wooden box. [513] Her heart clenched with rosewater dread, that particular terror wrapped in desperate hope. [526]

It was Tomasz's daughter, her face gaunt, her steps urgent. [536] She had never come before. [541]

Mira descended the slick passage to meet her, already knowing. [551] The young woman handed her a letter, a jar of honey, and news that Tomasz had died peacefully, but not before telling her about the people behind the waterfall who must not be forgotten. [584]

"He said you rescue dying things," the daughter whispered. [593] "I want to learn." [597]

Mira clutched the honey like a relic, understanding that Tomasz had given them his final gift: not just supplies, but a successor, another thread connecting their hidden world to the one that had cast them out. [633]

That night, she baked a "T" and shared it with the newcomer, beginning her education in the museum of exile. [654] Outside, the waterfall continued its ancient cascade, the thaw revealing and concealing in equal measure. [669] The grotto city breathed in its eternal twilight, preserving what the surface world had tried to destroy. [685]

Mira cleaned the emerald lens and placed it in its velvet case, beside the bread still warm from the oven. [704] Tomorrow she would teach Katya to shape the dough, and perhaps the beekeeper's daughter too. [720] The arts would not die—not while displaced hands still remembered how to press flour into meaning, how to transform loss into something that could be touched, tasted, passed down like heirlooms through the generations of the waterfall's children. [760]

The dread remained, delicate as rosewater, but so did the bread, rising golden in the darkness. [776]
