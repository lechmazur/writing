The catacomb orchard existed where death met persistence, where apple trees had broken through cathedral ceilings centuries ago and sent their roots threading between ribs and skulls. [30]

Mira descended the worn steps, lantern casting half-light through the corridors, turning bone shadows into lace against the earthen walls. [50] She was what the old traders called a reckless idealist—someone who believed the broken could be mended, even when the broken was fate itself. [74]

In her pocket, she carried the burned tarot card, its edges charred black, only the bottom third remaining: a pair of feet standing at a crossroads, the rest of the image consumed to ash. [108] It had belonged to her brother before he bartered his destiny away. [120]

The catacomb orchard served as the trading floor for such exchanges—bartered destinies bought and sold where roots touched the dead, as if transactions required witness from those who had already finished their stories. [153] Mira had spent three years tracing the woman who now held her brother's future, three years of inlaying meaning everywhere, reading significance in every chance encounter, every overheard word, every flicker of candlelight. [189] When you hunt destiny traders, you learn to see patterns they leave behind. [201]

The woman called herself Vesna, though Mira doubted that was true. [212]

She found her in the deepest chamber, where the largest tree grew—an ancient thing whose trunk had swallowed a stone sarcophagus whole, bark rippling around carved angels. [243] Vesna sat on an exposed root, shuffling a deck missing one card. [255]

"You're Elias's sister." [258] Not a question. [260]

"I want his destiny back." [265]

Vesna's laugh echoed through the half-lit corridor, soft and terrible. [275] "Destinies aren't returned, child. [280] They're consumed. [282] I've already worn your brother's future like a coat—all that potential for greatness, that beautiful trajectory toward invention and discovery. [302] Do you know what he traded it for?" [310]

Mira knew. [312] Three more years for their mother, dying of the wasting sickness. [323] Three years that had felt like mercy then, before they understood what Elias had truly given away. [340]

"I didn't come to negotiate," Mira said, her voice fiercely gentle—the kind of gentleness that precedes necessary violence. [358]

She had learned the trader's methods: how they trammeled destinies with silver wire and starlight, binding futures to new owners like transplanting roots. [380] If a destiny could be bound, it could be unbound. [390]

She pulled the burned tarot card from her pocket and pressed it against the great tree's bark. [407] The catacomb orchard knew what belonged to it. [415]

Mira had come here to patch holes in the soul—her brother's, yes, but also her own. [432] The guilt of watching him sacrifice his brilliance, his purpose, all for those additional years she could have spent simply loving their mother in whatever time remained naturally. [461]

"You can't trammel what's already been spent," Vesna said, standing now, deck scattered. [474]

"I'm not trammeling it," Mira answered. [481] "I'm trading for it." [486]

She had come recklessly, idealistically believing in the equation of sacrifice—that her future, still intact and shimmering with possibility, might be enough to purchase back the remnants of his. [518]

The tree's roots began to move. [524] Bone shifted beneath the soil, ancient witnesses stirring at the scent of a new bargain. [538]

Vesna's face twisted with understanding, then something unexpected—fear. [547] "You can't offer an unlived life for one already consumed. [557] The balance would—" [560]

"Create something new," Mira finished, her dusky resolve steady as the turning earth. [571] "That's the point." [575]

She hadn't come to restore her brother's exact destiny. [584] She had come to forge a shared one from the wreckage, to alchemize grief into forward motion. [600]

The burning sensation of the trade moved through her—her carefully hoarded future mixing with the ashes of his, creating something neither of them could have become alone. [628]

When it finished, the burned tarot card was whole again in her hand: two figures at the crossroads, walking the same road together. [651]

Vesna had fled somewhere during the transformation. [658]

Mira climbed back through the catacomb orchard, past the roots and bones, carrying within her a destiny that finally fit—patched together from sacrifice and stubbornness, imperfect and earned. [692] Elias would feel it too, wherever he was. [700]

The hole in both their souls was now filled with something better than what they had lost: purpose built from choosing each other over cleaner, lonelier paths. [728]

Above ground, dawn was breaking. [733]

She walked into it, no longer reckless but still idealistic, carrying their shared future forward. [747]
