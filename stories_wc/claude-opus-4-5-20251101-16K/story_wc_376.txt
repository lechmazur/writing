Mira's leaves had begun to curl the moment the merchant lied about his daughter's whereabouts. [16]

She felt the familiar withering in her chest, the gold-veined tendrils woven through her skin contracting like ferns retreating from frost. [36] The gilded-leaf calligrapher set down her brush and waited until he left, his false words still hanging in the filtered air of her studio. [57]

Three months had passed since the oasis dried. [65] The sprawling greenhouse city of Veridium stretched beneath amber domes, its citizens learning to survive on recycled moisture and rationed hope while the toxic sky pressed against the glass like something hungry. [93] Mira remembered the last honest conversation she'd witnessed at the water's edge—a father admitting fear to his son, both of them watching the ground drink the final drops. [120] That candor in small moments haunted her. [127]

Where did such conversations go when they ended? [135] Where did the words travel when people swallowed them back, when death interrupted, when courage failed? [149]

She had searched the archives, interviewed the memory-keepers, traced the pneumatic tubes that once carried messages between districts. [166] Nothing. [167] Until yesterday, when she'd pried up the warped floorboards to repair a leak and found the shredded papers beneath. [184]

Now Mira sat surrounded by fragments, piecing together a treasure map that had been deliberately destroyed. [198] The paper was old, predating the domes, marked with symbols she recognized from her grandmother's stories about the Before. [216] Someone had hidden this. [220] Someone had tried to destroy it. [226]

She reread the partial instructions she'd assembled so far: "Where breath becomes archive... beneath the Conversation Hall... speak only truth to enter." [246]

Her fingers found a rigid piece among the paper scraps—not paper at all, but metal. [262] A zinc-etched postal plate fragment, the kind once used to print addresses for mass mailings. [276] The etching showed coordinates and a phrase: "Repository of the Unfinished." [287]

Mira's leaves unfurled slightly, responding to the authenticity of the artifact. [298] No one had lied when making this. [305]

The Conversation Hall stood abandoned in the eastern district, its glass panels cracked but holding. [319] Mira moved through corridors where people once gathered to speak freely, before the toxicity drove everyone into smaller, private domes where lies became easier to hide. [345]

She found the entrance beneath a collapsed stage—a door requiring no key, only words. [360]

"I am afraid I'll find nothing," she said. [369] "I am afraid the conversations I've lost with my mother are gone forever." [382] The door recognized her honesty and opened. [389]

The Repository stretched impossibly far, filled with crystalline containers that hummed with captured sound. [402] Mira walked among them, reading labels: "Last words of Seren Vale, interrupted by flood." [416] "Apology from Thom Alder, never delivered." [422] "Question from child to parent, answered with silence." [430]

She understood now. [433] Lost conversations didn't disappear—they were preserved by the very honesty that made them precious. [447] Each container held a moment when someone had tried to speak truth and failed, or succeeded too briefly for the world to witness. [469]

An attendant appeared, ancient and still, her own skin threaded with copper vines. [483] "You wilt near dishonesty," the woman observed. [490] "That's why you found us." [495]

"I want to know where my mother's last words went," Mira said. [508] "She was trying to tell me something when the oasis collapsed." [519]

The attendant led her to a small container, glowing faintly green. [530] Inside, her mother's voice waited: "I should have told you every day—the gilding in your skin isn't a curse. [549] It's proof that truth runs through you. [556] Don't hide from the lies, Mira. [562] Let them make you wilt. [567] Then bloom again, brighter." [571]

Mira reread the transcript that materialized beside the container, her leaves unfurling completely, gold catching the filtered light. [587] Her mother's candor in that small, final moment had been preserved—not lost, only waiting. [601]

She carried the fragment of the postal plate back through the city, past the merchants and their comfortable lies, past the council members promising water that wouldn't come. [627] She let herself wilt in their presence, then recover. [636]

In her studio, she began a new project: a map of her own, calligraphed in gold leaf, showing others the path to the Repository. [661] Because every unfinished conversation deserved a destination, and every moment of candor—no matter how small—deserved to be found. [679]

The toxic sky pressed on, but beneath it, Mira's leaves shimmered with purpose. [693] Some truths were worth searching for. [699] Some silences were only temporary. [704] And somewhere, always, lost words waited for someone honest enough to hear them. [717]
