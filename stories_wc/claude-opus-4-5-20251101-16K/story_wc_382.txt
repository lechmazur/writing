The first time I knocked on Mrs. Aldrich's door, I only needed sugar. [13]

She answered in a cardigan the color of old paper, and the apartment behind her smelled of dried lavender and something older--ink, maybe, or the dust that collects on forgotten ledgers. [45]

She invited me in while she fetched the sugar bowl, and I noticed the walls lined with books in alphabets I couldn't read. [68]

"You live in 4B," she said, not a question. [77]

"The building tells me things." [82]

That should have been my warning. [88]

Instead, I returned the following Sunday with a jar of honey as thanks, and she made tea. [105]

That became our ritual--weekly sessions in her cramped kitchen, then eventually on the rooftop garden she maintained with patiently nimble fingers, coaxing jasmine and night-blooming cereus from cracked terracotta pots. [136]

I told her I was a historian. [143]

That was our first agreed upon lie. [150]

I was actually an architect's assistant, cataloging condemned buildings before demolition. [161]

But "historian" sounded nobler, and Mrs. Aldrich never corrected me. [171]

Perhaps because she had her own fictions to maintain. [180]

She taught dead languages--had taught them, she said, at the university decades ago. [194]

Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, Aramaic. [198]

But what fascinated me was her other knowledge: how to read the language of old buildings. [214]

The scratches on doorframes that recorded children's heights. [222]

The carbon shadows on brick where gas lamps once hung. [232]

The notches in stairs worn by a century of feet. [242]

"Buildings remember," she told me during one meteor shower night on the roof. [255]

Above us, the sky unraveled in silver threads while we sat surrounded by her wilderness of plants. [272]

"They speak in scars and stains. [278]

You just need the vocabulary." [283]

I wanted to interrogate her about everything--how she knew so much, why she'd chosen me as her student, what she meant when she said the building "told her things." [313]

But questions felt dangerous with Mrs. Aldrich. [320]

She answered them sideways or not at all, deflecting with fresh tea or a new lesson about Etruscan tomb inscriptions. [340]

The antique desk seal I found in a box during my cataloging work at the Harlow Building. [357]

Brass handle, carnelian stone carved with initials: E.A. [365]

Eleanor Aldrich. [367]

I cross-referenced the building's records that night. [374]

Eleanor Aldrich had lived in the Harlow Building from 1931 until her death in 1967. [389]

The building was demolished in 1970. [395]

She never could have moved to my apartment complex, which wasn't constructed until 1985. [409]

Our next tea session, I brought the seal. [417]

Set it on the table between us like evidence. [426]

She picked it up with those patiently nimble fingers, turned it over twice. [439]

"You've been thorough," she said. [444]

Not frightened. [446]

Almost proud. [448]

"You're dead." [450]

"That's an agreed upon lie," she replied. [457]

"I prefer to think I simply stopped being counted." [466]

The meteor shower peaked above us, streaks of light dying in atmosphere. [478]

Mrs. Aldrich sipped her tea, which I suddenly realized she never actually drank--only held, only lifted to lips that never parted. [500]

"Why me?" [502]

"Because you hear them. [506]

The buildings. [508]

You mourn them before they fall." [514]

She pressed the seal into my palm. [521]

"I'm teaching you to understand what they're saying. [529]

So when they demolish these walls, someone will remember the language." [540]

I understood then that our weekly sessions existed outside normal time--a pocket she'd stitched into reality through sheer stubbornness and longing. [562]

The rooftop garden, the tea, the lessons--all borrowed time, like the sugar that started everything. [578]

"Will you keep coming?" I asked. [584]

"Will you keep believing I exist?" [590]

Another agreed upon lie, but this one felt sacred. [599]

I nodded. [601]

Above us, the meteors kept falling, ancient light finally arriving after journeys longer than buildings or languages or the small immortalities we craft against forgetting. [626]

Mrs. Aldrich smiled and began teaching me the Sumerian word for threshold. [638]
