The glass basilica floated above the tea garden like a frozen prayer, its spires catching light that seemed to weep through crystal walls. [23]

Mira, the crafty lantern maker, knelt among the silver-leafed tea plants as evening descended—or rather, as she descended while ascending, for that was the nature of this particular floating isle. [52]

The higher one climbed toward the basilica, the deeper one sank into the substrata of memory. [67]

She had lived here for three years now, ever since Lia drowned in the earthbound sea. [82]

Every night after the shadow detaches—that liminal hour when the basilica's silhouette separates from its luminous body and drifts across the garden like a dark twin—Mira began her true work. [113]

Dream recording. [115]

It was illegal in most territories, extracting the sleeping visions of others, but here on the floating isle, no laws governed grief. [137]

Tonight, she unfolded her tools: the gem polishing kit, the hollow lantern frame, the sheets of paper that would become cranes. [158]

The gems—raw sapphires pulled from the island's core—required precise angles to capture dream-light. [173]

Mira's fingers knew the work intimately, buffing each facet until the stone could hold a sleeper's vision like water holds reflection. [195]

She had gathered hundreds now, each containing a fragment of Lia's dreams, harvested from the archives beneath the basilica before the priests could burn them. [222]

The dead were not supposed to keep their dreams. [231]

That's what the liturgy taught. [236]

But Mira was crafty in all senses—skilled, yes, but also cunning, subversive, willing to steal sacred things for love's sake. [257]

She polished the final gem, watching it transform from clouded stone to something that pulsed with interior dawn. [274]

Inside, she could see Lia running through a field that existed nowhere but in a child's sleeping mind. [292]

The grief struck as it always did—sudden, luminous, tormenting. [301]

Beauty and anguish inseparable as the shadow from the basilica before detachment hour. [314]

Mira set the gem into the lantern's heart, then lit the wick with trembling hands. [329]

The dream projected outward, filling the tea garden with ghost-light: Lia laughing, Lia spinning, Lia alive in the only way she could be now. [353]

This was why Mira climbed the floating isle each evening, descending through layers of sorrow even as her feet carried her higher. [375]

She reached for the paper. [380]

The first crane she folded was clumsy, grief making her fingers thick and stupid. [394]

But she had learned that this was the only way to survive—to fold grief into origami cranes, to transform anguish into something with wings. [418]

Each crane she released would carry a portion of her sorrow into the sky. [432]

Each lantern she built would hold another fragment of Lia's dreaming self. [444]

And perhaps, if she recorded enough dreams, folded enough cranes, she could construct a complete child from memory and light. [463]

The basilica's shadow stretched toward her, then—impossibly—detached entirely, sliding across the tea garden like a living thing. [481]

Detachment hour had come. [485]

Mira whispered the prayers she half-believed, the ones that might grant access to tonight's archive. [500]

Deep in the basilica's crystalline vaults, more of Lia's dreams waited. [512]

Dreams of birthday candles, dreams of her mother's hands, dreams of flying above a sea that had not yet learned to claim her. [535]

Mira rose, knees aching from the cold stone of the garden path, and began her ascent. [551]

With each step upward, she felt herself descending—into memory, into the luminous torment of love that would not end simply because its object had. [575]

The lantern swung at her hip, Lia still running in its gem-caught light. [588]

The cranes she'd released earlier circled the basilica's spires, white against the darkening sky, each one carrying a gram of grief she could almost bear to surrender. [617]

Almost. [618]

She climbed higher. [621]

She sank deeper. [624]

Above her, the glass basilica waited with its burning archives and its priest who looked the other way because he too had lost someone to the earthbound world. [651]

Below her, the tea garden held the last warmth of an extinct sun. [664]

And in between, in this floating space where up and down lost all meaning, Mira continued her crafty work: polishing stones, recording dreams, folding paper into creatures that could carry sorrow skyward while she descended into the only communion death permitted. [704]

The luminous torment was hers alone, and she would not trade it for all the peace in any world. [723]

For in the torment, Lia still lived. [730]

And that, Mira knew, was a kind of ascending that mattered more than gravity could ever comprehend. [746]
