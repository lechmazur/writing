The rain-beaded skylight loft held the afternoon in amber suspension, droplets catching what little light pushed through October clouds. [19] Marta set the kettle on and returned to her workbench, where the ash wood carving blank waited like a pale bone. [40]

She turned it in her hands, feeling for the grain. [50] Thirty years she'd spent beside Henrich as he'd done the same with lions—reading muscle and mood, knowing when to approach, when to retreat. [74] The big cats had been here and gone from her life as swiftly as summer storms, all of them eventually sold or dying, each one a lesson in impermanence. [103] Henrich himself had followed that pattern four months ago, collapsing in the kitchen between breakfast and the morning news. [122]

The kettle began its low murmur. [128] Marta picked up her gouge. [133]

Her approach to grief was what her sister called hauntingly practical—a phrase meant as criticism but worn like a badge. [154] Marta didn't weep into pillows or refuse meals. [162] She carved. [164] Each piece was a way to contain what might otherwise spill and flood, to crystallize time into something she could hold and examine. [187]

This blank would become a lion. [193] Not just any lion—she was carving Empress, the aging lioness Henrich had loved most. [208] He'd spent hours in her enclosure, just sitting, and Marta had never been jealous. [222] She understood. [224] Some connections transcend language and logic. [230]

The rain intensified, drumming the skylight in shifting rhythms. [239] In the rust-hued peace of the loft, surrounded by finished pieces—a carousel horse, a child's hands clasped in prayer, a detailed replica of their first cottage—Marta worked the blank's surface, defining the broad shape of a head. [278]

The kettle's murmur rose toward a whistle. [285] She had perhaps three minutes left, enough to establish the jawline. [296]

What she'd harvested from loss was this: the lesson wasn't in the holding but in the releasing. [313] Henrich had taught her through his own example. [321] When Empress had finally passed, he'd wept freely for one evening, then donated her enclosure to a rescue organization. [340] "Grief that clings becomes a cage," he'd told her. [349] "For you, not for what you've lost." [356]

She'd found this hauntingly practical too—how he could love so completely and yet open his hands when the time came. [377] Here and gone. [380] The phrase used to frighten her, suggesting meaninglessness. [388] Now she understood it differently. [393] Everything was here and gone. [398] The rain against the glass. [403] The steam beginning to curl from the kettle's spout. [412] The lions. [414] Henrich. [415] Eventually, herself. [417]

The ash wood accepted her cuts with soft resistance. [426] Empress's muzzle emerged, the slight part of her lips, the calm authority in her structure. [441] Marta wasn't trying to freeze time or deny its passage. [451] She was learning to contain moments like water in cupped hands—knowing they would slip through, cherishing the brief cool weight against her palms. [475]

The kettle screamed. [478] She set down her tools, crossed to the small stove, and poured steaming water over chamomile flowers. [495] The scent rose, domestic and ancient. [501]

Through the skylight, the rain was already slowing, the beaded droplets beginning their gradual slide down the glass. [519] In an hour, the sky might clear. [526] Tomorrow, clouds might return. [530] The blank on her workbench held the ghost of Empress, waiting to be revealed. [544]

Marta carried her tea back to the bench and sat, not working yet, just watching the light shift across the pale wood. [566] She thought of Henrich's hands—scarred and gentle—and how they'd moved through the world with such careful attention. [585] She thought of Empress pressing her great head against the bars, seeking his touch. [599]

Here and gone. [602] But not nothing. [605] Never nothing. [607]

The lessons she harvested were not about preventing loss. [616] They were about deserving the love while it lasted. [625] About remaining present even when presence hurt. [632] About the strange rust-hued peace that comes not from forgetting but from remembering well. [646]

She lifted her gouge again. [651] The afternoon stretched before her, crystallized into this single purpose. [661] The rain slowed to whispers. [666] The tea cooled. [669] And somewhere in the ash wood, a lioness began to breathe. [680]
