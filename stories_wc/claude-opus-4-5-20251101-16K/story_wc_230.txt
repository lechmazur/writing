After the empathy virus swept across the continents, truth became the only currency, and Maren learned that some purities can break a person faster than any lie. [27]

She worked the hanging orchard in the Veth Ravine, where apple trees clung to cable systems strung between cliff faces, their roots dangling in perpetual mist. [53]

Storms battered the gorge weekly, sometimes daily, and the fruit that survived grew dense and honest—bruised but sweet. [72]

Like the people left behind. [77]

Maren was a truffle forager by training, rational to her marrow. [88]

Before the virus, she'd made her living reading soil, understanding the logic of fungal networks beneath forest floors. [106]

Now she tended suspended trees and searched for something else entirely: a way to occlude the terrible transparency the virus had gifted humanity. [129]

She could not lie. [133]

None of them could. [137]

The empathy virus hadn't killed—it had connected, rewiring neural pathways until every falsehood felt like swallowing glass. [154]

Survivors spoke only truth or stayed silent, and silence itself became suspicious. [166]

Maren craved psychological safety—the simple grace of an unspoken thought, a feeling held private. [180]

In the before-times, she'd never valued secrecy. [188]

Now she understood it as shelter. [194]

The antique glass eye sat wrapped in oilcloth beneath her floorboards. [205]

She'd found reference to it in discredited textbooks, medical journals from the 1890s that spoke of rumored cures for hysteria and moral weakness—quackery dismissed by modern medicine. [233]

But buried in the margins of a water-damaged volume on phrenology, she'd found sketches of a glass prosthetic alleged to "restore the veil between souls." [259]

The eye had been crafted by a German occultist who believed consciousness leaked through the gaze. [275]

By wearing his creation, one could supposedly dam that leakage. [285]

Smuggled relics circulated in the post-virus world like contraband hope. [295]

Most were worthless—crystals, talismans, prayer beads worn smooth by desperate fingers. [306]

But Maren was rational. [310]

She'd traced the eye's provenance through three collapsed governments and a smuggler's network that operated out of the storm shelters beneath the ravine. [332]

She'd traded six months of preserved fruit and her silence about what she'd seen in the tunnels. [349]

The eye was beautiful in the way of broken things: milk-white glass veined with amber, an iris painted in concentric rings of brown and gold. [374]

It had belonged to a woman once, someone who'd lost her real eye to fever and her reputation to accusations of witchcraft. [396]

The occultist had made it for her as apology or penance. [407]

The woman had died in an asylum, swearing she'd finally found peace behind its milky veil. [423]

Tonight, with storm winds screaming through the ravine and the orchard swaying like a ship at sea, Maren unwrapped it. [443]

She held it to her own eye—still intact, still seeing—and pressed gently until her vision occluded. [460]

The world went soft, halved. [465]

She breathed. [467]

"I hate the way my mother died," she said aloud, testing. [478]

The words came easy. [482]

True. [483]

"I wish I could lie to the children about what happens when we run out of food." [500]

Also true. [502]

The eye changed nothing. [506]

But then, quietly: "I don't believe any of us will survive the year." [519]

And there—the faintest hesitation. [524]

The barest space between thought and speech, where once a lie might have lived. [538]

Not a cure. [541]

Not a veil restored. [545]

But a pause. [548]

A breath. [550]

Maren lowered the eye and wept with something adjacent to gratitude. [561]

The orchard shuddered around her, cables singing in the wind. [571]

Apples fell into the mist below, lost. [578]

But some remained, clinging with the stubbornness of all living things that refuse comfortable endings. [593]

In the morning, she would return the eye to its hiding place. [605]

She would climb the ladder and harvest what the storm had spared. [617]

She would speak only truth to the other survivors—but perhaps, with practice, she might learn to pause first. [635]

To choose which truths deserved voice. [641]

That was not dishonesty. [645]

That was not evasion. [649]

That was the fractured grace of remaining human in a world that demanded transparency like a wound demands air. [667]

Maren understood, now, why the woman in the asylum had called the glass eye her salvation. [683]

Not because it let her lie. [689]

Because it reminded her that interiority was worth fighting for. [699]
