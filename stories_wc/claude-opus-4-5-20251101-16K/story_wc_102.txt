The memory had surfaced three days ago, unbidden as a tide beneath a moonless sky. [14]

Maren stood now on the twilight viaduct, her camera obscura box pressed against her chest, watching wisteria cascade from the ancient stone arches in purple curtains of bloom. [43] She had spent her career capturing cities through pinhole and darkness, projecting inverted worlds onto the backs of her wooden boxes, finding clarity in the upside-down. [70] But nothing in her practice had prepared her for the vision that had cracked through her sleep: hands that were hers but not hers, reaching toward a figure walking away through snow, and the terrible weight of words she had never spoken. [109]

A past life, her grandmother would have called it. [118] Maren, spiritually curious since childhood but skeptical of easy answers, called it something that demanded investigation. [132]

She was searching for where unused love is stored. [141]

The thought had arrived with the memory, fully formed: somewhere, the love she had withheld in that other life still existed. [161] It had to. [164] Energy does not vanish. [168] It transforms. [170] And she had become what her grandmother's old journals called a pilgrim of sparks, following small illuminations toward larger truths. [188]

The first spark had led her to this viaduct at the edge of the city, where trains no longer ran and jasmine tangled with the wisteria in fragrant knots. [215] The second spark had been the teardrop-shaped jade pendant in her grandmother's effects, labeled simply: Kwan Yin's tear. [233] Maren wore it now against her collarbone, cool as grief, smooth as forgiveness. [246]

She set up her camera obscura on the viaduct's edge, positioning it to catch the dying light through the blooms. [264] The goddess of compassion, her grandmother had written, weeps for all the tenderness humans fail to offer. [280] Her tears become seeds for what might still grow. [290]

Maren leaned into the viewing hood and let the world invert. [301] Wisteria fell upward. [304] The bruised sky pooled at the bottom of her vision like spilled wine. [316] In this foggy lucidity, she had always found her truest sight, the world made strange enough to finally see. [334]

Her breathing changed first. [338]

She noticed it as she noticed everything through the camera obscura: obliquely, through reflection. [350] The breath grew shallow when she looked at the shadows, deep when she followed the light. [365] This was the method her body had always used to reveal what her mind refused to acknowledge. [380] She had learned to trust it the way sailors trust the wind. [392]

Now her breath caught entirely as the image in her box shifted. [404] The wisteria blossoms seemed to pulse with their own light, and in the inverted twilight, she saw them not as flowers but as vessels. [427] Each purple cluster held a luminous residue, faint as starlight, trembling. [438]

Unused love, stored in living things. [444]

The understanding moved through her like warmth returning to frozen fingers. [455] Every word unspoken, every embrace withheld, every tenderness swallowed back, it did not vanish. [468] It gathered in the growing world, waiting in blossoms and morning fog and the spaces between heartbeats. [483] The earth itself was an archive of human tenderness deferred. [493]

Maren pressed her palm against Kwan Yin's tear and felt something release in her chest, a knot she had carried so long she had forgotten it was not part of her. [523] The jade grew warm. [527] Her breathing deepened, steadied, and with each exhale she felt the old grief leaving, not disappearing but transforming. [545]

She understood now that the healing was not about recovering what was lost. [558] It was about recognizing that love does not require a recipient to exist. [570] The figure in the snow, whoever they had been, had walked away with nothing. [583] But the wisteria had inherited everything. [589]

Maren removed her eye from the camera obscura and looked at the viaduct with ordinary sight. [604] The blooms hung heavy in the fading light, and she could almost see it now, the faint shimmer of accumulated devotion in every petal. [626] She had come seeking a storehouse and found instead a garden. [637]

Tomorrow she would photograph this place properly, capturing the inverted wisteria in silver and light. [651] She would title the image something her grandmother would have understood. [662] But tonight, she simply stood among the blooms as darkness gathered, a pilgrim who had followed sparks to their source and found not an ending but a continuation. [688]

The unused love was everywhere, waiting to be seen. [697] And seeing, she knew now, was its own form of healing. [708]
