The floating isle's observatory had no use for daylight. [8] Mira climbed the spiraling iron stairs, her fingers tracing runes carved into the railing—each symbol a lesson she'd memorized before the world changed, before spoons bent reality and took her memories with them. [44]

She was a budding rune scholar then. [51] She supposed she still was now, though the title felt hollow when half her knowledge had scattered like ash in the wind. [72]

The observatory dome groaned open at her touch, revealing the endless night sky that wrapped around the isle. [90] Stars wheeled in patterns that no longer matched her father's charts. [101] After the Bending, celestial bodies had rearranged themselves, and nobody knew why. [113] Nobody except, perhaps, the automaton that sat dormant in the observatory's heart. [125]

Mira approached it with quietly deliberate steps, each movement considered. [135] The automaton was bronze and silver, shaped like a seated scribe, its eyes dark gems that had once glowed with accumulated wisdom. [155] In its frozen hands, it held an unfinished equation—the last thing it had been calculating when the Bending struck. [174]

She pulled the clockwork automaton key from her satchel. [183] Her father had given it to her before he vanished, before noon shadows swallowed him whole. [198] That was her obsession now: to find where shadows go at noon. [211] Not metaphorical shadows. [214] The literal darkness that fled from high sun—where did it retreat? [226] Her father had been studying that question when he disappeared into it. [238]

The key slid into the automaton's back with a satisfying click. [249] Mira wound it carefully, counting the rotations as her father had taught her. [262]

Three turns for memory. [266] Five for motion. [269] Seven for speech. [272]

The automaton shuddered. [275] Its gem eyes flickered amber, then settled into a steady glow. [286]

"Continuation requested," it said, voice like grinding gears. [294] "Previous session terminated unexpectedly. [298] Seventeen sealed awakenings remain unclosed." [302]

Mira's breath caught. [305] "Sealed awakenings?" [307]

"Power reservoirs. [309] Rune sequences initiated but not completed. [314] Each unclosed loop destabilizes local reality." [319] The automaton's head tilted. [323] "Your father understood. [326] He was closing them. [330] Then he entered one." [334]

"The noon shadow," Mira whispered. [339]

"A sealed awakening. [342] Dimensional pocket. [344] He went to close it from within." [351]

She gripped the workbench. [355] "Can I reach him?" [359]

"You must relearn what you've forgotten. [365] The Bending scattered knowledge, but knowledge can be reconstructed by closing loops." [376] The automaton extended one bronze finger toward the star charts. [386] "Each awakening is tethered to a celestial alignment. [394] Close them in sequence. [398] The noon shadow is the seventeenth." [404]

Mira studied the charts, and slowly, patterns emerged from chaos. [414] The automaton fed her fragments—a rune here, a calculation there—and she began to remember. [428] Not just remember. [431] Relearn. [432] The knowledge rebuilt itself inside her, stronger for being reconstructed rather than simply recalled. [445]

Night after night, she worked. [451] The floating isle drifted through darkness, and Mira sealed awakening after awakening. [463] Each closed loop restored something: a constellation snapping back into place, a river of light mending in the void. [480] By the fourteenth, she could read runes she'd never formally studied. [492] By the sixteenth, she understood why spoons had bent—reality, stretched too thin by unclosed power, had warped at its weakest points. [511]

On the final night, she stood before the seventeenth seal. [522] Dawn threatened the horizon, but on a nocturnal isle, dawn was just another darkness. [536]

She spoke the closing rune. [541] Light exploded inward, a perfect point of noon compressed into the observatory. [553] For an instant, she saw it—where shadows went. [562] Not absence, but presence elsewhere. [567] A folded space where darkness waited, patient and full. [577]

Her father stood there, frozen mid-gesture, completing his own seal. [587]

The loop closed. [590] The shadow-space released him. [594]

He stumbled into her arms, seventeen days older and infinitely tired, but alive. [607]

"You found me," he said. [612]

"I closed the loop," she answered. [618] "You taught me how." [623]

The automaton powered down, its purpose fulfilled. [630] Around them, stars settled into configurations Mira now understood completely—a budding scholar no longer, but one fully awakened, her knowledge sealed by completion rather than loss. [655]

The isle drifted on through the healed night, carrying them toward whatever came next. [669]
