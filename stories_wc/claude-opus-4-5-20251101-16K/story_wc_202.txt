The alchemist's market hung suspended between spires, bridges of rope and weathered planking connecting canvas stalls that swayed gently in winds that never touched the streets below. [27]

Mira had climbed here first as a child, following her grandmother's stories about a place where the forgotten could be found. [48]

Now she was a between-worlds translator, someone who spoke the language of realms that overlapped like transparencies laid upon one another. [69]

She worked through hidden details in paintings, finding messages left by artists who glimpsed other places within their visions. [87]

In her palm, the lighthouse lens fragment caught morning light, refracting it into colors that had no earthly names. [104]

The piece was elusively tangible, solid when she focused on it, yet seeming to slip toward transparency when she looked away. [124]

Her grandmother had pressed it into her hand on a day that felt like yesterday and a lifetime ago simultaneously. [142]

"Anchors of intuition," her grandmother had called these objects, and Mira could still hear her voice clearly. [158]

Things that tethered the translator's gift to something steady when navigating between worlds. [170]

Without them, one could drift, becoming a ghost in all realms and solid in none. [184]

Mira moved between stalls where merchants sold memories bottled in amber, equations that could unbind gravity, and seeds from plants that grew only in dreams. [209]

She was seeking a particular painting, one the market's eldest dealer claimed had arrived from an estate sale, unsigned and overlooked. [229]

The dealer's stall smelled of turpentine and ages. [237]

When he unveiled the canvas, Mira's breath caught. [245]

A lighthouse stood against a twilight sea, unremarkable at first glance. [255]

But through the lens fragment, she saw what others couldn't: figures in the waves, their faces clear and desperate, reaching toward a light that someone had painted out. [282]

An entire shipwreck, erased from history and from art. [291]

She understood then. [294]

These were the overlooked histories she had dedicated her life to honor, not the grand narratives that filled museums and textbooks, but the small stories painted over, forgotten, deliberately obscured. [323]

"May I?" she asked, and the dealer nodded, stepping back. [333]

Mira pressed the lens to the canvas and began to unfasten what had been hidden. [347]

It was delicate work, using her gift to peel back layers of intention, to translate the artist's buried truth into something the present world could receive. [374]

The figures emerged not as paint but as whispers: names, dates, a cargo ship called the Meridian that sank in 1847 with forty-three souls aboard, struck from records because powerful men found it convenient to forget. [411]

Between childhood and now, she had learned that time was never truly linear. [424]

In moments like this, past and present collapsed into an eternal instant where a grandmother's hand pressed a lens into a child's palm, where forty-three people drowned and also lived forever in hidden brushstrokes, where a translator stood suspended above a city and between all worlds at once. [473]

The market swayed gently on its cables. [480]

Merchants called their wares in languages both earthly and otherwise. [489]

Below, the city moved through ordinary hours while Mira existed in this moment that contained all moments. [505]

When she finished, the painting looked unchanged to any ordinary eye. [515]

But she had copied the names, the date, the story into her journal. [528]

Tomorrow she would find their descendants. [534]

She would tell them their ancestors had not been erased, that someone had kept them, secretly, in paint and intention, waiting across centuries for a translator to set them free. [563]

She paid the dealer and carried the painting into light that seemed both ancient and immediate. [578]

The lighthouse lens fragment pulsed warmly in her pocket, its elusively tangible presence a reminder that some things existed most fully when they could barely be grasped. [605]

Her grandmother had taught her this: that the world's true histories lay not in monuments but in margins, in overlooked corners, in the spaces between what was shown and what was seen. [639]

And it was her purpose, her calling across whatever years remained, to unfasten them, one hidden detail at a time, from the silence where they waited. [667]

The market's ropes creaked like the rigging of ships long gone. [678]

Somewhere below, the city continued its forgetting. [685]

Above, among alchemists and dreamers, the work of translation went on. [695]
