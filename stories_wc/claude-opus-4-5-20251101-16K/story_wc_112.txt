The xenobiology research station Meridian-7 hung between two moons, its observation decks perpetually bathed in the peculiar half-light of this system's extended twilights. [27] Kira Voss had been the station's sky mechanic for three years, obliging every request from the researchers—patching hull breaches, calibrating atmospheric filters, maintaining the transport shuttles that ferried specimens from the planet below. [58] But her real work happened in the maintenance bay after hours, where she'd assembled something the researchers would never understand. [76]

Tonight, the observation dome was silent. [83] The Whisper Moths—massive creatures with wingspans of twelve meters, studied for their impossible metabolism—had settled into their roost. [101] Within the hush of beating wings at rest, the station achieved a rare stillness. [115] No electromagnetic interference from their bioluminescent patterns. [122] No harmonic disruption from their synchronized flight. [129]

It was the only window she had. [136]

Kira pulled the lever on her device—a crude assembly of salvaged navigation equipment, rewired sensor arrays, and at its heart, a magnetic nexus she'd harvested from a decommissioned orbital station. [166] The nexus hummed to life at twilight's exact angle, its core glowing purple bleeding into gold. [182]

"Time doesn't flow forward," she whispered, adjusting the holographic projector. [192] "It moves sideways, parallel to itself, like pages in a book you're not meant to read in order." [211]

Through holographic principles, she'd mapped the nexus's field distortions, creating three-dimensional representations of temporal probability. [228] The projections showed not sequences but adjacencies—moments that existed beside each other rather than after. [243]

The station's metal walls were mechanically warm against her palm, heated by the constant hum of life support systems. [261] That warmth had become her only comfort in the cold vastness of space, a reminder that even machines could offer something like tenderness. [284]

Her motivation wasn't scientific fame. [290] Dr. Chen and his xenobiologists would never credit a mechanic with a theoretical breakthrough. [303] She needed to prove this for herself—for the memories that came to her sideways, the dreams where she stood in two moments simultaneously, the persistent sense that she was living adjacent to her own life rather than through it. [344]

The holographic display flickered, then stabilized. [351] The magnetic nexus pulsed in rhythm with something she couldn't name. [362]

And then she saw it. [367]

Not a vision exactly, but an overlay—her own figure standing in this same room, but different. [383] The maintenance bay filled with plants. [390] The walls painted a color that didn't exist yet. [400] Her own face, older, smiling with recognition. [408]

"I wondered when you'd find me," the other Kira said, her voice carrying that particular icy warmth of someone who'd waited long enough to burn through anger into something gentler. [440] "Time doesn't separate us. [444] It just arranges us differently." [449]

This was what subdued awakenings felt like, Kira realized. [458] Not the thunderclap of revelation but the quiet settling of understanding, like snow accumulating on a windowsill. [474] The truth had always been there, waiting in the spaces between moments. [486]

"How long?" Kira asked. [490]

"Does it matter? [493] We exist beside each other now. [499] That's the point." [503]

Outside, one of the Whisper Moths stirred, its wings catching the twilight glow. [516] In moments, the whole colony would wake, and their electromagnetic fields would scatter her readings into noise. [533]

But she'd seen enough. [537] Time wasn't a river carrying her forward. [544] It was a vast plane where every moment touched every other moment, and she had finally learned to reach across. [564]

The lever clicked back to neutral. [570] The magnetic nexus dimmed. [574] The holographic projection faded, taking her other self with it—but not really. [586] Never really gone, just adjacent. [591]

Kira pressed her hand against the mechanically warm wall and smiled. [602] Tomorrow, she would continue being the obliging sky mechanic who fixed what needed fixing. [615] But now she knew that every moment of her life existed simultaneously, touchable, real. [628]

The Whisper Moths began to stir, and the station filled again with the soft thunder of wings. [645] But Kira remained still, dwelling in the quiet space between one heartbeat and the next, where time moved sideways and nothing was ever truly past. [672]
