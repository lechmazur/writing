Marcus had worked the 7:15 AM ferry for eleven years, knew every creak of the hull, every passenger's coffee preference. [20] He loved this job with an ardor that baffled his coworkers. [31] "It's just water and routine," they'd say. [38] But to Marcus, each crossing was a small miracle. [47]

The morning the ferry vanished, Marcus was coiling rope on the foredeck. [59] One moment, the harbor lights glittered through morning fog. [68] The next, the ferry slipped between frequencies of light and emerged somewhere else entirely. [82]

A spectral grotto opened around them - vast crystalline walls catching starlight that shouldn't exist at 7:30 in the morning. [101] The passengers had disappeared. [105] Only Marcus remained, along with the ferry itself, now drifting in waters that glowed with their own luminescence. [123]

His first instinct was to radio the coast guard. [132] Static crackled, then voices layered over voices - dozens of himself, calling from dozens of timelines, all saying the same words with slight variations. [155]

"Mayday, this is the commuter ferry Meridian-" [162]

"Mayday, this is the commuter ferry Horizon-" [169]

"Mayday, this is-" [172]

Marcus lowered the handset. [176] His heart should have been racing with fear, but instead he felt something else: wonder. [191] Eleven years of ordinary crossings had prepared him for this extraordinary one. [203]

That's when he noticed the clocks. [209] Every timepiece on the ferry - the wall clock in the cabin, his wristwatch, the digital display - all showed time moving sideways. [230] Not forward, not backward, but perpendicular to everything he understood about progression. [242]

In the wheelhouse, he found the hourglass. [249] It sat on the captain's desk, completely empty. [257] No sand above, none below. [262] Just glass curved around absence. [267]

"You're supposed to fill it," a voice said. [275]

Marcus turned. [277] A woman stood at the threshold, flickering like a broadcast signal losing strength. [290] She wore a deckhand's uniform from some other version of this ferry, some other iteration of this life. [308]

"I've done this crossing two hundred and seventeen times," she said. [319] "Each time, I get a little more transparent. [327] But you - you still have substance. [333] You could end this." [337]

"End what?" [339]

"The loop. [341] The split. [343] When the original accident happened, the ferry didn't just disappear. [353] It shattered across timelines. [357] We've been trying to find the pattern ever since." [366]

She showed him then - via interconnected patterns in the grotto's crystalline walls. [378] Reflections within reflections, each one showing a different version of the ferry, a different deckhand, all caught in the same moment of fracture. [401] The patterns connected like neurons, like shipping lanes, like the routes Marcus had memorized over eleven years. [418]

"Merge them," she said. [422] "The timelines. [424] Use what you know." [428]

The empty hourglass suddenly made sense. [434] It wasn't broken - it was waiting. [440] Time couldn't fill it because time here ran sideways. [449] But patterns could. [452] Connections could. [454]

Marcus was resiliently positive by nature, perhaps annoyingly so. [463] His coworkers had joked about it. [469] Even now, facing the impossible, he felt something like hope. [479] "I know this ferry," he said. [485] "I know every route, every schedule, every crossing." [493]

He began to radio again, but differently this time. [502] Instead of calling for help, he called to himself - all the versions of himself scattered across the split. [520] He spoke the patterns: coordinates, tides, the rhythm of daily passages. [531] With each transmission, the crystalline walls resonated. [538] The interconnected reflections began to align. [544]

The woman grew more solid as the timelines converged. [553] Other figures appeared - passengers, crew, all the souls caught in the vanishing. [565]

The hourglass filled not with sand but with starlight, concentrated from the grotto's luminous waters. [580]

Marcus understood the tone of this place now: permanent transient. [590] They had always been arriving. [595] They had always been departing. [600] The ferry existed in both states forever, until someone loved it enough to choose one. [615]

He chose arrival. [618]

The grotto dissolved. [621] Morning light broke across the harbor, ordinary and magnificent. [630] The 7:15 ferry completed its crossing, passengers disembarking without knowing they had ever been elsewhere. [645]

Marcus coiled his rope, smiled, and prepared for the next voyage. [656] The hourglass sat in his pocket, warm and waiting. [665]
