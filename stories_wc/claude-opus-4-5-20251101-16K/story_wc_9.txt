The midnight glade floated above an ocean of silver clouds, and Seraph climbed the last rung of the bone ladder with her daughter strapped against her chest. [28]

She had been an onyx-ink cartomancer for seventeen years, reading fates in cards she painted with ink dark as the spaces between stars. [50] Now, three weeks after the birth, her hands trembled too much to draw straight lines. [65] Her daughter slept against her heartbeat, small fists curled like question marks, and Seraph wondered if she had any right to be here at all. [89]

The glade existed where repentance gathered—cloudbound and thick as morning dew. [100] Those who climbed found what they'd lost or learned why losing was necessary. [113] Seraph had come to find where lost time accumulates, because somewhere between her mother's death and her daughter's first breath, eight years had vanished like smoke. [138]

She remembered fragments: cards spread across tavern tables, coins pressed into her palm, strangers' futures spilling like water while her own dried up. [159] She hadn't traced her hand on the birthday tablecloth in all those years. [172] The family custom stretched back seven generations—each birthday, each member pressed their palm to white linen while someone traced the outline in whatever ink matched their soul. [198] Her grandmother's hands overlapped her great-grandmother's in faded copper. [208] Her mother's in river-blue. [212] Seraph's childhood prints scattered across a dozen cloths in onyx, but the last one stopped at nineteen. [228]

The glade grass bent silver beneath her boots. [236] Above, stars hung so close she could taste their light—cold and clean, like grief washed pure. [252] The beauty of this place choked her, pressed against her throat until breathing became an act of faith. [269]

She unfastened the leather pouch at her hip and withdrew the only offering she'd brought: a saucer from her childhood dolls' tea set, cracked down the center in a jagged line. [300] She'd broken it the day her mother first coughed blood. [311] She'd kept it the way some people keep thorns—to remember that love could split without warning. [327]

Willingly perplexed, she knelt in the silver grass and set the cracked saucer before her. [342] The cartomancer who demanded answers from painted cards had learned, finally, that some questions mattered more than their solutions. [360]

"I'm not here for answers," she whispered to the clouds below. [371] "I'm here to give the time back. [378] However much I stole from her." [384]

Her daughter stirred, made a small sound like a bird learning its own voice. [397]

The clouds began to rise. [402]

They came slowly, silver mist climbing through the grass until Seraph knelt in a sea of soft light. [418] The cracked saucer filled with something luminous—not water, not mist, but time itself pooled like mercury. [434] She saw her missing years reflected there: the nights she'd read cards until dawn, the mornings she'd walked past her mother's empty chair, the birthdays she'd let pass unmarked because marking them meant admitting they were gone. [469]

The crack in the saucer held the time in two halves that couldn't quite meet. [484]

Seraph understood then. [487] Lost time didn't accumulate in some distant vault—it gathered in the broken places, in the fractures people carried but wouldn't mend. [505] Her repentance wasn't about retrieving those years. [513] It was about choosing, finally, to stop breaking. [521]

She lifted her daughter and pressed the infant's tiny palm to her own larger one. [536] Tomorrow, when they descended, she would find the birthday tablecloth. [547] She would trace this small hand in whatever color her daughter's soul demanded, and beside it, she would trace her own—thirty-five now, fingers longer than her mother's had been, gaps in the fabric where she should have appeared but hadn't. [589]

She would fill those gaps with new lines. [597]

The clouds embraced them both as Seraph rose, the cracked saucer still cradled in her free hand. [613] She wouldn't repair it. [617] She would keep it beside her cards, beside her inks, as proof that broken things could still hold what mattered. [635]

Her daughter opened her eyes for the first time in this high place, and the starlight found them—dark as onyx, deep as all the futures Seraph had yet to paint. [665]

The choking beauty released her throat at last, and Seraph breathed in the thin air of the cloudbound glade, willingly perplexed by how much lighter grief became when you finally stopped running from it. [702]

She began her descent through the silver dark, one hand on the bone ladder, one hand steadying her child, the cracked saucer tucked against her heart where time could gather safely now—not lost, merely waiting for her to claim it. [746]

Below, the world held its breath for their return. [755]
