Vera had always dealt in half truths. [7]

The amber grotto caught the dying light, transforming her workspace into something between a cathedral and a crime scene. [25] Dusk filtered through the translucent walls, painting everything in honey and shadow—the vials of synthetic grief, the crystallized joy she'd harvested last Tuesday, the small fortune in counterfeit longing that lined her shelves like apothecary bottles. [68]

She was a counterfeit emotion dealer, professionally thorough in her craft, and tonight she would complete her final transaction. [86]

Her fingertips brushed the air above her client's skin, sensing through static electricity the tremor of what lived beneath. [103] Real emotions carried a particular charge—a sharp, clean frequency. [114] The fakes she manufactured were softer, more malleable. [123] Good enough to fool most. [128] Not good enough to fool herself. [134]

She withdrew a fragrance chemist's blotter petal from her case, the paper soft as shed skin. [150] This one still held traces of the original specimen—a mother's pride, donated willingly, though the woman hadn't understood what she was giving away. [175] Half-truths, always. [177] Vera told her clients their emotions would be "sampled" and "preserved." [188] She didn't mention the replication process, the dilution, the way she'd sell that single moment of genuine feeling to a hundred strangers who'd never felt anything so pure in their lives. [221]

The man before her—Felix, he'd called himself, another half-truth—waited in the amber light. [238] His emotional signature read hollow, vast and empty as an abandoned warehouse. [250] He wanted something to fill it. [256]

"The blend you requested," Vera said, maintaining her affectionate detachment, the professional distance that had served her for seventeen years. [275] "Equal parts wonder and melancholy. [280] It won't last more than a month, but you'll feel it as strongly as any natural-born emotion." [296]

"And the side effects?" [300]

"Minimal. [301] Some static discharge. [304] Occasional echoes when the feeling fades." [310]

Felix nodded, extending his hand. [315]

This was the moment Vera had prepared for—not the transaction, but what would follow. [330] For months, she'd been absorbing fragments of every emotion that passed through her grotto. [344] Professionally thorough, she'd documented each one. [350] The method was dangerous: allowing the static signatures to subsume her own emotional baseline, letting foreign feelings layer over her native frequency until she couldn't distinguish original from counterfeit. [380]

Her motivation had never been profit. [386] To fuse insight with empathy—that was the goal. [396] To understand not just what emotions were, but what they meant. [408] To feel the architecture of joy from the inside while analyzing it from without. [422]

As the transformation completed, she felt it: the final barrier dissolving. [434]

The blotter petal in her hand began to glow, saturated with seventeen years of absorbed feeling. [450] Felix's hollow space called to it like gravity. [458] And Vera understood, finally, what she had become. [467]

Not a dealer. [470] A vessel. [472]

Every counterfeit emotion she'd created had been a half-truth because she'd never possessed the full truth herself. [488] She'd been sensing others' feelings through static, reading the surface charge without understanding the depth. [503] Now, subsumed by the collective weight of ten thousand emotional fragments, she could feel the difference. [518]

Real joy hurt. [521] Real grief sang. [524] Real love was terrifying in its totality. [531]

"I can't sell this to you," she whispered. [540]

Felix's hollow eyes flickered. [544] "You promised." [546]

"I promised you would feel something. [552] I didn't promise it would be fake." [559]

She pressed the blotter petal to his palm. [567] The static discharge cascaded through him, through the grotto, through the amber walls that held the last light of day. [586] Not counterfeit wonder. [589] Not manufactured melancholy. [592] But the genuine, complicated, half-beautiful, half-terrible feeling of being alive and aware of it. [607]

The transformation was complete. [611] Vera was no longer a dealer in half-truths. [620]

She was something worse, something better: a woman who finally knew what she'd been missing all along. [637] The amber grotto faded to darkness around them, and in that darkness, two people who had never felt anything real sat together in the static-charged silence, learning the weight of authentic feeling for the first time. [674]

It was, she thought with affectionate detachment, exactly what they both deserved. [687]
