The flood had claimed the Bellini Opera House three days ago, and now Miriam stood waist-deep in black water, her cello bow raised like a divining rod. [27] Flickering lanterns hung from the balcony rails above, casting wavering shadows across the submerged seats and the half-drowned stage. [46] She had been an orchestra pit musician for seventeen years, but she had never seen the pit from this angle—looking up at the stage while standing in what felt like a cold, silent grave. [81]

She was lately inspired by something she couldn't name. [90] Since the flood, strange impulses had pulled her back here each night, past the barriers and the condemned signs. [109]

The water had done something to the walls. [117] Where once there had been crimson velvet and gilded molding, now there were patterns—stains that bloomed and spread like ink dropped in milk. [141] Water damage creating images that shouldn't exist: faces, hands, musical notation that swam in and out of coherence. [159]

Miriam had found the antique opera program floating near the conductor's podium on her first night back. [176] It was dated 1892, the paper swollen and translucent. [185] The ink had run, but not randomly. [192] The water damage had revealed something underneath the printed text—notes, symbols, arrows pointing to margins that contained nothing. [211] Or seemed to contain nothing. [216]

She understood now that she was meant to unravel the code left by a ghost. [231]

The ghost had never spoken. [236] Their communication existed in the in between spaces—the margins of the program, the silences between drips of water, the pregnant pause amid the hush of unstruck chords. [264] Miriam would play a phrase on her cello, and the lantern flames would bend in response. [280] She would ask a question in her mind, and a ripple would disturb the flooded orchestra pit, carrying a leaf or a fragment of sheet music to her feet like an answer. [312]

It was a wordless conversation, and she was learning its grammar. [323]

Tonight, she had brought the program and a lantern of her own. [335] She held the waterlogged pages up to the flame, and the damaged paper became a window. [351] The water stains formed a face—angular, severe, with hollow eyes that seemed to track her movement. [368] Maestro Aldric Venn. [371] She recognized him from the portrait that still hung, water-warped, in the lobby. [384] He had died in this building in 1892, the night of his final performance. [398] Heart failure, the records said. [403] But the code suggested otherwise. [408]

The images in the water stains told a different story. [418] Hands around a throat. [422] A woman in the wings. [427] A door sealed shut. [431]

Miriam understood what the ghost wanted: to disrupt the accepted history. [442] To tear through the official narrative the way the flood had torn through the building's facade. [458]

She played a single note on her cello—a low C that resonated through the flooded chamber like a heartbeat. [478] The lanterns flickered in unison. [483] The water trembled. [486] And in the in between space of that sustained tone, she heard something that wasn't quite music and wasn't quite voice. [507]

A name. [509]

She didn't need to write it down. [516] It had etched itself into her memory like water etching stone. [527]

The program slipped from her fingers into the flood, its purpose served. [539] The images on the walls began to fade as the water slowly receded, as if the opera house itself had held its breath for a century and could finally exhale. [569]

Miriam lowered her bow. [573] The conversation was over, but the story was just beginning. [583] Tomorrow she would find the name in the archives. [592] She would trace the lineage, follow the silence that had swallowed the truth. [605]

The ghost had given her everything she needed in the spaces between—between notes, between words, between what was recorded and what was remembered. [629]

She waded toward the exit, the water pulling at her legs like a departing embrace. [644] Above her, the lanterns steadied their flames for the first time all night. [657] The unstruck chords hung in the darkness, waiting for someone to finally play them true. [672]
