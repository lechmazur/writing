The universe had already finished its long exhale, collapsing inward like a dying star's final gasp, when Mira climbed the spiral stairs to the ambered observatory deck. [28] The platform floated in what remained of space—a crystallized viewing station preserved in golden resin that ancient astronomers had built to outlast entropy itself. [50] She came here every cycle, though cycles meant little now. [60]

Mira was a cast lots decision maker, the last of her order. [72] When humanity had fragmented across the contracting cosmos, her people had chosen randomness over deliberation, believing that chance held wisdom unavailable to logic. [93] She reached into her coat pocket and withdrew her most sacred possession: a collection of foreign coins from seventeen extinct civilizations. [113] Sumerian shekels clicked against Roman denarii, Byzantine solidus pressed against currencies from worlds that had never known Earth's sun. [130]

The static hissed through the observatory's ancient speakers—cosmic background noise compressed into something almost musical as spacetime folded. [148] Her purpose here was to distill meaning from that chaos, to find patterns in the interference that the universe coughed up in its contraction. [172] She had been quietly enthusiastic about this work once, keeping her hope contained like a small flame cupped against wind. [192] That enthusiasm remained, though stellar doubt had grown around it like frost. [204]

She understood the static bursts now, had learned their grammar over decades. [216] Each pop and hiss carried fragments of the backwards prophecy—visions not of what would happen, but of what already had. [236] In a contracting universe, time's arrow bent strangely. [245] Messages traveled from the future into the past, arriving as distorted echoes of events that had already concluded. [262] The prophecies told Mira about extinctions that were finished, loves that had already burned to ash, victories that existed only in memory's diminishing light. [285]

What use was prophecy that revealed only the past? [294]

She shook the foreign coins in her palm, listening to their metallic whisper. [307] The first toss would determine whether she continued listening tonight. [317] An odd number of heads meant yes. [324] She released them across the amber floor, and they scattered like fallen stars, catching the dim light of distant galaxies still visible through the crystalline dome. [349]

Seven heads. [351] Yes. [352]

Mira adjusted the frequency dial, and the static shifted—higher, sharper, resolving momentarily into something almost like voices. [370] She had spent her life trying to wavelength align with purpose, to find the cosmic frequency where her existence made sense. [391] The backwards prophecy had shown her the death of her homeworld, the extinction of her species, the slow dimming of every consciousness she had ever known. [415] All of it already done. [420] All of it immutable. [423]

But tonight the static carried something different. [430]

She leaned forward, understanding static bursts as fluently as others understood language. [442] The message arrived in reverse, of course—she had to mentally flip each phrase, each implication. [457] It spoke of a decision that would echo backward through contracting time. [469] It spoke of coins scattered on amber floors. [477] It spoke of her. [481]

The backwards prophecy described a woman who would find meaning not in preventing catastrophe or changing fate, but in witnessing. [499] In the contracting universe, someone needed to remember what had been. [511] Someone needed to distill the dying static into memory, into testimony, into love for what had existed. [528]

Mira cast the coins again. [533] This time she asked whether the prophecy was true—whether her purpose had always been simply to be present at the end, quietly enthusiastic about existence even as it folded into itself. [562]

Eight heads. [564] Even number. [566] The lots said no. [570]

But she smiled anyway, because cast lots decision makers knew something the universe had forgotten: randomness was not truth. [587] It was permission. [590] Permission to choose differently than chance dictated. [597]

She turned back to the static, adjusting frequencies with renewed purpose. [608] The ambered deck glowed around her, preserving this moment as it preserved all moments—frozen in golden light at the edge of everything. [630] Her doubt remained, vast as the contracting cosmos, but within it burned something small and stubborn. [648]

The foreign coins lay scattered at her feet like a constellation map of dead civilizations. [663] She gathered them slowly, reverently. [668] Each one represented a world that had existed, that had mattered, that she would remember. [682]

Outside, space continued its slow collapse. [689] Inside, Mira listened to the static bursts and distilled their backwards wisdom, wavelength aligning with a purpose she had finally understood: not to change the past or predict the future, but to witness the beautiful, doubtful, stellar present—for as long as it remained. [735]

The coins clinked softly as she pocketed them for the next casting. [748] Tomorrow she would climb these stairs again and ask the universe new questions. [762] The prophecy would still run backward. [768] The doubt would still burn cold between the stars. [778] But she would be here, quietly enthusiastic, remembering everything. [788]

That was enough. [791]
