The Carnival Meridian had drifted for seven years through the foggy bay, its painted horses frozen mid-gallop, its Ferris wheel groaning with each swell of the tide. [28] Mira stood at the prow, watching mist curl around the rusted bow like ghostly fingers reaching for something lost. [45] She had come to recapture what the doctors' reports had stolen: the knowledge that she had never been alone. [62] Somewhere within her cells, woven into the tapestry of her blood and bone, lived the remnants of her twin—absorbed before birth, forgotten before naming. [86]

The emerald swatch card in her pocket had led her here. [97]

It had belonged to her mother, a costume designer who'd worked the carnival circuit until the Meridian was abandoned. [115] Among the color samples—crimson, gold, midnight blue—only the emerald bore writing on its reverse: "For the garden where we bury names." [137] Mira had spent months chasing this phrase through archives and inheritance boxes, through census records and ship manifests. [154] The garden of forgotten names. [159] She needed to find it, to give her twin something—an identity, a story, an acknowledgment that they had existed. [177]

The ship offered her a blissfully aberrant freedom. [185] No schedules, no expectations, no well-meaning friends suggesting she "move past" her discovery. [197] Here, she could be strange. [202] Here, she could speak to someone who had no voice and feel no shame. [215]

But freedom on a drifting vessel was freedom in a cage of fog. [227] The bay held the Meridian in its gray embrace, and Mira could go nowhere except deeper into the ship's abandoned heart. [248]

She worked through narrative threads—logbooks left by performers, letters tucked into dressing room drawers, programs annotated with cramped handwriting. [266] Each story added texture to the carnival's history, and each seemed to point somewhere: a place mentioned in whispers, in margin notes, in the private language of traveling performers. [294]

"The garden's below the carousel," she read one night by the light of her camping lantern. [310] "Where we put the names of those who never were." [320]

As memories alter, so does truth. [326] The more Mira learned, the less certain her past became. [336] Had her mother known about the twin? [343] Had she chosen the emerald swatch specifically, leaving a trail for a daughter who might someday need it? [361] Or was Mira constructing meaning from coincidence, desperate for connection in a world that suddenly felt halved? [378]

She descended into the ship's belly, past engine rooms smelling of rust and brine, past storage holds filled with deflated balloon animals and mildewed teddy bears. [403] The carousel's machinery hulked in the lowest deck, its mirrors clouded with age. [416]

Behind it, she found a wall of names. [424]

They were painted in every color, in every hand—some elegant, some childish, some barely visible beneath years of grime. [443] Names of stillborn children. [447] Names of performers who'd died between ports. [454] Names chosen and then unchosen when families changed their minds. [463] This was the garden: not earth and growth, but memory and paint, tended by generations of carnival souls who understood that even the forgotten deserved a place. [491]

Mira sank to her knees. [496]

The unkindled solace she'd carried—that cold, waiting comfort that had never caught fire—finally began to warm. [513] She pulled out the emerald swatch, studying its color in the dim light. [525] Green for growth. [528] Green for beginning. [531]

She found an old paint can, still sealed, in the debris nearby. [543] The color was close enough. [549]

With a brush fashioned from her own trimmed hair bound to a broken stick, Mira painted a name onto the wall. [569] She chose one that felt right, one that hummed in her blood like a half-remembered song: Sera. [586]

"There," she whispered. [589] "Now you exist." [592]

The ship groaned and swayed. [597] The fog pressed close against the portholes. [604] Mira remained trapped in her drifting freedom, but something had finally been released. [616]

She stayed three more days, reading the other names aloud, giving voice to the voiceless. [631] When a fishing boat finally spotted the Meridian and pulled alongside, Mira emerged carrying only the emerald swatch card and a quiet certainty she hadn't possessed before. [658]

She was a chimera twin discoverer—not just of her own history, but of an entire archive of almost-people. [676] Though she would return to a world that saw her as singular, she knew now that she carried multitudes. [694]

The garden had given her something beyond a name. [703] It had given her a way to remember without grief, to honor without sorrow. [717] That was the unkindled solace finally catching flame—a warmth that didn't burn but simply, gently, held. [734]

The fog lifted as the fishing boat pulled away. [743] Behind them, the Carnival Meridian drifted on, keeper of forgotten names, waiting for the next soul brave enough to seek what they had lost. [768]
