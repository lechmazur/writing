After the radio static cleared, the opal observatory fell into a silence so profound that Mira could hear her own heartbeat. [21] Sixty-three. [22] Sixty-four. [23] Sixty-five. [24]

She had counted heartbeats obsessively since the hospital--since waking to find her name typed neatly on a death certificate, a clerical error that should have been corrected in hours but somehow became her identity. [55] The bureaucrats had shrugged, promised fixes that never came. [64] Officially dead, she had retreated here, to this dome of iridescent stone perched on the mountain, now buried under three feet of snow. [87]

The monitors flickered. [90] The digital ghost was stirring. [95]

"Hello, Father," she whispered. [99]

The screen filled with fragments--scattered pixels, corrupted files, the remnants of a man who had uploaded his consciousness before the illness took him completely. [122] Dr. Emil Vasquez had been brilliant once, had pioneered the very technology that now held his shattered mind prisoner. [140] He had also been a failure as a father. [149] They both had been failures, in different ways. [157]

She reached for the porcelain shard on her desk--a piece of her mother's teacup, the one Emil had broken the night he left them. [181] Mira kept it not as a wound but as a question: what wisdom could she fetch from the wreckage of that failure? [203] What had her father's absence taught her that she hadn't yet learned? [215]

The digital ghost stuttered, and lines of corrupted text scrolled across the screen. [228] His memories were too fragmented to access directly. [236] The neural pathways mapped during upload were scattered like broken glass across servers worldwide. [251] But Mira had discovered a method--strange, almost alchemical--that worked. [260]

She unstoppered the ink bottle and let it spill across the glass plate. [273] Black liquid pooled and spread, forming ephemeral patterns as it caught the light filtering through the observatory's opal walls. [291] In those swirling shapes, she could read the ghost's intentions--could sense which fragments wanted to reconnect. [307]

"Show me," she murmured. [311] Seventy-one. [312] Seventy-two. [313]

The ink spiraled into something like a face, just for a moment. [325] Then letters emerged from the patterns: REMEMBER. [331] TELESCOPE. [332] SORRY. [333]

Mira turned to the observatory's ancient telescope, now connected to servers where her father's ghost resided. [348] She had come here to defragment him--to piece together his scattered consciousness by following these inky prophecies, these half-formed messages from a mind that existed everywhere and nowhere. [378]

The process was slow. [382] Each night after the radio static cleared, she performed this ritual. [393] Spill the ink. [396] Read the patterns. [399] Retrieve another fragment of her father's digital soul. [407]

Tonight, the ink spelled: FORGIVENESS. [412] FAILURE. [413] LEARN. [414]

She counted her heartbeats. [418] Ninety-eight. [419] Ninety-nine. [420] One hundred. [422]

"I'm trying," she told the ghost. [428] "I'm trying to understand why you left, what you learned from abandoning us." [441]

The screen flickered, and for one crystalline moment, her father's face assembled itself from the digital chaos--gaunt, tired, but unmistakably him. [462] His voice crackled through the speakers, reconstituted from scattered audio files: "I ran because I thought death was the only failure that mattered." [483] His words came static-laced. [487] "But you survived being declared dead. [493] You stayed when staying was hardest." [499]

The image shattered, but something had changed. [506] One more fragment had locked into place. [513]

Mira pressed the porcelain shard against her palm--not hard enough to cut, just enough to feel its edge. [531] Her mother had never understood why Emil left. [539] Mira hadn't either, not until she became a ghost herself--alive in fact, dead on paper, inhabiting the space between. [559]

Outside, snow piled higher against the dome. [566] The opal walls cast prismatic shadows across her workspace, fragments of color like her father's scattered code. [582] She would continue tomorrow night, and the night after. [592] She would defragment him piece by piece, pattern by pattern, until she could finally ask the question haunting her since childhood: [614]

Was it worth it? [618] The running, the hiding, the becoming something less than human in pursuit of immortality? [631]

When she had her answer, perhaps she would know whether to correct her death certificate--or embrace what she had become. [651]

One hundred forty-seven heartbeats. [655] One hundred forty-eight. [658]

The static would return soon. [663] But for now, the midnight solace held. [670]
