The argument's echo had died, leaving only the vast quiet of the dome. [13]

Mira sat cross-legged on the concrete floor, the campfire story stick balanced across her knees. [27] The decommissioned radar installation curved above her like the inside of a skull, its instrumentation stripped, leaving only the white shell and the memory of listening for things falling from the sky. [56]

She was uncommonly serene for someone whose collaborator had just walked out. [67]

The stick was charred at one end, carved with symbols at the other—a relic from her grandmother's village, where elders passed it hand to hand during night gatherings. [94] Whoever held it had the right to speak. [102] Whoever didn't had the obligation to listen. [109]

This was the problem, she thought. [115] No one knows how to listen anymore. [122]

For three years, Mira had worked the circuit of seedy bars along the industrial corridor—The Rusted Anchor, Vera's Place, The Pit. [143] An urbane calligrapher by training, she'd learned to translate her precise brushwork into puppet shadows cast against smoke-stained walls. [162] Her shows were subversive not in their politics but in their patience. [174] While other performers delivered messages, Mira delivered questions. [183] Her puppets would stop mid-scene and ask the audience what should happen next. [195] Sometimes they would refuse to finish a story, leaving patrons arguing about justice and mercy over their cheap beer. [213]

To explore ethical storytelling, she'd told Marcus when he first joined her. [225] Not to tell people what's right. [231] To make them feel the weight of choosing. [239]

But tonight Marcus had accused her of cowardice. [247] Your half-measures change nothing, he'd shouted, his voice bouncing off the dome's interior. [260] People need clear answers, not your riddles. [267]

She'd said nothing, only watched him leave through the hatch door, his footsteps receding into the night. [283]

Now, in the meteor hush of the abandoned station, Mira turned the story stick in her hands. [299] The installation had been built to detect falling objects—missiles, satellites, space debris burning through the atmosphere. [314] Scientists had sat here listening for catastrophe. [321] The irony wasn't lost on her: she'd chosen this place for their rehearsals precisely because it was built for listening. [340]

A half-lit epiphany began to form in her mind, the way they always did—not as certainty but as a shape emerging from shadow. [362]

Marcus wanted her to reverse course. [368] To make her puppets preach instead of question. [376] To trade ambiguity for clarity. [381]

But what if the reversal he demanded wasn't the reversal she needed? [393]

She thought about her grandmother, passing the story stick around the fire. [404] The elders never told listeners what to think. [412] They trusted the darkness between words, the silence where meaning grew. [423] Their stories weren't half-lit by accident—they were half-lit by design, leaving room for each listener to bring their own light. [443]

Maybe the answer wasn't to give her audiences more illumination. [453] Maybe it was to reverse her own position entirely. [462] To stop standing before them as the one who knew the questions worth asking, and instead to sit among them, passing the stick, becoming a listener herself. [490]

She could see it: a new kind of show. [499] No stage, no performer's remove. [505] Just a circle in whatever dim bar would have them, with her puppets laid out like offerings, and anyone who wanted to could pick one up and speak. [533]

The dome's white curve held the night's silence like a cupped palm. [545] Somewhere above, beyond the shell, debris continued its eternal fall toward Earth, most of it burning to nothing before arrival. [565]

Mira stood, the story stick warm in her grip. [574] She would find Marcus tomorrow, not to apologize but to propose something neither of them had considered. [590]

The best stories, she understood now, weren't the ones that gave you light. [603] They were the ones that taught you to see in the dark. [614]

She walked toward the hatch, tucking the stick beneath her arm, leaving the dome to its original purpose: listening for what falls from great heights, waiting to understand what survives the descent. [648]

Outside, the stars hung silent and ancient, and Mira carried her half-formed vision into the cool air, knowing that some truths only reveal themselves in pieces, and that the spaces between knowing are where transformation lives. [690]
