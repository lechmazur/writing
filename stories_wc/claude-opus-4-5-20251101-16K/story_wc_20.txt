The search party disbanded at dawn, their lanterns extinguished one by one like dying stars. [15] Mira watched them leave from the foundry threshold, rain still dripping from the iron eaves in silver threads. [31] She did not follow. [35]

The foundry smelled of wet iron and cold cinders, its great furnaces dormant since the accident three weeks prior. [52] Mira moved through the shadows with the practiced balance of someone who had spent forty years measuring volatile compounds to the grain. [71] An alchemist learned equilibrium or learned nothing at all. [80]

She retrieved the zodiac coin from her apron pocket—Capricorn, the sea-goat, stamped in tarnished bronze. [94] It had belonged to Edris, the apprentice she had named herself when his dying mother pressed the newborn into her arms fourteen years ago. [117] "Name him something that climbs," the woman had whispered. [126] So Mira had chosen Edris, meaning "powerful lord," and given him the coin to mark his first breath under Capricorn's patient constellation. [147]

Now he was gone. [151] Lost to the mountain passes, the searchers said, though they found no body. [164] Mira knew better. [167] She had driven him there with her relentless corrections, her inability to praise, her fear that softness would make him weak. [187] The weight of his name had become a burden she'd placed on shoulders too young to bear it. [204]

She lit the smallest forge, feeding it coal and bellows-breath until it glowed amber. [218] The rain outside intensified, drumming against the foundry's tin roof like a thousand impatient fingers. [233] What she intended was factually mystical—grounded in metallurgical truth yet reaching toward something that textbooks dismissed as folklore. [251] Kintsugi alchemy, the old masters called it. [258] The art of mending broken things with seams of gold, making fractures beautiful rather than shameful. [273]

Mira had taught Edris the theory but never the practice. [283] She had told him he wasn't ready, that his measurements were imprecise, that he must master foundation before attempting transcendence. [302] All true. [304] All cowardice. [306] She had been afraid to show him her own broken places, the golden seams she'd filled across decades of failure and grief. [326]

Now she would redeem that silence by exploring limits she had never dared approach. [340]

From her workbench, she gathered the fragments—a shattered crucible Edris had dropped his first week, a cracked measuring glass from his fumbled attempts at distillation, the bent copper wire from his ambitious failure at electrical transmutation. [376] Every piece held memory. [380] Every crack mapped his journey through her tutelage. [388]

The coin she placed at the center. [395]

Mira worked through the night, heating gold to liquid brilliance, whispering the names she had given him over the years—Edris, apprentice, child, burden, hope. [422] Each name carried weight she had never examined until now. [432] Names were assignments, she understood at last. [439] They told a person who they must become before they could choose who they wished to be. [454]

The rain gentled as she poured the molten gold into cracks and fractures, binding shards into something new. [470] What emerged was neither crucible nor glass nor wire. [480] It was a lantern, imperfect and luminous, its surface mapped with golden rivers that caught the forge-light and held it. [499]

She had not meant to make a lantern. [507] That was the mystical part—intention shaped outcomes in ways measurement could not predict. [520]

Dawn crept gray through the foundry windows when she heard footsteps outside. [532] The door groaned open. [536] Edris stood there, soaked and shivering, his face gaunt from three weeks of wandering. [550]

"I saw the light," he said, voice cracking. [558] "From the pass. [561] I thought the foundry was empty." [567]

Mira set down the lantern, its gold seams glowing with impossible warmth. [579] "I was making something," she said. [585] "For you. [587] To show you what I should have shown you years ago." [597]

She crossed the rain-washed floor and did what balance had always forbidden: she let herself be unsteady. [614] She embraced him, this boy whose name she had chosen, whose cracks she had criticized instead of gilded. [631]

"I don't know if I can be what that name means," Edris whispered against her shoulder. [646]

"Then we'll find you a new one," Mira said. [655] "Or learn that names can stretch. [661] That they break and mend like everything else." [669]

The lantern flickered on the workbench, its fractured light filling the foundry with luminous regret—beautiful because it acknowledged the breaking, radiant because it chose repair anyway. [696]

Outside, the clouds thinned. [700] Somewhere beyond the mountains, the search party slept, believing they had failed. [712] They would never know that the lost boy had found his own way home, guided by golden light seeping through intentional scars, following the glow of someone who had finally learned that balance meant knowing when to let things fall apart so they could be rebuilt better. [762]

Mira released her apprentice and handed him the lantern. [772] "Your first completed transmutation," she said. [778] "Imprecise. [779] Imperfect. [780] Exactly right." [782]

Edris turned the lantern in his hands, tracing the golden seams with trembling fingers. [795] Understanding dawned in his eyes like morning through rain. [804]

I need to trim a few words. Let me revise:
