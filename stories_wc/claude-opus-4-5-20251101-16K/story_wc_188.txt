Mira chanted as she walked, her voice a low rhythm against the crunch of gravel beneath her boots. [17] The words were nonsense syllables mostly—fragments of songs her grandmother taught her, mixed with counting sequences and the chemical formulas for color: strontium for red, barium for green, copper for blue. [46] The chanting kept time, kept her moving, kept the silence from becoming too heavy to carry. [60]

The Blooming Fortress rose before her at dusk, its ancient walls softened by decades of neglect and nature's stubborn reclamation. [78] Wisteria cascaded from arrow slits like purple waterfalls. [86] Roses conquered siege towers that had once repelled armies. [95] What had been built for war now surrendered beautifully to everything that wanted to live. [109]

Mira shifted the pack on her shoulders, feeling the familiar weight of her trade: fuses, powders, casings, and the fire spinner's kerosene rag knot she kept wrapped in oilcloth against her heart. [141] The knot had belonged to Sava, her partner, her teacher, who had danced with flame while Mira painted the sky above her. [163] Three years gone now, taken by the fever that swept the eastern valleys, but the rag knot remained—still faintly redolent of kerosene, still carrying the shape of Sava's hands in its worn fibers. [197]

She had come here following Sava's final instructions, scrawled on a fever-damp page: "The fortress that blooms. Find my note in mosaic. You'll understand." [224]

Understanding had never been Mira's strength. [230] Creating, yes. [232] Making light explode against darkness, that she could do. [241] But Sava had always been the one who understood things—who read meaning in patterns Mira couldn't perceive. [257]

Dusk thickened to full night as she entered the courtyard. [267] Above, not a single star pierced the cloud cover. [276] During the hush of a night with no stars, the world felt compressed, intimate, as if the sky had drawn close to listen. [299]

Mira didn't light her torch immediately. [305] Instead, she let her awareness expand, a technique Sava had taught her—filter the world through ambient awareness, she'd said, and you'll hear what wants to be found. [332] So Mira stood motionless, breathing slowly, letting her senses gather information rather than hunting for it. [348]

The night smelled of jasmine and old stone. [356] Wind moved through the roses with a papery whisper. [365] Somewhere, water dripped in a pattern too regular to be rain. [376]

She followed the sound. [380]

The fountain had long since stopped flowing, but condensation gathered on its mosaic basin and fell in measured drops. [397] Mira knelt, finally allowing herself to strike a match. [406]

The mosaic depicted fire dancers, their forms rendered in amber and crimson and gold tessera, spiraling around a central figure who held something aloft—not flames, but a single bright point that could only be a firework's bloom. [444] And there, hidden in the negative space between dancers, tiles of darker stone spelled out words for those patient enough to perceive them: "Make light anyway." [472]

Mira laughed—a sound caught between grief and recognition. [481] Serious playfulness had been Sava's way, hiding profound truths inside jokes, tucking hope into unexpected corners. [496]

Make light anyway. [499] Three words against the gravity of hopelessness that had pulled at Mira every day since the funeral. [514] Three words that explained why Sava had kept dancing even as the world grew darker around them, why she'd insisted Mira learn the fireworks trade, why she'd sent her here to this fortress where death had been transformed into bloom. [555]

Mira unpacked her materials with renewed purpose, working by the match's dying glow. [568] She constructed a single rocket—not her most elaborate, but honest in its simplicity. [580] She used the kerosene rag knot to catch the spark that would light the fuse, Sava's tool finally completing its purpose. [600]

The fortress held its breath. [605] The starless sky waited. [609]

When the rocket climbed and burst into cascading gold against that absolute darkness, Mira began to chant again—not formulas now, but Sava's name, repeated like a prayer, like a defiance, like a note left in the night for anyone who needed to know that light could exist even when the universe provided no stars. [666]

The blooming fortress glowed beneath the falling sparks, flowers catching the brief illumination like witnesses. [682]

Mira was already building the next rocket. [689] And the next. [692] She would work until dawn if necessary, making light anyway, again and again, until the message embedded itself not just in mosaic but in the memory of the night itself. [722]

Some battles were won not through conquest but through stubborn, beautiful refusal. [734] Sava had known this. [738] Now Mira did too. [742]

She struck another match and smiled as the spark took hold. [753]
