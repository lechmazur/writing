Marcus had always looked up. [5] As an elevator repair technician, he'd spent twenty years studying the spaces above people's heads—the shafts, the cables, the hidden machinery that carried strangers between floors. [32] But it was the ghosts that taught him what ceilings truly concealed. [44]

The abandoned circus ticket office smelled of mildew and forgotten cotton candy. [56] The property management company had hired him to assess the old freight elevator that once carried performers and equipment to the upper levels. [78] Now it sat frozen, a steel coffin in the wall. [88]

Marcus set his toolbox down and looked around. [96] The ticket windows were boarded up, their painted clown faces faded to suggestion. [109] Cracks webbed across the plaster facade, and through those cracks, he could see the lath beneath—the skeleton that held up the smile. [132]

He noticed the dust first. [137] Skillfully observant after decades of reading the stories that debris tells, he crouched and studied the accumulation patterns on the counter. [158] Something had been moved recently—a rectangular shape, judging by the clean outline. [171] Someone had been here, despite the condemned notice on the door. [182]

The overhead fluorescents buzzed like trapped insects. [189] Marcus waited. [191]

When the buzz died off—that sudden silence that comes before bulbs fully surrender—he saw her. [208] A woman in a sequined leotard, sitting in the corner. [218] Her eyes were fixed on the ceiling. [225]

"You're looking in the wrong place," she said. [233]

Marcus didn't startle. [236] He'd long ago accepted this weightless burden of seeing the dead. [247] It pressed on him without crushing, present without painful. [256] He'd learned to engage with them the way he engaged with stuck pulleys—with patience, with respect for their particular mechanisms. [277]

"Where should I be looking?" he asked. [284]

She pointed upward. [287] "The ceiling. [289] Panel seventeen. [291] That's where Victor hid it after the accident." [299]

Marcus followed her gaze. [303] The dropped ceiling was standard commercial tile, water-stained and sagging. [313] He counted panels. [316] Seventeen was directly above the freight elevator door. [324]

He retrieved his ladder and climbed. [330] The dust up here told a different story—recent disturbance, finger marks in the grime. [345] Someone else had been seeking what the ceiling hid. [354]

Behind the tile, tucked against a joist, Marcus found a wooden box. [366] Inside, wrapped in velvet, was a horologist's mainspring barrel—the heart of a clock, capable of storing energy for days, releasing it in measured precision. [391]

"Victor was a horologist before he was a strongman," the ghost said. [403] "And a thief before he was either. [410] He stole that from the ringmaster's grandfather. [417] Took it the night the fire started." [424]

Marcus turned the brass cylinder in his hands. [432] It was beautiful, intricate, worth a fortune to collectors. [441]

"The fire," he repeated. [445]

"Eleven dead. [447] Victor included." [449] She looked at him with eyes that held no accusation, only exhaustion. [461] "The ringmaster blamed faulty wiring. [466] Insurance paid. [468] But Victor started it—knocked over a lamp while hiding his prize. [480] He's been up there ever since, watching it, unable to let go." [492]

Marcus looked at the shaft of the broken elevator. [501] In the darkness, he could see another figure—a massive man with guilt carved into his transparent features. [519]

The cracks in the facade ran deeper than plaster. [528] The whole circus had been built on a lie, and beneath the painted smiles, there had always been rot. [547]

"What do you want me to do?" Marcus asked. [556]

"Take it out of here. [561] Donate it. [563] Sell it. [565] Whatever frees him." [568] She was already fading as the fluorescents flickered back to life. [579] "Some of us can't leave until the evidence does." [588]

Marcus pocketed the mainspring barrel. [593] Above him, he felt the weight of Victor's decades-long vigil begin to lift—weightless now, truly weightless. [610]

He climbed down and gathered his tools. [617] The elevator was beyond repair, but that had never been the real job. [630] The real job was always what the ceilings hid: the secrets, the guilt, the small mechanisms that kept the dead wound tight. [652]

Outside, the morning sun hit his face. [659] The burden he carried felt lighter than ever—present but not pressing, a gift more than a curse. [677]

Some people fixed machines. [681] Marcus fixed what machines couldn't touch. [687]
