The funhouse mirrors still reflected, though everything else had rotted. [10]

Elara pressed her palm against the warped glass, watching her image stretch into something serpentine. [24] After the resuscitation, she'd developed an aversion to her own reflection—not because of what she saw, but because of what lingered. [44] A faint luminescence traced her outline, the stubborn glow that death had left behind like perfume from a departed lover. [62]

"Closer," whispered the voice at her shoulder. [69] "Fear lives in the spaces between what you see and what sees you." [82]

The advisor had no form she could name. [90] It existed only in murmurs against her ear, in the displacement of dust motes, in the sensation of cold breath on her neck. [112] She'd brought it back when her heart restarted—a hitchhiker from the threshold she'd crossed. [126]

Elara obeyed, stepping deeper into the carnival's decomposing heart. [135]

The funhouse had closed decades ago after a photographer documented its horrors—children who entered laughing, emerging silent, their eyes wrong. [154] Now Elara understood why. [158] The place consumed fear, grew fat on it, and she was photographically cursed because she'd been here before, as a child, and a camera had captured the moment fear first claimed her. [191] Every photograph taken of her since showed not her face but the thing that had worn it that day. [210]

She withdrew the dream dictionary from her coat pocket. [219]

Its pages were filled with paradoxical notes in handwriting that shifted between her own and her dead grandmother's—the woman who'd given her the opera cloak clasp she now wore at her throat, the silver serpent biting its own tail. [261] Her grandmother had written: "To defeat fear, you must make it afraid. [274] To make it afraid, you must love what repulses you." [284]

"You mean to unbosom yourself here," the advisor whispered, something like admiration threading through its voice. [298] "To confess your terror and let fear taste its own medicine." [309]

"Not confess," Elara corrected, stepping over a fallen clown mannequin whose grinning face had melted into something suggesting endless, toothless hunger. [330] "Seduce." [331]

The lingering luminance around her pulsed brighter as she moved toward the funhouse's center, where mirrors created an infinite regress of her glowing form. [355] She was drawn to this place despite its rot, because of its rot—the repulsive allure of confronting what had broken her. [376] Dead cotton candy crunched beneath her boots. [383] The air smelled of mildew and sugar, of childhood and decay. [394]

"Fear feeds on hiding," she said aloud, consulting another paradoxical note: To reveal is to consume. [409] To hide is to be consumed. [415] "So I stop hiding." [419]

She unclasped the opera cloak clasp, letting it rest in her palm. [431] The serpent seemed to writhe in the spectral light emanating from her skin. [444] Her grandmother had worn this into her own funhouse of fears and emerged transformed. [457]

"I know you're watching," Elara called to the darkness gathering in the corners, thicker than shadow. [472] "I died, and I came back, and I brought the light with me. [485] The light you've always tried to extinguish." [492]

The funhouse groaned. [495] Mirrors trembled. [497]

"Tell me," she whispered, echoing her advisor's cadence, "what does fear fear?" [509]

The darkness lunged—not to attack, but to flee. [518] And in its retreat, it unbosomed itself involuntarily, spilling secrets like black water: it feared being seen, being named, being loved despite its ugliness. [543]

Elara smiled, her luminance flaring. [548]

"Then look at me looking at you," she said. [557]

She held up the clasp like a mirror, and the serpent's eye caught the darkness, reflected it back transformed. [575] The fear shattered like glass, its fragments becoming nothing more than the glitter of old carnival lights, falling around her like cursed confetti. [598]

The advisor laughed—a sound like wind through dead leaves. [607]

"You tricked it." [610]

"No." [611] Elara clasped the serpent back at her throat, feeling the lingering luminance finally begin to fade into something warmer, something hers. [631] "I just refused to look away." [637]

She walked out of the funhouse, leaving the mirrors to reflect only dust and the memory of monsters that could no longer hold their shape. [660]
