The distress signal had gone out seventeen minutes ago, a pulse of light and frequency that would bring rescue vessels eventually—but not soon enough. [26] Mira descended through the temple's broken dome, her oxygen gauge blinking amber in the corner of her mask. [43] The forgotten underwater temple sprawled beneath her in lonesome splendor, its columns wrapped in bioluminescent kelp, its altars adorned with barnacles that sparkled like scattered jewels. [70] She had sent the signal knowing she might not surface again. [81] But some things mattered more than survival. [88]

The gathered hush of the temple pressed against her ears—not the muffled quiet of water, but something deeper, a silence that felt woven, intentional. [114] This place had been sacred once. [120] It remembered. [122]

Her mother's journal had described it: the Temple of Ephemera, where priests had learned to capture fleeting things—a child's laugh, the precise gold of a sunset, a lover's last breath. [150] They had stored these fragments in crystal vials, perfume bottles that held not scent but sensation. [167] One vial in particular had consumed Mira's thoughts for three years: the one her mother had sought before her own dive into these depths, the one that touches memories and could restore what dementia had stolen. [204]

Her mother had never surfaced. [209]

The gauge ticked to red. [214] Twelve minutes. [216]

Mira swam deeper, her headlamp cutting through the blue darkness. [226] The temple's inner sanctum opened before her—a circular chamber with alcoves carved into every surface, and in each alcove, the gleam of crystal. [250] Hundreds of vials. [253] Thousands. [254] An archive of the ephemeral, preserved in glass and magic and the gathered hush that kept this place suspended outside of time. [275]

Her chest tightened—not from pressure, but from the impossibility of the task. [287] How could she find one specific vial among thousands? [296]

Then she saw the bones. [301]

In the center of the chamber, a skeleton lay curled on the mosaic floor, one hand extended toward a fallen vial that had rolled just out of reach. [330] Around the figure's wrist: a bracelet of copper and turquoise that Mira had last seen on her mother's arm. [350]

Nine minutes. [352]

The instinct to flee screamed through her nerves—to surface, to breathe, to live. [365] But Mira forced herself still. [370] By overriding instinct, she could think. [376] By thinking, she could understand. [381]

Her mother had been so close. [387] The vial she'd reached for must have been the right one—but why had it mattered so much? [403] Her mother's dementia had already advanced by then, her memories a tangled knot of confusion and loss. [420] Mira's own childhood had been buried somewhere in that knot—her first steps, her first words, the sound of her mother singing lullabies that Mira could no longer recall. [449]

She reached for the crystal perfume vial with trembling fingers. [459]

The moment she touched it, images flooded her mind: her mother young and laughing, cradling an infant with dark curls, singing something soft and ancient about stars and sleeping. [488] The vial didn't store memories—it found them in the chaos of a fading mind and brought them forward. [506]

Her mother had come here to unsnarl what the disease had knotted, to find the threads of their shared past before they vanished forever. [529]

Six minutes. [531]

Mira understood now. [534] To harness the ephemeral wasn't to trap it—it was to honor it, to witness it fully before it dissolved. [553] She pressed the vial to her heart and felt the lullaby humming through her, note by note, memory by memory. [573]

Her mother's voice, finally returned. [578]

The temple's gathered hush seemed to deepen, not with emptiness but with reverence, as though the sacred space recognized what was being reclaimed. [601] Mira looked at the bones one last time, then began her ascent. [613]

The rescue lights flickered at the surface—distant, but approaching. [622] She would make it. [626] She would carry the song back into the world above, where her mother's body still breathed in a sterile room, waiting for a voice she no longer possessed to reach her through the fog. [660]

The crystal vial glowed faintly in Mira's grip, warm despite the cold depth—a small vessel of lonesome splendor, holding everything that mattered and nothing that could last. [691] But that was the nature of the ephemeral. [699] Not permanence. [701] Presence. [702]

And for now—for these few remaining minutes, these few remaining years—presence would be enough. [716]
