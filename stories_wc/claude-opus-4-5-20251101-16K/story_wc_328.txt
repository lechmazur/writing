Elena had spent three months underground, posing as an apprentice to Old Margit in her impossible garden. [17] The real work happened when Margit slept—Elena documented everything for the Cryptid Research Institute, cataloging phenomena that shouldn't exist. [35] The garden defied physics in ways that made her scientific mind ache. [46] Seeds floated upward until they decided to root in soil clinging to the ceiling. [59] Water pooled in midair, gravitationally playful, forming tiny hovering oceans that drifted between frostbitten stalks of lavender. [74]

She'd come here after the missing return changed everything—after Margit's son reappeared at his mother's door, unaged despite seven vanished years. [95] The Institute noticed. [98] Elena volunteered. [100]

The flint arrowhead came later. [105] She found it pressed into the ceiling-soil, ancient and sharp, pointing down at the exact spot where she'd positioned her recording equipment—an old cordless phone rigged to capture frequencies the garden emitted. [138] Static-laden confessions came through that phone each night. [147] Some voices were human. [151] Some decidedly weren't. [154]

Tonight, Margit's voice crackled through the receiver: "I never wanted the garden. [166] It chose me after my bitterness grew so large I thought I'd drown in it. [181] My husband left. [184] My son vanished. [187] The earth swallowed my anger and made it grow backward." [197]

Elena pressed the phone closer, her breath crystallizing in the perpetual cold of the underground chamber. [213] Frostbitten hope—that's what this place offered. [220] A wounded kind of possibility. [225]

"I wanted to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke," Margit continued, though she slept two chambers away, though she'd never spoken these words aloud. [247] The phone captured something deeper than sound. [254] "If the universe could take everything from me, I'd give it something back. [267] I'd make gravity forget which way was down. [276] I'd make time forget how to move forward. [285] My son would return, unchanged, and it would be the strangest miracle." [297]

The static intensified. [300] Elena felt the arrowhead vibrate in her pocket—she'd taken it from the ceiling earlier, a mistake she was beginning to understand. [320] It had been a seal. [325] A warning. [327]

The garden began to metamorphose around her. [334] Roots unwound from their spirals and reached toward her like curious fingers. [346] The air thickened with frozen mint and something older, wilder. [356] She witnessed a harmony untamed—not chaos, but a pattern written before physics had words for falling. [372] The garden wasn't defying natural law; it was obeying rules from somewhere beyond. [385]

Elena understood, suddenly, why the Institute had really sent her. [395] Not to document. [398] To retrieve. [400] They wanted the secret of Margit's transformed space, wanted to weaponize grief turned inside out. [414]

The phone crackled again: "You could stay." [422]

This voice was younger. [426] The son, perhaps. [429] Or what had returned wearing his face. [436]

"You could let the bitterness go too. [443] Let gravity play with you instead of pinning you down. [454] The arrowhead was mine once, before time forgot me. [464] It points toward whoever holds the heaviest heart." [473]

Elena looked down. [476] The arrowhead had rotated in her hand, pointing directly at her chest. [488]

She thought of her own calcified bitterness—the funding cuts, the ridicule, colleagues who called cryptid research a joke. [505] She'd wanted to prove them wrong so badly it had frozen into something sharp and cold inside her. [522]

But standing in Margit's garden, watching lavender bloom upside-down and water bead into tiny suspended seas, Elena felt that bitterness begin to thaw. [546] Not disappear—metamorphose. [548] If the universe was this strange, this gravitationally playful, then maybe there was room for wonder alongside the wound. [566]

She placed the arrowhead back into the ceiling-soil. [575] The roots released her gently. [580] The static on the phone dissolved into something that might have been laughter, or wind, or both. [596]

When Elena left the underground garden at dawn, she carried no recordings, no evidence for the Institute. [612] She carried only the static-laden confession still echoing in her bones: that some harmonies couldn't be tamed, only joined. [630] That some returns from the missing places changed not just the one who left, but everyone who chose to believe in the strangeness. [653]

The Institute would call her a failure. [660] Her cryptid research career would end in disgrace. [669] But walking into the cold morning light, Elena found herself smiling at the cosmic joke of it all—the bitterness finally transformed into something absurd and beautiful and free. [697]

She called it the beginning. [702]
