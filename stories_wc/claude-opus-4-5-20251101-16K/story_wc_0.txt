Dr. Elena Voss studied the remnants of things. [7] For fifteen years, she had analyzed neutron stars—the collapsed cores of dead suns, spinning impossibly fast, their surfaces so dense that a teaspoon would weigh billions of tons. [36] She preprocessed reality through equations, filtering the universe into data streams before it could reach her unarmored. [51]

After the flood, she returned to her mother's greenhouse. [60]

The storm had come three weeks ago. [67] Elena had watched the news from her office at the observatory, four states away, while running simulations on magnetar decay rates. [88] Her mother's voicemails accumulated like sediment—worried, then practical, then quiet. [98] By the time Elena arrived, her mother had already moved to the assisted living facility they'd been arguing about for two years. [118] The flood had decided things. [123]

The greenhouse listed slightly to one side, its aluminum frame bent where the water had surged through. [139] Elena picked her way across waterlogged soil, past toppled ceramic pots, past the wreckage of her mother's thirty years of patient cultivation. [159]

She had come to strip needless drama from the situation. [169] Assess damage, file insurance claims, arrange demolition. [176] She did not want to feel; she wanted to process. [186]

But the dust stopped her. [191]

On every remaining surface—the warped wooden benches, the cracked glass panels, the few surviving orchid pots—there were patterns. [209] Layers of silt from the floodwater, yes, but also something finer. [220] Something iridescent in the late afternoon light. [227]

Elena bent closer to a bench where her mother had once taught her to transplant seedlings. [242] The dust shimmered faintly: blues and greens and golds. [251] She touched it, and it smeared across her fingertip like a whisper. [263]

Butterfly wing dust. [266]

The greenhouse had always attracted them. [272] Her mother had called them her informal pollinators, had planted specific flowers to draw painted ladies and monarchs through the open vents. [293] The flood must have caught them here, trapped them. [302] The water's violence had left only this: the microscopic scales from their wings, accumulated now in patterns that traced the water's retreat, marking where the butterflies had struggled and finally surrendered. [334]

Elena stood very still. [338]

She had spent her career studying decay—the gradual, magnificent death of massive stars. [351] It took millions of years for a neutron star to cool, spinning slower and slower until it became invisible against the void. [372] She had always found comfort in those timescales. [381] Human drama seemed trivial against epochs. [387]

But here was decay she could hold in her palm. [397] Here was gradual change measured in wing-beats, in flood tides, in her mother's arthritis and fading memory. [413] Through accumulated dust patterns, she began to understand what she had been preprocessing away. [426] Her mother had spent decades here, coaxing life from soil, watching butterflies land on her shoulders. [440] Elena had seen it as a hobby, something to discuss briefly on phone calls before returning to her important work. [458]

Now the greenhouse was teaching her about stellar collapse. [467] Not the physics—she knew those cold. [474] But the weight of it. [479] How something enormous could compress into something small and dense and final. [491] How light could fade so gradually that you didn't notice until you were standing in darkness. [507]

Humility kindled in her chest, unfamiliar and warm. [515]

She sat down on the buckled bench, ignoring the dampness seeping through her clothes. [528] The afternoon light caught the butterfly dust again, turning it briefly luminous. [540] She thought about her mother in the facility, waiting. [549] About all the calls she hadn't returned. [556] About how she had studied dead stars while living ones dimmed around her. [568]

The greenhouse creaked softly in the wind. [575] Somewhere, a surviving plant was pushing a green shoot through the mud, beginning again. [588]

Elena pulled out her phone. [593] Not to document damage. [597] Not to file claims. [601]

Her mother answered on the second ring. [608]

"I'm at the greenhouse," Elena said, and her voice cracked on the last word, all her careful preprocessing finally failing. [627] "Tell me about the butterflies. [632] Tell me everything." [635]

In the silence before her mother spoke, Elena felt the universe compress: vast and small, ancient and immediate, collapsing into this single, humble moment. [659]
