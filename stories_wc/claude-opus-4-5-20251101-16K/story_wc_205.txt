The baroque asteroid turned slowly in the void, its carved spires catching starlight that had traveled millennia. [17]

Maren pressed the crystal vase shard against her palm until it left a crescent mark. [32] She was a defunct revolutionary now, her causes scattered like the temporal debris that drifted past the observatory windows. [51] Once she had rallied millions on three worlds. [59] Now she catalogued fragments of a dead people who had built their civilization into the body of this wandering stone. [79]

The shard had been part of a funeral vessel, she was certain. [91] The Academic Council disagreed. [95] They called it decorative, mundane, meaningless—another baroque flourish from a culture obsessed with ornamentation. [110] This was the heart of their archaeological dispute: whether the Carvers, as scholars named them, had possessed spiritual depth or merely aesthetic excess. [133]

Maren knew what she saw in the crystal's fractured planes. [143] Poetry. [144] Grief encoded in angles. [148]

Since time had become visible three centuries ago—bleeding into reality as amber light, pooling in corners, streaming from moments of intensity—the universe had changed. [174] Here on the asteroid, temporal accumulation clung to the Carvers' abandoned temples like luminous moss. [189] Their grief still glowed. [193]

A storm was building. [197] Maren could see it through the dome: time itself churning in the vacuum, a maelstrom of golden luminescence that would sweep across the asteroid within the hour. [224] She moved through the research station, covering mirrors during storms as protocol demanded. [237] The reflective surfaces could trap and amplify temporal resonance, creating loops that drove researchers to madness or scattered their consciousness across decades. [259]

As she draped the last cloth, she caught her reflection briefly—older than she remembered, eyes holding the burnished sorrow of someone who had lost more than she could name. [289] The revolution had failed. [293] Her daughter had died in the purges that followed. [302] She had come here to forget, but the Carvers would not let her. [315]

Their civilization called to her. [320] Not the civilization the Council described—cold artisans serving wealthy patrons—but something deeper. [334] She wanted to reimagine an entire civilization, to restore their humanity through proper interpretation of what they had left behind. [354]

The shard caught temporal light and refracted it into a spectrum she had never seen. [369]

Maren began to devise her approach. [375] She would need evidence the Council could not dismiss. [384] The Carvers had built their tombs deep in the asteroid's core, where baroque columns supported chambers carved with scenes of mourning. [405] She had photographed every surface, but photographs proved nothing to minds already decided. [418]

She would need to show them time itself. [426]

The storm struck as she gathered her equipment. [434] Golden light poured through the dome, and the station groaned with resonance. [446] Behind their coverings, the mirrors hummed. [452] Maren waited, gripping the shard, remembering how her daughter had loved to recite poetry on nights when the protests grew quiet. [473]

The storm passed. [476]

In the core chambers, she found what she needed. [485] The funeral vessels—intact ones, cousins to her shard—held captured time within their crystal matrices. [501] Not decorative. [503] Memorial. [504] The Carvers had preserved the final moments of their beloved dead, encoding grief into geometric precision. [520]

Maren lifted one vessel to the light. [527] Inside, amber luminescence shifted: a child running, a parent reaching, a moment of joy crystallized against oblivion. [544]

She was poetically inclined enough to recognize what the Council could not. [556] These were not ornaments. [560] They were prayers. [563]

She drafted her report through the night, words flowing like the temporal currents outside. [577] She described a civilization that had faced extinction and responded not with warfare but with beauty—a people who had carved their asteroid into a cathedral of remembrance. [605]

The Council would dispute her findings. [611] They always did. [614] But Maren had been a revolutionary once, and revolutionaries understood that truth required patience, persistence, and occasionally the shattering of old vessels to reveal what waited inside. [641]

She placed the shard on her desk beside the report. [651] Outside, the baroque spires caught starlight, and time drifted past in luminous ribbons, carrying echoes of everyone who had ever loved and lost and tried to make that loss mean something. [682]

The defunct revolutionary slept, dreaming of the civilization she would give back to the universe—not as the Council imagined them, but as they had truly been: artists of grief, architects of memory, poets whose language was light and stone and sorrow. [724]

In the morning, she would begin again. [731]
