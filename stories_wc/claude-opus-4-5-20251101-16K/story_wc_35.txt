The desert fortress stood silent after rain, its ancient stones darkened and glistening. [12] Marek woke at the close of an unspoken dream—one he'd carried for years but never given voice to—and knew today was the day. [38]

He was a chef who could taste memories. [46] Every ingredient he touched revealed its history: sun-warmed days in olive oil, grief in salt, the quiet joy of harvest in ripe tomatoes. [69] But his gift came with a curse—he was emotionally contagious through touch, passing his feelings to anyone whose skin met his. [90] So he wore gloves always, and cooked alone. [98]

The rain had exposed what he'd spent months seeking: an entrance to the coral icebound pavilion beneath the dunes. [116] Impossible, they'd said. [119] Coral in a desert. [123] Ice that never melts. [127] But the ancient texts described it precisely—a sanctuary where mariners once deposited their stored remorse before long voyages, so grief wouldn't weigh down their ships. [152]

Marek climbed down through wet sand and stone, his lantern catching on frost that shouldn't exist. [167] The pavilion emerged from darkness: coral columns encased in ice so clear it sang when touched, chambers carved by tides that had retreated millennia ago. [193]

He set to work analyzing tidal pool formations preserved in the ice—each pool a frozen record of emotion, sediment layered by centuries of deposited guilt. [218] The formations told him where the densest memories lay. [227] His fingers traced the patterns, reading them like recipes. [236]

His motivation was simple: to sandpaper rough memories. [244] His own, first. [247] Then others'. [249] The memories that cut when recalled, that woke people at night with their jagged edges. [263] If he could taste them, could he smooth them? [272] Make them bearable? [275]

He found the deepest pool, knelt, and placed his bare hand against the ice. [288]

The remorse subsumed him. [292]

A thousand regrets at once—sailors who left families, captains who made wrong choices, lovers who spoke cruel last words. [310] The grief flooded through him, and he tasted it all: copper and ash, sea-rot and something sweet like spoiled fruit. [331] His curse activated; had anyone touched him now, they'd have drowned in borrowed sorrow. [345]

But he was alone. [349] That was the point. [353]

Marek let the remorse settle, layer by layer, the way flour settles in water. [367] He felt for the rough edges—the sharp corners of memory where shame concentrated. [380] These he worked at, tasting each one, understanding its specific pain, then gently, gently eroding it. [395] Not erasing. [397] Smoothing. [398] The memory would remain, but dulled, handleable. [405]

Hours passed. [407] The ice wept around him as it slowly melted, releasing its prisoners. [419]

He found his own remorse among the ancient deposits—not placed here, but resonating. [432] His mother's face when he'd left. [438] The meal he'd cooked that failed. [444] The lover whose hand he couldn't hold. [451] These too he subsumed, letting them merge with the vast ocean of human regret until his own grief became small against the tide. [475]

The coral columns began to groan. [481] Without its stored remorse, the pavilion had nothing to preserve. [491] The ice cracked. [494] Marek gathered himself, climbed back through the passage, emerged into a desert fortress transformed by morning light. [510]

The rain had moved on. [515] The dunes were already burying the entrance again. [523]

He flexed his hands—still gloved, still dangerous—but lighter now. [532] The dreams he'd never spoken of felt distant, smooth-edged, like beach glass worn by years of waves. [549]

In his kitchen, Marek began to cook. [556] He cracked eggs that tasted of farmyard mornings, chopped onions that wept with their own small griefs. [572] He would feed the fortress guards today, and they would taste something they couldn't name—a meal seasoned with forgiveness, with the sturdy brittle hope of things that break but keep their shape. [606]

The pavilion was gone, subsumed by sand and time. [615] But somewhere in the taste of breakfast, its mercy lingered. [625]
