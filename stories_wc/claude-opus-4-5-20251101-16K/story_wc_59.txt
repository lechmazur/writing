The palace swayed gently in the eternal darkness, its crystalline spires groaning against the chains that bound them to the stalactites overhead. [22] Prince Aldric hadn't bathed in weeks, hadn't trimmed his beard in months. [33] His robes hung in tatters, stained with alchemical residue and the grime of obsession. [46]

He worked by the light of bioluminescent fungi he'd cultivated along the walls, their blue-green glow casting his laboratory in the hues of old dreams. [72] Around him, the suspended palace anchored to giant stalactites creaked like a ship at sea, reminding him always that everything here hung by threads—including hope. [99]

"If the feathers are memory," he murmured, scratching notes onto parchment already crowded with scrawl, "then the bones must be intention." [119] This was his method: hypothesizing about everything. [126] Every assumption examined. [128] Every mystery dissected into smaller mysteries. [133] Above, in the world of gears and steam-powered hearts, they'd stopped asking questions. [146] They'd stopped wondering. [149]

The mechanical world had no use for wonder. [157]

Aldric lifted the extinct bird's egg from its velvet cradle, turning it beneath the fungal light. [172] The shell was the color of old ivory, veined with hairline fractures that had appeared over centuries. [189] The phoenix-thrush had died out three hundred years ago, hunted for feathers that supposedly granted visions. [205] This egg was the last remaining piece of a species that had once filled the skies with songs so beautiful they made children weep with unnamed longing. [233]

He meant to bring it back. [239] Not the species—he wasn't that ambitious. [246] Just one bird. [249] One voice. [251] One proof that beauty could exist again. [258]

The bedraggled prince began to assemble the apparatus he'd spent seven years designing. [271] Crystal resonators clicked into brass housings. [277] Copper wires threaded through chambers filled with distilled moonlight, smuggled down from the surface at tremendous cost. [294] A mechanical heartbeat—ironic, using the enemy's tools—would pulse warmth into the dormant egg. [308]

But something more was needed. [313] Something science couldn't provide. [317]

"Hypothesize," he whispered. [320] "What makes genesis work?" [324] "What transforms stillness into life?" [329]

His hands trembled as he worked. [335] The palace shuddered around him, and for a moment the reverie that had sustained him through years of solitude threatened to shatter. [357] Fear moved through him like an earthquake through stone. [367]

He placed the egg in the central chamber. [375] He connected the final wire. [380]

And then, because he had no better hypothesis, Prince Aldric began to sing. [393]

His voice was terrible—cracked, unpracticed. [399] But he sang the old songs his mother had sung before the mechanical plague took her, before gears replaced hearts throughout the kingdom, before he'd fled to this hanging sanctuary beneath the earth. [433]

The egg glowed. [436]

Then it cracked. [439]

What emerged was not a phoenix-thrush. [446] The creature had too many wings—three instead of two—and its feathers shifted through colors that had no names. [465] One eye was larger than the other. [472] Its song, when it opened its beak, was bitterly sweet: achingly beautiful but touched with discord, like a perfect melody played on an instrument slightly out of tune. [502]

Aldric wept. [504]

A flawed genesis. [507] The bird that should not be, born from extinction and desperate hope and imperfect science. [522] He had achieved his aim to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world, but the beauty itself was wounded by the imperfect means of its creation. [547]

The creature hopped onto his shoulder, nestling against his matted hair. [558] It sang its broken-perfect song. [563]

"You're wrong," Aldric said, though he wasn't sure if he was speaking to himself or the bird or the mechanical world above. [584] "You're wrong and you're beautiful and perhaps that's enough." [594]

Through the discovery, he had learned something the mechanical world had forgotten: perfection wasn't the point. [609] The flaw was what made it precious. [616] The ache was what made the sweetness matter. [624]

Above, gears turned in their soulless precision. [631] Below, in a palace suspended from stalactites in eternal night, a prince held a creature that shouldn't exist while it sang songs that broke and healed his heart in equal measure. [662]

He would show them. [666] He would carry this flawed, magnificent life back to the surface. [677] He would remind them what they'd surrendered when they chose efficiency over wonder. [689]

But not yet. [692] For now, he listened, trembling in quaking reverie, to something no one had heard in three hundred years: the voice of beginning, imperfect and irreplaceable. [717]
