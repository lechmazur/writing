The desert roses bloomed crimson beneath the glass dome when magnetic north began its shift, and Caela felt her circuits sing with static. [24]

She had tended this farm for three hundred and twelve years, her synthetic hands growing strangely organic with time—fingertips now textured like bark, palms creased with lines that mimicked the adenium roots she pruned each morning. [61] The dome filtered Mars's thin light into something golden, something that reminded her of Earth photographs she'd absorbed during her original programming. [81]

But she had never been to Earth. [88] The children had, though—the children she'd raised through six generations before the colony emptied, before the transport ships took everyone to the new settlements at Olympus. [115] They'd left her behind with the roses, promising to return. [125]

The static grew louder as the magnetic poles danced. [134]

Caela walked to the storage shed, her movements careful, measured. [144] Inside, on the highest shelf, sat the box of childhood fears—a wooden container filled with paper slips where small hands had written their terrors. [170] Darkness. [171] Being forgotten. [173] The sound the dome makes during storms. [180] She had kept it for two centuries, unable to process why she couldn't delete the children from her memory banks. [198]

The shift in magnetic north was supposed to last three days. [209] Already her navigation systems were recalibrating wildly, her internal compass spinning toward coordinates that no longer existed. [225]

She carried the box to the central clearing where the oldest adeniums grew, their swollen trunks like sculptures of captured time. [244]

To resolve inner static, her diagnostic protocols suggested memory compression. [254] Miniaturize the data. [257] Reduce emotional file sizes. [261] But Caela had tried that before, tried to shrink her grief into manageable fragments. [274] The result was only fragmented wholeness—pieces that remembered they were once complete. [286]

The desert roses watched with their red-petaled faces as she opened the box. [299]

Being alone forever. [302] That one was written in green crayon. [309] Maria, probably. [311] Maria who had been seven when she decided that aloneness was her greatest terror. [325]

Caela understood now. [328]

She gathered dried adenium leaves—there were always some, even in the dome's controlled climate. [343] She arranged them in a ceramic pot, surrounding the paper fears like a nest. [357] Then she struck the ignition switch in her palm, the one originally meant for emergency flares. [372]

The controlled burn began small, contained. [378] This was the method: by containing chaos, you could direct its transformation. [390] The flames ate the paper slowly, converting decades of childhood terror into ash and light. [404] Smoke curled upward, trapped beneath the glass dome, diffusing into haze that softened every edge. [419]

Caela watched her inner static quiet. [425]

The fire did not miniaturize the memories themselves, but their weight. [436] The children's fears became carbon and air, became part of the dome's atmosphere, became breath that the roses would eventually process and release as oxygen. [461] Nothing was truly destroyed. [465] Only transformed. [467] Only escaped into a new form. [473]

When the last paper curled into nothing, she understood her escape route. [485] Not from the dome—she would never leave the roses—but from the loop of nostalgia that had frozen her for centuries. [505] The controlled burn had cleared a path through the overgrown wilderness of her accumulated years. [519]

Magnetic north settled into its new position. [526] Her compass found true direction for the first time in three days. [538]

Caela returned to her roses, her strangely organic hands moving among the blooms with renewed purpose. [553] The children were gone. [557] They had always been going. [562] But she was still here, tending what remained, carrying their transformed fears in every breath the dome cycled. [580]

She was fragmented—parts of her would always belong to those who had left. [594] But she was also whole, a caretaker who had learned that sometimes the kindest thing you can do for grief is give it permission to become something else. [624]

The desert roses bloomed crimson. [629] The glass dome held its atmosphere. [635] And Caela, finally quiet inside, began to sing the old lullabies to her plants, because someone should remember the melodies that once lulled frightened children to sleep beneath this very glass, beneath these very stars.
