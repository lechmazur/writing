The world had automated creativity three decades ago, and Meris had been an underachieving mage ever since. [17]

She climbed through clouds toward the icebound spire, using the old method—mist walking—placing her feet on vapor and prayer. [38]

The spell-engines below could generate a thousand poems per second, paint ten thousand paintings, conjure castles from pure algorithmic precision. [58]

But they couldn't do this: walk on nothing, sustained by intention alone. [70]

The spire emerged above the cloud sea, crystalline and ancient. [80]

It accommodates impossibilities, her grandmother had said. [87]

Things that shouldn't work, things the engines can't calculate. [96]

In her pack was the garden folly keystone—a carved stone from her grandmother's garden, the last piece of a decorative arch that once framed roses. [122]

The garden was gone now, paved over for processing centers. [132]

But this stone held what her grandmother called lingering luminance: light that refused to fade, magic absorbed from decades of simple joy. [154]

She reached the spire's base and began to unstrap her pack. [165]

Her fingers were numb, but she worked carefully. [173]

The keystone emerged into the strange light of this place—neither day nor night, but brilliant dimness, as if the sun and stars were both present and veiled. [201]

The Guild had labeled her underachieving because she couldn't interface with the engines. [214]

Her spells were small—making tea warm without fire, helping seeds grow, finding lost things. [229]

"Inefficient," they said. [232]

"Unscalable." [233]

But her grandmother had understood. [238]

The sacred is in the simple, child. [245]

Don't let them automate your soul. [251]

The spire's interior was hollow, a cathedral of ice. [260]

At its center stood an altar of frozen light, waiting. [270]

Meris placed the keystone upon it. [276]

Nothing happened. [278]

Then everything did. [281]

The lingering luminance within the stone awakened. [288]

Not light, exactly, but memory—her grandmother's hands in soil, the scent of rain-wet roses, the sound of her humming while she worked. [311]

These simple moments, stored in stone over thirty years, unfolded into the space. [324]

The spire accommodated this impossibility: emotion made visible, joy given form. [335]

She understood then why the old mages built follies in gardens. [346]

Not for decoration—for collection. [351]

Each stone absorbed the sacred moments of ordinary life, holding them against the day when such things might be forgotten. [371]

The engines below could generate spectacle. [377]

They could automate wonder. [381]

But they couldn't manufacture this—the holiness of a grandmother's garden, the grace of simple things loved well. [399]

The luminance spread through the ice, gentle and persistent. [408]

It would take decades to fade, if it ever did. [418]

Meris sat in the brilliant dimness, watching her grandmother's joy illuminate the ancient spire. [432]

She was still an underachieving mage by Guild standards. [441]

Her spells remained small. [445]

But she had walked on mist to reach a place above the clouds. [458]

She had carried a stone for thirty years. [466]

She had found what the engines could not create and what the algorithms could not calculate: meaning made from the simple act of loving small things well. [493]

The automation had consumed the world's creativity, but it couldn't touch this. [505]

Some light lingers because it was never meant for efficiency. [515]

Some magic resists scaling because its power lies precisely in its smallness. [527]

She stayed in the spire until the light settled into the ice, permanent now. [541]

Then she strapped the empty pack to her shoulders—the keystone had become part of this place—and began the long walk down through the clouds. [567]

There were other gardens once. [572]

Other follies. [574]

Other stones that might hold lingering luminance. [581]

The sacred was waiting in simple places, and she was the only one still looking. [596]

Below, the engines hummed and generated, produced and automated. [605]

Above, the spire held thirty years of morning light in a grandmother's garden. [618]

Meris walked on mist, underachieving and unstoppable, carrying nothing but intention toward the next small sacred thing. [635]
