The orchard shouldn't have survived the liquidation, yet apple trees grew thick and heavy with fruit where nothing else lived for three hundred miles. [25]

Vera Chen had made her career exposing the lies people clung to—viral hoaxes, medical fraud, doomsday cults that dissolved under scrutiny. [44]

But this assignment brought her to the edge of the Meridian Wasteland, where radioactive dust storms scoured the earth and locals whispered about a cursed diamond that kept the orchard alive. [72]

She stood at the perimeter fence, sharply observant eyes tracking the way dust devils died at the orchard's edge, dissipating into nothing as if striking an invisible wall. [100]

The survivors who tended the trees lived in corrugated shelters between the rows, their faces weathered but unmarked by radiation sickness. [119]

They called the diamond the Shepherd's Flaw—a massive stone, cracked through its center, mounted on a concrete pillar at the orchard's heart. [141]

"Touch it and you'll wither," an old woman named Elka warned her. [152]

Vera smiled and wrote that down. [158]

After the liquidation of Meridian Corp three years ago, the region had been declared uninhabitable. [172]

The company's executives had scattered with their severance packages while their workers inherited poison. [185]

Yet here was this pocket of impossible life, and the only explanation offered was magic. [199]

That was exactly the kind of comfortable lie Vera had trained herself to excavate truth from. [214]

She found the shredded documents in the abandoned administration building, half a mile into the dead zone. [230]

The filing cabinets had been emptied, but someone had been careless with the shredder—bags of paper strips left behind when the helicopters came. [253]

Vera spread them across her workstation and began reassembling shredded letters, strip by strip, her gloved fingers patient and precise. [272]

Hours passed. [274]

The dust storm howled outside but didn't enter the building, and she noted that too—the stillness here, as if something pushed the chaos away. [298]

By lantern light, she pieced together memos, technical specifications, a geological survey. [311]

The word appeared again and again: stillpoint. [318]

She began to intuit the shape of something larger. [327]

The survey described a natural phenomenon—a geomagnetic anomaly beneath the orchard that created a zone of electromagnetic calm. [345]

Meridian Corp had discovered this hidden stillpoint and built their facility around it, using its properties to stabilize experimental processes. [364]

The diamond wasn't cursed; it was a marker, placed to identify the phenomenon's center. [378]

Its flaw—the crack running through it—had been artificially created as a calibration tool for their instruments. [394]

The curse was invented later, by company lawyers who wanted to keep the surviving workers contained and quiet. [412]

If people believed the stillpoint was supernatural protection, they wouldn't demand scientific investigation into why they hadn't died. [429]

They wouldn't sue. [432]

They wouldn't ask why only this one location had been mysteriously shielded while the surrounding population suffered. [448]

Vera photographed each reconstructed page. [453]

The evidence was damning: Meridian had known about the stillpoint for decades and had deliberately kept it classified. [470]

They could have used it to protect the workers, to create evacuation zones, to save lives. [486]

Instead, they'd hoarded it, and when the disaster came, they'd let the mythology grow rather than admit what they'd hidden. [505]

She returned to the orchard as the storm died, finding Elka waiting beneath the Shepherd's Flaw. [521]

The cracked diamond caught the pale light, and Vera saw now what her sharply observant eyes had missed before—instrumentation grooves cut into the pillar, scientific precision masquerading as sacred geometry. [555]

"It's not a curse," Vera said. [561]

She explained the stillpoint, the corporate cover-up, the deliberate mythology. [571]

Elka listened without expression. [575]

When Vera finished, the old woman touched the diamond, running her fingers along its fatal flaw. [590]

"We knew," Elka said quietly. [595]

"Some of us found papers too, years ago." [603]

Vera stared. [605]

"Then why maintain the lie?" [610]

"Because the truth brought lawyers and journalists and government men, and they all wanted to take our stillpoint away, study it, own it." [632]

Elka's eyes were ancient, tired, and sharp. [639]

"The curse keeps us safe from them. Let them think we're fools who believe in magic. We'll keep our orchard." [658]

Vera understood then that truth was just another tool, and these survivors had learned to wield comfortable lies as protection against those who would exploit them further. [686]

She packed her evidence, her photographs, her reconstructed letters. [694]

She had come to debunk a conspiracy and found instead that the conspiracy had layers—corporate greed beneath, then myth, then a deeper pragmatism she hadn't expected. [722]

As she left the hidden stillpoint behind, the dust began to rise again, and the orchard stood green and impossible against the wasteland, keeping its secrets in the shadow of a flawed diamond that had never been cursed at all. [766]
