Mira Thorne had spent twenty years proving that magic was merely misunderstood physics, that monsters were just shadows cast by ordinary fear. [23] She was the myth buster who'd exposed the Singing Stones of Avalon as wind-carved limestone and the Oracle of Chennai as an elaborate acoustic trick. [46] But now she sat in the dome of an abandoned observatory on a cliff, cradling a painted seashell in her weathered hands, trying to decode a universal riddle she'd spent her whole life pretending didn't exist. [84]

The seashell had belonged to her grandmother—cobalt blue with golden spirals painted by fingers now thirty years in the grave. [103] "It points the way," her grandmother had whispered, pressing it into eight-year-old Mira's palm. [118] "But only when you're ready to believe." [125]

For decades, Mira had dismissed this as senility wrapped in sentiment. [136] She was not ready to believe. [142] She was constitutionally opposed to belief. [148]

Yet here she was. [152]

The observatory's telescope had long since been stripped for parts, leaving only the empty socket of the rotating dome and the skeletal remains of someone's abandoned research. [178] Among the debris, Mira had found it: a half-finished cello, its body incomplete but its strings still taut with waiting. [199]

She drew her bow across them now, and the resonant hums rose into the salt-thick air. [216] This was her method—always had been—the strange gift that made her the best debunker in the business. [233] Through those vibrations, she could reimagine past conversations, could retell them to herself as though they were happening fresh. [252] Most people heard only discordant notes. [258] Mira heard voices. [261]

"The compass appears at endings," her grandmother said, her voice curling from the cello's hollow body. [277] "Inside the whisper of closing pages." [283]

Mira's hands trembled but kept moving. [289] "You never explained what that meant, Nana." [297]

"Some riddles answer themselves. [301] You just have to stop running long enough to listen." [311]

The hums shifted, and suddenly it was her colleague, Dr. Farrell, from six months ago: "The satellite data doesn't lie, Mira. [332] There's a pattern in the cosmic background radiation. [340] Something's pointing at us. [344] At this cliff, specifically." [348]

"Pointing implies intention," the cello-memory of Mira replied. [356] "Cosmic coincidence is not a compass." [362]

"Isn't it, though? [365] Maybe the ephemeral compass isn't an object. [372] Maybe it's a direction that only exists for a moment—a possibility that vanishes the instant you stop looking." [391]

She'd laughed at him then. [396] She wasn't laughing now. [400]

The painted seashell in her palm had begun to glow—faintly, stubbornly, like hope refusing to be extinguished. [417] The golden spirals seemed to rotate, pointing toward the open slot in the dome where the telescope once peered at infinity. [437]

Mira followed its direction with her eyes. [444] The stars were emerging, and among them, one pulsed with a rhythm that matched the cello's hums. [462] She played faster, and the conversations overlapped—her grandmother, her mother, colleagues and strangers and half-remembered dreams—all retelling the same riddle in different words. [486]

What speaks without voice? [490] What points without direction? [494] What is found only when the finding is done? [503]

The answer rose in her chest like a tide: nothing. [513] Everything. [514] The space between the two. [519]

The ephemeral compass wasn't meant to lead somewhere. [527] It was meant to mark where you already stood—to illuminate, just for the whisper-length moment before the pages closed, that you had always been exactly where you needed to be. [559]

The glow faded. [562] The stars returned to their ordinary silence. [569] The cello string snapped with a sound like goodbye. [578]

Mira laughed—a wet, broken sound, halfway between grief and joy. [589] Twenty years of tearing down mysteries, and here was one she couldn't touch, couldn't explain, didn't want to. [607]

"Alright, Nana," she whispered, tucking the cooling seashell into her pocket. [618] "You win." [620]

She descended the cliff as dawn crept over the water, a myth buster walking away from the only myth that ever mattered, carrying nothing but a painted shell and the gloomy cheerfulness of someone who had finally stopped running. [660]

Some riddles, it turned out, were not meant to be solved. [671]

Only lived. [673]
