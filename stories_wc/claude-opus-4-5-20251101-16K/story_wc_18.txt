In the ruined orchard district, where fog had settled like grief for three hundred years, Vesna practiced her trade among the ghost-white trees. [24] She was a mirror maker, perhaps the last one, and she was firmly grounded in her craft despite the unreality that pressed against her workshop windows each morning. [50]

Tonight was different. [53] Upon the shimmer of twilight frost, when ice crystals began their slow descent through the perpetual mist, Vesna finally understood what she had to do. [76]

The dream had escaped her seventeen years ago. [84] She had dreamed of her father one night—his face, his hands teaching her to polish glass, the particular way he hummed while working—and when she woke, the dream had fled through the gap beneath her door, a ribbon of silver light that vanished into the orchard's fog. [129] Without it, she could no longer remember his face clearly. [139] The boundaries between memory and forgetting had blurred, leaving only ache. [150]

She had spent those seventeen years learning to capture such things. [161]

On her workbench lay an astronomer's broken sextant, salvaged from the fog years ago. [175] Its owner had been the last person to try navigating out of the district before Vesna was born. [192] He had failed, of course—the fog erased all celestial boundaries, made every direction identical to every other—but his instrument remained. [213] Vesna had repaired what she could, replacing cracked mirrors with her own superior glass, polishing the brass until it gleamed like captured sunlight. [235]

Tonight, she would use it to recreate what she had lost. [246]

The fog pressed against her windows, patient as always. [255] Beyond the frosted glass, the ruined orchard stretched in all directions, its dead apple trees reaching upward like supplicants. [273] The tone of this place had always reminded her of glass mountains—beautiful, treacherous, prone to shattering. [289]

She stepped outside, breath crystallizing before her. [296] The twilight frost shimmered on every surface, turning the world into a hall of mirrors. [312] Somewhere in this labyrinth of reflection and mist, her dream still wandered. [324]

Vesna raised the sextant to her eye and began her work. [335]

The method had taken years to perfect. [342] Through synchronized breathing—inhale with the pulse of the fog, exhale with the settling frost—she could blur her own edges enough to perceive what others could not. [368] The boundaries between observer and observed began erasing themselves. [378] She breathed in. [381] The fog breathed with her. [386] She breathed out. [389] The frost answered. [392]

There. [393] A flicker of silver between two skeletal trees. [401]

She followed without running, keeping her breath steady, the sextant trained on that elusive light. [416] The dream moved like water, like mercury, like everything her father had taught her to work with. [432] It did not want to be caught. [439] It had grown wild in its years of freedom. [448]

But Vesna was firmly grounded. [453] She did not chase; she matched. [459] Her footsteps found the rhythm of the dream's flight. [469] Her breath synchronized with its flickering pulse. [476] Slowly, inevitably, she was erasing the boundary between hunter and hunted, between longing and its object. [492]

The dream paused at the base of an ancient apple tree, its silver form resolving into something almost recognizable. [510]

Vesna lowered the sextant. [514] Through its mirrors, angled precisely, she could recreate sight-lines that the fog normally devoured. [528] And there, reflected in polished glass that had once belonged to an astronomer who dreamed of stars, she saw her father's face. [550]

He was humming. [553]

The dream trembled, ready to flee again. [560] But Vesna breathed in, breathed out, and in that synchronized moment, she opened her arms. [575]

It came to her like light returning to its source. [585]

She carried it back to her workshop, this captured thing, this fragment of who she had been. [601] Tomorrow she would set it into a mirror of her own making, where it would remain forever—a window in the fog, a boundary erased between past and present. [632]

The frost continued falling. [636] The glass mountains of this ruined world caught twilight in their facets. [648] And Vesna, firmly grounded despite all the unreality around her, finally remembered how to smile. [663]
