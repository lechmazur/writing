The workshop groaned and swayed on the acid sea, its foundation of sealed copper drums hissing where the caustic waters lapped against them. [24] Vex didn't mind the sound anymore—it had become the heartbeat of her world, the rhythm she'd learned to work by throughout the evolution of everything she'd built here. [52]

She was a pioneering cart glider by trade, or had been, back when such things mattered. [67] The first to ride the rail canyons on nothing but modified mining carts and faith. [82] Now her days took different forms, though she remained steadily curious, always picking at the edges of the impossible. [100]

The kaleidoscope sat heavy in her brass-jointed hand. [108] She'd built it herself from salvaged lenses and the crystallized tears of something that had once been alive—she didn't ask questions about the materials Drift brought her from the mainland. [139] Through the images in a kaleidoscope, she could transliterate the old codes, the ones the Architects had left scattered across the sky like forgotten prayers. [163]

"Show me something new," she muttered, spinning the cylinder. [172]

The fragments shifted. [175] Gears within gears, cogs meshing in patterns that hurt to follow. [186] She saw her own workshop reflected back, distorted—the same copper walls, the same acid-scarred windows, but populated by versions of herself she hadn't become yet. [211] The yearning algorithm at work, she supposed. [219] That was what she'd started calling it, the pattern she'd discovered woven into everything the Architects had touched. [237] A mathematical ache. [240] A formula for wanting something that didn't exist yet. [249]

She'd felt it her whole life. [255] The drive to ring a bell no one hears yet, to make a sound the world hadn't learned to listen for. [274]

On her workbench, the hunter's arrow tip gleamed under gaslight. [284] She'd pulled it from the wall of an abandoned temple two years ago—old technology, from before the acid rose and swallowed the lowlands. [307] Its edge was still sharp enough to cut light, or so Drift claimed. [320] Vex had run her own tests. [326] The metal contained traces of something that responded to the yearning algorithm, resonated with it like a tuning fork struck against intention itself. [348]

She believed—irreverently, outrageously—that she could build a bell from it. [359] Not a bell that made sound, but one that made sense. [370] A device that would translate the yearning algorithm into something comprehensible, something that could shake the foundations of what everyone thought they knew about the Architects and their abandoned world. [401]

The workshop lurched. [404] Another wave of acid, stronger than usual. [411] Somewhere below, she heard a drum seal give way with a wet pop. [424] She had hours, maybe, before the sea claimed this level too. [436] She'd learned to work with deadlines. [442]

Through the kaleidoscope, she watched her possible selves building, failing, building again. [454] The images shifted and she transliterated their movements into diagrams, scratching notes with a copper stylus that left grooves in the wax tablet. [476] The bell took shape in fragments—a curve here, an angle there, the arrow tip at its heart like a tongue waiting to speak. [500]

Throughout the evolution of her work, she'd learned that creation was mostly failure with better lighting. [515] But the yearning algorithm didn't care about success or failure. [525] It only cared about the reaching, the endless reach toward something just beyond the fingertips. [540]

The acid sea bubbled and sang its corrosive song. [549] The gears turned in their housings along every wall, measuring time in teeth and tension. [564] The cogs clicked their patient mathematics. [570]

Vex laughed—not bitterly, but with the kind of awe that comes from standing at the edge of something vast and absurd and beautiful all at once. [596] She'd spent her life gliding over canyons on contraptions held together by wire and will. [612] This was no different, really. [617] Just another impossible gap to cross, another silence waiting to be broken by someone steadily curious enough to try. [634]

She picked up the hunter's arrow tip, felt its ancient hunger harmonize with her own. [649] The metal sang against her palm, warm with possibility, sharp with purpose. [662]

Outside, the acid sea churned emerald and gold in the dying light. [674] The workshop drifted on, carrying its cargo of gears and dreams and one woman who refused to accept that some bells couldn't be rung. [697]

"Alright then," she said to the workshop, to the acid sea, to the versions of herself still waiting in the kaleidoscope's fractured light. [722] "Let's make some noise nobody's ready for." [730]

She began to build. [734]
