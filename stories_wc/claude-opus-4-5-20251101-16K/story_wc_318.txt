The echo chamber tunnel stretched beyond sight, where sounds lived twice—once as utterance, once as ghost. [16] Here, Marden stood with his collection: seven leaf blowers arranged in a crescent, each one a different pitch when roaring to life. [36]

He had been their conductor when he lived. [43] Every autumn Saturday, he'd lined them up in the garage, pull cords taut, and orchestrated a symphony of mechanical thunder that made his daughters shriek with laughter. [68] A ridiculous tradition. [71] A sacred one. [74]

Now, after the final grain had slipped through the hourglass—after the cancer, the quiet ending, the way his wife had stopped humming—Marden found himself here. [98] Between memory and echo. [102] Mournfully eager to return something he'd taken with him when he left. [114]

The house had gone silent. [119] Through the membrane between worlds, he could see them: his wife staring at coffee going cold, his daughters moving through rooms like they were afraid to disturb the grief that had settled like dust. [152] No one spoke of him. [157] No one spoke at all. [162] The unspoken had grown thick as walls. [169]

Tending to the unspoken—that was his purpose now. [178] Not words, but the spaces between them. [185] The "I love you" his wife never said that final morning because she'd assumed there would be evening. [201] The fight his daughters never resolved before his last lucid day. [212] The jokes that died on tongues because laughter felt like betrayal. [223]

Marden gripped the pull cord handle of the first blower. [233] The plastic was worn where his living palm had gripped it a thousand times. [247] He pulled. [249]

The roar filled the tunnel, magnified, transformed. [256] In the echo chamber, sound became something more—it became reach. [267] He pulled the second cord, the third. [274] The symphony built, dissonant and strange, and he conducted with arms that remembered the motion. [288]

But instead of chaos, something else emerged. [295] The competing winds of each blower began to macerate the silence he'd felt calcifying around his family. [311] The roaring broke it down, softened it, made it permeable. [321] And through that softening, Marden began to hum. [329]

Via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind, his voice threaded through the mechanical howl. [344] The same melodies he'd hummed when his daughters were small, when they'd wake crying from nightmares and he'd pace the hallway, too tired to remember proper words. [371] Just syllables. [373] Just comfort. [375]

The wind from the tunnel found cracks in the world—through heating vents and window frames, under doors and through the spaces where caulking had surrendered. [397] It reached the house where his family had forgotten how to breathe together. [410]

His youngest daughter heard it first. [416] She was in her father's study, finally opening the door she'd avoided for months. [429] The sound crept in, and she thought she'd imagined it—that half-remembered tune from childhood. [444] She laughed. [446] Not loud. [448] Just a breath that curled at its edges. [455] But it was enough. [459]

The sound spread. [462] His wife, at the kitchen window, smiled at nothing. [471] His older daughter texted her sister for the first time in weeks: "Remember how Dad used to do the leaf blower thing?" [492]

"So stupid." [494]

"So stupid." [496]

And they laughed. [499]

In the echo chamber tunnel, Marden felt the vibration return to him—laughter, restored, echoing back through the same passages his lullabies had traveled. [520] The blowers began to sputter and die, one by one, their work complete. [533]

He released the pull cord handle. [539] Let it swing from the machine like a pendulum finally at rest. [551]

The tunnel grew quiet, but it was a different quiet now. [562] Full instead of hollow. [566] The haunting was complete—not the kind that terrorizes, but the kind that heals. [580] He had tended to what they couldn't say themselves. [589] Mournfully eager until the very end, and now just mourning, and then just memory, and then— [604]

His daughters spoke his name aloud that night. [612] His wife hummed while washing dishes. [618]

And somewhere, in a tunnel made of echoes, a conductor took his bow. [631]
