Vera waded through the mangrove labyrinth at dusk, her bare feet finding purchase on roots slicked with salt and decay. [20] The singing spirits had already begun their evening chorus, their voices threading through the tangled branches like silver ribbons. [37] She carried nothing but the gargoyle's rainspout shard wrapped in cloth against her chest, its edges still sharp enough to draw blood. [56]

The medium had traveled three days to reach this place where water and land refused to separate. [71] Her brother Mattias had died here, his boat capsized, his body never found. [84] What they did find, months later, was a box beneath his bed filled with letters addressed to her—sealed, stamped, never mailed. [102] Dozens of them spanning years. [107] Apologies that had curdled into silence. [113]

The spirits' song shifted as she moved deeper, harmonies that seemed to recognize the weight she carried. [128] They inhabited every shadow here, these beings of brackish water and forgotten grief. [141] People came to this labyrinth seeking answers, and the spirits offered them—but never clearly, never kindly. [156] Vera understood this language of obscurity. [162] As a medium, she had spent her life translating the cryptic into the comprehensible. [175] Now she needed someone to translate for her. [183]

She stopped where the roots formed a natural alcove, moonlight beginning to spill through gaps in the canopy. [198] Her arms ached where the spirit wounds still festered—the price of her gift, marks that only healed in moonlight, slowly, painfully. [219] She unwrapped the shard and held it up, watching the ancient stone catch the pale glow. [235]

This fragment had channeled rain from cathedral eaves for four hundred years before lightning shattered its gargoyle. [250] Water remembered its passages. [254] Mattias had given it to her when they were children, before the silence grew between them like a wall. [271]

The spirits gathered closer, their singing dropping to a whisper. [281]

"I need to find the moment before deciding," Vera said aloud. [292] "Show me why he never sent them." [299]

The air grew thick with humidity, and condensation began forming on the leaves around her, on the smooth surfaces of stones, on the shard itself. [322] Words appeared in the moisture, traced by invisible fingers—the spirits' ancient method of communication. [336]

*He wrote them in anger first.* [342]

The letters beaded and ran. [347] New words formed. [350]

*Then rewrote them in sorrow.* [355]

Vera felt her throat tighten. [360] "Why didn't he send them?" [365]

*Because he wanted to find the right words. Because apologies that aren't perfect feel like lies.* [381]

She thought of her own silence, the calls she hadn't returned, the visits she'd postponed until there were no more visits possible. [401] The space where an apology waits unspoken—she had lived there too, building walls from the same bricks he had. [420]

The spirits began singing again, and this time she heard her brother's voice among them, faint but unmistakable. [437] She pressed the rainspout shard to her heart and let the tears come. [450]

*He wanted you to forgive him before he asked.* [459] The condensation spelled out one final message. [466] *He was afraid you'd say no.* [472]

"I wouldn't have," Vera whispered. [477] But even as she said it, she wasn't certain. [486] That was the terrible truth of unsent letters—they preserved not just words but possibilities, keeping hope and fear suspended together in amber. [506]

The moonlight strengthened, and she felt warmth spreading through her wounded arms, the slow knitting of damaged flesh. [523] The spirits' song swelled into something that sounded almost like forgiveness—not offered, but demonstrated, the way the water forgave the land for trying to contain it. [549]

She understood now what she had come to evoke: not her brother's ghost, but the tenderness they had both been too proud to show. [572] Fierce tenderness, the kind that burns because it matters too much. [584]

Vera reached into her pocket and withdrew her own letter, the one she had written to Mattias after finding his box. [602] Unsealed. [603] Unsent. [604]

She laid it among the roots and watched the water rise to claim it, the ink bleeding into the brackish flow, her words finally joining his in the place where nothing needed to be perfect to be true. [642]

The singing spirits carried the message outward, dissolved into the labyrinth's endless channels. [655]

Vera stayed until dawn, healing in the moonlight, letting the condensation write new words across her skin—words that looked like *begin again* and *it was always enough*. [684]

When she finally left, the gargoyle's shard remained behind, planted upright among the mangrove roots. [700] Rain would find it there. [705] Water would remember. [708] And somewhere in the spaces between sending and receiving, between regret and release, two siblings would keep learning how to speak. [729]
