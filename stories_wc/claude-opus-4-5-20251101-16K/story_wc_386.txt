The shrine was carved into the glacier's heart, where blue ice held centuries of silence. [14] Mira descended through the fissure each night, candles burning in hollowed niches, their flames steady despite physics—borrowed light, she thought, borrowed from somewhere warmer. [40]

She was a wreck-diver by trade, a ghost whisperer by inheritance. [51] The two vocations intertwined like rope fibers: she retrieved objects from sunken ships, and the dead followed those objects home. [71]

Tonight, the melted snow globe sat between her palms. [80] She'd pulled it from the Northwind's cabin three weeks ago, found it fused into a warped dome by the fire that sent the vessel down. [106] Inside, the miniature village had become abstract—a church steeple bent into the glass, tiny figures merged into a single mass of painted porcelain. [129]

The ghost it summoned was a girl, perhaps twelve when she drowned, though age became uncertain in the dead. [146] She hovered at the shrine's edge, watching Mira with the hungry patience all spirits possessed. [161]

"Your name," Mira said. [165] She always began with names. [170]

"Elsa Varen." [172] The voice came from everywhere—from the ice, from the candle flames, from Mira's own chest. [188]

Mira weaves truth carefully. [192] This was her method, her survival mechanism. [199] The dead craved answers, but too much truth delivered too quickly could shatter them into nothing. [215] Too little, and they lingered forever, growing teeth. [223]

"You want to know about the fire," Mira said. [232]

Elsa's form flickered. [235] "My father says I started it. [241] In every dream, he tells me I killed them all." [251]

This was the window Mira needed—the windows of connection that made her work possible. [265] The dead could not enter living dreams, but their memories could. [276] Their faces appeared in strangers' sleep: a crowd scene in a nightmare, a figure in a window, a child in the background of someone else's recollection. [302] By analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams, Mira could trace the truth backward. [315] She'd spent two weeks interviewing the Northwind's survivors, recording their nightmares, cataloging every spectral intrusion. [329]

"Your father dreams of you standing near the lantern," Mira said. [340] "But three other survivors dream of a different figure—a man in a cook's apron, drunk, stumbling into the cargo hold with a candle." [363]

Elsa's edges sharpened. [366] "The cook?" [368]

"Henrik Moss. [370] He died in the fire too. [376] But he appears in four separate dreams, always with guilt on his face. [389] You appear in twelve—always confused, always innocent." [396]

The truth was this: children are easy to blame. [405] Children cannot defend themselves from grief-maddened fathers who need someone small enough to hold responsible. [418] Mira had seen it before, this calcification of guilt onto the vulnerable dead. [431]

"You did not start the fire, Elsa." [438]

The shrine's ice cracked—a sound like breathing. [445] The candles flared. [448]

Mira's motivation had never been complex: to salvage something pure from the wreckage. [461] Every dive brought up artifacts corroded by salt and time, but occasionally she found something worth saving. [477] A locket with a photograph still visible. [484] A letter sealed in wax. [489] A child's reputation, burned away by a father's unbearable sorrow. [499]

"Will you expose him?" Elsa asked. [505] "Will you tell people what he's done to my memory?" [515]

Mira considered this. [518] She could seek out the survivors, share her findings, attempt to rehabilitate a dead girl's name among the living. [535] But the living rarely listened to ghost whisperers, and Harald Varen's grief had already metastasized into something unreachable. [551]

"I'll tell the ice," Mira said. [557] "I'll carve your innocence into this shrine, and everyone who comes after me will know. [573] The glacier remembers longer than people do." [580]

She lifted the melted snow globe, its warped glass catching candlelight like borrowed starlight—reflected, refracted, not its own. [597] But beautiful still. [600] Pure despite damage. [603]

Elsa Varen smiled. [606] The expression transformed her from specter to child, and for one moment, Mira saw her as she must have been: bright-eyed, alive, holding a snow globe on a winter morning, shaking it to make the tiny village disappear in white. [645]

"Thank you," Elsa whispered. [649]

The candles dimmed. [652] The ghost dissolved into the blue ice, finally part of something ancient and clean. [666]

Mira began to carve. [670]
