Mara had swept the labyrinth's passages for thirty-seven years, and in that time she had learned to measure grief by the dust it left behind. [25]

Every morning, silver particulate accumulated along the baseboards where dreamers had wandered in their sleep, trailing loss like pollen. [43] She collected it in glass vials, cataloged each sample by weight and shimmer, building what her predecessor had called the ledgers of quantified sorrow. [65] The work was tedious, essential, and entirely invisible to anyone who didn't understand that labyrinths are not puzzles but repositories. [82]

Tonight, the storm had driven her up from the underground passages into the astronomer's abandoned tower. [96] Lightning split the clouds while moonlight poured through the gaps, creating a strange double illumination that made the room feel suspended between destruction and peace. [119] Her hands, perpetually scarred from brushing against the labyrinth's crystallized grief deposits, began their slow regeneration in the lunar glow. [137] She heals in moonlight—this she had discovered by accident years ago, falling asleep in a window frame, waking with palms smooth as a child's. [160]

On the workbench before her lay the astronomer's broken sextant, its mirrors cracked, its arc warped from a fall she had not witnessed. [182] The old stargazer had abandoned it here when he abandoned everything else, chasing some vision into the labyrinth and never returning. [201] Mara had found his final notebook, pages filled with observations that made no astronomical sense: angles between sleepwalkers, distances measured in exhaled sighs, coordinates pointing toward nothing visible. [226]

He had been trying to discover what trees witness. [234]

The ancient oaks surrounding the labyrinth's entrance had stood for six hundred years, their roots threading through the passages below. [251] The astronomer believed they absorbed the sorrow Mara swept, filtered it through bark and sap, and witnessed truths no waking mind could hold. [272] His sextant, he theorized, could navigate to that knowledge—if he could only learn to aim it at the right sky. [292]

He had failed because he looked upward. [299] Mara understood now that he should have looked inward. [308]

She began to deconstruct the broken instrument, removing each brass fitting, each fragment of mirror. [322] Her fingers worked with the precision of someone who had spent decades maintaining impossible architecture. [336] The sextant's components spread across the table like a dissected equation. [347]

What she intended was not repair but transformation. [355] By mapping scattered dreams—those fragmentary visions that accumulated in the labyrinth's corners, orphaned from their dreamers—she could recalibrate each piece. [374] The mirrors would reflect not starlight but the geography of sleeping grief. [386] The arc would measure not angles but the weight of witnessed moments. [398]

She worked through the storm's duration, reassembling the sextant around a core of crystallized dream-dust. [413] The moonlight through the fractured window helped her see connections the astronomer had missed. [427] His ledgers of observation became her guide; her ledgers of sorrow became the fuel. [441]

The storm faded. [444] The tower fell into silence so complete that when Mara set down her final tool, a pin she had used to align the mirrors, it rang against the stone floor like a bell. [477]

At the moment that pin was heard in the silent corridor below, something changed. [491]

The sextant's mirrors clouded, then cleared, showing not stars but roots. [503] Deep beneath the labyrinth, the oak roots glowed with accumulated witness. [514] Mara raised the instrument to her eye and saw six centuries of passage: lovers losing each other in the maze's turns, children calling for parents who had already emerged, the astronomer himself walking in circles until his body simply stopped. [551]

The trees had witnessed all of it. [558] They held the sorrow not as burden but as nutrient, transforming grief into growth rings, into shade, into oxygen that dreamers breathed as they wandered lost below. [582]

Mara lowered the sextant, understanding now why her work mattered. [593] She did not clean the labyrinth; she gardened it. [602] The dust she collected was not waste but seed, and the oaks were not witnesses but gardeners themselves, tending a crop of transformed sorrow that fed back into the world as something almost like grace. [637]

Dawn approached. [639] Her healed hands would scar again today, brushing against the crystalized losses of a hundred dreamers. [654] Tomorrow she would climb to this tower, and the moonlight would restore her, and the mundane miracle would continue. [672]

She tucked the transformed sextant into her apron and descended the stairs, returning to passages that waited to be swept. [691] The labyrinth needed its maintenance worker. [697] The trees needed their sorrow. [702] And somewhere below, the first dreamer of the day was already beginning to wander, trailing silver dust that would feed roots that would witness worlds that would never end. [731]
