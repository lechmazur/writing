The frozen library above the clouds existed in a state of perpetual stillness, its spires of ice-glazed stone catching the first hauntingly bright rays of a distant morning. [28] Vera climbed the final ladder of frozen rungs, her breath crystallizing before her lips. [42] She was a lunar-eclipse locksmith by trade—one who worked only during those rare celestial alignments when the mechanism between sun and moon aligned just so, allowing her to open locks that defied ordinary craft. [77] But she had not come here to practice her profession. [87] She had come to learn the rhythm of repair. [96]

In her satchel, wrapped in oilcloth, lay her father's clockmaker's gear assortment: brass cogs of varying sizes, springs coiled tight as secrets, escapement wheels worn smooth by decades of handling. [126] He had died during the last eclipse, his hands still reaching for a timepiece he could never finish. [144] The gears represented everything he'd failed to teach her, every conversation interrupted, every lesson left incomplete. [160]

The library's doors opened at her touch, though no hinges moved. [171] Inside, frost coated every surface—shelves, tables, the spines of ancient books. [183] Yet nothing decayed. [186] Time itself seemed to have paused here, holding its breath. [196]

She had heard of this place through scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner back home—torn pages stuffed behind a radiator, forgotten by whoever had hidden them centuries ago. [227] The prophecy spoke of a hall of mirrors where broken things revealed their wholeness, where locksmiths could learn to open what had been sealed within themselves. [253]

The frozen library stretched before her, corridors branching like the chambers of a crystallized heart. [268] Vera followed the frost patterns on the floor, trusting the way ice formed around warmth, until she reached the library's center. [289]

The hall of mirrors awaited. [294]

Not mirrors of glass, but of ice so pure and still that reality doubled infinitely within it. [311] Vera saw herself reflected a thousand times—younger, older, her father's face ghosting through her features, her mother's grief worn like a veil. [334] The reflections moved when she did not. [341] They showed her hands working, fitting gears together, her father standing behind her, guiding. [355]

She pulled the clockmaker's gear assortment from her satchel with trembling fingers. [367] The brass pieces felt impossibly cold, impossibly dear. [375] In her reflection, she watched herself uncap a small vial—one she hadn't consciously reached for—filled with oil her father had mixed himself for lubricating delicate mechanisms. [403] The scent rose, sharp and mechanical and heartbreaking: pine resin and rendered fat and something metallic that always reminded her of lightning. [425]

In the hauntingly bright light filtering through the frozen library's crystalline dome, Vera began to work. [441]

The mirrors showed her what she could not see with ordinary eyes: how each gear related to the next, how damage propagated through a mechanism like grief through a family, how repair was not about forcing pieces back together but about understanding the rhythm they once shared. [488] Click, pause, click. [491] The escapement of time, the breath between moments. [499]

Her father had not left her incomplete lessons. [507] He had left her the capacity to complete them herself. [517]

Under the soft hush of that distant morning, with clouds rolling below the library like a frozen sea, Vera fitted the final gear into place. [542] The mechanism in her hands—assembled from her father's scattered intentions—began to tick. [556] Not loudly, but with the quiet persistence of memory, of love that outlasts its speaker. [571]

She had come seeking the rhythm of repair. [579] She found something more: the understanding that some locks are opened not with tools but with time, that some broken things must remain broken until we grow into the people capable of healing them. [613]

The hall of mirrors softened around her. [620] Her reflections smiled, each one a different version of who she might become. [633]

Vera wrapped the ticking mechanism in oilcloth and began the long descent through the clouds, carrying her father home in the only way left to her—through the work of her own two hands, through the rhythm he had always trusted her to find. [677]
