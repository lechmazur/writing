The druid came to the cursed lake after the magic trick failed. [11] The mirror spell was supposed to show truth, but it only reflected surfaces—never what lay beneath. [26] So Mira sought another way to discover what mirrors don't show. [37]

She had the gift of finding lost things: whispered prayers, forgotten graves, memories that slipped through time's cracks. [53] But she'd never searched for something lost within herself. [62]

The orchard vortex churned at the lake's heart—ancient apple trees caught in eternal spiral, their branches reaching like desperate arms. [80] The water flowed inward against nature, pulling everything toward that impossible center where reality bent and groaned. [95]

Mira carried a flesh-eating plant seed against her heart, her last defense. [107] The seed was hungry, always, and she kept it starved. [117] In desperate moments, she could plant it and let it devour whatever threatened her. [130]

She began her search through expanding circles. [137] Starting at the water's edge, she walked the perimeter, her senses reaching inward toward the vortex's pull. [153] Each circuit brought her closer, each step a negotiation with the curse. [164]

Warlike serenity settled over her like armor forged from stillness. [174] She was calm the way a blade is calm—ready, poised, present. [185] The curse of this lake had consumed better druids, but Mira had trained herself to expect nothing, want nothing, need nothing. [204] Her guard was her survival. [209]

On the third circle, she felt it—a pulse of frozen memory suspended in the magical residue. [224] The confession she sought. [228]

Years ago, her teacher had stood at this very shore before the curse transformed it. [242] He'd spoken words that Mira was meant to hear, but she'd been too young, too afraid. [257] She'd run, and his confession had frozen here, preserved like amber around an insect, waiting for someone who could find lost things. [278]

The vortex pulled stronger as she approached. [285] Trees groaned in their endless spiral. [291] Fruit rotted and bloomed simultaneously in the warped time. [300] Mira planted her feet against the current and spoke the words of unbinding. [313]

The frozen confession began to thaw. [319] Her teacher's voice emerged from the churning water—fragmented at first, then heartbreakingly clear: [332]

"I was wrong to train you as I did. [341] I made you guarded because I was afraid of what you could become. [354] Your gift for finding things—it terrified me. [362] You could find the weakness in any soul, the fracture in any defense. [374] So I taught you to fear yourself." [381]

Mira's chest tightened. [384] Her fingers touched the seed, that familiar hunger pulsing against her palm like a second heartbeat. [398]

"But I should have told you the truth," the voice continued. [408] "You find what is lost because you are meant to return things to wholeness. [422] Not as weapon. [425] As healer." [427]

The words struck like arrows of light through her carefully constructed walls. [438]

The vortex surged in response to her vulnerability. [445] Trees cracked and spun faster. [450] The curse sensed the opening in her defenses and attacked—branches lashing, water rising in tendrils of black liquid. [467]

Mira's instinct was to guard, to harden, to plant the flesh-eating seed and let it devour whatever threatened her. [484] That was what her training demanded. [490]

Instead, she made herself unbend. [495]

Her spine straightened from its defensive curve. [502] Her shoulders dropped from their perpetual brace. [509] Her fist unclenched around the seed. [515]

She let herself be soft in this warlike place. [524]

The vortex's pull weakened instantly. [529] The curse fed on fear, on defense, on the rigid stance of those who came to fight. [545] When Mira released her guard, she gave it nothing to grip. [556]

Through one final expanding circle, she walked into the vortex's heart. [567] The trees parted like curtains. [572] The water calmed to glass. [577]

At the center stood a mirror of still liquid—and this time, when she looked, she saw what regular mirrors never showed. [597] Not her face, but her purpose. [603] The countless lost things waiting to be found and returned. [613] The wholeness she could help create if she stopped treating her gift as threat. [627]

She pressed the flesh-eating seed into the soft earth at the lake's heart. [640] It would guard this place now—not her. [648] Some hungers deserved to be fed by curse rather than carried by a healer. [662]

Mira emerged from the cursed lake as the first druid ever to leave it whole. [677] She was still guarded in some ways—that would take years to fully change. [690] But she'd found the most important lost thing: the version of herself that her teacher had hidden away in fear. [709]

The warlike serenity remained, but transformed now. [716] She was still ready, still present, still capable of violence if necessary. [727] But the violence was no longer aimed inward at her own becoming. [738]

She knew now that finding was only half her gift. [748]

Returning was the rest. [752]
