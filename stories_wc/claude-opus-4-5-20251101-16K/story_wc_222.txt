The sky was wrong again. [5]

Mira knew it the moment she pressed the pocket sundial lid to her eye and saw stars where the sun should be. [27] The brass disc, separated from its base years ago during her first fumbled theft, had become something more useful than any timepiece—a lens that revealed truth through illusion. [55]

High in the icebound spire above the clouds, she waited. [65] The tower had been abandoned by astronomers centuries past, its crystalline walls now sheathed in frost that caught light like scattered diamonds. [84] This was where the Guild of Veils conducted its most delicate work—where chivalrous thieves like herself learned that stealing could be an act of grace. [107]

She was, as her mentor Aldric called her, an apprentice of wonder. [119] "To take is easy," he had told her once, his breath fogging in the perpetual cold. [134] "To take correctly is divine." [139]

The wrongness in the sky meant the barrier between worlds had thinned. [150] It meant her contact from the opposing realm would come. [160]

Mira set the chessboard on the frozen observation deck, arranging each hand-carved piece with care. [175] The method had been established long before her time: swapping hand-carved chess pieces with secrets inside. [189] Each figure was hollow, containing scrolled messages too dangerous for ordinary couriers. [200] Her white queen held coordinates. [205] Her knight carried a name. [210] The pawns—eight of them—contained fragments of an apology she had spent months composing. [225]

She was here to amend. [230]

Three years ago, brimming with a thief's arrogance, she had stolen from the wrong person. [244] Not wrong because they were powerful—Aldric had taught her that power meant nothing—but wrong because they had been innocent. [262] A scholar from beyond the veil, visiting to share knowledge, and Mira had taken her most precious possession: a compass that pointed toward lost loved ones. [288]

The scholar had wept. [292] Mira had watched from the shadows, clutching her prize, and felt her soul crack. [306]

Chivalrous thieves did not steal from those who had nothing to spare. [318] She had violated the sacred code. [324]

The figure emerged from the wavering air where sky met cloud. [335] Tall, wrapped in fabrics that moved like liquid starlight, the emissary from beyond carried her own chess set. [352] Their pieces would trade places tonight. [358] Black for white. [361] Secrets exchanged in a game that was also a ceremony, sacredly playful as all the Guild's rituals tended to be. [380]

"You are the one who seeks to mend," the emissary said. [391] Not a question. [394]

"I am." [396] Mira placed the pocket sundial lid on the board between them—an offering, a symbol of her willingness to see truly. [417] "I cannot return what I stole. The compass was lost in the northern waters. My failure compounded." [433]

"Then what do you offer?" [438]

"Everything I have discovered since. Every secret these pieces hold. Coordinates to treasures I've located but never claimed. Names of those who prey on scholars. Routes through the veil that remain safe." [468] Mira met the emissary's strange eyes. [474] "I offer my service, my skills—to embrace whatever unknown task she might require of me, with open arms." [492]

The game began. [495] Each piece swapped held a fragment of her penance. [504] The emissary studied each secret with alien patience, sometimes nodding, once laughing—a sound like wind chimes in a hurricane. [522]

When the last piece traded, the emissary spoke. [530] "The scholar you wronged became my teacher after her loss. She said grief transformed her. She learned to find people instead of waiting for them to be found." [557]

Mira's throat tightened. [560]

"She said if the thief ever sought forgiveness, I should tell her this: wonder is not about possessing marvels." [577] The emissary touched the sundial lid gently. [583] "It is about becoming one." [588]

The wrong sky rippled. [592] Dawn approached—real dawn, not the illusion. [599]

"Go," the emissary said. [603] "Be the compass you could not return. Point the lost toward home." [615]

Mira descended the icebound spire as light broke through clouds, carrying nothing but purpose. [628] Above her, the chess pieces remained—black and white together now, their secrets freed, their game transformed into something like prayer. [648]

She had come as a thief seeking absolution. [656]

She left as an apprentice of wonder, finally understanding what the wonder was meant to teach. [671]

The sky corrected itself. [675] And Mira ran toward it with cautious abandon, into the unknown that had always been calling her name. [692]
