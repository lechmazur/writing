Mira had been a celestial signal interpreter for seventeen years at Station Kepler-7, positioned at the edge of a gravitational anomaly that bent time and light in equal measure. [31] She worked here because the anomaly made certain signals visible—whispers from stars long dead, echoes that shouldn't exist. [50]

Her mentor had left her a dried-up fountain pen with an exotic nib, shaped like a solar flare. [67] It had been empty for years, but she kept it on her desk. [80] A reminder. [82] You interpret, you don't create. [88] That had been his rule. [94]

But she had broken it. [99] Three months ago, after planting the wrong seeds—sending a misinterpreted signal that led a colony ship to adjust course toward a dying system—she understood that interpretation was creation. [128] Every reading she gave shaped what others did next. [137] She had edited history without meaning to. [144]

Now she was trying to unbend what had curved. [153] Through contingent relationships—the networks of cause and effect that the anomaly revealed—she could see how one decision branched into many. [175] The colony ship was still three years from its destination. [185] There was time. [188]

She was confidently uncertain about the solution. [195] That was her nature now. [200] After the mistake, certainty felt like arrogance, but hesitation meant paralysis. [212] So she moved forward, knowing she might be wrong, accepting it, acting anyway. [225]

The anomaly helped. [228] Here, time pooled and eddied. [233] Signals from the future occasionally brushed against the present. [242] She had learned to read them, to thresh meaning from experience—separating the noise from what mattered. [258] It was her motivation, her purpose. [264] To find the grain of truth among the chaff of possibility. [275]

She picked up the dried pen. [281] The nib caught light, prismatic. [286] Her mentor had used it to write his interpretations in a language of his own devising. [301] She had never decoded all of it, but she was beginning to understand: he had been editing history too. [320] Carefully. [321] Deliberately. [322] Not changing what happened, but changing what people understood had happened. [333] The story, not the event. [338]

She could do the same. [343] Through the contingent relationships visible in the anomaly, she could send a new signal—not contradicting her first interpretation, but contextualizing it. [364] The dying system had resources the colony could use during a brief window. [376] The wrong seeds might still grow if planted in different soil. [388]

There was strange comfort in this. [394] The mistake didn't need erasing. [399] It needed reframing. [402] History wasn't fixed; it was a conversation between what happened and what we understood. [416] She had been trying to unbend the timeline, to straighten what she had curved, but that wasn't how the anomaly worked. [436] Everything that bent remained bent. [441] You could only add new curves, new interpretations. [449]

She wrote the new signal in her notebook, then transcribed it into the transmission array. [463] The words felt right—confidently uncertain, accepting their own potential for error. [475] She was not fixing history. [480] She was adding to it. [485]

Outside her window, the anomaly shimmered. [491] Light bent around invisible mass, creating halos and shadows that didn't correspond to anything real. [505] But they were real, in their own way. [512] Everything here was contingent—dependent on perspective, on relationship, on the observer's position in time and space. [528]

The colony ship would receive her signal in fourteen hours. [538] They would interpret it. [542] They would make new decisions. [547] History would continue editing itself, through every person who read a sign and chose what it meant. [563]

Mira set down her stylus and touched the dried-up pen. [573] She kept it for looking at, for remembering. [582] Empty, it couldn't create anything new. [588] But it reminded her that interpretation was sacred, that meaning was harvested, not invented. [601]

Through the gravitational anomaly, she watched stars bending toward each other. [612] Wrong turns could become right ones. [618] Mistakes could become opportunities. [622] This was the strange comfort of her work: nothing was final. [633] Everything was contingent. [636]

She sat back and waited for the response that would come, in time. [649]
