The floating rock drifted through amber clouds, its moss-covered surface bearing only a weathered stone table, two cushions, and Yara. [20]

She knelt alone on the tea ceremony platform, her crow quill with its carefully trimmed tip resting beside an empty cup. [41]

The first storm had passed an hour ago, leaving the air thick with petrichor and static. [57]

The second storm gathered on the horizon, a wall of violet lightning and shadow. [71]

Between them: this breath. [75]

This saturated hush where even time seemed to steep like tea leaves in still water. [90]

Yara was a budding rune scholar, three years into her studies and already marked by them. [106]

Literally. [107]

Her forearms bore the evidence of her affliction - when stress overwhelmed her, her skin crystallized in jagged patterns, leaving behind formations of pale quartz where flesh had been. [135]

Her mentors called it a gift. [141]

She called it what it was: scars. [148]

But scars, her grandmother had once told her, are just stories the body writes before the mind is ready. [167]

She had come here to transform scars into stories of her own choosing. [180]

The tea set before her was empty - this ceremony required no tea. [192]

Only breath, and ink, and the willingness to shed. [201]

Yara lifted the crow quill, feeling its familiar weight. [210]

The tip had been trimmed just yesterday, its edge precise as a surgeon's blade. [224]

She dipped it into the obsidian inkwell and held it above her crystallized forearm. [238]

Her throat tightened. [241]

Already she felt the familiar pressure building beneath her sternum - the prelude to another crystallization. [256]

The stress of what she attempted coiled inside her like a second storm. [269]

She closed her eyes and did what her mentors would have forbidden: she revisited youthful superstitions. [285]

Grandmother's voice: "Crows carry words between worlds. [292]

Their feathers remember everything they've touched." [298]

Grandmother's hands: pressing a black feather to young Yara's scraped knee. [309]

"Let it take the hurt. [314]

Let it fly." [317]

Foolish. [318]

Unscholarly. [319]

But Yara held her breath and let herself believe. [328]

The platform drifted through silence. [333]

The clouds held their color. [338]

The distant storm paused its approach as if watching. [347]

During that held breath, Yara pressed quill to crystal. [356]

The rune she drew was not from any textbook - it was from her childhood, a symbol her grandmother claimed could unlock anything that had been locked too long. [384]

Yara had drawn it in dirt, on foggy windows, on her own skin in temporary ink, never believing it held power. [405]

Now, with proper tools and desperate faith, she wrote it into her scar. [418]

The crystal sang. [421]

A high, thin note rang across the floating rock, startling birds from distant cliffs. [435]

The quartz pattern on her forearm began to fracture - not painfully, but like ice releasing its grip on a spring river. [456]

Piece by piece, the crystallization shed from her skin, falling onto the stone table in fragments that caught the amber light like scattered diamonds. [480]

Beneath it: new skin. [484]

Pink and tender, unmarked. [488]

But not empty. [491]

Where the crystal had been, faint silver lines remained - the rune she had drawn, now permanently etched into her flesh. [511]

A story she had chosen. [516]

A scar transformed. [519]

Yara exhaled. [521]

The second storm broke. [525]

Wind rushed across the platform, scattering the crystal fragments into the clouds below, carrying them away like crow feathers on an updraft. [547]

Rain began to fall, warm and insistent, and Yara lifted her face to meet it. [562]

She was still a budding scholar. [568]

Still learning. [570]

But she understood now what her grandmother had tried to teach her - that the oldest superstitions often carried truths too simple for academic language. [594]

That shedding was not about losing, but about choosing what remained. [605]

She looked at her transformed forearm, at the silver rune gleaming through the rain. [619]

One scar down. [622]

Many more to go. [626]

But for now, in this breath between storms, she allowed herself to simply be - a young woman on a floating rock, holding a crow quill, finally understanding that some ceremonies require no tea at all. [661]

Only the willingness to believe. [666]
