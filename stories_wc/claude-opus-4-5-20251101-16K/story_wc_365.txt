The abandoned spaceport repair bay existed in a fold between realities, a place where rust never finished its work and shadows held the shapes of ships long departed. [28] Vera pressed her palm to the cold metal floor, cataloging: texture of oxidized steel, humidity at forty-seven percent, the subsonic hum of dying generators. [52] She recorded these sensations in the air before her, light bending around her fingers as she crafted another node in her sensory map. [75] She was a sensory map maker, one of the last. [85] Her work had once charted trade routes for interstellar merchants. [95] Now she used it to navigate something far more treacherous: the spaces between worlds. [109]

The green glass shard hung from a cord at her throat, warm against her collarbone despite the chill. [126] It had been her mother's, salvaged from a universe that no longer existed. [139] Vera had worn it for fifteen years without understanding its purpose. [150] Then, three months ago, it had begun to sing. [159]

The shifts came cyclically spontaneous—predictable in their rhythm, random in their exact moment. [171] Every twelve hours, give or take, the shard would flare with emerald light, and Vera would have seconds to choose: stay, or step sideways into another version of reality. [201] She had learned to keep her maps ready. [209]

The shard hummed now, building toward another threshold. [217] Vera closed her eyes and let herself sink into that familiar space, the murmur of half-remembered dreams where one universe bled into the next. [241] Here, time felt like honey, and memories that weren't hers flickered at the edges of her consciousness. [258] Her mother's face. [261] Her mother's hands, pressing the shard into her palm. [270] Her mother's voice: "Don't look for me. [277] Some truths are better left buried." [283]

But Vera had never been good at leaving things buried. [293]

She had spent these months weaving between worlds, following traces of her mother's passage through parallel universes. [309] Each version of this spaceport held different clues. [317] In one, her mother had been a hero. [325] In another, a war criminal. [330] In a third, she had never existed at all. [339]

The weight of a withheld truth—that was what drove Vera forward. [350] Not anger. [352] Not grief. [354] Simply the unbearable heaviness of not knowing. [361]

The shard flared. [364]

Vera opened her eyes as reality shuddered around her. [373] The repair bay remained, but the light had shifted from amber to silver. [386] Different universe. [388] Different rules. [390]

She reached out, sensing: metallic tang in the air, vibration frequency shifted two octaves lower, temperature dropped eight degrees. [408] Her fingers traced the differences into her map, building the topology of this new world. [423] Then she saw it. [427]

On the far wall, scorched into the metal, was her mother's symbol: three interlocking circles. [442] Beneath it, coordinates Vera recognized. [447] And below those, a single word. [453]

REDIRECT. [454]

Vera's breath caught. [457] She had been searching wrong. [462] All these months, she had traced her mother's path forward, following the woman's flight from universe to universe. [479] But the truth her mother had hidden wasn't ahead. [488] It was behind. [491] The origin point. [494] The universe where everything began. [499]

Vera pulled up her sensory map, the accumulated data of dozens of realities glowing before her. [514] Patterns emerged that she hadn't seen before—threads connecting each world, converging backward toward a single point. [530] The shard pulsed against her chest, as if agreeing. [539]

"You destroyed it," Vera whispered, understanding flooding through her. [547] Her mother hadn't fled her home universe. [554] She had erased it. [558] The green glass shard was all that remained—and it was also the key to return. [573]

The withheld truth had weight after all. [580] It pressed down on Vera's shoulders like the gravity of collapsed stars. [592] Her mother had committed genocide across dimensional lines, eliminating every version of their homeworld to stop something. [608] To stop what? [611]

The shard sang again, the cycle completing, offering passage. [620] Vera could redirect her search now. [626] Go back instead of forward. [631] Find the ghost of a murdered universe and learn why her mother had killed it. [646]

She pressed her palm to the floor one final time, recording this moment—the taste of revelation, the texture of resolve, the frequency of fear. [671] Then she gripped the shard, let the green light swallow her, and stepped backward through the weave of worlds. [689]

In the murmur of half-remembered dreams, she felt her mother's presence stir. [701] Somewhere between realities, the truth was waiting. [708] It would be heavy, Vera knew. [714] But she had spent a lifetime learning to carry weight. [724]
