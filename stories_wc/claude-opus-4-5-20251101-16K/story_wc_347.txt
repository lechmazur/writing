Maren had not asked to inherit the orchard, but the curse passed through bloodlines like rot through stone. [18] Each morning she woke to find another branch blackened, another fruit split open and weeping something that smelled of copper and regret. [40]

The orchard clung to the eastern rim of the Thornway Labyrinth—a maze of stone corridors carved into the cliffside, patrolled by mechanical birds whose brass wings caught the dying light with graceless beauty. [74] They were lovely in the way a blade is lovely: precise, cold, indifferent to the warmth they extinguished. [92]

Today three travelers had entered the labyrinth below. [100] Maren had watched them from her broken terrace, their bright cloaks disappearing into the maze's throat. [116] Fools. [117] They always were. [120]

She was reluctant to go. [125] Every descent cost her something—time she needed for the trees, warmth she couldn't spare, pieces of herself she'd never recover. [146] But the night frost would form in six hours, and anyone caught in the labyrinth when it came would freeze into the stone itself, their last breaths crystallizing into sculptures of terror that the mechanical birds would admire with their clicking, turning heads. [189]

From her workbench she retrieved the forgotten blueprint—yellow with age, its edges crumbling, its lines showing a labyrinth that no longer matched the one below. [215] The curse had shifted the walls over centuries, but the blueprint still held patterns, rhythms. [230] Maren had spent fifteen years learning to read its underlying logic, the mathematics of its madness. [246]

She gathered her tools: a brass rod, three copper discs, and a small nut from the least corrupted tree. [265] The nut hummed faintly in her palm, its shell warm. [275] It was the only thing the curse couldn't fully claim—too dense, too essential, containing the orchard's original seed-memory from before the blight took hold. [300]

The descent took an hour. [305] The mechanical birds tracked her with opal eyes, recognizing the orchard-keeper's scent, letting her pass. [320] They would not extend the same courtesy to strangers. [329]

In the labyrinth, Maren worked by her peculiar method: leaving impressions without touching. [342] She pressed the brass rod into the moss-covered walls, leaving arrows that pointed toward safety. [357] She laid the copper discs on the ground, their weight imprinting circles that meant "turn here" in the old traveler's language. [378] She never touched the travelers themselves, never called out, never revealed herself. [390] To do so would bind them to the curse, and then they'd wake one morning with an orchard of their own, its branches reaching for their throats. [417]

The blueprint guided her as she moved ahead of them, an offhandedly exact ghost. [431] Her placements were casual but precise—three fingerwidths from each corner, exactly seventeen steps between markers. [447] The mathematics had to be perfect or the labyrinth would swallow her signs whole. [461]

She found where the travelers had gotten lost—a junction where seven paths met, all identical, all wrong except one. [481] Here she would assemble the final marker. [488] She placed the small nut at the junction's center and arranged the discs around it, the brass rod laid across them like a compass needle. [513]

The nut's warmth pulsed outward, and the arrangement glowed faintly—not with magic, but with memory. [529] The forgotten blueprint had shown her this: the labyrinth remembered what it was supposed to be, and the nut carried the seed of that remembrance. [554] Together they created an impression that even the shifted walls couldn't deny. [566]

A path illuminated itself. [570] The correct path. [573]

Maren withdrew into the shadows as the travelers approached. [582] She watched them pause at her markers, confusion becoming understanding, panic becoming purpose. [595] They followed the glowing way, their cloaks disappearing around the final turn that led to the western exit. [613]

Above, the sky purpled toward frost. [619]

Maren climbed back to her orchard as the first ice crystals formed on the labyrinth's upper walls. [636] The mechanical birds settled onto their perches, brass feathers ringing like distant bells, graceless and beautiful in the dying light. [656]

Tomorrow the orchard would demand its due. [663] More blackened branches, more copper-scented fruit, more of her warmth fed to something ancient and hungry. [679]

But tonight, three travelers would sleep in warm beds, never knowing who had saved them, never inheriting her burden. [698]

Maren sat among her cursed trees and waited for morning, her hands still smelling of the small nut's peculiar hope. [718]
