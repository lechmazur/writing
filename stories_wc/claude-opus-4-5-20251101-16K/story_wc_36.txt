The Thunder-echo range held its breath. [6]

Mira climbed the slate path where the world wore thin, her pack heavy with driftwood collected from the valley's ancient shore. [27]

Each piece represented a choice, a turning point where she had once stood as guardian and chosen wrong. [45]

After the guardianship—that was how she measured time now. [55]

Before, she had been the keeper of the passage, the one who held the flute that sang between worlds. [74]

After, she was merely a collector of failures, arranging them like driftwood along mountain paths. [89]

The silence here was avalanchingly quiet. [95]

It gathered in the crevasses and pooled in the shadows between peaks, building mass like snow before a slide. [114]

One wrong sound could send it cascading into the void, taking whatever thin membrane remained between this world and the next. [135]

She paused at a junction of three paths and knelt, pulling weathered wood from her pack. [151]

The first piece she laid pointing east, toward the passage she had failed to protect. [166]

The second pointed west, toward the world she had let slip through her fingers. [180]

The third she set facing north, into the unknown territory where understanding might finally reside. [195]

Arranging driftwood as directional markers—it was primitive work for someone who had once navigated the weave with nothing but intuition and the flute's song. [220]

But she was harvesting insights from failure now, and failure demanded humility. [232]

The gilded reed flute waited in its case against her hip. [243]

She had not played it since the day the weave collapsed, since her student—her daughter—had stepped through a passage that should have held firm and vanished into silence. [273]

The guilt of it lived in Mira's fingers, which trembled whenever they touched the case. [288]

But understanding required returning to the wound. [295]

She followed the northern marker to a shelf of rock overlooking the range's deepest canyon. [310]

Here, the thunder-echoes were born—sounds that bounced between walls for so long that they eventually faded into something else entirely. [331]

Something that slipped between the folds of what was and what could be. [344]

Mira sat. [346]

She breathed. [348]

She made herself as still as the mountains themselves. [357]

Then, with the deliberate motion of one performing a ritual long delayed, she reached for the case and began to uncase the flute. [380]

The gilded surface caught no light—the sky was overcast, the sun a rumor—but it seemed to glow anyway, the way memory glows when you finally face it. [409]

The reed was still intact, still capable of carrying breath into song. [421]

She raised it to her lips. [427]

The first note emerged thin, uncertain. [433]

It fell into the canyon and disappeared. [440]

The second came stronger, finding the old pathways in the air where the weave had once been tight and true. [460]

She could feel the echoes building, the silence beginning to shift. [471]

Then she heard it—not a sound, but an absence of sound in a particular shape. [487]

Her daughter's last note, the one she had played as she stepped through. [500]

It had been bouncing through this canyon for three years, growing quieter, growing more precise in its meaning. [518]

It told her what she had missed: the flaw had not been in the weave. [533]

It had been in her teaching. [539]

She had been so focused on precision that she had never taught the art of recovery—how to catch yourself when a passage shifted, how to anchor back to the origin world. [571]

The insight cut deep. [575]

But cutting was what she had come for. [583]

Mira played again, a new melody this time. [591]

Weaving between worlds required more than perfect notes—it required knowing how to return from imperfect ones. [608]

She let the song fray at the edges, then pulled it back. [620]

Let it wander, then called it home. [627]

In the canyon below, something stirred. [633]

An echo that was not quite an echo. [641]

A presence that might have been waiting all this time for someone to finally understand. [656]

The silence held, avalanchingly quiet, as Mira learned to forgive herself one note at a time. [672]
