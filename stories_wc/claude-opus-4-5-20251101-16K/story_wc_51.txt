After the first snowmelt, when streams ran copper beneath the warming earth, Mireth descended to the bronze grotto to begin her work again. [23]

The kerosene lamp burner had waited all winter, its brass fitting cold against her palm. [38]

She struck a match and watched flame catch, throwing angular shadows across walls that curved inward like ribs of some great leviathan—a whalebone cathedral buried beneath the mountain. [67]

Mireth was a fractal weaver. [72]

Not of thread or light, but of burdens themselves. [81]

Through the grotto's open ceiling, starlight poured down in silver threads, mingling with the lamp's amber glow. [98]

The bronze walls caught both illuminations and multiplied them, creating patterns that repeated infinitely into stone—smaller and smaller iterations of the same arched chamber, each containing a tinier version of herself holding a tinier flame. [134]

She was boundary-lessly trapped here. [139]

Not by walls or locks, but by the very nature of her calling. [152]

The grotto extended forever inward through its fractal geometry, yet its single exit remained perpetually just beyond reach—always one more chamber away, one more iteration deeper. [178]

She could walk for eternity and never leave, nor ever reach a final end. [192]

This was the price for her gift: to collect the weights of different burdens that others could not carry. [211]

A shingled hush fell over the grotto as she prepared her loom. [223]

It was not mere silence but layered quiet—each bronze surface absorbing sound in overlapping waves, like shingles on a roof catching rain. [244]

In this profound stillness, she could hear the approach of her first supplicant: footsteps echoing down the entrance shaft, carrying with them the heavy resonance of grief. [271]

The woman who emerged was young, though her eyes held ancient exhaustion. [283]

She carried nothing visible, yet Mireth could see the burden coiled around her shoulders—the death of a child, perhaps, or the slow dissolution of love. [308]

Such weights left their marks in colors only fractal weavers could perceive. [320]

"I cannot bear it anymore," the woman said. [328]

Mireth gestured to the bronze floor before her loom. [337]

"Kneel here. [339]

By orienting properly, I can draw it from you." [348]

The woman obeyed, facing the direction Mireth indicated—toward the deepest iteration of the grotto, where fractal repetitions became too small to see. [371]

This alignment was essential. [375]

Burdens had gravity; they fell inward toward infinity. [383]

One had to face the depths to release them. [392]

Mireth began to weave. [396]

Her fingers moved through air that thickened like honey, pulling threads of sorrow from the woman's shoulders. [412]

The kerosene lamp burner flickered as each strand passed through its flame, the heat beginning the transformation. [428]

The burden fought her. [432]

They always did. [435]

Grief wanted to be carried; guilt demanded attention; shame clung with desperate fingers. [447]

But Mireth was patient. [451]

She wove the dark threads into patterns that reflected and repeated, each iteration smaller, until the weight distributed itself across infinite instances—each fragment bearing almost nothing. [478]

Then, slowly, she felt it calcify. [484]

The woven burden hardened in her hands, transforming from fluid anguish into solid stone. [497]

She set the small, dark pebble on the bronze floor, where it joined hundreds of others—a collection of sorrows turned to gravel. [519]

The woman rose, lighter. [523]

Her eyes remained sad, but she could stand straight now. [533]

"Will it stay gone?" she asked. [539]

"No burden ever fully disappears," Mireth replied. [546]

"But it will remain bearable. [551]

The weight is distributed now, shared across every reflection of this moment stretching into infinity." [566]

After the woman left, Mireth sat alone in the whalebone reverie of her grotto, surrounded by calcified sorrows and the endless bronze repetitions of herself. [590]

Starlight drifted down like memory. [595]

The lamp burned low. [599]

She thought of her own burden—the one that had brought her here, the one she could never weave away because she was both the weaver and the thread. [626]

To free others, she had traded her own freedom. [635]

To lighten countless hearts, she had accepted an infinite imprisonment. [645]

But when the next supplicant came, bearing their own impossible weight, Mireth would rise again, orient them properly toward the depths, and begin to weave. [671]

This was her purpose, her trap, her solace. [679]

The shingled hush embraced her, and she waited. [687]
