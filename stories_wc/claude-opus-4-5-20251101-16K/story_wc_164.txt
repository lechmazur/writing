Mira descended into the geode before the light could forget her name. [12]

The iridescent cave welcomed her with colors that had no business existing--purples that whispered, golds that hummed, crystalline walls throwing rainbows like children throw tantrums. [38]

She smiled at the beauty, though her heart carried its familiar weight. [50]

A sea-foam recollectionist learned early that the loveliest places often housed the saddest stories. [64]

The seeds were her guide. [69]

Scattered across the crystalline floor, they traced an erratic path deeper into the geode--dropped by a migrating bird that had sheltered here three springs ago, when the woman Mira sought had still remembered her own daughter's face. [107]

Now that woman was dying, and her memories were dissolving like salt in rain. [121]

Mira knelt beside a cluster of seeds, pressing her palm to the cool crystal beneath them. [137]

This was her gift, her curse, her purpose: she could transliterate emotions, reading the feelings that had soaked into places and objects, converting them into images she could understand. [166]

Here, where the seeds had fallen beside a handprint worn into quartz, she felt something stir. [182]

Joy. [183]

Bright and startled, like a gasp of delight. [191]

The crater glass hanging from her neck warmed against her skin. [202]

She lifted the dark disc--formed millennia ago when a star had kissed the earth hard enough to leave bruises--and peered through its smoky center. [228]

Through that ancient lens, emotions became visible. [235]

She saw her: a woman with silver hair, laughing at the bird that had landed on her shoulder. [253]

The creature had been carrying seeds in its beak, provisions for a journey it would never complete. [270]

When it died here, sheltered and peaceful, the seeds had spilled. [281]

The woman had wept, then smiled, then forgotten why she had come. [293]

Missing pieces. [295]

That was always the problem. [300]

Mira followed the seed-trail deeper, pausing wherever the scattered pattern suggested the woman had stopped. [315]

Each cluster told part of the story--fear near a narrow passage, wonder beneath a cathedral of amethyst spires, determination at a fork where one path simply ended. [343]

That was what Mira had come to understand: why some paths disappeared. [355]

The woman had been searching for the same answer, once. [365]

Before dementia had begun erasing her, she had been a cartographer of memory, mapping the routes that consciousness traveled. [384]

She had discovered that paths didn't fade randomly. [392]

They disappeared when no one walked them, when emotions stopped feeding them, when the last person who cared forgot to care. [413]

Mira made her conjectures carefully, piecing together fragments. [421]

The seeds showed her where the woman had wandered. [430]

The crater glass showed her what the woman had felt. [440]

But the missing pieces--the gaps where memory had already crumbled--those Mira could only guess at. [457]

She reached the cave's heart, where the largest crystals grew in formations that defied geometry. [472]

Here, the seeds ended in a perfect circle, as if arranged by intention. [485]

Through the crater glass, Mira saw the woman kneeling, crying, laughing. [496]

"I wanted to know," the phantom said, her transliterated emotions speaking words she had never voiced. [512]

"I wanted to know why my mother's path to me disappeared before she died. [526]

Why she stopped walking toward me." [532]

The answer hung in the iridescent air: because she forgot. [542]

Not from cruelty. [545]

Not from choice. [548]

Simply because minds could break, and broken minds could not hold all their paths. [562]

Mira lowered the glass. [566]

The woman's family had hired her to recover what could be saved--any memory, any feeling, any fragment that might help them say goodbye. [590]

She gathered the seeds gently, each one carrying an emotional fingerprint. [601]

She would bring them back. [606]

She would transliterate what remained into something the dying woman might recognize, some spark that could illuminate the path between mother and daughter one final time. [632]

The cave glittered around her, cheerfully indifferent to grief. [641]

But Mira found hope in that indifference. [648]

The crystals had witnessed countless stories dissolve into forgetting, yet they still threw light into darkness. [664]

Still made rainbows from nothing. [669]

Some paths disappeared, yes. [673]

But others could be walked again--if someone cared enough to follow the scattered seeds before memory faded entirely. [692]

She climbed toward daylight, carrying missing pieces home. [700]
