The morning fog saxophonist came to the grotto as dewdrops formed on stone. [13]

She always arrived at this hour, when mist gathered thick enough to touch. [26]

The radiant grotto had been her refuge for seven years now, ever since the coded prophecy first whispered itself through the crystals of the prism atrium. [52]

That structure rose from the grotto's heart, a geometric impossibility of glass and mineral that caught even the weakest light and scattered it into quietly vivid spectrums across the wet walls. [83]

She lifted her saxophone, its brass surface already beading with moisture, and pressed her lips to the mouthpiece. [100]

The first note emerged trembling, a low B-flat that the fog seemed to absorb rather than carry. [116]

This was her method: playing through negative space. [124]

Not the sounds themselves, but the silences between them, that was where her true work happened. [140]

The prophecy had been encoded in a melody her grandmother once hummed, a tune that seemed innocent until you understood its architecture. [162]

Each pause in that old song contained a syllable. [171]

String the silences together and you had words. [179]

String the words together and you had a future so terrible that hearing it would make it real. [196]

She had learned this too late. [202]

Her grandmother had hummed the prophecy to her as a child, not knowing what she transmitted. [218]

Years later, a linguist had decoded it during a research visit to this very grotto, where the prism atrium's unique acoustics allowed him to isolate the negative spaces between notes. [248]

He had begun to whisper the translation aloud. [256]

She had silenced him before he finished. [263]

Not violently, simply by playing. [268]

Her saxophone had filled every silence, left no gap for the terrible words to occupy. [283]

The linguist had forgotten what he was saying mid-sentence, his mind unable to hold the prophecy without its scaffolding of quiet. [304]

Now she maintained the vested hush. [310]

Dawn after dawn, she returned as dewdrops formed, as mist pooled in the grotto's bowl-shaped floor, as the prism atrium began its daily transformation from dark geometry to scattered rainbows. [343]

She played not songs but interruptions, a note wherever silence might gather, a tone to fill any pause that threatened to coalesce into meaning. [369]

The grotto remembered everything. [373]

Sound lingered here in ways she did not understand, echoing for years in frequencies below human hearing. [390]

Her grandmother's humming still lived in these walls, waiting. [399]

The prophecy kept trying to reassemble itself. [406]

Some mornings she felt it pushing back against her saxophone, the negative spaces growing deeper, more insistent. [423]

The coded syllables strained toward coherence like water seeking its level. [434]

This morning felt different. [438]

The mist hung heavier than usual, and the prism atrium's light seemed to pulse rather than scatter. [455]

Dewdrops formed on the crystals and fell in patterns that seemed almost deliberate. [468]

She tasted eerie nostalgia on her tongue, that particular flavor of returning to a place that has changed while you were away, even when you were never truly away. [498]

The grotto was remembering something new. [504]

She pressed harder into her playing, filling silences she had not noticed before. [517]

Through negative space, the prophecy had been expanding. [525]

New pauses had opened between the old ones, creating room for additional syllables. [538]

The future her grandmother had encoded was growing more specific, more detailed, more inevitable with each dawn. [554]

She understood then that she could not play forever. [563]

Her vested hush was borrowed time, nothing more. [571]

The quietly vivid colors from the prism atrium painted her fingers as they worked the keys, and she found herself wondering what the prophecy's final words might be. [600]

Perhaps they concerned her. [604]

Perhaps they always had. [608]

She lowered the saxophone and let one silence grow. [617]

In it, she heard her grandmother's voice begin to whisper, ancient and coded and patient. [632]

The dewdrops continued to form. [637]

The mist continued to gather. [642]

And in the radiant grotto, surrounded by prismatic light and the weight of what could not stay unspoken forever, she listened at last to what the negative space had always been trying to say. [676]
