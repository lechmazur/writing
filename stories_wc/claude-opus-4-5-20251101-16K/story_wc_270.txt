The hot springs of Mount Kerra had always been sacred, but now, during the reconstruction, they served as refuge for those the old regime had marked for death. [28] Grandmother Sora climbed the sulfur-stained path, her joints protesting every step. [39] She had earned the title "insurgent" thirty years before her first grandchild was born. [53] Now her grandchildren were grown, the war was over, and she had one final act of rebellion left. [71]

The amber rested against her chest, suspended on a cord beneath her worn robes. [85] Inside it, barely visible, floated what the Temple Keepers had called humanity's implanted destiny—an embryo from the First Age, preserved when their ancestors chose the future rather than letting it unfold naturally. [118]

The plants whispered to her as she walked. [126] The moss spoke of moisture. [131] The twisted pines murmured about minerals. [137] She hadn't asked for this gift—it had come accidentally, after the bombing that killed her daughter and left Sora buried for three days beneath rubble thick with root systems. [167] When they pulled her out, she could hear the green world speaking. [179]

"You're troubled," said the lichen on the rocks, sensing her cortisol through her breath. [193]

"I'm always troubled," she replied. [198]

The hot springs steamed before her, terraced pools descending from the volcanic vent. [211] Prayer flags from the old temple still fluttered from crumbling posts, torn and faded. [225] One flag had torn free completely—not a flag, she realized. [236] A kite. [238] A child's kite, abandoned perhaps when the evacuation orders came. [248]

Sora retrieved it from where it had tangled in dead brush. [259] The tail was made of cloth strips, and on those strips, someone had painted words in the old script—the temple language that only priests had been permitted to read. [289] But Sora had spent years in the insurgency learning what the Temple Keepers had forbidden. [304] She traced the faded characters with her thumbnail. [312]

"Open the amber when the waters run true, when war becomes memory and hate becomes dew, when the keeper of green speaks without voice, then unseal what was stolen, and offer the choice." [345]

Her hands trembled. [348] The prophecy wasn't about her—couldn't be. [355] Yet here she stood: a plant-speaker, in the sacred springs, during the reconstruction when they were finally rebuilding rather than destroying. [376]

The ferns along the pool's edge swayed toward her. [385] "You carry life that waits," they whispered. [392] "We can feel it sleeping." [397]

"It's not for me to wake," Sora said. [405]

"No," agreed the ferns. [409] "It's for you to offer." [414]

This was why she had come. [420] The Temple Keepers had used the embryo to control her people for generations—claiming only they could read destiny, only they could interpret what the preserved life-form meant. [448] They had made the future into a cage. [456]

But tradition didn't have to mean stagnation. [463] Sora wanted to evolve what her people believed, not with violence or abandonment, but with intent. [479] With choice. [481]

She lowered herself into the warm water, feeling decades of tension release. [493] The amber grew warm against her skin. [500] She pressed her thumb to the seal—the same seal temple priests had claimed was unbreakable without divine permission. [519]

It cracked open like a ripe fruit. [526]

Inside, the embryo had long since fossilized into something like a seed. [538] When it touched the mineral-rich water, it began to dissolve, releasing golden particles that spread through the pool and sank into the surrounding soil. [562]

The plants erupted into excited chatter all around her. [571] "New thoughts!" they cried. [575] "New memories joining us!" [579]

Sora understood then. [582] The embryo hadn't been a single destiny—it had been genetic memory, the collected adaptations of all ancestors before the First Age. [604] The Temple Keepers had hoarded it, dispensing only fragments, keeping her people dependent. [617] Now it belonged to the earth itself. [624] Anyone could access it. [628] Everyone could choose which traditions to carry forward. [636]

"Grandmother?" [637] A voice from the path. [642] Her granddaughter Emi, who had followed her here. [650] "What did you do?" [654]

Sora smiled, feeling the plants welcome the girl with the same whispers they offered her. [669]

"I gave you the past," she said. [676] "What you build from it is your choice." [684]

The reconstruction continued, but now it would be something new. [694] Evolved, with intent. [697]
