Nadia pressed her palm against the cold viewport, watching the clouds churn beneath the floating observatory. [16] Three years since the wedding that ended in fire. [24] Three years since she stopped believing in futures and started hunting for them instead. [37]

The console beeped - circuit breakers cooling, systems cycling down for the mandatory rest period. [50] She had eighteen minutes before she could resume calculations. [59]

She reached for the geode crystal on her workstation, its hollow interior catching the dim emergency lights. [74] Her brother had given it to her the morning of the wedding, before the drones came, before the algorithm decided their celebration looked like a gathering of militants. [103] The crystal survived because she'd left it in the car. [114] She survived because she'd gone back for her phone charger. [124]

Through perturbation theory, she had learned to detect the ripples. [134] Small disturbances in the quantum foam suggested potential energy pooling in specific locations - not kinetic, not thermal, but something else entirely. [155] The unused kind. [158] The futures that never happened. [163]

Dr. Vasquez called her work "theoretical indulgence." [170] The funding committee called it "promising but premature." [178] Nadia called it the hunt. [183]

She turned the geode in her hands, remembering how her brother described the formation process - pressure and time creating hollow beauty from rock. [206] She wondered if she was becoming the same, or if she was just becoming hollow. [221]

The observatory drifted at forty thousand feet, positioned to minimize atmospheric interference with her delicate instruments. [237] Up here, she could sense what others couldn't: the pools of potential that accumulated around moments of truncated possibility. [256] They were intangibly tangible - registering on her sensors as definite readings while remaining impossible to capture, collect, or contain. [275]

Every drone strike. [278] Every car accident. [281] Every disease that took someone before their time. [289] Potential pooled there like water seeking its level, and Nadia had dedicated her remaining years to finding where unused potential pools, to understanding why it gathered and what it meant. [319]

The perturbation equations sprawled across her screens, each one describing how small changes rippled outward, how possibility states collapsed and reformed. [342] She wasn't trying to bring anyone back. [349] She wasn't that delusional. [353] But she needed to know if the futures they would have had - Karim's career, Yara's children, her mother's garden in spring - existed somewhere in the quantum substrate. [380]

The answer, she was beginning to understand, was yes. [389] And it was devastating. [393]

Seven minutes remaining on the circuit breakers. [400] She stared at the geode's crystal teeth, their edges catching light like frozen screams. [414]

Her latest readings showed a massive pool forming over a hospital in Lagos. [427] Another over a refugee camp in Sudan. [434] Potential accumulating like a debt the universe refused to pay. [444] She tracked these pools the way meteorologists tracked storms, charting their growth and movement, publishing findings that made other physicists uncomfortable. [465]

Because if unused potential was real, if it persisted and pooled, then the universe kept receipts. [481] Every cut-short life left a scar in the probability field. [491] Every stolen future remained as a kind of ghost math, intangibly tangible, forever almost. [505]

This was her unfiltered awakening - seeing the wound without bandages, without the comfortable lie that death meant endings rather than accumulations. [525] Nadia felt the familiar rush, the bleak exhilaration her therapist named before Nadia stopped attending sessions. [541] The terrible joy of seeing clearly, of mapping the loss that others preferred to forget. [556]

The circuit breakers clicked. [560] Systems hummed back online. [564]

She positioned the geode at the focal point of her sensor array, using its crystalline geometry to filter incoming quantum fluctuations. [582] The readings sharpened. [585] Lagos was growing. [588] Sudan was growing. [591] And there - a new signature forming over a school in Yemen. [602]

The world was filling with unused potential, with all those unlived lives pooling, waiting. [616]

She didn't know yet what would happen when the pools reached critical mass. [629] Perhaps nothing. [631] Perhaps everything. [633] But she would hunt that truth through every perturbation equation, every cooling cycle, every minute the universe gave her. [652]

Because she survived when forty-three others didn't. [660] Because the algorithm spared her and she refused to waste that accident on forgetting. [674]

Nadia began typing, the geode glowing faintly in her peripheral vision, and the floating observatory carried her higher into the dark where the readings were clearest and the ghosts of possibility swirled like slow storms beneath an indifferent sky. [716]
