The observation deck stretched endlessly now, a cathedral of glass and silence where seconds pooled like spilled mercury. [18] Mira pressed her palm against the viewport, watching distant stars blur into threads—light itself confused by the temporal distortion that had made her both blessed and cursed. [44]

Three years had passed outside since the shutdown. [52] For Mira, temporally stretched across the anomaly's edge, it had been seventeen days. [65] Or perhaps seventeen centuries. [69] Time had lost its meaning here, and she had lost everything else. [81]

They called her the blessed pariah. [87] The radiation from the dilation core had killed the other twelve researchers in minutes. [100] It had transformed Mira into something that couldn't leave—her cells now synchronized with the deck's fractured timeline, her body a living paradox. [122] The rescue ships had come and gone, their crews aging years in the hours they spent trying to reach her. [142] Eventually, they stopped coming. [146]

The echoed silence of the empty station pressed against her ears like water. [159]

She opened her grandmother's journal, its leather cover worn soft by three generations of hands. [173] The gilded compass rose applique on the front caught the starlight, gleaming despite the darkness. [187] Her grandmother had sewn it there herself, needle and thread binding metal to leather in the same patient way she'd bound their family together. [211]

"Find your true north," she used to say, "even when the stars lie." [224]

Tonight was an anniversary. [228] Not of the accident—Mira had stopped counting those—but of something older. [240] Every year since her grandmother first looked up at the sky over Kansas, the women in her family had sketched the constellations on this date. [265] Her mother had continued the tradition from their rooftop in Chicago. [276] Mira had carried it to the lunar academy, then to the research station, then here, to this deck suspended between moments. [296]

She took out her charcoal pencil. [302] Through the viewport, the stars weren't stars anymore—they were smeared suggestions of light, their positions meaningless in the dilated space. [322] But Mira sketched anyway. [326] She drew what she remembered. [331] What she imagined. [334] What she hoped the sky still looked like to everyone she'd lost. [346]

The custom had always been about connection. [353] Recording shared constellations meant sharing the same sky, even across distance. [364] Now, Mira realized, it meant something more. [371] Each sketch was an anchor. [376] A refusal to drift entirely into the stretching void. [385]

She glimpsed, in the slow accumulation of drawings, a pattern she hadn't seen before. [398] Her grandmother's sketches showed Polaris steady and bright. [407] Her mother's captured its slight drift over decades. [415] Mira's own drawings—dozens now, spanning what might have been months or moments—revealed something else entirely. [429] The north star moved in her sketches like a heartbeat. [439] Flickering. [440] Reaching. [441]

True north wasn't a fixed point. [447] It never had been. [451]

She touched the compass rose applique, its gilded edges sharp against her fingertip. [463] Her grandmother had never meant for her to find a destination. [474] She'd meant for Mira to find direction. [481] Motion. [482] Purpose through movement, not arrival. [487]

The confusion that had paralyzed her since the shutdown began to shift. [499] If time here didn't flow, then she would flow through it. [511] If rescue couldn't reach her, she would reach toward something else. [523] The sketches weren't just memory—they were navigation. [531] Each line was a course correction, teaching her to steer by unreliable stars. [544]

Mira turned to a fresh page. [550] The observation deck hummed with its strange, stretched silence, but she no longer heard emptiness. [565] She heard potential. [568] The quiet between heartbeats. [572] The pause before a first step. [578]

She began to draw not what she saw, but where she wanted to go. [592] The stars emerged beneath her charcoal in impossible configurations—constellations of hope, mapped by a woman learning to turn confusion into exploration. [614]

Outside, light continued its slow dance with distorted time. [624] Inside, Mira found her true north at last. [633] Not a star. [636] Not a place. [639] A direction: forward, always forward, guided by the same stubborn inheritance that had kept her family looking up for generations. [658]

The gilded compass rose caught the light once more as she closed the journal. [672] Tomorrow—whatever tomorrow meant here—she would sketch again. [681] And again. [683] Until motion itself became home. [688]
