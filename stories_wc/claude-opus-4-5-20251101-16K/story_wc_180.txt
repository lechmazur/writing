Mira's fingers trembled as she threaded the silver wire through another fractured quartz lens, her workbench balanced precariously among the apple branches that twisted through the cathedral's broken rafters. [31] The abandoned sanctuary had become an orchard over decades, fruit trees climbing through shattered stained glass, their roots drinking from the baptismal font below. [52] She'd lived here three seasons now, after the breach of contract, after the Opticians' Guild had dissolved her partnership and scattered her reputation like ash. [73]

The guild had promised her secrets would remain hers. [82] They'd lied. [84]

"You're still doing it wrong," said the girl perched on a neighboring branch, her legs swinging irreverently above the thirty-foot drop to the nave. [105] Sera had arrived two weeks ago, claiming to be a runaway apprentice from the southern chapter, though Mira suspected otherwise. [124] The girl was endearingly feisty, challenging every instruction, questioning every technique, yet returning each morning despite Mira's dismissals. [141]

"I've been mending quartz eyes for forty years," Mira replied without looking up. [154] "Before you were a thought in your mother's mind." [164]

"Which is why you're stuck in your methods." [173] Sera dropped down to sit beside her. [180] "The Guild teaches new calibrations now." [187]

"The Guild teaches theft and betrayal now." [194] Mira set down her tools, studying the girl's face in the green-filtered light. [208] Something familiar lurked in those features—the stubborn jaw, the way her eyebrows pinched when thinking. [223] "Why do you persist in coming here?" [230]

Sera shrugged, but her casual mask slipped. [237] "Someone has to bridge generational wisdom before it dies completely." [247] The phrase struck Mira like recognition, an echo of words she'd once spoken to her own daughter, Calla, before the estrangement, before the silence that stretched into years. [275]

"Where did you hear that phrase?" [281]

Instead of answering, Sera reached into her satchel and withdrew a faded blue ribbon. [294] Mira's breath caught. [297] She knew that ribbon—had tied it into Calla's braids on her naming day, had watched it flutter behind her daughter as she ran through summer fields. [323]

"She kept it," Sera said quietly. [329] "My mother kept everything of yours." [336]

The cathedral seemed to hold its breath. [343] Pears hung heavy overhead, and Mira thought of deciduous vows—the promises she'd made to the guild, yes, but also to her family, oaths that had fallen away like leaves each time her work consumed her. [379] Seasonal commitments, she'd told herself. [385] The craft mattered more than continuity. [391]

But leaves grew back, didn't they? [397]

"Calla sent you?" [400]

"She's too proud." [403] Sera smiled—Calla's smile, unmistakably. [408] "But she taught me everything she remembered of your work, and I found the rest in a bag she'd forgotten in the attic. [430] Your old journals, your experimental lenses, your letters you never sent." [442] Sera spread items across the workbench: yellowed papers, scratched crystals, dried herbs for lens-cleaning solutions lost to modern practice. [460]

Using forgotten bag contents, Mira traced her own handwriting, decades old, describing methods the Guild had stripped from their archives. [478] Here was the proof of her innovations, the techniques they'd claimed as their own after the breach. [494]

"She wants me to learn properly," Sera continued. [502] "From you. [504] She said wisdom shouldn't skip generations just because one generation couldn't apologize." [515]

Mira laughed despite herself—the accidental wisdom of her daughter's grudging gesture, sending her own child to heal what pride had wounded. [534] The orchard rustled above them, dropping blossoms like snow, and she understood suddenly that deciduous didn't mean dead. [552] It meant cycles. [555] It meant return. [558]

"Your technique is atrocious," Mira said finally, picking up Sera's practice lens. [570] "But it's fixable." [573]

Sera grinned, triumphant and tender. [578] "So you'll teach me?" [582]

"I'll teach you what I should have taught your mother." [592] Mira tied the faded ribbon around her wrist—a tether, a promise, a vow that would shed and renew but never fully fall. [614] "Starting with patience, which neither of you inherited." [623]

The cathedral's trees whispered their ancient agreement, and somewhere in the world beyond these walls, Mira imagined Calla waiting, perhaps practicing her own difficult words. [649] The breach had happened. [653] Contracts had shattered. [656] But some promises lived in ribbons and journals and stubborn granddaughters who climbed into ruined sanctuaries demanding knowledge. [673]

Mira adjusted her granddaughter's grip on the silver wire. [682] Outside, the season was turning, leaves preparing their annual surrender. [692] But here in the rafters, surrounded by fruit and forgiveness, new growth was just beginning. [707]

"Again," Mira said. [710] "And this time, trust the quartz to tell you where it needs healing." [723]

Sera nodded, concentrating, persisting, and Mira felt something deciduous in her own heart finally returning to bloom. [740]
