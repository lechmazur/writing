The world glided now. [4] After friction disappeared, everything moved with terrible grace--waves that never crashed, only slid up the shore like silk unspooling against glass. [26] Kiri stood on the tidal bluff, watching eels drift through water that offered no resistance, their sinuous bodies undulating in patterns that had become her obsession. [52]

She was precognitively cursed. [56] Every future arrived in her mind three days before it solidified into real--never enough time to change anything meaningful, always enough time to make her complicit in whatever came. [85] The gift had made her elusive, had driven her from the coastal villages to become what the fishing folk whispered about: the eel herder who lived where land met aurora, who spoke to slithering things and read prophecy in their movements. [125]

Tonight, the sky burned green and violet. [133] The aurora draped itself across the darkness like borrowed dawn--light that didn't belong to this hour, warmth that wouldn't last. [154] Kiri knelt on the cold basalt, arranging her painted rocks in mathematical sequences. [167] Fibonacci spirals. [169] Prime number chains. [172] Golden ratios nested within golden ratios. [178] These were the patterns her grandmother had shown her before dying, configurations the old woman said connected all living things to the collapsed cores of ancient stars. [204]

The collapsed star dust sat in a clay jar beside her knee. [216] Denser than anything on Earth should be--a thimbleful of matter from a sun that had died screaming into itself millennia ago, compressing its fire into impossible weight. [243] Her grandmother had given it to her along with a lingering promise: understand the sacred patterns, child, and you will harness what the universe has hidden from lesser eyes. [272]

For thirty years, that promise had kept her alive through visions of disaster and loss. [286]

The eels knew friction was gone before humans did. [295] They'd changed their migrations, swimming in configurations that echoed the mathematics Kiri laid out in stone. [310] She'd followed them here, to this bluff where three currents met and the magnetic fields sang strange songs through her bones. [329] Tonight, her visions had shown her something new--not tragedy, for once, but completion. [342] An answer. [344] A fulfillment of everything she'd chased across decades of solitude. [354]

She placed the seventh rock, red ochre spiraling to its center, at the precise distance the sequence demanded. [371] The painted surface--stars, waves, eels intertwining in ancient iconography--caught the aurora's shifting light. [385]

Nothing happened. [387] Then everything did. [390]

The collapsed star dust began to glow. [397]

Kiri had seen this moment three days ago, but seeing and understanding were different beasts entirely. [412] The patterns she'd been arranging weren't mere symbols--they were instructions. [423] The mathematics told the star dust how to remember what it had been before collapse, before gravity crushed its light into impossible density. [445]

The sacred patterns were a language the universe spoke to itself. [456]

Below the bluff, her eels rose to the surface in their hundreds, their silver bodies forming the same spiral she'd laid in stone. [477] The aurora intensified above, ribbons of light descending to touch the frictionless water, and Kiri understood finally why friction had vanished from the world--it was preparation. [504] The universe was smoothing itself for something to move through it, something vast and fundamental that could not tolerate resistance. [523]

The star dust lifted from its jar, motes of impossible light drifting upward. [536]

Her grandmother's promise hadn't been about power or prophecy. [545] It had been about connection--about showing Kiri that consciousness itself followed patterns, that her curse was simply awareness of the sequence before it completed its turn. [572] Every tragedy she'd witnessed had been a pattern reaching its conclusion. [583] Every joy, the same. [587]

She could harness this. [591] Not control it--never that--but join it. [599] Become part of the pattern rather than its eternal witness. [608]

The borrowed dawn of the aurora grew brighter as Kiri placed the final stone in its ordained position. [625] The eels spiraled below like living mathematics. [632] The star dust sang frequencies that predated language. [640]

And for the first time in thirty years, Kiri saw no future at all--only an infinite, frictionless present where understanding and being became the same sacred thing. [671]

She smiled, and let the pattern take her home. [680]
