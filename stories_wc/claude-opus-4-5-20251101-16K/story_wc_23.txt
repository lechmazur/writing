Mira became a patchwork navigator the night the hydraulics failed, when the great antenna dishes of Signal Station Twelve groaned and froze mid-arc, pointed forever at a patch of sky where nothing broadcast anymore. [37]

She should have left then, like the others, but she stayed among the starlit towers and rusted gantries because leaving felt like another kind of dying. [62] Her daughter had been dead three months, and Mira had nowhere else to carry that weight. [77]

The first call came at midnight on a waning crescent. [87] A woman's voice, fractured by static: "I need to find my way back to him." [101] Mira had said wrong number, but the voice persisted, giving coordinates that matched no map she knew, describing a landscape of ash and water and terrible, tender light. [129]

She understood then that the station had always been listening to more than radio waves. [144]

Now she builds something new each night, using salvaged parts and intuition, stitching together frequencies from the station's dead equipment and her own grief-sharpened instincts. [169] A patchwork navigator, charting routes through territories that exist only in loss. [181] The calls come reliably at midnight, always midnight, voices seeking passage home. [193]

Reverse migration, she calls it. [198] The way the dead sometimes need to travel backward through the geography they left behind, touching each place of meaning before they can rest. [221] And the living who call her, the grieving ones who somehow find her number, they need to trace those paths too, to understand where their loved ones went. [249]

Her abilities fluctuate with moon phases, strongest when the sky is darkest, when the station's broken dishes seem to drink in frequencies beyond human hearing. [274] On full moons, she can barely hear anything, the light too loud somehow. [287] But in the deep darks, the new moons and the slivers, the dead speak clearly and she can guide them home. [307]

She keeps a patina bronze censer foot on her console, the only thing she took from her daughter's apartment. [324] Elena had found it at an estate sale, loved how the verdigris made it look like something rescued from the sea. [344] "A foot without a body," Elena had laughed. [352] "Like me, wandering." [355]

Now Mira holds it during the hardest calls, when a father needs to find his son or a child seeks her grandmother, and the cold bronze anchors her. [380] It reminds her that fragments can still be precious, that a foot can still carry weight even severed from its whole. [400]

Tonight's call comes precisely at midnight. [406]

"I'm lost," says a voice she knows better than her own heartbeat. [418]

Mira's hands shake on the bronze. [424] "Elena." [425]

"Mom." [426] Static crackles like fire. [430] "I've been trying to come back. [436] I keep getting turned around." [441]

Mira closes her eyes and reaches for her charts, the ones she's built from three months of calls, the patchwork maps of loss she's assembled from other people's grief. [467] She knows this territory now. [472] She has walked it in her sleep. [479]

"Tell me what you see," Mira whispers. [486]

Elena describes the apartment they shared when she was small, the hospital room at the end, the stretch of highway where she lost control. [507] Reverse migration. [509] Traveling backward through every place that mattered. [516]

"There's a signal station," Elena says finally. [523] "Under so many stars." [527]

"That's where I am." [531] Mira's voice breaks. [534] "That's where I've been waiting." [539]

Through the cryptic phone calls at midnight, mother and daughter build a bridge out of words and frequency and longing. [556] Mira guides Elena through the final passages, the places between, speaking landmarks of memory until she feels the air in the station change, feels something settle beside her like warmth, like breath, like the brush of a hand she cannot see. [598]

The bronze censer foot grows warm in her palm. [607]

"I found you," Elena murmurs, or maybe it's just the wind through the broken station, or maybe there's no difference anymore. [627]

Mira sits in the starlight, surrounded by her maps and equipment, her patchwork tools of navigation. [643] She has guided hundreds home, but tonight she finally understands why she stayed when the hydraulics failed. [660] Not to run from grief, but to build within it. [670] To become someone who could chart the geography of loss until she knew it well enough to find her own daughter wandering there. [692]

The next call will come tomorrow at midnight. [700] Another voice, another journey, another chance to offer raw solace to the lost. [714] But for now, Mira holds the bronze foot and listens to the silence where her daughter rests, finally home, and finds something almost like peace in the wreckage of everything broken. [747]
