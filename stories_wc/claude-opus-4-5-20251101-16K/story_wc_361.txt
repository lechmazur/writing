Mira's hands trembled as they always did, fingers twitching against the leather satchel strapped to her hip. [17] The ridgeway stretched before her, ancient stone markers rising like crooked teeth against curtains of green and violet light that rippled across the sky. [44] She was a courier of relics, carrying fragments of the old world to collectors who paid well and asked few questions. [65] Most deliveries were mundane--broken ceramics, corroded coins, faded manuscripts. [75] But tonight's cargo made her pulse race faster than usual. [85]

The dragonfly-wing pendant rested against her chest, suspended from a cord of spider-silk. [98] It was not part of her delivery. [105] It was the last gift from Tessoran, her mentor, who had vanished three summers past without explanation or farewell. [124]

"You're too nervous," Tessoran had told her once, watching Mira fumble with a package. [138] "You rush through moments as if they're obstacles. [146] You must learn to stay." [151]

Tessoran had been the finest courier in the northern territories, but she never hurried. [165] She would stop to watch clouds form shapes, would share bread with strangers and listen to their stories until the fire burned low. [188] She had a gift for extending brief encounters into something more--not through magic, Mira had assumed, but through presence. [208]

Now Mira understood differently. [212]

The pendant began to hum against her skin, a vibration so subtle she might have imagined it. [229] But she knew better. [233] The aurora overhead intensified, colors bleeding into one another, and Mira felt her heartbeat slow despite herself. [250]

A figure stood beside the path ahead--an old woman gathering herbs in the silver light. [266] In her ordinary haste, Mira would have nodded and passed by. [277] Instead, she stopped. [280]

"Nightroot," the woman said without looking up. [287] "Grows only when the lights dance. [293] Good for trembling hands." [297]

Mira's fingers stilled. [300] The pendant hummed stronger now, vibrating sympathetically with something in the air, in the aurora itself. [316] Time seemed to stretch like honey from a spoon. [325]

"My teacher collected nightroot," Mira heard herself say. [333] "She said it could germinate dreams." [339]

The old woman finally looked up. [345] Her eyes reflected green fire. [350] "Tessoran was your teacher?" [354]

The name struck like a bell. [360]

"She passed through here often, across many years," the woman continued. [371] "Always stopping, always listening. [375] She understood that routine is where wonder hides. [383] We must coax it out gently, like seedlings from dark soil." [394]

"Where did she go?" [398]

"The same place all couriers go eventually. [405] Into the spaces between." [409] The woman pressed something into Mira's palm--a handful of small seeds. [421] "These have been waiting. [425] Tessoran said you would come." [430]

The pendant's vibration intensified until Mira felt it resonating with her own bones, with the aurora, with the ancient stones of the ridgeway. [453] Understanding bloomed within her. [457] Tessoran's gift had never been patience alone. [464] The pendant, by vibrating sympathetically with the world, extended moments, created space for wonder to germinate in the cracks of ordinary time. [486]

The old woman had vanished when Mira looked up. [495] Perhaps she had been there, perhaps not--the boundary between real and story grew thin along these heights. [513]

Mira knelt and pressed the seeds into the cold earth beside the path. [526] She remained there, trembling hands stilled at last, watching the aurora paint the darkness. [540] She extended this brief encounter as long as she could, feeling Tessoran's memory blur into something larger--not a person anymore, but a way of being, a myth of presence passed from teacher to student. [575]

When she finally rose, the soil where she had planted showed tiny green shoots, impossibly quick, as though time had folded itself to accommodate growth. [600]

Mira walked on through the aurora-lit ridgeway, carrying her relics toward their destination. [613] But she no longer rushed. [618] She was learning what her absent mentor had known--that the fade from memory to myth is not a loss, but a transformation. [641] That wonder lives in pausing. [646] That even a jittery courier can become a keeper of elongated moments. [658]

She touched the dragonfly-wing pendant once, feeling it thrum with sympathetic light, and continued into the dancing night. [676]
