The staircase had no beginning Vera could remember and no end she could imagine. [14] She climbed anyway. [17]

That was who she was--a grim optimist, someone who carried darkness in her chest but still reached for the next step, the next breath, the next impossible hope. [43] In her pocket, she kept a pair of dice, one of them chipped at the corner where the six met the five. [62] She rolled them sometimes, watching probability play out against the marble steps, each result a small defiance against the monotony of perpetual motion. [85]

The stairs wound upward in an endless spiral, and Vera had long ago accepted that time here was meaningless. [101] There was no dawn, no dusk, no decay of her body to mark the passage of anything. [117] Just the climb. [120] Just the boundless confinement of infinity stretching in both directions. [129]

But she was balancedly daring--not reckless enough to throw herself into the void, not passive enough to simply sit and let eternity consume her. [153] She observed. [155] She counted. [157] She filled notebooks with equations, tracking the dimensions of each step, the curvature of the spiral, the patterns in how sound traveled. [177]

Through mathematical proofs, she sought the rupture. [184]

Somewhere in this architecture of endlessness, there had to be a break--a flaw in the perpetual motion that kept her climbing. [204] Nothing could be truly infinite, she reasoned. [211] Even infinity had boundaries in mathematics, limits that defined its behavior. [222] If she could find the equation that governed this place, she could find where it failed. [238]

The chipped die reminded her why she bothered. [246]

She had held these dice on the night everything changed--or rather, didn't change. [259] Marcus had asked her to stay. [265] His hand on hers, his voice breaking in the kitchen light, and she had been rolling these dice, a nervous habit, when the chip happened. [290] One die striking the counter's edge. [296] One moment fragmenting. [299]

She had left anyway. [303] Walked out into the rain toward the job, the city, the life she thought mattered. [318] She never saw him again. [323] Not because he died--she would have heard--but because some doors, once closed, become walls. [337] The texture of that missed opportunity haunted her: the warmth of his palm, the specific quality of light through the window, the weight of words she never said. [364]

She didn't know how she had arrived on this staircase. [374] One moment she was aging in a small apartment, surrounded by success that tasted like ash; the next, she was here, climbing. [396]

But the proofs were leading somewhere. [402]

Vera sat on step number 847,293--she had counted--and spread her notebooks across the cold marble. [418] The spiral's curvature wasn't constant; she had measured enough to know. [428] There were micro-variations, so small they seemed like errors, but mathematics didn't make errors. [441] Mathematics revealed. [443]

She ran the calculations again. [448] The variations formed a pattern, a frequency, like a heartbeat buried in the architecture. [462] And at certain intervals--every 847,293 steps, she realized with a jolt--the pattern suggested a weakness. [477] A point where the staircase's self-perpetuating geometry folded slightly inward. [487]

A rupture waiting to happen. [492]

She stood. [494] Her legs didn't ache anymore; bodies here didn't suffer ordinary wear. [505] But her heart--that still worked. [510] That still remembered how to race. [516]

Vera pulled out the dice. [521] The chipped one caught the sourceless light, its flaw visible, beautiful in its imperfection. [534] She didn't roll them. [538] Instead, she pressed them to her lips, a prayer and a promise. [550]

She stepped forward, past the point she had measured, and pressed her hand against the wall of the staircase where it should be weakest. [575] The marble felt warm. [579] Alive. [580]

She pushed. [582]

The rupture opened like a wound in fabric--not violent, but profound, a peeling back of reality itself. [599] Through the gap, she saw not an exit but a moment: Marcus in the kitchen, hand extended, waiting. [616] The light through the window. [621] The rain. [623]

Vera understood then. [626] This place wasn't a prison. [631] It was a question, asked over and over: What would you choose? [643]

She stepped through, balancedly daring one final time, ready to capture the texture of what she had missed, ready to speak the words she had carried through infinity. [670]

The staircase continued behind her, perpetual and patient, waiting for the next climber who needed to find their rupture point. [690]
