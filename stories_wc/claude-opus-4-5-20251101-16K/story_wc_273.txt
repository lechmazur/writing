Vera tracked time the way others tracked animals—by the traces it left behind. [13]

The eclipse had ended seventeen minutes ago, and light returned to the wind-carved encampment like something stolen and reluctantly given back. [34] The sandstone pillars surrounding her tent stood sculpted by centuries of desert gales, their surfaces etched with patterns that resembled frozen screams. [52] She felt kinship with them. [57]

Her pale fingers uncorked the vial of disappearing ink, the liquid inside shimmering with an iridescence that existed only in the moments before it vanished. [79] She poured it deliberately onto the stone table, watching it pool and spread. [92] The artificial hummingbird drone hovering at her shoulder recorded everything, its mechanical wings beating with precise silence. [108]

"Document pattern sequence forty-three," she murmured, and the drone's emerald eye pulsed in acknowledgment. [122]

Vera was consciously wild—a choice made after the accident, after the moment that had fractured her understanding of reality. [139] She had abandoned the research institutes with their sterile corridors and rigid methodologies. [151] Now she lived here, where wind spoke louder than human voices, where she could pursue her obsession without interference. [168]

The ink began forming patterns as it evaporated. [176] Spirals emerged, then dissolved. [180] Fractals bloomed and faded. [184] Each configuration lasted only seconds, ephemeral blueprints of something vast and incomprehensible. [195]

She needed to know why time slowed in crisis. [204]

Three years ago, her brother had fallen from a cliff face during a field expedition. [218] Vera had watched him drop, and in those seconds—which should have been seconds—she had experienced what felt like minutes. [236] Every detail crystallized: the terror in his eyes, the way his fingers grasped at nothing, the precise angle of sunlight catching his wedding ring. [258] Time had stretched like molten glass, giving her an eternity to witness what she could not prevent. [274]

He had disappeared into the canyon below. [281] They never recovered the body. [286]

The eclipse phenomenon was her latest avenue of investigation. [295] During astronomical alignments, the ink patterns grew more complex, more revealing. [307] The hummingbird drone captured evidence that disappeared as quickly as it formed—proof that something existed between moments, in the spaces where time bent under pressure. [332]

A new pattern emerged in the ink now, more elaborate than any she had documented. [347] It resembled a doorway, its edges crisp before they softened into vapor. [360]

Vera's anger was serene, the kind that had calcified into something permanent and patient. [374] She did not rage against the universe for taking her brother. [385] Instead, she dissected its mechanisms with cold precision, determined to understand the cruelty of those stretched seconds. [401] Had time slowed to torture her? [407] Or had it offered her a gift—more moments with Marcus, even terrible ones? [420]

The pattern intensified. [423] Through the ephemeral shapes in the spilled ink, she glimpsed something impossible: depth, dimension, a window into elsewhere. [439]

"Magnify," she commanded the drone. [444] It swooped closer, recording. [448]

In the ink's fleeting architecture, she saw movement. [456] A figure, distant but familiar, climbing endlessly upward through amber light. [466] Marcus. [467]

Her breath caught. [470] The pattern began dissolving from its edges inward, reality reclaiming the anomaly. [482]

Vera understood then. [485] Time didn't slow during crisis—perception did, stretching consciousness thin enough to glimpse what existed between seconds. [500] Her brother hadn't disappeared into the canyon. [507] He had disappeared into the spaces where time folded, caught in an endless moment of falling and never landing. [524]

The ink vanished completely. [528] The stone table lay bare again. [534]

She sat motionless as the desert wind sang through the carved pillars of her encampment. [548] The hummingbird drone settled on her shoulder, its recording complete. [558] Evidence that would disappear from memory drives within hours, as all evidence of these phenomena did. [573]

But Vera had seen enough. [578]

Tomorrow she would mix a stronger solution. [585] She would wait for another alignment, another thinning of the membrane between moments. [597] Eventually, she would pour enough ink to create a pattern large enough to step through. [612]

Her anger remained serene, but now it carried purpose. [621] She would find the place where time held its prisoners. [631] She would bring her brother home, or she would disappear into that amber light herself, climbing alongside him forever. [649]

The wind carved new patterns into the sandstone around her as darkness settled over the encampment. [665] Vera corked her empty vial and began preparing for the next attempt. [677] The drone powered down, preserving its energy for tomorrow's documentation. [687]

Above her, stars emerged where the eclipse shadow had been, ancient light that had traveled unimaginable distances to reach her eyes. [706] Time was not linear, she knew now. [713] It was layered, folded, full of hidden rooms where lost things waited. [725]

She would find the door. [730] She would open it. [734] And whatever she discovered inside, she would face with the same serene fury that had sustained her through three years of searching. [755]

Vera tracked time, and time had finally shown her where it kept its secrets. [769]
