The living bridge garden grew itself over centuries, its root-woven pathways spanning the chasms of the Thessaly Gorge like the fingers of sleeping giants. [27] Elara Venn had designed hedge mazes for thirty years, but nothing prepared her for a commission that asked her to shape living architecture into impossible geometries. [52]

The patrons wanted a maze that would never be solved. [62] They wanted infinity. [65]

Elara understood now, three months into her work, why the previous designers had fled. [79] The living bridges responded to intention, their roots and vines rearranging themselves based on the gardener's deepest thoughts. [96] When she sketched hyperbolic planes—surfaces where parallel lines diverge endlessly, where space folds into eternal recursion—the bridges listened. [114] They grew accordingly. [117]

The problem was that hyperbolic geometry doesn't exist in three dimensions without distortion. [130] Something had to give. [134] And what gave, Elara discovered, was time. [142]

She first noticed it when she found the photographs. [151]

Scattered along the root-bridges like fallen leaves, the images showed her own face at different ages—some older than she'd ever been, some younger than she remembered. [178] They were fading, their silver-gelatin surfaces disintegrating even as she held them, crumbling to ash between her fingers. [196] In one, she stood triumphant before a completed maze of impossible angles. [208] In another, she lay crumpled at the garden's heart, her eyes open and empty. [222]

When she touched the oldest photograph, she fell backward through her own timeline. [234]

This is what it meant to be retrocognitively trapped. [243] Elara experienced her past not as memory but as presence—reliving her mother's funeral, her first commission, the morning she burned her hand on a garden stake at age seven. [270] Each moment held her with absolute authority, yet she remained aware of her current self, stranded in simultaneity. [287] She could feel time's texture now: rough as burlap in grief, smooth as glass in joy, porous and crumbling in the spaces between. [309]

She had wanted this. [313] God help her, she had wanted to discover the texture of time. [325]

The halo fragment pulled her back. [331]

She'd found it weeks ago, half-buried beneath a moss bridge—a curved shard of pale gold that hummed with frequencies beyond hearing. [351] Research suggested it came from an astronomical instrument, perhaps Byzantine, perhaps older. [363] But when she held it during her temporal seizures, it anchored her to the present like a lighthouse beam cutting through fog. [383]

Now Elara stood at the maze's center, where the hyperbolic geometry reached its apex. [396] The hedges curved away in all directions simultaneously, their branches forming saddle-shapes that hurt the eye. [412] Photographs continued to drift down like dying butterflies, each one showing a version of her that might have been, might still be. [434]

She understood the maze's secret at last. [442] The living bridges hadn't just grown her design—they'd grown into it, becoming the hyperbolic surface itself. [458] And hyperbolic surfaces, she knew now, existed partially outside conventional spacetime. [469] Through hyperbolic geometry, the maze was causing the boundary between past and present to disintegrate, folding what was into what is. [489]

The fading photographs were echoes. [495] Futures collapsing. [497] Pasts dissolving. [499]

Elara pressed the halo fragment to her chest and felt its trembling warmth. [512] She could leave. [515] She could abandon the commission, let the garden consume its own impossibility, let the bridges grow wild and formless again. [533]

But she had discovered what she sought. [541] Time was not a river or a line. [550] It was a texture, woven from moments that touched each other across distances that shouldn't exist. [566] And if she could map that texture—if she could complete the maze—she might chart what no human had ever charted. [586]

The next photograph to land in her palm showed her standing here, in this exact spot, older and luminous and alive. [605]

Elara began to walk the hyperbolic paths, letting the maze teach her its language of infinite divergence. [621] Behind her, photographs continued to fade and disintegrate, futures she was choosing not to live. [636] Above her, the living bridges trembled with something like recognition. [647]

She would solve her own unsolvable maze. [655]

She would chart the topology of time itself. [664]

And if the garden trapped her forever in its quaking reverie of past and present and possible—well. [681] There were worse eternities than understanding. [688]
