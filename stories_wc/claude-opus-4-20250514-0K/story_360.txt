Elara's trembling fingers traced the broken fountain pen, its split nib catching on her threadbare robe. <words>15</words> In the goblin city's phosphorescent depths, she was an oddity—a necromancer who apologized to the spirits she summoned. <words>32</words>

The underground plaza echoed with peculiar sounds: goblin children shrieking on rust-eaten swings, their laughter bouncing off stalactite ceilings. <words>51</words> These playground sounds reminded Elara why she'd descended here, clutching the ancient riddle that promised to unveil death's true nature. <words>71</words>

"The tangled tapestry unravels where life meets its shadow," she whispered, her sincerity startling even the vendor selling pickled cave mushrooms. <words>92</words> Other necromancers commanded with arrogance, but Elara asked—genuinely asked—and somehow, the dead listened more closely. <words>107</words>

She'd lost her power three moons ago when doubt crept in like morning fog. <words>121</words> The fountain pen, her grandmother's channeling tool, had snapped during a particularly gentle summoning. <words>135</words> Now she sat by the goblin's sacred pools, watching moisture gather on crystalline walls. <words>149</words>

A dewdrop formed on a stalactite above, perfectly spherical. <words>158</words> As playground squeals crescendoed, the droplet caught the bioluminescent glow, refracting it into impossible colors. <words>173</words> Within that tiny prism, Elara saw it—the tangled tapestry itself, visible only in this fleeting intersection of water and light. <words>193</words>

Life and death weren't opposites but threads in the same weaving. <words>204</words> The goblin children's vitality and the ancient stones' memory of countless deaths created a pattern she'd never noticed. <words>222</words> Her meekness hadn't been weakness; it was recognition that commanding death meant honoring life's fragility. <words>237</words>

The dewdrop fell, shattering against stone. <words>243</words> But in that microsecond of destruction, Elara understood the universal riddle. <words>254</words> Death wasn't an ending but a transformation of the pattern, each thread pulling others into new configurations. <words>271</words>

She pressed the broken pen to her heart, feeling her power return—not regained but transformed. <words>286</words> The split nib would channel differently now, writing spells in doubled lines that honored both sides of existence. <words>304</words>

A goblin child tugged her robe, offering a glowing grub. <words>314</words> Elara accepted with that peculiar sincerity that made even goblins trust her. <words>326</words> She smiled, understanding finally why the riddle had led her here, to this liminal place where civilizations met, where playground joy echoed against ancient sorrow. <words>351</words>

Rising, she began the spell anew, the broken pen moving in sure strokes. <words>364</words> The dead came not as servants but as teachers, showing her the tapestry's pattern stitch by careful stitch. <words>382</words> In the underground city's eternal twilight, surrounded by improbable life, the meek necromancer finally understood her peculiar power: she didn't command death—she conversed with it. <words>408</words>
