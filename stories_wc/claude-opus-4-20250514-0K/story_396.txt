Marie picked through the abandoned lot behind the Louvre, her practiced eyes spotting edible purslane between rusted metal scraps. <words>16</words> She'd forgotten her collection basket again—the third time this week—so she stuffed dandelion greens into her coat pockets. <words>34</words> A glint caught her eye: a fragment of stained glass, depicting what might have been an angel's wing, lay half-buried in construction debris. <words>58</words> She pocketed it absently, already forgetting why. <words>66</words>

Three days later, at the International Urban Sustainability Fair, she'd set up her foraged foods display when a severe woman in Hermès approached. <words>90</words> "That glass piece," the woman said, pointing to where Marie had inexplicably used it as a garnish. <words>107</words> "It's from my family's bombed cathedral. <words>114</words> We've been searching for seventy years." <words>120</words>

Marie blinked, trying to remember where she'd even found it. <words>131</words> "I'm terribly sorry, I collect things and forget—" <words>139</words> She noticed corporate developers circling the woman like vultures, clearly interested in the publicity value of recovered heritage. <words>157</words> Something protective stirred in Marie's chest. <words>163</words>

"Perhaps we should discuss this privately?" <words>169</words> Marie suggested with studied indifference, though her mind raced. <words>179</words> The woman, Claudette, agreed. <words>183</words>

They descended into Paris's forgotten champagne vaults, where Marie sometimes foraged cave mushrooms. <words>196</words> The final performance of an underground opera echoed through limestone corridors—she'd forgotten about tonight's show. <words>212</words> As soprano notes pierced the darkness, Marie began negotiating. <words>221</words>

"Your family wants the glass back," Marie said, examining a peculiar fungus with feigned fascination. <words>237</words> "Those developers want to exploit your story. <words>244</words> But this fragment survived bombs, abandonment, urban renewal." <words>252</words> She turned it over in her palm, remembering now how it had called to her. <words>268</words> "Some things deserve better than museums or marketing campaigns." <words>277</words>

Claudette's expression softened as the opera swelled. <words>284</words> "You're suggesting...?" <words>286</words>

"Leave it with someone who'll forget where they put it," Marie shrugged. <words>298</words> "Someone who finds beauty in weeds and broken things. <words>307</words> Someone too scattered to sell out." <words>313</words> She offered the fragment back. <words>318</words> "Or take it—watch it become another commodity." <words>325</words>

The aria reached its climax as Claudette decided. <words>334</words> "My grandmother would have liked you," she said finally. <words>344</words> "She fed people with church garden vegetables during the war." <words>355</words> She closed Marie's fingers around the glass. <words>362</words> "Some inheritances aren't about ownership." <words>367</words>

They emerged from the vaults as the opera ended, Claudette disappearing into the night while Marie had already half-forgotten their arrangement. <words>389</words> She'd remember the glass fragment occasionally, finding it in random pockets, using it as a cutting board or bookmark, never recalling its significance. <words>413</words> In her charmingly careless hands, the sacred remained safe from those who'd monetize memory. <words>428</words> The angel's wing caught light differently each time she rediscovered it, a fragile wonder perpetually shielded by benign neglect. <words>447</words>
