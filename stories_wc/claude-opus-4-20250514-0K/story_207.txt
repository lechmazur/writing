Petra's magnetic boots clicked against the abandoned medical bay's floor, each step echoing through corridors that hadn't heard human voices in decades. <words>19</words> The forthright peddler clutched her most precious cargo—a dried flower bouquet preserved from Earth's final gardens—while the universe hummed its secret song through the station's hull. <words>47</words>

She'd come here following whispers, sifting through rumor-laden gossip columns transmitted across the void, each one hinting that Dr. Marcus Chen still lived. <words>71</words> The oath she'd sworn to him, sealed in blood during the colony wars, bound her to silence about his crimes. <words>91</words> But redemption's path rarely ran straight. <words>97</words>

"I know you're here," she called out, her voice meekly assertive in the sterile darkness. <words>113</words> The medical equipment stood like metal tombstones, their screens dead but somehow watchful. <words>127</words>

A shadow moved. <words>130</words> Marcus emerged from behind a surgical partition, his face gaunt but eyes still sharp. <words>145</words> "Petra." <words>146</words> His smile held no warmth. <words>151</words> "Still peddling hope to the hopeless?" <words>157</words>

She extended the bouquet. <words>161</words> "These belonged to your daughter." <words>166</words>

His composure cracked. <words>169</words> In that moment, she saw it—the divide between the man he'd been and the monster he'd become. <words>186</words> The dried petals trembled in the recycled air, each one a memory of the life he'd destroyed to fund his experiments. <words>208</words>

"The colonies know what you did," Petra continued. <words>216</words> "But they also know about the cure you discovered." <words>225</words> She felt an strange joy in her loneliness here, finally free to speak truth. <words>239</words> "Your oath bound me to protect your identity, not your conscience." <words>250</words>

Marcus reached for the flowers with shaking hands. <words>258</words> "She loved sunflowers," he whispered. <words>263</words>

"She loved her father more." <words>268</words> Petra's honesty cut deep, as it always did. <words>276</words> "The cure formula is hidden in the bouquet's stems. <words>285</words> Share it with the colonies, and maybe her death meant something." <words>296</words>

The universe continued its eternal humming, indifferent to human suffering and redemption alike. <words>309</words> But in that abandoned medical bay, two people stood at a crossroads. <words>321</words> Marcus clutched the dried flowers like a lifeline, understanding that breaking their oath meant different things to each of them. <words>341</words>

For him, it meant facing justice. <words>347</words> For Petra, it meant freedom from selling pretty lies when truth could heal. <words>360</words> She turned to leave, her footsteps lighter despite the artificial gravity. <words>371</words>

"Thank you," Marcus called after her. <words>377</words>

She paused at the doorway. <words>382</words> "Don't thank me." <words>385</words> Her forthright nature wouldn't allow it. <words>391</words> "Thank your daughter for believing you could still choose redemption." <words>401</words>

The medical bay doors sealed behind her, leaving Marcus alone with his choices and the secret song of the universe. <words>421</words>
