Elias pressed his quill harder against the parchment, recording every withered leaf in the witch's greenhouse with obsessive precision. <words>18</words> The structure clung to the hillside like a glass parasite, its foundation rooted between ancient gravestones that sprouted like broken teeth. <words>37</words> He'd been sent by the Royal Archives to catalog her botanical specimens, but something else had drawn his attention—a peculiar glass bulb mounted above her workbench, its filament glowing with impossible steadiness. <words>68</words>

"Tesla's prototype," the witch murmured, noticing his gaze. <words>76</words> "He gave it to me before they silenced him." <words>85</words> She handed him an envelope, its broken wax seal leaving traces of adhesive along the edges. <words>101</words> "Go ahead, analyze what remains." <words>106</words>

Elias hesitated, his rigid training warring with curiosity. <words>114</words> The adhesive felt warm beneath his fingertips, and as he studied its crystalline patterns, images flooded his mind—Tesla's workshop, the witch as a young woman, their shared experiments in bridging science and ancient wisdom. <words>147</words>

"You were certainly uncertain then," she said, reading his expression. <words>157</words> "Just as you are now." <words>162</words>

The visions intensified, showing him truths his meticulous records had never captured: how she'd hidden Tesla's revolutionary designs in her greenhouse, disguising world-changing inventions as mere botanical curiosities. <words>189</words> The light bulb wasn't just illumination—it was a beacon for those who dared imagine differently. <words>204</words>

Elias felt his chest constrict, then expand. <words>211</words> Without warning, he bellowed—a sound of release that shattered his decades of restraint. <words>224</words> The greenhouse glass trembled, and something shifted inside him like a puzzle piece sliding into place after years of forcing it elsewhere. <words>246</words>

"There," the witch smiled, her weathered hands gentle. <words>254</words> "The quiet transformation begins." <words>258</words>

He understood now why she tended her garden among graves—death and growth intertwined, innovation buried beneath tradition's weight, waiting for someone brave enough to unearth it. <words>283</words> His ledgers suddenly seemed like tombstones themselves, marking where curiosity had died in favor of accuracy. <words>299</words>

"Will you help me?" <words>303</words> she asked. <words>305</words> "To cradle empathy in arms of steel?" <words>312</words> She gestured toward her plants, each one a hybrid of science and magic, logic and wonder. <words>328</words>

Elias set down his quill and picked up a trowel instead. <words>339</words> The light bulb flickered once, as if in approval, casting shadows that danced between the gravestones and the growing things. <words>359</words> For the first time in his careful life, he felt uncertain in the most certain way—knowing that this doubt would bloom into something extraordinary. <words>383</words> His transformation would be quiet, like seeds germinating in darkness, but when it finally emerged, it would illuminate worlds. <words>402</words>
