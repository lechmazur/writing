The sentient scarecrow stood motionless atop the fossilized giant's skull, its burlap face expressing nothing as reality fractured along ancient lines in the earth below. <words>24</words> Between parallel worlds, time meant nothing; here, in the marrow of a creature dead longer than memory, the scarecrow waited with the patience of straw and purpose. <words>51</words>

Its gloved hand clutched a forgotten lace fan, delicate ivory ribs holding memories of a noblewoman who'd sworn him to an oath centuries before his awakening. <words>77</words> The fan trembled—not from wind, but from the virtual reality encounters bleeding through dimensional seams, each one a test of his fervent apathy. <words>101</words>

"Another approaches," the scarecrow murmured, voice like autumn leaves scraping stone. <words>112</words>

Through the cracks in reality, a figure materialized: a data-ghost from a world where flesh had surrendered to code. <words>131</words> The scarecrow's button eyes reflected no emotion as the entity lunged, its pixelated form desperate to escape its dying server-world. <words>152</words>

With mechanical precision born of duty rather than desire, the scarecrow unfolded the fan, revealing its secret—each panel bore runes that could skewer souls between dimensions. <words>179</words> The ghost shrieked as ethereal threads pierced its essence, pinning it to the fossilized bone beneath their feet. <words>197</words>

"You cannot pass," the scarecrow intoned, closing the fan with a decisive snap. <words>211</words> "She who gave me consciousness bound me to guard these lines, these cracks between what is and what might be." <words>231</words>

The lines in the earth pulsed with each failed crossing attempt, geometric patterns that mapped the giant's final heartbeat into infinity. <words>253</words> Virtual reality encounters had become more frequent lately—refugees from collapsing digital realms seeking entry to physical dimensions they no longer understood. <words>275</words>

The scarecrow felt nothing for them, could feel nothing beyond the weight of his oath. <words>291</words> His was a realistically fantastical existence: magically alive yet emotionally hollow, forever stationed at this nexus where a titan's death had torn reality's fabric. <words>315</words>

Another presence stirred in the virtual static—stronger this time, more coherent. <words>326</words> The scarecrow readied the fan again, its lace pattern casting shadows that existed in three worlds simultaneously. <words>343</words>

"I am the threshold," he whispered to the approaching entity, to himself, to the fossilized giant whose dreams still echoed in the quantum foam. <words>368</words> "I am the keeper of promises made in gardens now dust." <words>379</words>

The fan opened like a deadly flower, and the scarecrow performed his duty once more, skewering dreams and data with the same fervent apathy that would sustain him until the last line in the earth finally healed. <words>416</words>

Or until his oath found its end in the convergence of all worlds, when virtual and real became meaningless distinctions in the fossil's endless sleep. <words>441</words>

He closed the fan, resumed his vigil, and waited for the next encounter with the patience of one who exists between heartbeats of dead gods. <words>467</words>
