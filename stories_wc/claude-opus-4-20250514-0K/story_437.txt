Brother Matthias pressed his trembling fingers against the ceramic owl figurine, its glazed eyes reflecting the sickly green light filtering through the greenhouse city's glass ceiling. <words>24</words> Outside, toxic rain drummed against the vast botanical domes that sheltered humanity's last garden from the poisoned sky. <words>41</words>

"The flowers speak," he whispered to his gathered followers, though his voice wavered with the uncertainty that had always defined his leadership. <words>64</words> They sat in a circle among the drooping orchids and wilting roses, each holding photographs yellowed with age and streaked with the faint shimmer of long-dried tears. <words>91</words>

Matthias had discovered something in those tear-stained images—a pattern, a code perhaps, that seemed to translate the silent language of the dying blooms around them. <words>117</words> The boundaries between past and present blurred as he traced the salt-crystal trails on a photo of his grandmother's funeral bouquet. <words>139</words> She had been a botanist before the sky turned venomous, before the greenhouses became cities, before flowers became prophets. <words>158</words>

"Look how they bend," he said, holding the owl figurine higher, its shadow dancing statically across the wilted petals—moving yet frozen, changing yet constant. <words>183</words> His followers leaned forward, desperate for meaning in this suffocating Eden where cheerfulness felt like mourning and sorrow tasted sweet. <words>203</words>

The ceramic owl had belonged to his grandmother too, a gift from the time when birds still flew beneath open skies. <words>224</words> Now it served as his talisman, a bridge between the verdant past captured in photographs and the withering present surrounding them. <words>246</words> Through the tear-stains on old pictures, he claimed to decipher what the flowers were trying to say—warnings, perhaps, or elegies, or love letters to the sun they'd never truly see again. <words>278</words>

Rain intensified, pattering against glass like urgent morse code. <words>287</words> Matthias felt his influence spreading through the group not through charisma or conviction, but through their shared recognition of loss made beautiful, decay made meaningful. <words>312</words> He was no prophet, merely a translator of grief, as spineless as the dying stems that could no longer support their own blooms. <words>336</words>

"The dahlia speaks of dignity in death," he murmured, studying a water-spotted photograph. <words>350</words> "The rose mourns its thorns more than its petals." <words>359</words> His followers nodded, finding solace in his uncertain certainties, his dynamic stillness, his doleful cheer. <words>375</words>

In the greenhouse city, where boundaries dissolved like sugar in rain, Brother Matthias led not with strength but with shared fragility, teaching others to read the language of flowers through the lens of ancient tears, while the ceramic owl watched with painted eyes that remembered the sky. <words>424</words>
