The herbalist's quarters occupied the easternmost tower of what had once been Matsumoto Castle, now transformed into an art academy where students learned to capture fleeting beauty. <words>24</words> Yuki lived alone among dried roots and tinctures, her only companion a leather-bound book of pressed flowers collected across decades. <words>43</words> Each Tuesday, she descended the spiral stairs to teach botanical illustration, carrying the book like a sacred text. <words>61</words>

In her classroom, Akira always chose the seat nearest the window. <words>72</words> He painted meteor showers—ephemeral streaks across rice paper that seemed to pulse with hidden meaning. <words>87</words> Yuki noticed how his brushstrokes mirrored the curves of pressed cherry blossoms in her book, though she never mentioned it. <words>107</words> Their silence held more weight than words. <words>114</words>

One evening, while gathering moonwort on the castle grounds, Yuki witnessed a meteor shower unlike any before. <words>131</words> The celestial patterns matched exactly the arrangement of flowers she'd pressed the night Akira was born—a fact she'd discovered only through careful comparison of dates and astronomical records. <words>159</words> She understood then that their fates had been intertwined long before their first meeting. <words>173</words>

The next class, she repositioned her teaching easel. <words>181</words> Instead of facing the students directly, she angled it toward Akira's corner, creating a triangle between herself, him, and the window's view of the night sky. <words>207</words> The shift was subtle yet dramatic in its implications. <words>216</words>

Week by week, she began teaching differently. <words>223</words> Each lesson decoded another layer—the spiral patterns in fern fronds, the mathematical precision of petal arrangements, the way pressed flowers retained their essence despite transformation. <words>247</words> Akira's paintings evolved in response, his meteor trails beginning to curve like stems, to cluster like blooms. <words>264</words>

During the final class before winter break, Yuki opened her pressed flower book to a page she'd never shown anyone. <words>284</words> Sandwiched between glass was a single shooting star flower, its white petals forming points that exactly matched the constellation visible during that long-ago meteor shower. <words>310</words> She placed it on Akira's desk without explanation. <words>318</words>

His brush paused mid-stroke. <words>322</words> In the reflection of his water jar, she saw recognition dawn—not just of the flower, but of everything it represented. <words>342</words> He understood now why his mother had sent him to study at this particular castle, with this particular teacher. <words>361</words> The conversation they could never have aloud had finally been spoken through petals and pigments, through careful repositioning and patient observation. <words>383</words>

That night, Yuki climbed to her tower room and watched new meteors arc across the sky. <words>399</words> Below, in the courtyard, Akira painted by lantern light, his brushstrokes capturing both the flowers that were and the stars that would be. <words>423</words> Their shared silence bloomed between them, a pressed flower of understanding preserved in the space where words would only wither. <words>443</words> The distance between them remained, but it no longer meant separation. <words>454</words> Some intimacies require the mercy of space. <words>461</words>
