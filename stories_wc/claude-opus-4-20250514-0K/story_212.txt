Mara's calloused fingers sorted through the magician's deck of trick cards she'd found among the ruins, each one inscribed with genetic sequences instead of suits. <words>20</words> After the last resource war scorched the ethereal plains into glass and ash, she'd become the apocalyptic farmer breeding new seeds—not by choice, but by the Council's decree. <words>49</words>

The cards weren't ordinary; they sang when touched, whispering the song of boundaries between what was possible and what was forbidden. <words>71</words> Each morning, she'd shuffle them before tending her experimental crops, their typically atypical mutations growing in defiance of nature's old rules. <words>93</words> Purple wheat that absorbed radiation, corn with leaves that collected moisture from thought itself—these were her children now. <words>111</words>

But Mara yearned to escape a life dictated by another, by the Council that had conscripted her gift after discovering she could hear the plants jabber in frequencies others couldn't perceive. <words>142</words> They'd taken her from the coast where she'd once sent messages in bottles carried by the sea, each one a prayer for rescue that never came. <words>169</words>

Today felt different. <words>172</words> The ace of spades—no, the ace of genomes—fell from the deck, landing on a seedling that immediately began to pulse with bioluminescent light. <words>196</words> The plant's jabber became coherent: "The boundary song knows your name, Mara. <words>208</words> Listen." <words>209</words>

She pressed her ear to the glowing stalk, and through its cellular whispers came a familiar sound—waves crashing, glass bottles tumbling in surf. <words>233</words> Her old messages had found something out there in the wasteland seas, something that had decoded her genetic plea and sent instructions back through the plant network. <words>261</words>

The trick cards scattered as she worked, following the plant's guidance to combine specific seeds. <words>276</words> Each card that touched the soil revealed another piece of the puzzle—a pathway growing beneath the ethereal plains, roots forming an underground railroad of consciousness. <words>302</words>

By nightfall, her typically atypical garden had transformed into a living vessel. <words>314</words> The plants wove themselves into a cocoon, their cell walls singing harmonies that dissolved the boundaries between flesh and chlorophyll. <words>334</words> The Council would arrive at dawn to collect their harvest, but they would find only empty fields and a deck of cards arranged to spell: "Message received. <words>362</words> Farmer has gone to sea." <words>367</words>

Inside her plant-ship, Mara felt the raw solace of finally choosing her own path. <words>382</words> The song of boundaries carried her beyond the ethereal plains, through root systems and mycelial networks, toward whatever answered her bottles. <words>404</words> She was no longer the apocalyptic farmer breeding new seeds for others. <words>417</words> She had become the seed itself, planted in freedom's soil, growing wild beyond anyone's design. <words>433</words>
