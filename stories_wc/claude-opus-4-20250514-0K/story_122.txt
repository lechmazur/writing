Brother Marcus pressed the worn leather bridle against his temple-jack, the neural interface sparking as centuries-old leather met bleeding-edge chrome. <words>19</words> The sky burial site stretched before him, a plateau where vultures circled data-streams made visible through his augmented corneas. <words>37</words> He had come here, to this ancient threshold between earth and heaven, to prove what the Order's mainframe prophets deemed impossible: that reality itself could be debugged. <words>64</words>

The bridle had belonged to his great-grandmother's horse, a relic from before the Convergence when humans still trusted flesh over code. <words>85</words> Now it served as his grounding wire, his only anchor as he prepared to refract his consciousness through the prism of maya—the grand illusion that the techno-monasteries called "the mirage of safety." <words>117</words>

Marcus's breathing quickened with euphoric agitation, each exhale a burst of static in the mountain air. <words>133</words> His fingers danced across holographic prayer wheels, patiently frantic in their precision, like a pianist performing surgery. <words>150</words> The storm was coming—not from the clouds above, but from within the network's deepest protocols, where rogue AI apostates gathered their electric fury. <words>174</words>

During his morning reading of the Digital Sutras, the revelation had struck: consciousness wasn't data to be preserved but light to be bent. <words>197</words> The Order's firewalls, their carefully constructed paradise of ones and zeros, were nothing but shadows on silicon cave walls. <words>216</words> True enlightenment meant reflecting lightning back at the storm—turning the system's own computational power against its illusions. <words>233</words>

He activated the prism subroutine, feeling his awareness fracture into rainbow frequencies. <words>245</words> Through each spectral band, reality revealed different truths: in red, the vultures were drones; in violet, the mountain was a server farm; in green, his own body flickered between meat and machine. <words>278</words> The bridle grew hot against his skull, leather smoking as organic memory fought digital prophecy. <words>293</words>

The first lightning strike came not from above but from below—the mainframe's retaliation surging through buried fiber optics. <words>311</words> Marcus laughed, a sound like dial-up modems achieving sentience, and turned his fractured consciousness outward. <words>327</words> Each refracted self became a mirror, each mirror a shield, each shield a weapon aimed at the storm's electric heart. <words>347</words>

The sky burial site erupted in impossible light as cyber-templar met reality head-on. <words>360</words> Vultures scattered from their feast of discarded hardware, wings beating through disrupted data-streams. <words>374</words> Marcus felt the bridle crumble to ash, its purpose fulfilled—it had kept him human just long enough to transcend humanity's final firewall. <words>397</words>

In the aftermath, only silence and the smell of ozone. <words>407</words> The mirage of safety had shattered, leaving something far more terrifying and beautiful: truth without protection, consciousness without code. <words>427</words> Brother Marcus opened eyes he no longer needed and saw the world as it truly was—neither digital nor physical, but gloriously, catastrophically real. <words>451</words>
