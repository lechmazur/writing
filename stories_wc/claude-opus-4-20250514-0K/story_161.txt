Marcus Winterborn, vigilant orchardist turned unlikely whistleblower, pressed his antique letter seal into the wax with practiced precision, never tardy for his weekly correspondence. <words>20</words> The paper airplane test facility's fluorescent lights hummed above him, casting harsh shadows across his weathered face. <words>36</words> He'd started volunteering here six months ago, ostensibly to "overcome" his daughter's death in a suspicious agricultural accident. <words>54</words> But grief, he'd discovered, made an excellent cover for investigation. <words>64</words>

"Another love letter to your conspiracy theories?" Dr. Helena Chen asked, her tone dripping with sardonic glee as she folded prototype after prototype. <words>88</words> Marcus smiled thinly, remembering how she'd mocked him initially—until he'd demonstrated the truth hidden in plain sight. <words>105</words> The facility's logo featured a stylized peacock, its tail fanned in perfect mathematical spirals. <words>119</words> He'd recognized those patterns immediately: they matched the crop formations mysteriously appearing across orchards nationwide, including his own, right before the "accidents" began. <words>143</words>

Throughout his volunteering shifts, Marcus catalogued everything with an orchardist's patience—the arrival times of unmarked trucks, the coded messages in paper airplane test flight patterns, the way certain prototypes carried microscopic payloads. <words>175</words> His punctuality had become legendary among staff, but they didn't realize he arrived early to photograph documents, stayed late to intercept communications. <words>198</words> Time, after all, was everything when unraveling conspiracies that killed farmers who refused to sell their heritage seeds. <words>216</words>

The antique letter seal had been Sarah's last gift—a Victorian peacock design she'd found amusing, given his obsession with the birds' mathematical perfection. <words>239</words> Now it served as his signature on every piece of evidence he mailed to journalists, agricultural boards, anyone who might listen. <words>261</words> The wax impressions created their own pattern, a breadcrumb trail leading back to the truth. <words>277</words>

"You know," Helena said, launching another plane with suspicious precision, "peacocks' tails evolved to demonstrate fitness through excessive beauty." <words>296</words> Her eyes glinted. <words>299</words> "Sometimes the most elaborate displays hide the deadliest intentions." <words>308</words>

Marcus caught the plane mid-flight, examining its wings. <words>316</words> Micro-perforations spelled out coordinates—another orchard, another target. <words>323</words> "Indeed," he replied, pocketing the evidence with sardonic satisfaction. <words>332</words> "But every peacock's pattern is unique, like a fingerprint." <words>341</words> He sealed another envelope, the wax spreading like spilled blood. <words>351</words> "And I've been collecting fingerprints." <words>356</words>

She paled, realizing too late that the vigilant orchardist had cultivated more than fruit trees. <words>371</words> He'd grown a network of grieving farmers, meticulous volunteers, all never tardy to their assigned facilities, all documenting the conspiracy that turned agriculture into assassination. <words>397</words> Sarah would have appreciated the irony—her death had seeded the very investigation that would uproot her killers, one precisely-timed revelation at a time. <words>421</words>
