General Markov pushed through the Dark Matter Diner's door, his medals clinking like wind chimes against dried seaweed that hung from the entrance—the owner's peculiar ward against "temporal indigestion." <words>25</words>

Between rides on the interdimensional transit, weary travelers gathered here to feast on impossibilities. <words>39</words> Markov slumped into a booth beneath a gallery of black-and-white photographs, each capturing an arc of light that shouldn't exist. <words>59</words>

"Coffee?" asked the waitress, her smile suggesting she knew exactly why ex-military types frequented this rationally absurd establishment. <words>76</words>

"Make it strong enough to dethrone fear from the throne of reason," Markov muttered, rubbing temples that had commanded too many losing battles. <words>99</words>

She winked. <words>101</words> "Ah, another one seeking renewal through our special brew." <words>110</words>

The diner hummed with shared anxieties—each patron nursing wounds invisible to conventional physics but palpable in this pocket between realities. <words>130</words> A quantum physicist argued with her past self at the counter. <words>141</words> A time-loop insurance salesman repeatedly dropped his fork. <words>149</words> Markov recognized the particular exhaustion that transcended mere fatigue; it was existential burnout, the kind that made decorated generals question whether their wars had ever been real. <words>176</words>

The coffee arrived in a cup that seemed to contain its own event horizon. <words>190</words> As Markov sipped, the photographs above him began to shift. <words>200</words> Each arc of light revealed a moment of surrender—not defeat, but the mischievous wisdom of letting go. <words>217</words> A soldier laying down arms to plant gardens. <words>225</words> A general trading strategies for stargazing. <words>231</words> Warriors discovering that the greatest victory was admitting their shared terror of meaninglessness. <words>244</words>

"You see it now," the waitress said, refilling his cup with liquid that defied several laws of thermodynamics. <words>262</words> "The photographs capture what happens when we stop pretending fear is the enemy." <words>276</words>

Markov felt the dried seaweed's salt-memory on his tongue—ancient oceans that had witnessed countless cycles of creation and destruction. <words>295</words> The absurdity struck him: here he sat, a burnt-out general finding profound truth in impossible coffee at an interdimensional rest stop. <words>316</words> He laughed, and the sound rippled through dimensions. <words>324</words>

Around him, other patrons began to chuckle, their anxieties transforming into shared recognition of the cosmic joke. <words>340</words> Fear hadn't been dethroned through battle but through the simple act of acknowledging its rightful place—not as ruler, but as counselor in the cabinet of consciousness. <words>367</words>

Markov stood, renewed not by forgetting his battles but by remembering why laughter might be the universe's most sophisticated weapon. <words>387</words> He left payment in currency from three different timelines and stepped back into the space between rides, carrying the diner's mischievous wisdom like a medal more precious than any he'd earned through war. <words>419</words>

The dried seaweed chimed behind him, welcoming the next weary soul seeking transformation in the Dark Matter Diner's rationally absurd embrace. <words>440</words>
