Captain Nyx Starweaver rolled the chipped dice between her fingers, the ivory cubes worn smooth by generations of desperate gamblers. <words>19</words> She sat cross-legged in the brig of her own ship, having locked herself in after discovering the truth. <words>37</words> The psychic genealogist's latest vision had revealed why her crew kept leaving: her bloodline carried the curse of inevitable abandonment. <words>57</words>

"Three hours until the last star fades into morning light," she muttered, watching through the porthole as the universe prepared for its daily death. <words>81</words> The dice tumbled across the metal floor, landing on snake eyes—again. <words>92</words> She laughed bitterly, a sound that echoed off the walls like a funeral dirge performed by jesters. <words>109</words>

Her gift for reading ancestral memories through touch had made her the most sought-after fortune hunter in seven systems. <words>128</words> Yet she wore her abilities with proud humility, never boasting about the treasures she'd found by channeling dead pirates' final thoughts. <words>150</words> But this morning's discovery in the abandoned bullet train graveyard had changed everything. <words>163</words>

The diary had been wedged beneath a seat, its pages yellowed like dying stars. <words>177</words> One touch had flooded her mind with visions of her great-grandmother, also a psychic genealogist, also cursed to drive away everyone she loved. <words>201</words> The entries detailed how each generation tried to lengthen their relationships, stretching them like taffy until they snapped. <words>219</words>

"The puzzle of destiny," her ancestor had written, "is that knowing the pattern doesn't break it." <words>235</words>

Nyx picked up the dice again, noting how the chip on one die always made it land askew. <words>253</words> Just like her heart—damaged in precisely the way that threw off its rhythm. <words>266</words> The alarm bells of heartbreak rang constantly in her chest, a warning system she couldn't silence. <words>282</words>

Through the brig's bars, she heard footsteps. <words>289</words> Her first mate, Orion, appeared with breakfast and that insufferable gentle smile. <words>301</words> "Captain, you can't keep locking yourself away every time you get close to someone." <words>315</words>

She rolled the dice through the bars. <words>322</words> They clattered at his feet: double sixes this time. <words>331</words> "Want to bet on that?" she asked with grave playfulness. <words>341</words>

He picked them up, studying the chipped edge. <words>349</words> "Your great-grandmother's dice?" <words>353</words>

"Great-great-great," she corrected. <words>356</words> "Found them with the diary." <words>361</words>

"And what did the diary say about breaking curses?" <words>370</words>

Nyx stood, pressing her forehead against the cold bars. <words>379</words> Outside, the last star was dimming, preparing to surrender to artificial morning. <words>391</words> "It said the only way to lengthen love is to stop trying to hold it." <words>407</words>

Orion unlocked the brig door. <words>412</words> "Then maybe stop holding yourself?" <words>417</words>

As the star faded completely, Nyx stepped out, leaving the dice behind. <words>429</words> Sometimes the puzzle of destiny wasn't about solving it, but accepting that some patterns were meant to be traced with lighter fingers. <words>452</words> The alarm bells in her chest quieted, not silenced but softened, as she chose to float rather than grip. <words>472</words>
