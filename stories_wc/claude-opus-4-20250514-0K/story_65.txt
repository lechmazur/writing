The slapdash bard Elara strummed her mistuned lute at the world's edge, where continental plates ground against each other in their eternal dance. <words>18</words> Her family had picnicked on this precipice for seven generations, claiming the trembling ground as their sacred space despite—or perhaps because of—its possibly impossible nature. <words>46</words> The earth here existed between states: solid yet shifting, permanent yet ephemeral, safe yet deadly. <words>61</words>

Death had found her three days ago in a tavern, its cold fingers brushing her throat as she sang. <words>80</words> She'd fled here, to the only place her family believed could confuse even the Eternal Hunter. <words>96</words> The brass doorplate she'd stolen from Death's own threshold weighed heavy in her pack—her grandmother's final, whispered instruction before passing. <words>117</words> "When Death comes, child, take its nameplate and run to where the earth splits. <words>131</words> Set your blanket where our blood has fed the stone, and wait while the hourglass resets its sand." <words>149</words>

Elara spread the threadbare picnic blanket over the exact spot where her mother had spread it, and her mother before her. <words>171</words> The ground shuddered, a minor quake that would have terrified any but her bloodline. <words>185</words> She unpacked stale bread and bruised apples with trembling hands, maintaining the ritual even as shadows lengthened unnaturally around her. <words>205</words>

"You disrupt the natural order," Death's voice rumbled from everywhere and nowhere. <words>217</words>

"My family has disrupted your order for two hundred years," Elara sang back, her voice cracking with melancholic glee. <words>236</words> She held up the brass doorplate, its letters spelling Death's true name in a language older than words. <words>254</words> "We've made this fissure sacred with our joy, our grief, our defiance. <words>266</words> Seven generations of last meals eaten where your jurisdiction fractures." <words>276</words>

The tectonic plates shifted again, and through the gap, she glimpsed the cosmic hourglass—grains of crushed planets falling upward, beginning their reset. <words>298</words> Death materialized across from her, skeletal hands reaching for its stolen nameplate. <words>310</words>

"Join me," Elara offered, gesturing to the blanket with desperate whimsy. <words>321</words> "Every year, my family shared bread with whoever would sit. <words>331</words> Even you." <words>333</words>

Death paused, considering this possibly impossible invitation. <words>339</words> The sacred space hummed with accumulated love and loss, decades of defiant picnics seasoning the stone. <words>355</words> Slowly, Death lowered itself onto the blanket's edge. <words>363</words>

"While the hourglass resets its sand," Death conceded, accepting a piece of bread. <words>376</words> "Then we shall see." <words>380</words>

Elara's fingers found her lute strings, coaxing a tune both mournful and bright. <words>393</words> Here, balanced on the earth's breaking point, she'd won another year of impossible life. <words>407</words> The brass doorplate lay between them, temporarily unclaimed, as they shared the strangest and most sacred picnic ever held at the world's edge. <words>431</words>
