The lone trapper floated through the observatory's maintenance shaft, her breath creating frost patterns on the porthole glass. <words>16</words> Between shifts, when the research staff slept, she hunted for something more elusive than the pelts she'd once pursued in Earth's forgotten forests. <words>39</words> The piece of sea glass in her pocket hummed—silently audible, like memories screaming through vacuum. <words>55</words>

She'd lost everything when the ice caps melted: her cabin, her trade, her daughter who'd played with that very glass on what used to be shoreline. <words>82</words> But loss, she'd learned, had an upside—it carved out space for impossible things. <words>96</words>

The observatory's archive room reeked of ozone and old secrets. <words>107</words> She pulled the microfilm canister from behind a false panel, stolen months ago from the Director's private collection. <words>125</words> The projector flickered to life, casting ghostly equations across the curved wall. <words>138</words> Frame by frame, she decoded the shady research: coordinates to a phenomenon the scientists pretended didn't exist. <words>156</words>

A black hole of doubt, they'd labeled it—a cosmic anomaly that absorbed certainty itself, leaving only questions in its wake. <words>177</words> But the trapper had seen the hidden addendum: those who approached it correctly could siphon radiance from its event horizon, transforming uncertainty into pure potential. <words>203</words>

She'd spent years tracking patterns in the observatory's data streams, noticing what others ignored. <words>218</words> The researchers saw failure; she saw breadcrumbs. <words>226</words> Each rejected hypothesis, each abandoned experiment, led her closer to understanding how to recommence what grief had ended. <words>244</words>

The sea glass grew warm against her palm. <words>253</words> Her daughter had called it "caught starlight," and maybe she'd been right. <words>266</words> The trapper fed the coordinates into her salvaged navigation pod, jury-rigged from decommissioned equipment. <words>281</words>

Outside the observatory's windows, space yawned like the mouth of every beast she'd ever trapped, but bigger, hungrier. <words>299</words> The black hole of doubt waited three parsecs away, invisible except for how it bent light around itself. <words>318</words> She'd approach during the next shift change, when no one would notice a missing maintenance worker. <words>335</words>

The microfilm dissolved in acid, as programmed. <words>343</words> Evidence erased, but knowledge preserved in her mind's careful snares. <words>354</words> She pressed the sea glass to her lips—a kiss for luck, for lost things, for the audacious hope that doubt's darkness might birth new light. <words>380</words>

Tomorrow, she would trap the untrapable: not fur or meat, but the radiant possibility that somewhere in the universe's vast indifference, her daughter's laughter still echoed, waiting to be found. <words>410</words> Even if it meant becoming something other than human. <words>420</words> Even if it meant never coming back. <words>428</words>

The trapper smiled, frost and starlight on her weathered face. <words>439</words> Some pelts were worth any price. <words>446</words>
