The coin spun through the air, catching the afternoon light that filtered through the flower pressing workshop's dusty windows. <words>18</words> Elara held her breath as it landed—heads. <words>25</words> The nomadic dreamer's heart surged with anguished joy; she would finally intervene in the Council's plans. <words>41</words>

"Congratulations," Master Chen said, his voice ferociously polite despite the tremor beneath. <words>53</words> "You've been selected for the mission." <words>59</words>

Around her, five other chosen ones exhaled—some in relief, others in disappointment. <words>71</words> Each had sought this secret mission entrusted to a select group, though none fully understood its true nature. <words>89</words> The Council had masked intentions well, speaking only of "preserving the old ways." <words>102</words>

Elara's fingers traced the mariner's wheel mounted incongruously on the workshop wall—a relic from her seafaring grandmother who'd first taught her that harmony with nature meant understanding its storms as well as its calms. <words>137</words> The wheel had guided three generations of women who'd wandered between land and sea, pressing flowers from every shore they'd touched. <words>159</words>

"The pharmaceutical companies arrive at dawn," Master Chen continued, maintaining his suffocating courtesy. <words>172</words> "They intend to purchase our meadowlands for industrial cultivation." <words>181</words> His smile never wavered, but his knuckles whitened. <words>189</words> "You six will ensure they find nothing but barren soil." <words>199</words>

The anguished joy deepened in Elara's chest. <words>206</words> To achieve harmony with nature, they would have to destroy it first—transplant every rare orchid, every medicinal herb, every sacred bloom before the bulldozers came. <words>231</words> A controlled burn would follow, leaving only ash. <words>239</words>

"We're saving them by killing the land?" <words>246</words> whispered Marcus, the youngest chosen. <words>251</words>

"We're saving them by making the land worthless to those who would truly kill it," Elara corrected, her nomadic soul understanding the paradox. <words>275</words> She'd seen enough conquered gardens to know that sometimes retreat meant survival. <words>287</words>

In the hush after a coin toss decides fate, truth crystallizes. <words>298</words> The workshop fell silent except for the whisper of pressed petals settling in their frames. <words>313</words> Each member of their secret group would take specimens—seeds, cuttings, pressed flowers—and scatter across the continent. <words>328</words> When the companies found only scorched earth, they'd abandon their plans. <words>339</words> Years later, the nomadic dreamers would return, replanting their treasures in soil made rich by rest. <words>355</words>

Master Chen handed Elara the first preservation box, his ferociously polite mask finally cracking to reveal the anguish beneath. <words>374</words> "My grandfather built this workshop. <words>379</words> But buildings can be rebuilt—extinct flowers cannot." <words>386</words>

She gripped the mariner's wheel one last time, feeling her grandmother's spirit in its worn wood. <words>402</words> Tomorrow, she would burn paradise to save it. <words>410</words> Tonight, she would press one last flower—a wild iris that grew nowhere else—between pages that would travel far before coming home. <words>432</words>

The coin had chosen her to be both destroyer and savior. <words>443</words> The nomadic dreamer accepted both roles with the terrible joy of those who understand that sometimes love requires the hardest choices. <words>464</words>
