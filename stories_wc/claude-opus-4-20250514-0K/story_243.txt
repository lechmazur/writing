The pixelated corridors of the Temple of Forgotten Code stretched endlessly before Malachar, each step producing an unnaturally loud echo that made the jumpy necromancer flinch. <words>20</words> In this retro video game world, where the old gods slumbered in their digital tombs, even sound behaved according to typically bizarre rules. <words>40</words> His skeletal fingers clutched the ancient fishhook that pulsed with ethereal light whenever the moon icon appeared in the status bar above. <words>62</words>

For weeks, Malachar had pursued rumors of the High Programmer, the revered icon whose benevolent image adorned every loading screen. <words>82</words> But whispers in the deleted sectors spoke of corruption, of code rewritten to serve darker purposes. <words>98</words> The necromancer's quest to unmask this false prophet had led him through glitched graveyards and corrupted cathedrals, always following the echoing footsteps that seemed to emanate from nowhere and everywhere simultaneously. <words>129</words>

Now, deep within the temple's hidden chambers, he discovered it: a protest mural rendered in phosphorescent pixels. <words>146</words> The paint drips—if one could call them that in this digital realm—formed patterns that defied the world's rigid 8-bit aesthetic. <words>167</words> Malachar began to falter, his confidence wavering as he analyzed each luminous streak. <words>180</words> The drips weren't random; they were encrypted messages, each color corresponding to deleted lines of the world's original code. <words>199</words>

His fishhook blazed brighter as the moon icon reached its zenith, illuminating previously invisible layers of the mural. <words>216</words> There, hidden beneath the propaganda, was the truth: the High Programmer had rewritten the fundamental laws of their reality while the old gods slept. <words>240</words> Citizens who questioned the changes were marked as "bugs" and systematically erased. <words>252</words>

The echoing footsteps grew louder, no longer distant but approaching with mechanical precision. <words>265</words> Malachar's jumpy nature served him well; he dove behind a stack of deprecated sprites just as the High Programmer materialized. <words>285</words> But the necromancer had learned something crucial from the mural's paint drips—the tyrant's power waned during system maintenance cycles. <words>304</words>

With trembling hands, Malachar raised his glowing fishhook and began the incantation to summon the digital dead, those erased "bugs" whose code still lingered in the world's memory cache. <words>333</words> The typically bizarre logic of their world meant that deleted didn't mean gone forever. <words>347</words> As ghostly sprites emerged from the temple's walls, their combined presence created a feedback loop that threatened to wake the slumbering gods. <words>370</words>

The High Programmer's perfect facade began to pixelate and distort, revealing the corrupted entity beneath. <words>385</words> In this moment of clear complexity, where simple graphics conveyed profound betrayal, Malachar understood that unmasking the truth required not just courage, but the willingness to resurrect what power had tried to bury. <words>418</words>

The echoing footsteps ceased, replaced by the sound of a system desperately trying to reboot itself. <words>434</words>
