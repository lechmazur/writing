The ambivalent prophet Kira held her collection of marbles, cracked from centuries of cosmic pressure, watching them refract the artificial light of Lunar Station Seven. <words>24</words> She'd discovered them yesterday in a rummage sale box alongside jigsaw puzzle edges that, when assembled, revealed fragments of the universe's underlying code. <words>47</words> 

Between heartbeats—that impossible moment where time dilates in low gravity—she saw it all: the cosmic scoreboard that tracked every soul's karmic debt, every civilization's rise and fall. <words>76</words> The mining colony's residents thought her mad, but their bashful arrogance amused her; they dug for helium-3 while she excavated truth itself. <words>99</words>

"I could tell them," she murmured, rolling a spider-webbed marble between her fingers, "but prophecy is such a burden when you're not sure you want to be right." <words>128</words> The puzzle edges had shown her how to defragment reality's scattered data, to reorganize the very fabric of cause and effect. <words>150</words> 

Her apprentice, Chen, entered the meditation chamber with that particular gait of someone trying not to disturb a prophet mid-vision. <words>171</words> "Master Kira, the colony administrator demands—"

"Demands are for those who believe the scoreboard matters," she interrupted, her tone carrying that peculiar mixture of humility and superiority that marked true seers. <words>201</words> "Tell me, Chen, what would you do if you could scramble every tally, every judgment rendered by the universe's cold mathematics?" <words>223</words>

Chen shifted uncomfortably. <words>226</words> "I... I suppose I'd want to know if it was right to do so." <words>240</words>

Kira laughed, a sound both joyful and melancholic—happily sad, as she'd learned to be after seeing too many futures. <words>260</words> "Right and wrong are just entries on the board, dear one." <words>272</words> She held up the marble collection, each crack a pathway to possibility. <words>285</words> "These showed me how the puzzle edges fit together, how to access the universe's administrative functions." <words>302</words>

"But you haven't done it yet," Chen observed. <words>310</words>

"Haven't I?" <words>312</words> Kira's smile was enigmatic. <words>316</words> "Or have I already done it between heartbeats, in that space where intention becomes reality?" <words>332</words> She stood, her prophet's robes—practical mining gear modified with fragments of those puzzle edges—rustling like cosmic static. <words>350</words> 

"The final oath isn't sworn with words, Chen." <words>358</words> She pressed a cracked marble into his palm. <words>366</words> "It's made in that moment of choosing whether to shatter the game board or simply rearrange the pieces." <words>384</words> Her fingers traced the constellation of cracks across the marble's surface. <words>395</words> "I've made my choice, but the universe hasn't finished processing it yet." <words>407</words>

As Chen stared at the marble, Kira walked toward the observation deck, where Earth hung like a blue marble—uncracked, but perhaps not for long. <words>432</words> The cosmic scoreboard awaited her decision, and she approached it with the measured steps of someone who knew that salvation and destruction were simply different arrangements of the same puzzle. <words>463</words>
