The sapped herbalist pressed her forehead against the cool glass of the observatory, watching the ocean with fervent indifference. <words>16</words> She had arrived three weeks ago to study tide patterns, though she couldn't quite remember why it had seemed important. <words>35</words> The blacksmith's bellows she'd inherited from her grandmother sat unused in the corner, its leather lungs collecting salt dust. <words>54</words> 

During her afternoon napping—which had stretched to consume most daylight hours—she dreamed of perfection. <words>69</words> Perfect tinctures, perfect remedies, perfect understanding of the sea's rhythms. <words>79</words> But perfection, she was learning, extracted its own price. <words>88</words> Each precise measurement, each flawless preparation had drained something essential from her, leaving her thoughtfully thoughtless. <words>104</words> She analyzed everything yet understood nothing. <words>110</words>

A lone goose traced its path across the grey sky, and she followed its flight with hollow eyes. <words>128</words> The bird's trajectory mapped something profound—she was certain—but the meaning slipped through her fingers like sand. <words>145</words> She had once cherished such moments of natural wisdom, when the world spoke in patterns only herbalists could decipher. <words>164</words> Now she merely catalogued: northeast to southwest, seventeen degrees above horizon, wing-beat interval of 1.3 seconds. <words>180</words>

The glass walls of her clifftop prison reflected her gaunt face back at her from every angle. <words>197</words> She had chosen this observatory for its unobstructed view of the tides, believing that perfect observation would yield perfect knowledge. <words>217</words> Instead, the endless watching had become a kind of sleeping while awake. <words>229</words>

She turned to the bellows, remembering how her grandmother had used it not for metalwork but for drying herbs. <words>248</words> "Fire breathes life into dead things," the old woman had said. <words>259</words> The herbalist lifted the heavy tool, working its handles with mechanical precision. <words>271</words> Air wheezed through the nozzle—in, out, in, out—matching the rhythm of the waves below. <words>286</words>

The goose circled back, defying her calculated flight path. <words>295</words> It landed on the observatory's roof with a sound like dropped stones. <words>307</words> Through the glass ceiling, she could see its breast rising and falling, alive with purposeless purpose. <words>323</words> 

She understood then what the price of perfection had cost her: the ability to cherish imperfection. <words>339</words> The tides didn't follow her charts exactly. <words>346</words> The goose flew where it pleased. <words>352</words> Her grandmother's bellows had dried herbs unevenly, yet they had healed better than her flawless preparations ever could. <words>370</words>

Setting down the bellows, she opened the observatory door. <words>379</words> Salt wind rushed in, disturbing her careful notes, scattering months of pristine observations. <words>392</words> She watched them flutter like white wings into the churning sea below, and felt something worn and precious stir within her sapped soul. <words>416</words> The goose honked once, thoughtfully thoughtless, and she smiled her first real smile in months. <words>431</words> Tomorrow she would gather imperfect herbs from the clifftop, dry them with the ancient bellows, and remember what it meant to heal. <words>454</words>
