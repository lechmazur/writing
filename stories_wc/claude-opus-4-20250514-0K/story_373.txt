Dr. Vera Chen's cybernetic fingers twitched as the train whistle faded into the neon-lit distance of New Atlantis. <words>16</words>

The underwater metropolis sprawled beneath layers of kaleidoscopic coral, its bioluminescent patterns pulsing like a fevered dream. <words>33</words>

She clutched the blacksmith's bucket—a relic from the surface world—its rusted metal containing her most precious contraband: organic tissue samples. <words>54</words>

In this age of mandatory augmentation, pure flesh had become the ultimate taboo, forbidden by the Synthesis Council that governed all human-machine integration. <words>78</words>

Vera's veterinary practice served as perfect cover; nobody questioned why she hoarded biological materials when her patients were the last remaining organic creatures. <words>102</words>

Tonight, she would feast. <words>106</words>

The abandoned motel district beckoned through the coral maze, its forgotten rooms holding secrets that could distort reality itself. <words>125</words>

She'd discovered the phenomenon while rummaging through Room 47 last month—how certain combinations of organic matter and cybernetic interfaces could challenge everything the Council taught about consciousness. <words>153</words>

Her uniquely effective neural modifications allowed her to process these forbidden experiences without the madness that claimed other experimenters. <words>173</words>

The bucket grew heavier with each step, its contents sloshing with promise. <words>185</words>

Inside the motel's collapsed lobby, bioluminescent coral had invaded through shattered windows, creating a cathedral of light and shadow. <words>204</words>

Vera activated her surgical suite, watching mechanical arms unfold from her spine like chrome wings. <words>219</words>

The first taste always transported her—raw sensation flooding circuits designed only for data. <words>233</words>

Her cybernetic veterinarian credentials meant nothing here; she was simply an addict to the primal, chasing the ghost of humanity through mouthfuls of forbidden flesh. <words>258</words>

Each bite distorted her perception further, memories of the surface world bleeding through: real sunlight, unfiltered air, bodies without metal. <words>278</words>

The bucket emptied as she consumed her sacred taboo, aware that discovery meant decommissioning, but unable to stop. <words>296</words>

Outside, the coral pulsed in rhythm with her hybrid heartbeat, as if the city itself shared her hunger. <words>314</words>

When dawn's artificial light crept through the ruins, Vera emerged transformed—neither fully machine nor flesh, but something altogether more disturbing. <words>334</words>

Her patients would never know their doctor carried pieces of them inside her now, challenging the very perception of what it meant to be alive in New Atlantis. <words>362</words>

The empty bucket clanged against metal stairs as she descended back into the legitimate world, her secret safe within the raucous silence of her augmented body. <words>389</words>

Tomorrow, she would fill the bucket again, driven by a hunger that no amount of technology could satisfy. <words>407</words>

The train whistle echoed once more across the coral city, and Dr. Vera Chen smiled with too many teeth. <words>426</words>
