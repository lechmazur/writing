Li Wei's fingers trembled as they traced the tattered doll's dress, its silk threads catching the sunlight that streamed through the debris of the collapsed theater wing. <words>24</words> The ancient Chinese palace, reimagined as humanity's last cultural preserve after the oil ran dry, housed performers who were more archaeologists than artists. <words>46</words>

As a chameleon stage actor, Wei had mastered every role except the one that mattered most—himself. <words>62</words> The dress belonged to a child actress who vanished during the palace's conversion fifty years ago, when fossil fuels became memory and solar panels crowned every pagoda. <words>89</words> Wei's rationally impulsive nature made him perfect for solving cold-case mysteries through performance, recreating final moments to reproduce truth from fragments. <words>110</words>

"The child performed here," he whispered, transforming his posture to match a ten-year-old's uncertainty. <words>125</words> Sunlight through debris created a natural spotlight, illuminating dust motes that danced like tiny ghosts. <words>140</words> His method was simple yet profound: embody the missing until their secrets surfaced through pure emotional honesty woven into theatrical illusion. <words>161</words>

The palace's current director had commissioned him to solve twelve disappearances, each one a thread in understanding how art survived civilization's collapse. <words>183</words> Wei's anxious serenity—that peculiar balance between fear and peace—allowed him to channel victims without drowning in their terror. <words>202</words>

He donned the tiny dress over his costume, feeling its weight despite its size. <words>216</words> The fabric smelled of jasmine and fear-sweat, preserved by the dry air of the renewable-energy era. <words>233</words> As he moved through the choreography found in the girl's diary, muscle memory that wasn't his own guided each step. <words>254</words>

"She hid," Wei breathed, his voice pitched high and young. <words>264</words> "Not from the renovation crews, but from someone she trusted." <words>274</words> The sunlight shifted, revealing a hidden panel behind fallen timber. <words>284</words>

Inside lay twelve small skeletons, each clutching props from their final performances. <words>296</words> The missing children hadn't vanished—they'd been murdered by the palace's original director, who feared young talent would expose his mediocrity in the new world. <words>321</words>

Wei collapsed, the doll's dress tearing further as his adult frame convulsed with borrowed grief. <words>337</words> This was why he solved these mysteries through performance: to give voice to the silenced, to reproduce their truth in a world that had learned to live without burning the past for fuel. <words>370</words>

Tomorrow, he would stage their stories, weaving their emotional honesty into an illusion of justice. <words>385</words> The audience would weep, not knowing whether they mourned the children, the old world, or themselves. <words>401</words> Wei removed the dress carefully, folding it with reverence. <words>410</words> In the marriage of anxious serenity and sunlight through debris, he had found them all. <words>425</words>
