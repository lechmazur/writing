Sarah's gloved fingers traced the weathered fishing lure embedded in the quantum tunnel's wall, its rusted hooks catching the oscillating light that bent time itself. <words>23</words> She'd been here before—would be here again—trapped in this loop where every emergency call led back to this crystalline corridor between dimensions. <words>45</words>

The paramedic badge on her uniform flickered between states: visible to all, yet holding secrets only she could access—privately public, like her own unraveling mind. <words>71</words> Each loop brought the same cardiac arrest victim, the same futile chest compressions, the same flatline that echoed through realities. <words>90</words>

But this time, something shifted. <words>95</words>

A single raindrop—impossible in this sterile void—struck the tunnel floor with a sound that shouldn't exist here. <words>112</words> The tone resonated at precisely 432 Hz, the frequency of healing, and Sarah felt her excitement build even as the familiar boredom of repetition threatened to consume her. <words>140</words>

She'd tried everything: different medications, altered techniques, even screaming at the quantum walls until her voice gave out. <words>158</words> Nothing broke the cycle. <words>162</words> The victim—a child who looked exactly like her brother had at seven—died every time, and with each death, her childhood trauma nested deeper in her chest, building layers of guilt like a bird preparing for winter. <words>198</words>

The raindrop's echo became a bell, tolling for a recess she'd forgotten—that day on the playground when she'd failed to save him from drowning in the school's flooding basement. <words>228</words> Time folded. <words>230</words> The quantum tunnel revealed its true nature: not a passage between dimensions, but between moments of regret. <words>247</words>

Sarah knelt beside the manifestation of her nightmare, understanding flooding through her like electric current. <words>262</words> The weathered lure wasn't debris—it was the same one her brother had been reaching for when the water took him. <words>282</words> She'd kept it all these years, carried it through medical school, through every shift, through every loop. <words>299</words>

"I accept you," she whispered to the dying child, to her brother, to herself. <words>313</words> "I accept that I couldn't save you then." <words>321</words> Her tears fell upward in the tunnel's twisted gravity. <words>330</words> "But I've saved so many others because of you." <words>339</words>

The loop shuddered. <words>342</words> The child's eyes opened—not her brother's green, but stranger's brown. <words>352</words> A real patient. <words>355</words> A real emergency. <words>358</words> The quantum tunnel dissolved into the familiar chaos of her ambulance, sirens wailing through real rain. <words>374</words>

Sarah performed CPR with renewed purpose, each compression a prayer of acceptance, baptizing her nightmares in the sacred water of forgiveness. <words>395</words> The heart monitor sang its electronic hymn: beep, beep, beep. <words>405</words> Life returning. <words>407</words> Time moving forward. <words>410</words> The weathered lure fell from her pocket, finally released, as Sarah discovered that healing others had always been her way of healing herself. <words>433</words>
