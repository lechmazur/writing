Elara pressed her thumb against the copper disc, feeling its ridges where the Lincoln Memorial had been flattened into abstract lines. <words>17</words> Her pressed penny collection contained exactly one hundred specimens, each stolen from a different enchanted orchard across the realm. <words>35</words> The living statues that policed these sacred groves never caught her—she was far too rationally mischievous for their stone-slow reflexes. <words>56</words>

Tonight, she would steal her final penny. <words>63</words>

The moon carved silver paths through the apple boughs, and Elara followed them with practiced ease, oscillating between shadow and light. <words>84</words> As a vivid dreamer, she understood that reality bent differently here, where stone guardians pretended to slumber while watching everything. <words>104</words> Their patient vigilance amused her in the dourest way possible. <words>114</words>

She paused at the threshold of the central grove, knowing an apology trembled on her lips—not for her thefts, but for what she was about to reveal. <words>142</words> The ultimate cosmic deception wasn't that these orchards grew enchanted fruit. <words>153</words> It was that the statues themselves were the true harvest. <words>163</words>

A granite maiden shifted, her eyes tracking Elara's movement. <words>172</words> "You return," she said, voice like grinding millstones. <words>180</words>

"I always return," Elara replied, producing her penny press—a contraption she'd modified to work on more than just copper. <words>199</words> "Tell me, guardian, do you remember being human?" <words>207</words>

The statue's expression cracked, literally. <words>212</words> "We are eternal protectors." <words>216</words>

"You're prisoners," Elara corrected, her tone carrying that particular blend of sorrow and bitter humor she'd perfected over ninety-nine previous heists. <words>238</words> "Each orchard is a collection site. <words>244</words> Each statue, a pressed soul, flattened into service." <words>252</words>

She held up her collection, moonlight revealing not pennies but tiny, crystallized memories. <words>265</words> "I've been gathering evidence. <words>269</words> Your memories, compressed but not destroyed." <words>275</words>

The guardian oscillated between fury and hope, her stone form rippling. <words>286</words> "Why?" <words>287</words>

"Because someone needs to remember you were once dreamers too," Elara said, approaching with her modified press. <words>304</words> "And because the real thieves—the ones who built these orchards and made you forget—never expected a rationally mischievous soul to follow the moon paths backwards." <words>331</words>

She pressed the device against the statue's base. <words>339</words> The guardian didn't resist; perhaps she recognized a fellow patient soul. <words>350</words> The stone began to crack, revealing something luminous beneath. <words>359</words>

"This might hurt," Elara warned, though her dour amusement suggested she knew it definitely would. <words>374</words> "But freedom usually does." <words>378</words>

As the first guardian began to remember her name, Elara smiled grimly. <words>390</words> Ninety-nine down, thousands to go. <words>395</words> The cosmic deception would unravel, one pressed memory at a time. <words>406</words>
