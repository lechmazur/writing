The arctic research greenhouse stood like a crystal cathedral against the endless white, its glass walls fogging with the breath of tropical plants that shouldn't exist here. <words>24</words> Arcturus, an old-fashioned mage in moth-eaten robes, wandered through the humid rows with purposefully aimless steps, clutching a weathered fragment of a pharaoh's coffin. <words>49</words>

The children's laughter echoed from the makeshift playground outside—scientists' families making the best of their isolation during the afternoon recreation hour. <words>70</words> But Arcturus paid them no mind, his ancient eyes fixed on the mirrors strategically placed among the orchids to maximize sunlight. <words>91</words> Each reflection showed him something different: not his wizened face, but fleeting visions of those who had touched the coffin fragment before him. <words>115</words>

"Show me," he whispered to the shard, and the mirrors rippled. <words>126</words>

A young archaeologist appeared in the first mirror, her face twisted in horror as she pried the piece from its tomb. <words>147</words> In the second, a black market dealer counted coins with trembling fingers. <words>159</words> The third revealed a museum curator who wept as she packed it away, understanding too late what she'd unleashed. <words>178</words>

The unfolding riddle of the fragment consumed Arcturus—each ephemeral encounter in the mirrors added another piece to the puzzle. <words>197</words> The pharaoh's curse wasn't death, but something far worse: an irresistible compulsion to seek the uncharted frontier between life and whatever lay beyond. <words>221</words> Each previous owner had glimpsed it and retreated in terror. <words>231</words>

But Arcturus wandered on, neither hurrying nor slowing, letting the greenhouse's sacred geometry guide his seemingly random path. <words>249</words> The mirrors began showing him deeper visions—the pharaoh himself, preparing for a journey no living soul had mapped. <words>267</words>

A child's ball rolled through the greenhouse door, and a small girl chased after it. <words>282</words> She stopped, staring at the old mage. <words>289</words> Without thinking, Arcturus knelt and opened his arms, and she ran to him for a brief, impossible cuddle. <words>307</words> In that moment of human warmth, the mirrors exploded with light. <words>318</words>

The riddle's answer blazed through him with sanctified dread: the uncharted frontier wasn't a place but a choice—to remain tethered to life through simple acts of love, or to follow the pharaoh's path into the luminous void. <words>356</words> The fragment grew warm in his pocket as the child ran back outside. <words>369</words>

Arcturus stood among the mirrors, understanding at last why the greenhouse had called him here. <words>384</words> The tropical plants breathed around him, alive and defiant in this frozen wasteland, just as he must choose to be. <words>404</words> He drew out the fragment, kissed it once, and buried it deep in the rich soil of a banana tree, claiming his frontier at last. <words>429</words>
