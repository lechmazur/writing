Brother Aldric clutched the creased shipping label, its faded ink revealing an address he'd seen only in dreams. <words>18</words> The aerial gondola swayed precariously as it crossed the mist-shrouded mountains, carrying him toward answers he'd sought for twenty years. <words>38</words> His reflection in the gondola's scratched window was visually unappealing—scarred, weathered, haunted by memories of his twin brother's betrayal. <words>57</words>

In the heartbeat after a dream returns, clarity strikes like lightning. <words>68</words> Last night, Aldric had finally understood the vision that plagued him: Marcus hadn't just stolen the monastery's sacred flute—he'd murdered their master. <words>90</words> The proof lay in the tooth marks on the antique instrument, marks Aldric had photographed before the theft. <words>108</words> Marcus had a chipped incisor from childhood; the impression would be unmistakable. <words>121</words>

The gondola creaked, ascending through clouds that seemed to whisper warnings. <words>133</words> Aldric's stubborn nature had kept him searching when others declared the case cold, harvesting the past for fragments of truth. <words>154</words> Every lead, every rumor, every faded document had led to this moment. <words>167</words> The shipping label, discovered in the monastery's archives, showed where Marcus had sent the flute—to a collector in these very mountains. <words>190</words>

His fingers traced prayer beads, though vengeance warred with his vows. <words>201</words> To avenge their master meant confronting not just Marcus, but the darkness within himself. <words>216</words> They were twins, mirrors of possibility—one choosing devotion, the other greed. <words>228</words> Aldric had spent years learning to outsmart your own dark reflection, understanding that Marcus would anticipate his every move. <words>248</words>

The gondola station emerged from the mist like a castle from legend. <words>261</words> Aldric felt cautious enchantment at the sight—this place existed at the boundary between justice and revenge. <words>278</words> The collector's mansion perched impossibly on the cliff face, its windows glowing amber in the twilight. <words>295</words>

Inside his satchel, beside the photographed tooth marks, lay a letter from the local authorities. <words>311</words> They would arrest Marcus based on Aldric's evidence, but only if the flute could be recovered. <words>328</words> The monk's weathered hands steadied as the gondola docked. <words>338</words> Twenty years of patient investigation, of analyzing minute details others overlooked, had prepared him for this confrontation. <words>356</words>

As he stepped onto the platform, mountain wind whipping his robes, Aldric glimpsed a figure in an upper window. <words>376</words> Even from this distance, he recognized his brother's silhouette—waiting, knowing, perhaps even welcoming this inevitable reunion. <words>393</words> The past had been harvested; now came the reckoning. <words>403</words> Brother Aldric moved forward, carrying justice in his scarred hands and mercy in his stubborn heart. <words>419</words>
