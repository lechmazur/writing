The tired swordsman sat in the quiet breakroom, staring at the resignation letter Brother Chen had left on the stone table. <words>17</words> The floating rock monastery had lost another soul to despair, another warrior who'd forgotten why they climbed these suspended peaks. <words>36</words>

He lifted his plain cloth bag, feeling the weight of meteor fragments he'd collected over decades. <words>52</words> Each stone represented a night he'd followed the celestial trails across the sky bridges between floating monasteries, searching for something he could no longer name. <words>77</words> The other monks called him fiercely apathetic, mistaking his exhaustion for indifference. <words>89</words>

But they didn't understand. <words>93</words> His apathy was armor, carefully cultivated to protect the spark of defiance that still flickered in his chest. <words>111</words> Years ago, he'd made a promise to himself: never surrender to the comfortable numbness that claimed so many warriors. <words>131</words> That promise lived beneath layers of weariness, hidden even from his own conscious mind most days. <words>147</words>

Brother Chen's departure should mean nothing. <words>153</words> Another resignation, another empty meditation cushion, another set of swords returned to the armory. <words>167</words> Yet as he sat there, something stirred. <words>174</words>

"The meteor shower begins tonight," Master Wu announced from the doorway, his voice carrying that particular tone of knowing naivety that only the truly ancient could master. <words>202</words> "The bridges will be treacherous." <words>207</words>

The swordsman nodded, already knowing he would go. <words>215</words> Not because he cared about the celestial display or the dangerous crossing between the floating rocks. <words>231</words> He would go because following meteor showers had become his ritual of remembrance, his way of honoring that buried promise. <words>251</words>

Standing slowly, joints protesting after too many battles, he shouldered his plain cloth bag. <words>265</words> The other monks would whisper about his strange obsession, his nightly wanderings. <words>277</words> Let them. <words>279</words> They saw contradiction in his fierce apathy, never realizing it was the only way he'd found to overcome the crushing weight of endless days. <words>304</words>

As he stepped onto the narrow bridge connecting their monastery to the next floating peak, meteors began streaking overhead. <words>323</words> Each luminous trail reminded him why he continued this charade of not caring while caring deeply. <words>339</words> The spark of defiance flared brighter with each step into the star-drunk darkness. <words>353</words>

Brother Chen had resigned because he'd lost his spark entirely. <words>363</words> The tired swordsman pressed forward, bag heavy with fallen stars, knowing his seeming indifference was the fiercest rebellion of all. <words>383</words> He would follow these meteor showers until his bones turned to dust, protecting his hidden promise with cultivated exhaustion. <words>402</words> In the quiet breakroom tomorrow, his empty seat would tell its own story of perseverance disguised as surrender. <words>420</words> The floating rock monastery would endure, and so would he, one apathetic step at a time. <words>437</words>
