The lost apprentice, Kira, discovered the fallen bird's nest wedged between two hydroponic apple trees on deck seven. <words>17</words> She'd been wandering the interstellar orchard ship for three days since her mentor vanished into the void between galaxies. <words>35</words>

"Still moping around like a cosmic orphan?" Captain Vega's voice crackled through the ancient cordless phone mounted to the tree trunk. <words>56</words> The device, a relic from Earth, served as the ship's peculiar intercom system—its static-laden confessions traveling through electromagnetic fields that pulsed between the bio-domes. <words>81</words>

Kira lifted the handset, her voice carrying mocking affection. <words>90</words> "I'm reverse-engineering wisdom from this nest, actually. <words>97</words> Some traveler's wisdom about how even birds know when to leave home." <words>109</words>

"Ah, privately open as always—sharing your deepest thoughts with inanimate objects while pretending you're fine." <words>124</words> The captain's chuckle dissolved into static. <words>130</words> "Your mentor left those same breadcrumbs when she was young. <words>140</words> Same deck, same trees, probably the same existential crisis." <words>149</words>

Across the promise of changing winds—solar winds that would shift their trajectory in seventy-two hours—Kira had to decide. <words>167</words> Stay aboard as the ship's new caretaker, or take an escape pod back to the last visited galaxy. <words>185</words>

She studied the nest's intricate weaving, each twig placed with purpose despite its fallen state. <words>200</words> "Did she tell you why she left?" <words>207</words>

"Through that very phone, twenty years ago. <words>214</words> Said freedom wasn't about running away, but accepting that sometimes we're meant to tend gardens we didn't plant." <words>232</words> Static swelled between words. <words>236</words> "She found her self-acceptance in teaching you, even knowing you'd eventually ask these same questions." <words>251</words>

Kira pressed her forehead against the smooth bark, inhaling the impossible scent of earth and apples in deep space. <words>270</words> The nest had fallen, but it remained whole—a small universe of intention and care. <words>285</words>

"The birds that built this," she whispered into the phone, "they knew it might fall, didn't they?" <words>302</words>

"Everything falls, little apprentice. <words>306</words> The question is whether we're falling toward something or away from it." <words>318</words>

She could hear her mentor's words now, reverse-engineered through the captain's static-laden confessions, through twenty years of similar conversations on this same phone. <words>341</words> The orchard ship would continue its migration, carrying its gardens and ghosts between galaxies. <words>355</words> And she would tend them, not because she was lost, but because she'd found herself in the falling. <words>373</words>

"Tell the navigation team I'm staying," Kira said, cradling the nest. <words>384</words> "Someone needs to hang this back up where it belongs." <words>394</words>

"Already knew you would, kid. <words>399</words> Welcome home." <words>401</words>
