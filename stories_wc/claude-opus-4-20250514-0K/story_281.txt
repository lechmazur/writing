Marcus slipped his nimble fingers into another pocket, but instead of a wallet, he pulled out a miniature ventriloquist dummy with obsidian eyes. <words>19</words> The pickpocket stared, baffled, as the wooden figure's jaw clicked open on its own. <words>33</words>

"Between appointments, are we?" the dummy rasped, its voice echoing through the abandoned lighthouse engine room where Marcus had fled after his latest heist. <words>58</words> The thief stumbled backward into rusted gears, his practiced composure cracking. <words>69</words>

"What manner of transformation is this?" Marcus whispered, watching the dummy's limbs twitch with impossible life. <words>86</words> The eerie puppet cocked its head, painted smile widening. <words>95</words>

"You steal possessions, but I steal certainty," it said. <words>104</words> "Your fingers know only taking, but have you considered giving?" <words>114</words>

Marcus felt his mind growing confusingly lucid, as if fog had lifted to reveal a landscape he'd never noticed. <words>133</words> Words bubbled up from somewhere deep, spilling out in impromptu verse: "I've picked a thousand pockets clean, / But never picked apart what picking means." <words>159</words>

The dummy applauded with tiny wooden hands. <words>166</words> "Poetry sustains the soul's rebellion," it declared. <words>173</words> "You challenge property's status quo through theft, but what if you challenged thought itself through art?" <words>189</words>

Heat flooded Marcus's cheeks despite the engine room's damp chill. <words>199</words> He spoke again, unable to stop: "These hands that grasp at others' gold / Now grasp at truths I've never told." <words>220</words> Each rhyme transformed him, peeling away layers of rationalization. <words>229</words>

"The art of transformation begins with confession," the dummy instructed, its painted eyes somehow both dead and intensely alive. <words>248</words> "Your scorching poise as a master thief masks a deeper hunger." <words>259</words>

Marcus sank to his knees on the salt-stained floor, verses pouring forth: "I steal because I am empty space, / A shadow seeking substance, grace. / But poetry fills what theft cannot— / The hollow where my soul forgot." <words>301</words>

The lighthouse machinery groaned around them, as if awakening to his words. <words>313</words> "Between your scheduled thefts, you've discovered your true appointment," the dummy observed. <words>325</words> "Not with victims' pockets, but with your own transformation." <words>334</words>

"I understand now," Marcus said, his voice steady with newfound purpose. <words>345</words> "The greatest heist is stealing back myself from who I've become." <words>356</words>

The dummy's jaw clicked shut, returning to lifeless wood. <words>365</words> Marcus tucked it carefully into his own pocket—not as stolen goods, but as a teacher. <words>381</words> He climbed the lighthouse stairs, leaving his old profession behind, ready to sustain himself through verses that would challenge more than just the ownership of wallets. <words>408</words> His fingers, once instruments of theft, now itched only for a pen. <words>420</words> The art of transformation had claimed its newest practitioner, and poetry would be his method of revolution. <words>437</words> Between the appointments of his former life, he had discovered his true calling in the most haunted of places. <words>456</words>
