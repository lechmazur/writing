The exorcist floated among the orbital debris, her hands trembling as she clutched the pressed wildflowers—the only truth her grandmother had left her. <words>20</words> Everything else had been lies: the family's earthbound legacy, their supposed gift for banishing spirits, even the story of how they'd lost their home planet. <words>43</words> She'd discovered the deception while assembling toy spacecraft in the station's workshop, when she'd accidentally triggered a hidden recording. <words>62</words>

Her stage fright had always been her curse—how could an exorcist work when her voice seized before crowds? <words>80</words> But here, surrounded by twisted metal and frozen memories, she understood: her grandmother had crafted that fear deliberately. <words>98</words> It was protection, keeping her from performing the false rituals that had destroyed their bloodline's credibility. <words>114</words>

The wildflowers drifted from her grip as she heard it—the sound of a key turning in a lock, impossible in the vacuum yet unmistakable. <words>138</words> The debris field wasn't random; it was a puzzle, and her inheritance of lies had been the blueprint to solve it. <words>159</words> Each floating fragment held a toy component she recognized from her workshop duties, magnified to massive scale. <words>176</words>

Nothing about her life had been usual—never usual, her grandmother would say with that knowing smile. <words>193</words> The old woman had hidden the truth in plain sight: they weren't exorcists of spirits but of possibilities, sculptors of potential from the ashes of "never." <words>219</words> 

With defiant determination, she began to submerge herself in the work, not in water but in the vast ocean of space between the debris. <words>243</words> Her hands moved with practiced precision, assembling the massive toy-fragments into something new. <words>256</words> The stage fright evaporated; there was no audience here, only the silent testimony of destroyed worlds. <words>272</words>

As pieces locked together, she understood the final deception: the spirits her family had banished weren't supernatural—they were the ghosts of failed futures, timelines that led to extinction. <words>301</words> The toys she'd assembled for years were practice, preparing her for this moment. <words>314</words>

The orbital graveyard transformed under her touch, becoming a vast key itself. <words>326</words> When the last piece clicked into place, space itself seemed to exhale in a defiant hush. <words>342</words> The pressed wildflowers, suspended in the void, began to bloom impossibly, their petals spreading color through the darkness. <words>360</words>

She had inherited lies, yes, but they were lies that protected a greater truth: sometimes deception is the cocoon from which possibility emerges. <words>383</words> Her grandmother's greatest exorcism had been banishing the future where humanity remained trapped by its own limitations. <words>400</words>

Now, amid the assembled remnants, she finally understood her purpose—to unlock the door her ancestors had spent generations preparing. <words>419</words> The universe held its breath as she turned the cosmic key, ready to sculpt a new possibility from the ashes of "never." <words>441</words>
