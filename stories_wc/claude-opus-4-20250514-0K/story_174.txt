Elara traced frost patterns on the abandoned car window, her breath misting in the mountain air. <words>15</words> Each crystalline formation reminded her of gunpowder trails—subtle paths unfolding like the fireworks she'd designed for thirty years. <words>33</words> Behind her, the waterfall thundered, concealing the entrance she'd spent months searching for. <words>47</words>

The hidden library existed between moments, accessible only when frost formed specific patterns that matched her grandmother's pressed leaf collection. <words>67</words> Elara pulled the brittle album from her satchel, comparing maple veins to ice fractals. <words>81</words> Her fingers, stained with sulfur and charcoal, trembled as the patterns aligned. <words>93</words>

The waterfall parted like a curtain. <words>99</words>

Inside, books floated in temporal suspension, their pages turning at different speeds—some racing through centuries, others frozen mid-word. <words>118</words> Elara had always been theoretically creative, sketching fireworks that defied physics, but here, theory became possibility. <words>135</words> She could augment reality itself. <words>140</words>

Twenty years ago, she'd designed the memorial firework for her daughter's wedding—a chrysanthemum burst that would spell Sara's name in golden sparks. <words>163</words> But Elara had mixed the chemicals wrong, creating a dud that fizzled in darkness while guests shifted uncomfortably. <words>181</words> Sara had smiled, said it didn't matter, but Elara saw disappointment flicker across her face like a shadow. <words>199</words> They never spoke of it again. <words>205</words> Sara died three years later, the failed firework becoming Elara's deepest regret. <words>217</words>

The library's temporal nature meant she could fold that moment back into now. <words>230</words> Not change it—the books made that clear—but augment it, layer the intended beauty over the failed reality. <words>248</words> She found the night documented in a volume that smelled of champagne and tears. <words>262</words>

Following the frost-pattern instructions, Elara pressed her grandmother's leaves between the pages. <words>274</words> Each leaf held a different firework design, theoretical creations she'd never dared attempt. <words>287</words> The maple became the chrysanthemum burst, the oak transformed into cascading gold letters, the birch into Sara's favorite constellation. <words>306</words>

Time folded. <words>308</words> In the past, the dud still fizzled, but now it cast shadows that bloomed into light, visible only to Sara. <words>328</words> Her daughter's face illuminated with wonder as ghostly fireworks painted her name across dimensions. <words>342</words> The augmentation rippled forward—in Sara's final days, she'd told nurses about the "secret fireworks" only she could see, how they'd made her wedding perfect. <words>366</words>

Elara emerged from the waterfall as frost melted from the car window. <words>378</words> The pressed leaves had turned to ash, their purpose complete. <words>388</words> She'd solved the familiar puzzle of regret not by erasing it, but by weaving beauty through its cracks. <words>406</words> Time's ephemeral nature had allowed her this gift: to be a wandering fireworks designer who finally learned that the most profound displays happen in the shadows between moments. <words>435</words>
