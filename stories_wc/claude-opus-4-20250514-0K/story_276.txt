The orbital debris tracking station lurched against its gyroscopic stabilizers as Ambassador Chen pressed her forehead to the observation window. <words>17</words> She'd arrived three months ago, an uneasy emissary between Earth's warring factions, seeking something she couldn't name. <words>34</words>

The station's common area doubled as a memorial—its refrigerator door covered in postcards from the dead colonies, rustling in recycled air like autumn leaves. <words>59</words> Chen often found herself there during the crew's weekly picnics, watching patterns emerge in their careful avoidance of certain cards. <words>79</words>

"You keep staring at Zagreb-7," muttered Kowalski, the station's senior tracker, gesturing with a thin coathanger he'd bent into a pointing tool. <words>102</words> "My daughter sent that one." <words>107</words>

Throughout their Sunday picnics, Chen had noticed how each crew member navigated the memorial differently—some cards touched reverently, others ignored completely. <words>129</words> The coathanger trembled in Kowalski's grip as he traced constellations between postcards, showing her the debris fields that had once been homes. <words>152</words>

"Every impact creates new patterns," he said, his voice cracking. <words>162</words> "I track them all—the metal, the memories, the mistakes." <words>172</words>

Chen's diplomatic training hadn't prepared her for this accidental wisdom scattered throughout conversations about trajectories and orbital decay. <words>190</words> She'd come seeking grand strategies to heal Earth's divisions, but found truth in smaller things: how grief moved in elliptical orbits, how redemption grew like branches from unexpected seeds. <words>220</words>

During one picnic, the station lurched violently—a piece of debris narrowly missing their hull. <words>235</words> The postcards rustled frantically, and Chen instinctively caught three that fell: New Mumbai, Titan Base, her own childhood home in Beijing. <words>257</words>

"The universe keeps teaching," Kowalski said, helping her pin them back. <words>268</words> "Whether we're listening or not." <words>273</words>

Week after week, picnic after picnic, Chen documented these patterns—not in the debris fields, but in the crew's small acts of preservation and memory. <words>298</words> She watched them bend coat hangers into tools, into art, into bridges between what was lost and what remained. <words>318</words>

Her final report would surprise Earth's leaders with its simplicity: reconciliation wasn't found in grand gestures but in shared meals among the wreckage, in the rustle of remembrance, in the branches of redemption that grew when people simply sat together, tracking what they'd lost while building what they'd found. <words>368</words>

The morning she left, Chen added her own postcard to the door—not from any colony, but from the station itself. <words>389</words> "Where I learned," she wrote, "that healing happens in orbits, not straight lines." <words>402</words>

The coathanger Kowalski gave her as a parting gift still hangs in her office, bent into the shape of hope. <words>422</words>
