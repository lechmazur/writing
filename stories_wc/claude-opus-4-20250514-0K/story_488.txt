The solitary summoner prowled the quantum beach, her fingers tracing the map drawn on a leaf that had somehow survived the corrosive salt winds. <words>20</words> At the hush just before a condemned building is demolished, she stood before the abandoned Probability Lighthouse, its walls flickering between existence and void. <words>44</words> Her family had always celebrated the Dissolution Festival here, where they'd summon echoes of possible futures and bind them into tangible inventions. <words>66</words> But that was before the Collapse, before reality grew thin and her bloodline scattered across dimensions like sand through fingers. <words>86</words>

The leaf-map pulsed with oddly authentic coordinates—not of place, but of potential. <words>99</words> Each vein marked a pathway to what could be, each stem a bridge to innovations that existed only in the spaces between quantum states. <words>123</words> She needed this final summoning to work, needed to pull from the collapsing lighthouse the spark of invention that would let her transcend her current form. <words>149</words> Her reflection in the tide pools showed not one face but dozens, each a version of herself that had succeeded where she had failed. <words>173</words>

The demolition crews waited beyond the reality barrier, their machines humming with inevitable purpose. <words>188</words> She had minutes, maybe less, before they collapsed this pocket of possibility forever. <words>201</words> With practiced movements, she began the ritual her grandmother had taught her—not with candles and crystals, but with probability equations scratched in sand and temporal loops woven from seaweed. <words>231</words> The Dissolution Festival had always been about letting go, about celebrating the death of one reality to birth another. <words>250</words>

The lighthouse groaned, its quantum structure failing. <words>257</words> Through the cracks in space-time, she glimpsed the invention she sought—a device that could splice consciousness across dimensions, letting her become all her reflections at once. <words>284</words> But as she reached for it, her own reflection reached back, multiplied and magnificent, already wielding the power she craved. <words>304</words> In that moment of corroded rapture, she understood: to outshine your own reflection, you had to become the light itself. <words>324</words>

She pressed the leaf-map against the lighthouse wall and spoke the summoning words. <words>338</words> The building shuddered, reality bent, and in the space between demolition and existence, she pulled through not the device, but the knowledge to build it. <words>363</words> As the lighthouse collapsed into probability foam, she stood alone on the quantum beach, her mind blazing with blueprints that existed in no dimension but her own. <words>390</words> The spark of invention burned within her now, and when she looked down at the tide pools, only one face stared back—brilliant, singular, and finally surpassing what she had been. <words>420</words>
