The weary undertaker stood beneath the astronomical clock, its bronze gears frozen mid-revolution like the moment after a car backfires in a silent street. <words>20</words> The ancient Persian palace had been reimagined as a mortuary, its turquoise tiles now grey with centuries of dust and death. <words>40</words> He traced the sun paths etched into the clock's face, following the tribal knowledge passed down through generations of his family—knowledge rarely practical in an age of digital timestamps and GPS coordinates. <words>72</words>

But tonight was different. <words>76</words> Tonight, the darkness pressed against the windows like a living thing, absolute and hungry. <words>91</words> The city's power grid had failed three days ago, and with each passing hour, more people brought their dead to him, wrapped in sheets that whispered ancient prayers. <words>120</words>

The astronomical clock held secrets his grandfather had whispered on his deathbed: "When the world goes dark, follow the sun paths backward. <words>143</words> They will show you how to imprison the shadow that comes for the living." <words>158</words> At the time, he'd dismissed it as delirium, but now, with candlelight flickering across the palace's vaulted ceilings, he understood. <words>179</words>

His fingers moved with placid ferocity across the clock's mechanisms, adjusting celestial wheels that hadn't turned in decades. <words>197</words> Each click resonated through the marble halls where Persian kings once walked, now lined with refrigeration units that no longer hummed. <words>219</words> The tribal knowledge flowed through him—not spells or superstitions, but a deep understanding of how light and shadow danced across the earth's surface, how ancient peoples had mapped the sun's journey to predict eclipses, disasters, and worse things. <words>260</words>

As he worked, the darkness outside began to coalesce, taking form. <words>271</words> But the undertaker continued his task, knowing that hope lived in the precision of his movements, in the remembrance of patterns older than electricity. <words>296</words> The clock's final gear clicked into place, and suddenly, impossibly, golden light traced the sun paths carved into the palace floor. <words>318</words>

The shadow recoiled, imprisoned within the boundaries of ancient astronomy made manifest. <words>330</words> Around him, the dead lay peaceful, protected by knowledge that modern science had forgotten—that some darkness could only be fought by understanding the light's true path across the heavens. <words>360</words>

He sat beside the clock, exhausted but vigilant, holding onto hope in the absolute dark. <words>376</words> The palace walls seemed to breathe with him, patient and eternal, while outside the imprisoned shadow writhed against barriers built from tribal wisdom and celestial mathematics. <words>403</words> Dawn would come, following the same sun paths his ancestors had mapped, and with it, the world would remember why they once built clocks that tracked more than just time. <words>434</words>

The weary undertaker closed his eyes, listening to the astronomical clock tick onwards, each sound a heartbeat of hope. <words>454</words>
