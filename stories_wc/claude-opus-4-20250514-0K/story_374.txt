The lonesome minstrel Kael pressed his rubber stamp against the morning requisition form, though the image it left was unclear, smudged like everything else in his life. <words>24</words> In the rooftop horse stables of New Meridian, where the city's elite kept their genetically preserved steeds above the smog line, he tended to the animals while the owners waited in coffee lines far below. <words>56</words>

His grandfather had been head groom here, as had his grandfather's rival, Marcus Vega. <words>70</words> Now their descendants—Kael and Marcus's granddaughter Elena—continued to bicker over stable duties with the same fervor, though neither could remember what started the feud. <words>95</words>

"You're feeding Stardancer wrong again," Elena called from across the stable, her voice cutting through the morning air. <words>112</words>

"I feed him by tracking cloud patterns, like the old ways taught," Kael replied, not looking up from the feed bucket. <words>133</words> It was bizarrely typical how their arguments always began this way, with criticism wrapped in tradition. <words>149</words>

Elena snorted. <words>151</words> "Cloud patterns. <words>153</words> You think you can read the silent cosmos through horse feed?" <words>164</words>

But Kael did believe it. <words>169</words> Every morning, while the city's workers queued for their stimulant doses, he watched the artificial weather systems drift between the towers, seeing messages in their programmed movements. <words>196</words> The horses understood; they always ate better when he aligned their feeding times with the cloud shadows. <words>213</words>

"My grandmother's journal says—" Elena began. <words>219</words>

"My grandfather's manual states—" Kael interrupted. <words>225</words>

They stopped, hearing their own ridiculousness echo in the stable. <words>235</words> The horses nickered, unimpressed by human folly. <words>242</words>

Kael pulled out his stamp again, pressing it to a hay bale tag. <words>256</words> The unclear mark bothered him—he'd inherited it from his grandfather but never learned what image it was supposed to make. <words>277</words> Elena watched him struggle with it. <words>283</words>

"Mine does the same thing," she admitted quietly, producing an identical stamp. <words>295</words> "Blurry. <words>296</words> Indefinite." <words>297</words>

They compared the stamps in the morning light filtering through the atmospheric processors. <words>310</words> Two tools, worn by generations of use, their original purpose lost to inherited stubbornness. <words>324</words>

Below them, the coffee lines grew longer, workers beginning their bizarrely typical day. <words>337</words> Above them, the clouds moved in their predetermined patterns, spelling out nothing and everything. <words>352</words>

"Maybe," Elena said, "we're both reading the same cosmos, just from different angles." <words>365</words>

Kael nodded, feeling the weight of his lute against his back—he only played for the horses now, another lonesome tradition. <words>385</words> Together, they watched the morning clouds drift past, their stamps held loosely, the unclear images somehow making perfect sense in the mundane enchantment of their shared solitude among the rooftop stables. <words>416</words>
