Lord Pemberton adjusted his gardening gloves, pretending to prune the hedges outside the workshop's ventilation grate. <words>13</words> The submissive aristocrat had learned that playing the role of harmless nobility granted him invisible access to the compound's most sensitive areas. <words>34</words> Through the echo chambers beneath, voices carried with crystalline clarity—an architectural flaw the secret agents never suspected their landscaper would exploit. <words>56</words>

"The toxin will liquify its nervous system within minutes," a cold voice drifted upward. <words>70</words> Pemberton's unusually perceptive nature caught the slight tremor beneath the speaker's clinical tone—someone forcing themselves to sound detached. <words>89</words> He recognized that particular flavor of self-loathing; he'd worn it himself when Father demanded he drown the stable kittens. <words>108</words>

His dull letter opener—a gift from his late mother—weighed heavy in his pocket. <words>122</words> Such an absurd tool for espionage, yet its very mundaneness had saved him before. <words>137</words> Through the grate, he glimpsed a glass cage containing something small and luminescent. <words>151</words>

"Sir, the specimen shows signs of sapience," another voice ventured. <words>161</words>

"Irrelevant. We have our orders." <words>166</words>

Pemberton's hands stilled on the shears. <words>172</words> Silent empathy had always been his curse and compass—feeling others' pain without their permission, understanding without words. <words>190</words> The creature in the cage pulsed with a terror so pure it made his teeth ache. <words>207</words>

He slipped through the maintenance door, letter opener palming the ancient lock with practiced ease. <words>223</words> "Terribly sorry," he murmured to the startled agents, affecting his usual bewildered aristocratic air. <words>238</words> "Looking for my pruning shears—dreadfully scatterbrained today." <words>245</words>

While they scrambled for weapons, he "accidentally" knocked over the containment controls with his elbow. <words>261</words> The creature—a bioluminescent octopus no larger than his fist—immediately pooled like liquid mercury through the opened cage. <words>279</words>

"Oops," Pemberton said with earnest flippancy, watching the remarkable being flow toward a drainage grate. <words>295</words> "Butterfingers run in the family, I'm afraid." <words>302</words>

The lead agent raised his weapon, but Pemberton was already bowing apologetically, backing toward the door. <words>319</words> "I'll just see myself out—wouldn't want to track mud on your lovely sterile floors." <words>334</words>

Later, tending his evening roses, he felt a cool touch on his ankle. <words>348</words> The octopus had found him, its chromatophores spelling out intricate patterns of gratitude across its skin. <words>365</words> Pemberton smiled, offering his garden glove as a temporary shelter. <words>376</words>

"The greenhouse pond should suit you nicely," he whispered, his silent empathy confirming the creature's relief. <words>393</words> "And don't worry—aristocrats are expected to be eccentric about their pet projects." <words>406</words>

Sometimes the best protection came disguised as harmless inadequacy. <words>415</words> He'd learned that from Mother, along with the letter opener. <words>426</words> Both equally dull, both unexpectedly effective at opening what needed opening. <words>438</words>

The octopus settled into his pocket, and Pemberton returned to his pruning, whistling tunelessly. <words>453</words> Tomorrow he'd need new employment, but tonight, one extraordinary being would swim free beneath his greenhouse stars. <words>471</words>
