Gears Whitmore adjusted her cracked phone case, the spider-webbed plastic catching fluorescent light from the abandoned subway platform. <words>17</words> She wasn't your typical artificer—no goggles, no grease stains, just a woman in a crisp business suit carrying a rotary phone like a briefcase. <words>44</words>

The underground labyrinth stretched before her, tunnels branching into darkness where trains no longer ran. <words>59</words> Time folded here, yesterday's newspapers fluttering alongside tomorrow's obituaries, but Gears remained professionally detached from such paradoxes. <words>76</words> Her job was simple: inform the living about calls they'd never received. <words>88</words>

She set the rotary phone on a rusted bench, its incomplete call logs spilling out like ticker tape. <words>106</words> Each entry represented someone who'd tried to break free from their assigned role—a banker who'd wanted to dance, a dancer who'd dreamed of banking. <words>131</words> The irony wasn't lost on her, though she kept her observations clinical. <words>143</words>

"Subject 447," she spoke into her cracked phone case, recording notes. <words>154</words> "Attempted contact: March 32nd, 2019. Message: 'I see beauty in spreadsheets now.'" <words>167</words>

The tunnels echoed with empty abundance—thousands of missed connections, millions of unspoken truths. <words>180</words> Graffiti artists had tagged the walls with equations, mathematicians had scrawled poetry. <words>192</words> Everyone trying to be something else, someone else. <words>200</words>

Gears dialed the rotary phone, each click echoing through the temporal maze. <words>212</words> The incomplete logs showed her next assignment: a surgeon who collected bottle caps, finding entire universes in their corrugated edges. <words>232</words> Such zany pursuits from serious people—or was it serious pursuits from zany people? <words>246</words> The distinction blurred down here where time ate its own tail. <words>257</words>

She walked deeper, past abandoned turnstiles that counted backwards, past posters advertising futures that had already failed. <words>274</words> Her cracked phone case caught her reflection—fragmented, multiplied, honest. <words>283</words> For the first time, she wondered if her professional detachment was just another stereotype begging to be broken. <words>301</words>

The rotary phone rang, impossible since it wasn't connected to anything. <words>312</words> She answered anyway. <words>315</words> Static filled her ear, then a voice: "We see beauty in your mundane reports, Gears. In your refusal to judge. In your broken phone case that you never replace." <words>344</words>

She hung up, understanding finally that her role as emotionless informant was the very stereotype she'd been hired to document others breaking. <words>366</words> The empty abundance of the tunnels suddenly felt full—not of absence, but of possibility. <words>381</words>

Gears picked up the rotary phone and dialed herself, leaving a message in the incomplete logs: "Artificer discovers beauty in distance. Requests permission to remain professionally detached while personally engaged." <words>411</words>

Time folded again, and she smiled—a zany expression for someone so serious, a serious expression for someone so zany. <words>430</words> The cracked phone case reflected her smile in infinite fragments, each one breaking a different rule. <words>446</words>

She walked on, informing the uninformed, finding the extraordinary in the ordinary, perfectly imperfect in her contradictions. <words>463</words> The abandoned tunnels sang with her footsteps, empty abundance finally making sense. <words>475</words> Beauty lived in the mundane act of doing one's job while being entirely, stereotypically, wonderfully human. <words>491</words>
