Marcus Chen had grown careless about hiding his identity since retiring from vigilantism three years ago. <words>15</words> Now he wandered the city of forgotten fountains, where moss-covered cherubs spat nothing but promises into cracked basins. <words>32</words> His latest obsession—collecting traditional games from the neighborhood's elders—seemed harmless enough for someone who'd once scaled skyscrapers. <words>50</words>

The antique dentist's drill in his apartment wasn't a trophy but a reminder. <words>63</words> His grandfather, a dentist turned resistance fighter, had hidden messages inside hollow teeth, teaching Marcus that resilience meant finding strength in unexpected places. <words>87</words> These days, Marcus channeled that lesson differently. <words>94</words>

He discovered his best intelligence came from the Copper Corner Barbershop, where the Shaving Cream Serenaders rehearsed every Tuesday. <words>112</words> The quartet's gossip flowed as freely as their harmonies—who was moving away, whose grandmother still remembered the old rope-jumping rhymes, which collector had that rare carved chess set. <words>140</words> Marcus would slouch in the corner, trimming split ends with lazy precision while his mind mapped the conversations. <words>158</words>

"That Mrs. Rodriguez," warbled the baritone between verses, "claims she has the only complete set of lotería cards hand-painted by the fountain artist himself." <words>183</words>

Marcus's scissors paused. <words>186</words> The fountain artist—the mysterious figure who'd designed every whimsical fountain before vanishing—had supposedly embedded a secret game within the city's water features. <words>209</words> Finding it required more than athletic prowess; it demanded patient observation. <words>220</words>

He began his lure that afternoon, at the pause between raindrops when the city smelled like wet copper and possibilities. <words>240</words> He left handwritten notes at three specific fountains, each containing half a riddle about traditional games. <words>257</words> Mrs. Rodriguez, he'd learned, walked past these fountains daily, unable to resist a puzzle. <words>272</words>

Sure enough, she appeared at the fourth fountain—the one with the laughing fish—just as the sun broke through. <words>290</words> "You're that vigilante boy," she said, recognizing him despite his civilian slouch. <words>302</words> "The one who saved the museum's game collection from the flood." <words>313</words>

Marcus smiled. <words>315</words> "I'm just a collector now, hoping to learn from the best." <words>326</words>

She studied him, then pulled out her lotería cards. <words>335</words> Each one revealed part of a larger map when held to the light. <words>348</words> "The fountain artist taught us that games preserve memory better than monuments," she said. <words>363</words> "But they require players, not heroes." <words>369</words>

Together, they traced the map through the city's forgotten fountains, discovering hidden compartments containing ancient games. <words>386</words> Marcus realized his grandfather's lesson had evolved: true resilience meant knowing when to hang up the mask and when to pick up the dice. <words>411</words> The art wasn't in the heroics but in the quiet determination to preserve what mattered, one lazy afternoon at a time. <words>432</words>

As they walked between fountains, the city's hidden whimsy revealed itself in every carved detail, every secret compartment, every story shared. <words>454</words> Marcus had found his new calling, and it required no mask at all. <words>467</words>
