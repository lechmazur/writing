Marcus slouched against an apple tree, its gnarled roots breaking through what used to be the forty-second floor of the Meridian Tower. <words>19</words> The reclaimed orchard had overtaken the toppled skyscraper years ago, nature threading through steel and glass with patient determination. <words>38</words> He fingered the blank price tag in his pocket—his signature tool for the con that would finally expose them all. <words>59</words>

"Energetically lethargic," his invisible allies whispered in his ear, their presence felt but never seen. <words>74</words> They'd been coaching him for months on the perfect paradox: move with purpose while appearing utterly spent. <words>91</words> It was the only way to magnetize the right mark, to draw in someone who believed they were rescuing a harmless fool. <words>113</words>

The computer terminal embedded in the tree trunk had been frozen for three days. <words>127</words> Marcus waited, knowing that when it restarted, the city's entire financial records would refresh, revealing decades of buried transactions. <words>146</words> His blank price tag would become the key—a void where numbers should be, proving that some debts could never be calculated. <words>168</words>

A book fell from the branches above, landing squarely on his chest. <words>180</words> "Environmental Economics: Post-Collapse Edition" read the spine. <words>187</words> 

"Sorry!" A woman descended the rope ladder, her suit incongruous among the fruit trees. <words>201</words> She was Clara Voss, Chief Financial Architect, though she didn't know he knew. <words>214</words>

Marcus let his eyes droop, perfecting his practiced exhaustion while his mind raced. <words>227</words> "S'okay," he mumbled, handing back the book with calculated clumsiness. <words>237</words>

She studied him with predatory kindness. <words>243</words> "You look tired. <words>246</words> There's coffee in the old executive suite—well, what's left of it." <words>257</words>

His invisible allies hummed approval. <words>262</words> The meet-cute had worked. <words>266</words>

As Clara led him through the vertical forest, Marcus felt the computer's circuits beginning to spark back to life. <words>285</words> Soon, very soon, he would attach his blank price tag to her lapel, and the system would recognize what it meant: an admission of immeasurable guilt. <words>312</words>

"You know," he said, his voice deceptively weak, "I used to work in finance." <words>326</words>

She stiffened slightly. <words>329</words> "Really?" <words>330</words>

"Before the collapse. <words>333</words> Before the towers fell and the trees grew." <words>341</words> He paused at the old water cooler, now a planter for strawberries. <words>353</words> "I kept records of things that were never supposed to exist." <words>364</words>

The computer chimed—a sound like breaking ice. <words>371</words> 

Clara's face went pale. <words>375</words> She understood now why he was here, what truth he carried. <words>386</words> The invisible allies pressed closer, ready to witness. <words>394</words>

Marcus pulled out the blank price tag, its emptiness more damning than any number. <words>408</words> "Some things," he said with gentle harshness, "can't be bought, sold, or forgiven." <words>421</words> 

The orchard held its breath as the city's sins began downloading, each file a seed that would grow into justice. <words>442</words>
