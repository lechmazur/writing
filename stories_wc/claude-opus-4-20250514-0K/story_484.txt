The groggy brewer stumbled through the haunted mansion graveyard, clutching a piece of a broken mirror like a talisman against the encroaching darkness. <words>19</words> His head throbbed from last night's sampling session, but the headache paled compared to the existential hangover of being uniquely generic—a craft brewer in a world drowning in IPAs. <words>48</words>

Outside the cemetery gates, protesters chanted about corporate takeovers of local breweries, their voices dying into that peculiar lull where throats clear and convictions gather strength. <words>74</words> Marcus had joined them earlier, shouting about authenticity while secretly knowing his own brewery sold overpriced beer with predictable flavor profiles and ironic names. <words>98</words>

The mirror shard caught moonlight, reflecting his bloodshot eye. <words>107</words> He'd found it embedded in a tombstone marked "Here Lies Originality, 1842-2023." <words>119</words> How perfectly mundane, he thought, that even death had become a cliché. <words>131</words>

He needed to initiate something—anything—to become a living embodiment of his values instead of just another hipster peddling liquid pretension. <words>151</words> The darkness pressed closer, not supernatural but philosophical, threatening to swallow what remained of his artistic integrity. <words>168</words>

That's when he noticed it: the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase leading down into a mausoleum. <words>186</words> The steps descended into what locals whispered was the original brewery cellar, where the mansion's owner had crafted ales before prohibition killed both his business and, reportedly, him. <words>215</words>

Marcus descended, each step echoing with flippant solemnity. <words>223</words> "Going underground," he muttered, "how refreshingly unoriginal." <words>230</words>

The cellar revealed ancient equipment, copper kettles green with patina. <words>240</words> On the wall hung a sign: "Brew not for gold, but for the soul's bold threshold." <words>257</words> Marcus snorted, then paused. <words>261</words> The pretentious rhyme somehow rang true in this forgotten space where someone had actually believed in their craft. <words>279</words>

The mirror shard trembled in his hand, reflecting not his face but possibilities—beers that told stories, flavors that challenged rather than comforted. <words>302</words> The encroaching darkness wasn't winning; it was clarifying. <words>310</words>

He could hear the protest resuming above, voices rising with renewed purpose. <words>323</words> Marcus set the mirror piece on a barrel, where it caught light from a crack in the ceiling. <words>341</words> He wouldn't return to his trendy taproom. <words>348</words> Instead, he'd resurrect this place, brew honestly in the shadows of graves, create something genuinely unique by embracing the generic foundation of all beer: water, malt, hops, yeast, and uncompromising intention. <words>379</words>

The groggy brewer smiled, finally awake. <words>385</words> Sometimes becoming your values meant abandoning who you thought you were and fermenting into who you could be. <words>403</words> Even if it happened in a graveyard. <words>410</words>
