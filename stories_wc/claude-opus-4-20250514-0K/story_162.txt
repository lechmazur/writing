Marcus shuffled the worn deck with practiced ease, his fingers dancing over cards that had seen better days in the reverse engineering workshop's break room. <words>24</words> The fragment of blueprint tucked in his breast pocket crinkled softly—a reminder of why he'd returned to this forgotten corner of the industrial district. <words>49</words>

"You came back," Elena said from the doorway, her voice cutting through the dusty silence. <words>65</words>

The workshop hadn't changed—workbenches cluttered with dismantled machinery, shelves lined with old videotapes nobody watched anymore, their magnetic memories slowly degrading like island dreams fading at dawn. <words>92</words> Marcus had spent three years here before the accident, before the government contracts dried up, before everything fell apart. <words>111</words>

"I told you I would," he replied, dealing two hands without looking up. <words>125</words> Despite his reputation as a carefree gambler who'd bet on anything, Elena knew something others didn't—Marcus had never broken a promise to her. <words>149</words> It was what made him uniquely trustworthy in her eyes, this contradiction of a man who'd risk everything except his word. <words>171</words>

She sat across from him, picking up her cards. <words>180</words> "The blueprint fragment—do you still have it?" <words>188</words>

He nodded, patting his pocket. <words>193</words> They'd discovered it together five years ago, hidden inside a decommissioned prototype: coordinates to an island research facility, partial schematics for something the government had buried. <words>219</words> That shared secret had bound them together more tightly than any contract or confession could. <words>235</words>

"I've been trying to refocus," Marcus said, studying his hand. <words>246</words> "Find some harmony in all this chaos, you know?" <words>256</words> The workshop's familiar hum of dormant machinery provided a strange comfort, a hammered repose after years of running. <words>275</words>

Elena smiled sadly. <words>278</words> "The island memories still haunt you." <words>285</words>

"Every night," he admitted. <words>289</words> They'd visited once, secretly, finding only ruins and questions. <words>299</words> But something about that place had changed them both—made them see patterns where others saw randomness, made them understand that some puzzles weren't meant to be solved, only lived with. <words>330</words>

"Maybe that's the harmony," Elena suggested, laying down her cards. <words>341</words> "Not forgetting, not solving, just... accepting." <words>348</words>

Marcus looked at her hand—a perfect straight. <words>356</words> He laughed, genuinely, for the first time in months. <words>366</words> "You always did know when to hold and when to fold better than me." <words>381</words>

Outside, rain began pattering against the workshop's metal roof. <words>391</words> They sat together in comfortable silence, two people bound by fragments of secrets and memories of islands that might not exist, finding peace in the imperfect certainty of each other's company. <words>423</words> The blueprint fragment would remain unfinished, but perhaps some mysteries were better left that way. <words>439</words>
