The baroque asteroid spun through borrowed starlight, its gilded surfaces catching distant suns like secondhand dreams. <words>16</words> Maria crouched behind a crystalline outcropping, her paint-splattered camera lens the only evidence of her former life as an artist. <words>36</words> Now she was something else—a lurking assassin who photographed her targets through rainbows of dried acrylic, each kill documented through a kaleidoscope of past creativity. <words>62</words>

The unforgiving road had brought her here, to this ornate rock where nobles played at being gods. <words>79</words> She'd taken the contract not for money but for something more precious: to cradle the dawn in trembling hands, to witness the first sunrise on Earth after the tyrant fell. <words>109</words> Duke Castellan had stolen Earth's rotation, locked it in eternal night, and only his death would release it. <words>127</words>

Through her damaged lens, she watched him emerge from his palace of carved meteorite. <words>141</words> The paint splatters created a pattern like a spider's web after rain, fracturing his image into prismatic segments. <words>159</words> Each fragment showed a different truth—here his cruelty, there his fear, everywhere his superficially profound speeches about necessity and sacrifice. <words>181</words>

Maria had studied his routines via the pattern of a spider's web after rain, finding connections in seemingly random movements. <words>202</words> Every seventh day, when the bus driver completed the final route through the asteroid's tunnels, the Duke walked alone in his gardens. <words>225</words> The driver was Maria's cousin, sworn to silence, counting down stops like rosary beads. <words>240</words>

She lined up her shot through the paint-damaged viewfinder, the weapon hidden within the camera's modified body. <words>257</words> The Duke paused beside a fountain of liquid mercury, admiring his reflection. <words>269</words> His lips moved in another hollow soliloquy about burden and destiny. <words>280</words>

Maria thought of sunrise—real sunrise—warming frozen oceans, painting clouds she'd only seen in archived photographs. <words>294</words> Her finger found the trigger disguised as the shutter button. <words>304</words>

The Duke turned, perhaps sensing something, and for one moment their eyes met through the kaleidoscope lens. <words>321</words> His expression shifted from surprise to understanding to something almost like relief. <words>333</words> Then, inexplicably, he began to laugh—not with cruelty but with genuine mirth, as if finally understanding some cosmic joke. <words>352</words>

Maria hesitated, caught between duty and curiosity. <words>359</words> But the bus was completing its final circuit, her cousin flashing the tunnel lights in sequence. <words>376</words> Time had run out for superficially profound last words. <words>385</words>

She pressed the button. <words>389</words>

Through the paint-splattered lens, she captured both the photograph and the kill, the Duke's laughter frozen in a rainbow of shattered light. <words>411</words> Already she could feel it—somewhere in the void, Earth beginning its slow return to rotation, and dawn preparing to break. <words>432</words>
