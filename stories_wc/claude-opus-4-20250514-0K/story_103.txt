The weatherbeaten knight stood before the lighthouse prison, its brass door knocker gleaming like a mocking sun against the storm-darkened tower. <words>18</words> Twenty years had passed since he'd imprisoned his own daughter here, choosing duty over love when she'd fallen for an enemy prince. <words>39</words>

Inside, he found her cell unchanged: a cracked mirror, a child's wooden horse, dried roses, and a music box—seemingly random items that formed a pattern he'd never understood. <words>68</words> Now, staring into the mirror's surface, time folded impossibly inward. <words>78</words>

Within the reflection, he saw her as she'd been—young, defiant, heartbroken—and himself making that impossible choice again. <words>95</words> "Father," her reflection whispered, and he realized with joyful agony that the mirror held more than memory. <words>112</words> It held her final moments, trapped forever in silvered glass. <words>122</words>

The wooden horse had been her favorite toy; the roses, from her forbidden wedding; the music box, playing their family's lullaby. <words>143</words> Each item marked a moment he'd stolen from her future. <words>153</words> His weathered hands trembled as understanding dawned—she'd arranged them as a message only he would appreciate. <words>170</words>

"I forgive you," her reflection mouthed, and he saw how she'd spent her last days: not in bitter rage, but crafting this moment of grace. <words>195</words> The pattern wasn't random at all, but a daughter's grudgingly sweet farewell to a father who'd loved duty more than her. <words>216</words>

He pressed his palm against the mirror, and impossibly, she pressed back. <words>228</words> Within that reflected world, she was still alive, still waiting. <words>238</words> He could shatter the glass, end this torment, but that would destroy her last gift—this chance to see her one more time. <words>260</words>

Another impossible choice. <words>263</words>

The knight lifted the music box, winding its key with arthritic fingers. <words>275</words> As the lullaby played, her reflection smiled, tears streaming down both their faces in different worlds, different times. <words>293</words> He finally understood why she'd forgiven him: not from weakness, but from strength he'd never possessed. <words>309</words>

"I was wrong," he whispered, his voice breaking. <words>317</words> "You were braver than any knight." <words>323</words>

Her reflection began to fade as the music slowed, but her lips formed words he'd waited twenty years to hear: "I know you loved me, Father. I always knew." <words>352</words>

The music stopped. <words>355</words> The mirror cleared. <words>358</words> But the knight remained, cradling her childhood treasures, finally able to appreciate the terrible beauty of her sacrifice. <words>376</words> He'd come to hush the final cry of regret, but found instead a daughter's love that transcended even death's bitter walls. <words>397</words>

The brass door knocker would sound no more; he would stay, guardian of her memory, until the sea claimed them both. <words>418</words>
