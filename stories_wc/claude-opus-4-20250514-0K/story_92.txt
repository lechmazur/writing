The chandelier's crystal teeth caught the dying light as Margot entered the Ashford mansion's dining room, three purebred Afghans trailing behind her like smoke. <words>19</words> She'd been the dog walker for Manhattan's ultra-rich for seven years, but the Ashfords were different—their silent agreements went beyond mere discretion. <words>41</words>

The dogs whimpered, sensing what she couldn't yet see: the botanical collection arranged along the mahogany table, specimens that shouldn't exist, their leaves shifting despite the still air. <words>69</words> Mrs. Ashford sat at the head, her carefully careless posture betraying nothing of the tension that made the room breathe. <words>90</words>

"You're early," Mrs. Ashford said, though Margot was precisely on time. <words>101</words>

"The dogs needed their walk," Margot replied, understanding this dance. <words>111</words> In this profession, one learned to justify the unjustifiable, to pretend not to notice when reality bent at the edges. <words>131</words>

The mansion's reputation as haunted had served the Ashfords well—it kept questions at bay. <words>145</words> But Margot knew better; what haunted these rooms wasn't ghosts but choices, the kind that required botanical specimens that fed on more than soil and water. <words>172</words>

"Sit," Mrs. Ashford commanded, and Margot obeyed, the dogs settling uneasily at her feet. <words>186</words> The woman pushed a document across the table—a blood drive consent form, though no mobile unit waited outside. <words>204</words>

"We met at the hospital blood drive last spring," Mrs. Ashford said, rewriting history with practiced ease. <words>221</words> "That's when you agreed to help with my special collection." <words>231</words>

Margot's fingers trembled as she lifted the pen. <words>239</words> The plants seemed to lean closer, their impossible colors bleeding into the periphery of her vision like watercolors in rain. <words>259</words> This was why she'd come—to stand where fear dares not tread, to finally understand what the ultra-rich truly paid her to ignore. <words>282</words>

The signature flowed from her hand, sealing more than employment. <words>292</words> The dogs' whimpering ceased abruptly, as if a switch had been thrown. <words>304</words> Outside, color bled from day into night, the sunset accelerating unnaturally through the tall windows. <words>319</words>

"Excellent," Mrs. Ashford breathed, and the botanical collection rustled its approval. <words>330</words> "Now you'll understand why our previous walker... departed." <words>338</words>

The room filled with a loud silence, the kind that pressed against eardrums and made hearts skip. <words>355</words> Margot felt the change immediately—the way the dogs' leashes felt heavier, how their eyes reflected something ancient and hungry. <words>375</words>

She'd crossed the threshold from servant to keeper, from walker to guardian of creatures that wore dog-shapes by day. <words>394</words> The Ashfords didn't need a dog walker; they needed someone willing to feed what must be fed, to maintain the carefully careless facade that kept their true nature hidden. <words>424</words>

As the last light died, Margot understood: some silent agreements were written in blood, and some walks led deeper than any mansion's grounds. <words>448</words> The botanical collection sang softly in the darkness, welcoming its newest gardener home. <words>461</words>
