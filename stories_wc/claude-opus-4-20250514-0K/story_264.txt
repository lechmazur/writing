Dr. Elara Voss adjusted her cracked magnifying glass, the fracture splitting starlight into prismatic ribbons across her workbench. <words>18</words> The unruly alchemist had commandeered the shooting star tracking station during the baseball game's seventh-inning stretch, knowing the facility would be empty. <words>40</words> Her colleagues called her hauntingly cheerful—always humming while mixing volatile compounds, always smiling when experiments exploded. <words>57</words>

Tonight, she would finally touch the sky. <words>64</words>

The ancient overhead projector wheezed to life, its familiar hum filling the observatory with nostalgic warmth. <words>80</words> Elara had rescued it from storage, preferring its analog charm to the station's digital displays. <words>96</words> Through its yellowed lens, she projected her alchemical formulas onto the dome ceiling, transforming equations into constellations. <words>113</words>

"Between innings," she whispered, checking her watch. <words>120</words> "Perfect timing." <words>122</words>

The other researchers had grown cynical, dismissing her theories about capturing stardust in crystalline matrices. <words>138</words> They'd forgotten the playful wonder that first drew them to the cosmos. <words>151</words> But Elara remembered—oh, how she remembered the night she'd first seen a meteor shower and believed anything was possible. <words>171</words>

With infinite caution, she aligned her cracked magnifying glass with the projector's beam. <words>185</words> The fracture, rather than ruining the lens, had revealed something extraordinary: it could separate celestial light into its component memories. <words>206</words> Each split ray carried whispers of distant worlds, and tonight, a particularly bright shooting star was scheduled to pass directly overhead. <words>228</words>

She mixed her prepared solutions, each movement deliberate despite her reputation for chaos. <words>242</words> The compounds glowed faintly, responding to the projector's hum like tuning forks finding their frequency. <words>258</words> This wasn't mere chemistry—it was cosmic alchemy, the marriage of earthbound elements with stellar dreams. <words>274</words>

The baseball crowd's distant cheering signaled the inning's end. <words>283</words> Soon, her colleagues would return, armed with skepticism and spreadsheets. <words>294</words> But Elara had minutes yet, and she intended to impress upon them something magnificent. <words>309</words>

The shooting star appeared precisely on schedule, blazing across the observatory's viewing window. <words>323</words> Elara raised her cracked magnifying glass, catching the meteor's light through the projector's beam. <words>338</words> The combined illumination struck her alchemical mixture, and for one transcendent moment, the solution crystallized into pure starlight. <words>357</words>

The touched sky materialized in her palm—a fragment of infinity made tangible. <words>370</words> It pulsed with hauntingly cheerful energy, the same inexplicable joy that drove her through countless failed experiments. <words>388</words>

When her colleagues returned, they found Elara cradling a crystal that hummed with the same frequency as the old projector. <words>409</words> Their cynicism melted as she pressed the fragment into their hands, letting them feel the universe's playful wonder for themselves. <words>430</words> The unruly alchemist had done more than touch the sky—she'd brought it down to earth, one carefully cracked lens at a time. <words>453</words>
