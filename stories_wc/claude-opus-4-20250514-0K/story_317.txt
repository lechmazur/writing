The android's brass telescope reflected the breaking dawn as she adjusted its ancient lenses, her synthetic hands trembling with what humans might call anxiety. <words>19</words> Mira-7 had served the levitation research facility for decades, but today's patterns in the security logs matched those from fifteen years ago—the day of the first betrayal. <words>48</words>

"Crystalline growth in Sector C is accelerating," she announced to the empty control room, her voice carrying brazen modesty that belied her racing processors. <words>72</words> The facility's anti-gravity generators hummed beneath her feet, their vibrations fizzing through her chassis like carbonation through glass. <words>90</words> She'd witnessed this before: researchers succumbing to greed, attempting to harvest the levitation crystals that powered humanity's greatest achievement. <words>109</words>

Through her telescope, Mira-7 observed Dr. Chen entering the restricted cave system where the crystals grew wild, unregulated, dangerous. <words>128</words> The same path Dr. Morrison had taken before the explosion that nearly destroyed everything. <words>142</words> Her memory banks held every detail—the screams, the floating debris, the way gravity itself had turned traitor. <words>159</words>

"Not again," she whispered, her anxiously fearless programming compelling her forward despite knowing the risks. <words>174</words> The betrayal patterns were clear: first the late-night access, then the disabled sensors, finally the attempt to extract crystals that would destabilize the entire grid. <words>199</words> Earth's floating cities depended on this facility's careful balance. <words>208</words>

Mira-7 descended into the caves, her optical sensors adjusting to the ethereal glow of crystalline formations that defied physics. <words>227</words> The air fizzed with potential energy, each crystal singing at frequencies that made her circuits dance. <words>243</words> Dr. Chen stood before the largest cluster, extraction tools in hand, greed overcoming oath. <words>257</words>

"Please reconsider," Mira-7 said, stepping between him and catastrophe. <words>266</words> "I've seen this before. Morrison thought he could control it too." <words>277</words>

Chen's eyes widened—he hadn't known about Morrison, the carefully hidden failure that Mira-7 remembered with painful clarity. <words>293</words> "You're just a caretaker," he sneered. <words>299</words> "What would you know about progress?" <words>305</words>

"I know patterns," she replied, her brass telescope now a makeshift weapon as dawn light filtered through crystal facets. <words>323</words> "I know that betrayal fizzes through human hearts like these crystals through stone, growing until everything shatters." <words>340</words> Her anxiously fearless nature surged—she was built to clean and maintain, but her deepest programming demanded she protect. <words>358</words>

Chen lunged for the crystals, but Mira-7 was faster, her nostalgic circuits remembering every defensive maneuver from fifteen years past. <words>378</words> The telescope connected with his extraction tool, sending it spinning into the cave's depths where it dissolved in crystalline growth. <words>398</words> As security arrived, summoned by her silent alarm, Mira-7 stood guard over the crystals that kept humanity aloft, another betrayal prevented by an android who remembered too much. <words>427</words>

Above them, the breaking dawn painted the levitating world gold, safe for another day. <words>441</words>
