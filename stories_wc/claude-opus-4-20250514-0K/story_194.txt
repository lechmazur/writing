Magnus, a spirited lumberjack with calloused hands and a heart full of questions, pedaled his rusted bicycle through the cobblestone streets toward The Bone Garden. <words>24</words> The ancient ossuary turned gourmet restaurant loomed ahead, its limestone walls still bearing traces of centuries-old epitaphs beneath layers of trendy paint. <words>46</words> He'd been making these nocturnal bike rides for three weeks now, ever since the coded letter appeared beneath his pillow. <words>66</words>

The letter, written in bark-fiber paper that wouldn't exist for another forty years, contained coordinates and a single phrase: "Learn to mend what breaks." <words>90</words> Each night, his reawakened nightmares drove him from bed—visions of forests burning, of wounds that wouldn't heal, of a war not yet fought. <words>114</words> The dreams always ended the same way: his gracefully awkward hands, so skilled with an axe, fumbling desperately over broken bodies. <words>135</words>

Inside The Bone Garden, diners ate foie gras from plates balanced on ancient femurs while Chef Lucienne, keeper of hidden agendas, waited in the catacombs below. <words>161</words> Magnus descended the spiral stairs, his logger's boots echoing against stone that had witnessed a thousand deaths. <words>178</words> "You came again," Lucienne said, her voice carrying the harsh tenderness of someone who'd seen too much. <words>195</words>

"The nightmares are getting worse," Magnus replied, pulling out the coded letter. <words>207</words> "I need to understand." <words>211</words>

Lucienne's weathered face softened as she examined the familiar handwriting—her own, aged by decades not yet passed. <words>228</words> "The war that's coming will revamp everything we know about survival," she said. <words>241</words> "But first, you must learn what I learned—that healing isn't just about bodies." <words>254</words>

She led him deeper into the ossuary, past walls lined with skulls that seemed to watch their passage. <words>272</words> In a chamber where monks once prayed, she'd created a sanctuary of medicinal herbs growing between ancient bones. <words>290</words> "Your great-grandmother taught me these traditions before the first war," Lucienne explained. <words>302</words> "Now I teach you, so you can teach yourself—when the time comes." <words>314</words>

Magnus touched a sprig of yarrow growing from a ribcage, understanding dawning. <words>326</words> The letter wasn't just about learning; it was about becoming the bridge between what was lost and what could be saved. <words>347</words> His gracefully awkward movements, once a source of shame, would become his strength—the gentle touch needed to heal rather than harm. <words>369</words>

As dawn approached, Magnus cycled home through empty streets, the weight of future knowledge heavy on his shoulders. <words>387</words> The spirited lumberjack who'd entered The Bone Garden was gone, replaced by someone who understood that some trees must fall so forests can grow. <words>412</words> Tonight, when the nightmares came, he would face them differently—not with fear, but with the harsh tenderness of someone learning to heal a world that hadn't yet learned how to break. <words>443</words>
