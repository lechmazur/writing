The wandering orchardist descended through murky waters toward the forgotten underwater city hall, her collection of dried leaves sealed in a waterproof pouch against her chest. <words>24</words> Each leaf bore the memory of a different universe—apple blossoms from worlds where gravity flowed upward, pear leaves from dimensions where time grew like fruit. <words>49</words> She'd spent lifetimes mapping trade routes through the multiverse, but this drowned bureaucracy held the key to reclaiming what she'd lost. <words>71</words>

The city hall's marble columns were wrapped in kelp, its grand entrance guarded by schools of fish that had never known sunlight. <words>94</words> Inside, waterlogged desks floated like corpses, their drawers spilling permits and licenses that would never again stamp approval on anything. <words>115</words> She navigated by touch, her trustworthy unique sense guiding her past the debris of a civilization that had chosen drowning over surrender. <words>138</words>

In the mayor's office, she found it: the kitchen table, impossibly dry in its bubble of preserved air. <words>157</words> Her grandmother's table, where wisdom had been served with morning tea, where she'd first learned that some routes between worlds could only be traced by those who understood both soil and sorrow. <words>190</words> The phantom hand touched her shoulder—her grandmother's ghost, still teaching. <words>201</words>

"Every leaf tells where water flows between worlds," the specter whispered, though no sound carried in this depth. <words>219</words> The orchardist spread her collection across the table's scarred surface, each dried specimen a coordinate in the vast atlas of existence. <words>241</words> Apple leaves from the war-worlds, where her orchards had burned. <words>252</words> Cherry leaves from the peace-dimensions, where fruit rotted unharvested. <words>262</words> Plum leaves from the boundary-realms, where she'd lost her daughter to a merchant's betrayal. <words>277</words>

The phantom hand guided hers, arranging the leaves into a map that pulsed with bittersweet truth. <words>293</words> Trade routes appeared not as lines but as roots, branching through realities where water was currency and seeds were promises. <words>314</words> She saw it now—how to reclaim not just the paths, but the trust broken by those who'd drowned this city rather than honor their debts. <words>340</words>

Each leaf crumbled at her touch, releasing its knowledge into her calloused palms. <words>354</words> The kitchen table wisdom flowed through her: sometimes you must descend to the darkest depths to understand which heights are worth climbing. <words>377</words> The phantom hand squeezed once—approval, farewell—and faded. <words>385</words>

The orchardist rose through the water, her map internalized, her purpose crystallized. <words>398</words> Above, infinite universes awaited, each hungry for fruit that could grow in any soil, sweet with the grit of survival. <words>419</words> She would plant new orchards along the reclaimed routes, trustworthy unique gardens where the drowned could surface and breathe again. <words>440</words>
