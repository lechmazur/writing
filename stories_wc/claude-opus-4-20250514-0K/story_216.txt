The metal washer gleamed between Marcus Chen's fingers as he accepted another midnight call, its robustly delicate edges worn smooth from years of nervous rubbing. <words>23</words> "Professional Scapegoat Services," he answered with obsessive calm, though his voice carried no trace of the man who once decoded sacred symbols for the Seminary of New Athens. <words>52</words>

High above in Cirrus Station, the cloud city's vapor-locked towers hummed with recycled air and forgotten prayers. <words>70</words> Marcus had arrived here three years ago, after the last library card was returned to the desk at the Seminary—his card, bearing a name he'd methodically erased from every database. <words>101</words>

"I need someone to take the blame for the Hierophant breach," the caller whispered. <words>116</words> Marcus recognized the coded reference immediately: another cryptic puzzle wrapped in corporate espionage, another chance to refashion himself through borrowed guilt. <words>138</words>

The washer had been his ordination gift, a simple ring of tungsten carbide meant to symbolize eternal commitment. <words>157</words> Now it served as his only anchor to an abandoned identity, its weight both burden and compass. <words>175</words> Each midnight call brought new sins to shoulder, new personas to craft from the vapor-thin air of anonymity. <words>194</words>

"Terms?" Marcus asked, already calculating the sacred geometry hidden in the caller's breathing patterns. <words>209</words> The Seminary had trained him too well; even in exile, he couldn't stop searching for divine messages in human failings. <words>230</words>

"Seven million credits. <words>233</words> The authorities need someone with your... particular credentials." <words>241</words>

Marcus smiled, a robustly delicate expression that would photograph perfectly for booking records. <words>255</words> He'd built his reputation carefully—believable enough to convict, forgettable enough to release. <words>268</words> The cloud city's perpetual mist made surveillance difficult, identities fluid. <words>278</words> Perfect for a man who'd traded his true calling for this strange ministry of manufactured guilt. <words>295</words>

"Send the briefing to the usual node," he instructed, turning the washer over and over. <words>311</words> Its surface caught the blue glow of Cirrus Station's atmospheric processors, refracting light like a tiny halo. <words>329</words> Each job brought him closer to understanding why the Seminary's final archive had been destroyed, why he'd been marked as the architect of its downfall. <words>355</words>

The caller disconnected without farewell—they always did. <words>362</words> Marcus stood at his window, watching synthetic clouds birth and dissolve in endless cycles. <words>377</words> Tomorrow he would become someone else's mistake, wear another's sins like a secondhand coat. <words>392</words> But tonight, holding his metal washer against the glass, he traced the sacred symbols only he remembered, refashioning abandonment into purpose with obsessive calm. <words>417</words> The cloud city kept its secrets well, but Marcus Chen—whoever he truly was—kept them better. <words>433</words>
