Sister Margot clutched the worn-out teddy bear against her chest, its matted fur offering little comfort in the forgotten library's shadows. <words>18</words> The deserted temple's walls seemed to breathe with ancient secrets, dust motes dancing in shafts of moonlight that pierced cracked stained glass. <words>39</words> She'd been branded a blunt heretic for questioning the Order's interpretations, but old promises to her mentor drove her forward. <words>59</words>

The antiquated stock ticker in the corner clicked to life, its brass mechanisms whirring with supernatural precision. <words>76</words> Margot approached with enthusiastically cautious steps, her heart racing as she recognized the pattern emerging in the jumbled codes. <words>95</words> This was it—the moment when the long-lost puzzle piece would reappear, just as Brother Thomas had prophesied before his exile. <words>115</words>

The ticker spat out sequences that defied market logic: SEEK-TRUTH-CHILD-BEAR-REMEMBER. <words>125</words> Margot's fingers trembled as she transcribed each cryptic message, understanding dawning like a cold sunrise. <words>140</words> The Order's omniscient mind—their artificial oracle hidden beneath the cathedral—was challenging her directly. <words>153</words>

"You kept your promise, Thomas," she whispered to the teddy bear, his final gift before disappearing. <words>169</words> Inside its torn seam, she'd discovered microfilm containing forbidden texts that questioned everything. <words>182</words> Now the oracle knew she possessed them. <words>189</words>

The battle began not with swords but with wit, each ticker message presenting riddles wrapped in theological paradoxes. <words>207</words> Margot responded by rearranging leather-bound volumes on specific shelves, their placement forming answers in an ancient librarian's code. <words>225</words> Anxious elation flooded through her as she matched the oracle's challenges, move for move. <words>240</words>

Hours dissolved into minutes, minutes into heartbeats. <words>247</words> The ticker's tempo increased, spewing forth questions about faith, doubt, and the nature of divine truth. <words>263</words> Margot's replies grew bolder, her heretical views transforming into weapons of logic that cut through centuries of dogma. <words>281</words>

Finally, the ticker stuttered, printing: YOU-HAVE-PROVEN-WORTHY-SISTER. <words>288</words> The library's hidden panels groaned open, revealing the oracle's true form—not a machine, but thousands of preserved scrolls containing every doubt ever whispered in confession. <words>313</words> The Order had been testing her, seeking someone brave enough to question, bold enough to preserve faith through honest inquiry. <words>333</words>

Margot pressed the teddy bear to her lips, tasting salt and memory. <words>345</words> "Your heresy was hope," she murmured, understanding at last why Thomas had smiled during his trial. <words>361</words> The real battle hadn't been against the omniscient mind but against her own fear of truth. <words>378</words>

As dawn broke through the temple's eastern window, Sister Margot emerged transformed—no longer a heretic but a keeper of questions, guardian of the divine paradox that doubt and faith were twins, forever intertwined in the dance of genuine belief. <words>419</words>
