The cold-natured knight stood at the intersection's center, where four empty streets converged beneath flickering sodium lights. <words>16</words> His armor clinked softly as he knelt, retrieving a child's lost mitten from the cracked asphalt. <words>31</words> The wool was still warm. <words>36</words>

Behind him, the abandoned department store concealed the secret agent center's entrance, its broken windows reflecting nothing but darkness. <words>55</words> He'd come here every night for three months, drawn by whispers of folk remedies hidden within the facility's medical archives. <words>75</words> His grandmother's bone cancer had defeated modern medicine. <words>83</words>

The mitten trembled in his gauntleted hand. <words>90</words> Strange—no child should be here at this hour. <words>98</words> He tucked it into his belt pouch and approached the store's service entrance, where agents had spray-painted incomplete family altars across the steel door. <words>123</words> Missing fathers, absent mothers, shadowy siblings—each altar told a story of sacrifice. <words>135</words>

His own altar waited there too, half-finished. <words>142</words> He'd started painting it weeks ago: his grandmother's herbs hanging from wooden beams, her hands grinding roots. <words>159</words> But he couldn't complete her face. <words>165</words> Every attempt felt like betrayal. <words>170</words>

The door's keypad glowed. <words>174</words> He entered the code—lawfully obtained through channels that bent rather than broke regulations. <words>188</words> Inside, fluorescent lights hummed over rows of medical files. <words>197</words> Other knights had tried stealing these remedies through force. <words>206</words> He chose support instead, becoming the agency's night guardian in exchange for access. <words>219</words>

In the third drawer, he found it: a formula combining wolfsbane with morning dew, annotated in his grandmother's handwriting. <words>238</words> How had it gotten here? <words>243</words> His fingers traced her notes about pain management, about dignity in dying. <words>255</words>

The mitten fell from his pouch. <words>261</words> As he bent to retrieve it, he noticed yarn trailing toward the wall. <words>274</words> Following it, he discovered a hidden panel revealing canvases—dozens of unfinished portraits. <words>286</words> Agents' families, frozen mid-brushstroke. <words>290</words>

Understanding flooded through him. <words>294</words> The incomplete altars weren't memorial walls—they were invitations. <words>302</words> Permission to finish what others started. <words>308</words> Support through shared grief. <words>312</words>

He carried the formula and canvases to the door. <words>321</words> There, he finally completed his grandmother's face on the altar, using pigments mixed with the remedy's herbs. <words>338</words> Her eyes sparkled with the same rebellious warmth that had taught him rules existed to protect, not imprison. <words>356</words>

The child's mitten he hung from her painted hand—a reminder that healing passes between generations, sometimes through the most unexpected vessels. <words>377</words> Other knights would come tomorrow night, drawn by their own desperate needs. <words>389</words> They would find his altar complete, the formula copied beneath it, and understand: rebellion could be lawful when it served love. <words>411</words>

The intersection remained silent as he walked away, but the abandoned store glowed faintly now, transformed from a place of secrets into a sanctuary of shared healing. <words>439</words> His cold nature had finally found its purpose—not in following orders, but in supporting others through the artistic act of completing what loss had left unfinished. <words>465</words>
