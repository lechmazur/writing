Kaine's mittened fingers trembled as they gripped the sword's hilt, steam from nearby vents fogging his vision. <words>15</words> The frigid tundra orchard stretched endlessly, its frost-bitten apple trees grotesque monuments to a world gone wrong. <words>32</words> He'd spent years filing away evidence of the old ways, documenting each tradition before the convergence had twisted everything. <words>52</words> Now, as he placed the final testimony into his leather satchel, the moment had arrived. <words>67</words>

The blank postcard weighed heavy in his breast pocket—a portal between realms that only activated when filled with genuine intent. <words>87</words> His naturally awkward stance made him an unlikely champion, shoulders hunched as if perpetually apologizing for existing. <words>104</words> Yet the elders had chosen him precisely for this quality; humility could bridge worlds where arrogance failed. <words>121</words>

"Like hermit crabs," his master had explained, watching Kaine struggle with basic footwork years ago. <words>136</words> "They emerge from old shells not through force, but through patient wiggling, finding the precise moment of release." <words>154</words> The lesson had seemed abstract then, but now, standing where two realities overlapped, Kaine understood. <words>169</words>

Geothermal vents hissed accusations at him, their heat creating pockets of life in the frozen wasteland. <words>185</words> Each vent marked a wound where the old world bled through, and the apple trees fed on this mixture of ice and fire, bearing fruit that existed in neither realm fully. <words>216</words> His breath came in anxious puffs as he drew the postcard, knowing that whatever he wrote would determine whether the traditional systems could be restored. <words>241</words>

The ephemeral rancor that had driven him here—that bitter resentment at watching his world dissolve—suddenly seemed petty. <words>258</words> His awkward shuffle through the snow brought him to the largest vent, where reality wore thinnest. <words>274</words> With clumsy strokes, he began writing on the postcard, not grand declarations but simple truths about bread-making, harvest songs, the proper way to greet dawn. <words>299</words>

As ink touched paper, the worlds shuddered. <words>306</words> Kaine's swordsmanship had always been hesitant, each strike preceded by doubt, but perhaps that made him perfect for this delicate surgery between dimensions. <words>330</words> He slid the completed postcard into the vent's steam, watching it dissolve and reform, carrying his message across the divide. <words>351</words>

The orchard began to shift, apple blossoms emerging from frozen branches as if shaking off a long sleep. <words>369</words> Like a hermit crab finally freeing itself, Kaine felt his awkwardness transform into purpose—not erased, but recontextualized as the careful movements of someone who understood the weight of change. <words>399</words> The traditional systems wouldn't return unchanged, but they would emerge renewed, bridging what was with what could be, one hesitant step at a time. <words>424</words> His sword, unblooded but not unused, had carved a path between worlds through patience rather than violence. <words>441</words> The evidence was filed, the testimony given, and now came the slow work of rebuilding. <words>456</words>
