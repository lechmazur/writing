Marcus pressed the preserved butterfly against the scanner, his fingers trembling despite years of smuggling contraband through the drought prediction center. <words>18</words> The wings, frozen in iridescent death, contained encoded musical memories from before the water wars—each scale a note, each pattern a melody that could unlock empathic responses in listeners. <words>48</words>

"State your business," droned the security guard, her enthusiasm perfectly calibrated to mask complete indifference. <words>64</words>

"Meteorological consultant," Marcus replied, matching her tone while his mind raced through contingencies. <words>77</words> He'd spent months cultivating this peculiar skill—appearing passionately disinterested—to blend seamlessly into the center's culture of detached urgency. <words>96</words>

Inside, the facility hummed with computers predicting rainfall patterns that would never come. <words>109</words> Marcus navigated toward Lab Seven, where Dr. Elena Vasquez lay under anesthesia for her weekly neural calibration. <words>126</words> The timing was meticulous, yet impulsive—he'd learned her schedule only yesterday but couldn't resist acting immediately. <words>143</words>

Through the observation window, he watched her lips move in delirious confession. <words>155</words> "The paintings... they sing... grandmother's lullabies in the yellow ochre..." she murmured. <words>167</words>

Marcus slipped inside, placing the butterfly on her monitoring equipment. <words>177</words> The encoded memories would download during her confession, when her defenses were lowest and her empathic channels most receptive. <words>196</words> He needed her to feel what others felt—truly feel it—to predict not just weather patterns but human behavioral storms. <words>216</words>

"Blue notes in the brushstrokes," Elena continued, her words painting unconscious revelations. <words>228</words> "Father never understood... the drought began in our hearts first..." <words>238</words>

The butterfly's wings began to dissolve, releasing decades of compressed emotional frequencies. <words>250</words> Marcus watched the monitors spike as musical memories flooded Elena's synapses—jazz funerals from New Orleans, Buddhist chants from Tibet, lullabies from cultures lost to desertification. <words>274</words>

Her eyes snapped open, pupils dilated with newfound understanding. <words>283</words> "You," she whispered, recognizing him despite the anesthesia. <words>291</words> "The rain predictor who feels nothing." <words>297</words>

"I feel everything," Marcus corrected with practiced monotony. <words>305</words> "That's why I smuggle these memories—to teach others the weight of collective emotion." <words>319</words> He gestured to the butterfly's remains. <words>325</words> "Your predictions will improve now. You'll sense the human patterns behind climate change." <words>338</words>

Elena's confession resumed, but now included futures she could suddenly perceive. <words>349</words> "The drought ends when we remember how to cry together," she prophesied. <words>361</words> "When our tears become rain..." <words>366</words>

Security burst in, drawn by the anomalous neural readings. <words>375</words> Marcus surrendered with enthusiastic resignation, his mission complete. <words>383</words> He'd successfully infected the center's most brilliant predictor with empathy, ensuring humanity might finally forecast its own salvation. <words>402</words> The butterfly had carried more than music—it had smuggled hope into a world that had forgotten how to harmonize with itself. <words>423</words>
