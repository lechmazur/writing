Valentina Morse adjusted her amber earrings, watching their reflection multiply in the sky reflection pool beneath her stilettos. <words>16</words> After the invention of time travel, heartbreak had become infinitely more complex—lovers could literally revisit their mistakes, creating temporal knots of desire that only she could untangle. <words>44</words>

She was restlessly curious about her next client, a woman who'd been zip-lining through parallel timelines, chasing versions of herself who'd made different romantic choices. <words>69</words> The gravity of desires, Valentina had learned, bent spacetime itself. <words>79</words>

"You're late," said the client, materializing beside the pool's chrome rim. <words>90</words>

"I was tracking cloud trails," Valentina replied smoothly, her voice honeyed poison. <words>102</words> "Your emotional turbulence leaves quite the atmospheric signature across timelines." <words>112</words>

The woman's eyes widened. <words>116</words> "You can see that?" <words>120</words>

"Darling, I see everything hearts try to hide." <words>128</words> Valentina's amber earrings caught the light from three different suns—past, present, and future—reflected in the pool's surface. <words>146</words> "You've been trying to proclaim yourself free in a cage of illusions, haven't you?" <words>161</words>

The client nodded, tears threatening. <words>166</words> "Every timeline, every choice—I thought I could find the perfect love story if I just kept searching." <words>184</words>

"But instead, you discovered something worse than heartbreak," Valentina said, her cautious impulsiveness compelling her to reach for the woman's trembling hand. <words>207</words> "You found infinite heartbreaks." <words>211</words>

The sky reflection pool rippled, showing glimpses of the client's romantic catastrophes across dimensions—each rejection, each goodbye, each what-if crystallized in liquid chrome. <words>234</words>

"The gravity of desires," Valentina continued, "isn't about finding the perfect timeline. <words>246</words> It's about understanding that every version of you chose based on who she was in that moment." <words>264</words> She touched her amber earrings, a gift from her own lost love in Timeline Prime. <words>280</words> "We zip through possibilities, but we can't escape ourselves." <words>289</words>

"Then what's the point?" <words>293</words> The client's voice cracked. <words>297</words>

Valentina smiled, dangerous and knowing. <words>302</words> "The point is that heartbreak counseling in the age of time travel isn't about healing." <words>318</words> She gestured at the infinite reflections surrounding them. <words>326</words> "It's about accepting that some cages we build ourselves, and some freedoms are found in staying still." <words>344</words>

The client studied her reflection—all her reflections—in the pool. <words>353</words> "You sound like you're speaking from experience." <words>361</words>

"Every femme fatale has her origin story," Valentina whispered. <words>370</words> "Mine just happens to span centuries that haven't happened yet." <words>381</words>

Above them, cloud trails formed new patterns, marking another heart learning to navigate the terrible arithmetic of love multiplied by infinity. <words>402</words> Valentina's amber earrings glowed, conducting the session's end with practiced precision. <words>413</words> In this business, salvation always looked like surrender. <words>421</words>
