The reaver Thane discovered the crumpled drawing wedged beneath a twisted bench in Kaleidoscope Park, where reality fractured into prismatic shards. <words>19</words> The child's crayon work depicted a figure with too many teeth kissing the night sky, stars dripping from its maw like honey. <words>40</words> In the margins, someone had scrawled poems in what appeared to be dried blood: "Mother's mouth/Father's hunger/Daughter's turn." <words>57</words>

Thane recognized his own childhood hand immediately. <words>64</words> Before the first lie is told—before children learn to hide their true natures—they draw exactly what they see. <words>83</words> His parents had been reavers too, passing down their peculiar appetites through generations like heirloom recipes for disaster. <words>101</words>

The park's kaleidoscope effect made everything charmingly grotesque: butterfly wings sprouted human eyes, flowers whispered obscenities, and the playground equipment breathed with mechanical lungs. <words>125</words> Thane smoothed the paper against his leather coat, remembering. <words>134</words>

More poems nagged at him from the margins: "Kiss the void/Swallow light/Birth the dark/Repeat, repeat, repeat." <words>151</words> His mother had written those, her mocking affection evident in every stroke. <words>163</words> She'd loved him the way carnivorous plants love meat—with purpose and hunger. <words>176</words>

The drawing showed truth: reavers didn't just consume flesh. <words>185</words> They craved transcendence, to taste the stars in a single kiss, to devour divinity itself. <words>200</words> Each generation refined the hunger, distilled it, made it more exquisite and unbearable. <words>213</words>

Thane traced the child-figure's grotesque smile with one scarred finger. <words>223</words> His daughter would be seven now—the age when reaver children began showing signs. <words>237</words> Would she draw similar pictures? <words>242</words> Would she scrawl poems about consumption in the margins of her schoolwork? <words>254</words>

The kaleidoscope shifted, showing him reflected infinities of himself: the child who drew this picture, the man holding it, the father he'd become. <words>278</words> All hungry. <words>280</words> All reaching skyward with open mouths. <words>286</words>

He'd sworn to break the pattern, to starve the inheritance out of his bloodline. <words>300</words> But here in the park where his parents had first taught him to hunt, surrounded by the charmingly grotesque architecture of his childhood, he felt the old nagging need. <words>329</words>

The margins held one final poem, written in his father's hand: "Love is teeth/Heritage is appetite/Denial is the cruelest hunger." <words>350</words>

Thane folded the drawing carefully, a closed-off reaver cradling evidence of what he'd been before the world taught him shame. <words>371</words> Tomorrow, his daughter would visit. <words>376</words> He would watch her draw, see what emerged from her untainted perception. <words>388</words> And perhaps, with mocking affection inherited from his mother, he would teach her the family poems. <words>404</words>

Some patterns, after all, were written in the stars themselves. <words>414</words>
