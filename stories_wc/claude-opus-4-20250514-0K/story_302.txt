The tuneless bard Erasmus Crow adjusted his brass goggles as he entered the airship's opulent dining room, where crystal chandeliers swayed gently with the vessel's movement through storm clouds. <words>25</words> His reputation preceded him via twisted word-of-mouth legends—the poet who sang discord into harmony, who turned cacophony into peace. <words>44</words> Tonight's poetry reading would be his masterpiece, his chance to kiss the horizon of madness and return transformed. <words>62</words>

The mahogany tables were packed with the empire's literary elite, their mechanical augmentations clicking softly as they sipped absinthe from delicate glasses. <words>84</words> Erasmus clutched his stained manuscript, its pages yellowed and splattered with what might have been ink, blood, or something far stranger. <words>106</words> Each blotch represented a moment where chaos had nearly consumed him, where his tuneless voice had somehow bent reality's ear. <words>127</words>

"Ah, the Discord Whisperer arrives," Lady Pemberton sneered, her clockwork eye whirring as it focused on him. <words>144</words> "Come to assault our ears with your caterwauling?" <words>152</words>

Erasmus smiled with brazen humility, bowing low enough to seem respectful yet shallow enough to mock. <words>168</words> "My lady, I merely offer what the universe demands—imperfection as salvation." <words>179</words> His fiercely nonchalant demeanor masked the trembling in his hands as he approached the podium. <words>194</words>

The first poet had already begun, her melodious voice weaving tales of clockwork hearts and steam-powered dreams. <words>211</words> Perfect pitch, perfect meter, perfectly boring. <words>217</words> Erasmus waited, feeling the chaos building in his chest like pressure in a boiler. <words>231</words>

When his turn came, he opened the stained manuscript and began to sing—if singing could describe the sound of gears grinding against silk, of steam hissing through honey. <words>260</words> The audience recoiled, but then something extraordinary happened. <words>268</words> The chandeliers' tinkling became percussion, the engine's rumble became bass, and his tuneless wailing became the conductor of an impossible symphony. <words>289</words>

A duchess began to weep, remembering her first love. <words>298</words> A general laughed, recalling a battle where mercy had conquered strategy. <words>309</words> The stained manuscript's marks began to glow, each splash of chaos now a star in the constellation of his performance. <words>329</words>

"This is madness," someone whispered. <words>334</words>

"No," Erasmus replied between verses, his voice suddenly clear as crystal, "this is its horizon." <words>349</words> He pulled out his tinderbox, striking a flame that danced in colors no one could name. <words>365</words> The fire consumed the manuscript, but the words continued, now written in smoke and starlight across the dining room's vaulted ceiling. <words>387</words>

When silence finally fell, the room had changed. <words>395</words> The perfect order of their steampunk world had cracked, letting in something wild and necessary. <words>410</words> Erasmus bowed again, this time with genuine humility, having tamed chaos not by conquering it, but by teaching it to dance. <words>432</words>

The twisted legends would speak of this night, when a tuneless bard kissed madness and brought back wisdom. <words>450</words>
