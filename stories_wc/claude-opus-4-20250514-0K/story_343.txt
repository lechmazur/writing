Captain Mirth adjusted his brass-buttoned motley as the submarine's pipes hissed their melancholy tune. <words>14</words> Once the fleet's premier entertainer, he now commanded this vessel with the same painted smile that had made him iconically unintentional—a jester who'd stumbled into captaincy through a bureaucratic error no one dared correct. <words>47</words>

In his gloved hand, he clutched a crumpled drawing of the Sacred Geometries, the ancient practice of divining through tea leaves that his grandmother had taught him before the Mechanists banned such "inefficiencies." <words>78</words> The submarine's brass walls sweated condensation as they descended deeper, searching for the Neutral Zone where believers from both warring nations might find common ground. <words>103</words>

"Captain," wheezed First Mate Cogsworth through the speaking tube, "the Divination Chamber's paint is still wet, but we've arrived at the coordinates." <words>125</words>

Mirth's bells jingled sadly as he made his way through corridors lined with exposed gears and steam gauges. <words>143</words> The fresh paint fumes made his eyes water—or perhaps that was something else entirely. <words>158</words> He'd convinced both the Brass Republic and the Steel Confederation to send representatives here, promising that the old ways could unite them where politics had failed. <words>185</words>

In the chamber, two figures sat rigidly across a riveted table: Ambassador Piston and Delegate Sprocket, their mechanical augmentations clicking with mutual suspicion. <words>208</words> Between them sat an ornate samovar, its steam curling in patterns that made Mirth's heart quicken. <words>225</words>

"Honored guests," he began, his voice cracking like his white greasepaint, "I command you to observe." <words>241</words> He poured the tea with practiced ceremony, the amber liquid swirling into their cups. <words>256</words> As they waited for the leaves to settle—the paint on the walls tacky and glistening like tears—he unfolded the crumpled drawing. <words>278</words>

"My grandmother mapped these patterns across three wars," he explained, tracing the geometric forms. <words>293</words> "Circle within square, spiral embracing line—each shape a story of division becoming unity." <words>307</words>

The ambassadors leaned forward despite themselves as Mirth analyzed their cups, finding in one the sharp angles of fear, in the other the curves of longing. <words>334</words> "You both see hexagons," he whispered, his jester's mask slipping to reveal the mystic beneath. <words>350</words> "Six sides—the number of compromise, of mutual sacrifice." <words>359</words>

As the paint dried around them, sealing them in this moment, something shifted. <words>373</words> Piston's augmented eye focused on Sprocket's tea leaves, recognizing her own pattern reflected there. <words>388</words> They began to speak—not of territories or resources, but of the children they'd lost to this war, of the songs they remembered from before the Great Division. <words>416</words>

Mirth's crooked hope had found its mark. <words>423</words> The sacred practice lived on, not in temples or halls, but in the brass belly of a submarine, guided by a sad clown who'd accidentally become exactly what the world needed. <words>455</words> The geometry of peace, after all, required unconventional architects. <words>464</words>
