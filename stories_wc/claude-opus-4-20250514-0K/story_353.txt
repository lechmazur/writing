Elara kneaded dough with cynically gentle hands, pressing dried lavender between the folds—the same pressed flowers her grandmother had taught her concealed the seeds of contagion that could topple empires. <words>26</words> The small-town baker had learned long ago that revolution begins in the humblest places, especially when shadows learn to speak of coming darkness. <words>48</words>

Tonight, the moon would complete its seventh pattern since she'd begun tracking its phases, marking when the tyrant's protective enchantments weakened. <words>69</words> She dusted flour from her apron and descended through the hidden trapdoor beneath her ovens, where the emergency time machine garage hummed with desperate energy. <words>94</words>

The garage existed outside normal time, a pocket dimension where rebel mechanics retrofitted stolen chronocycles for missions that could rewrite history. <words>115</words> Elara's bread, infused with those special pressed flowers, would exceed mere sustenance—it would carry memories forward and backward through time, planting seeds of rebellion in minds across centuries. <words>143</words>

"The shadows spoke again today," whispered Marcus, the lead mechanic, his oil-stained fingers adjusting temporal gauges. <words>159</words> "They say the tyrant plans to erase the old calendar entirely, making himself eternal." <words>173</words>

Elara nodded, understanding that her cynically gentle nature—kind enough to feed the hungry, bitter enough to poison kings—made her perfect for this task. <words>196</words> She'd watched the tyrant's soldiers burn her bakery once before, in a timeline she'd already begun to erase. <words>214</words>

The pressed flowers in her pocket held more than beauty; they contained spores from the Time Garden, where past and future bloomed simultaneously. <words>237</words> Each petal carried genetic memories of freedom, each stem a pathway to consciousness that no tyranny could suppress. <words>255</words>

"Moon's at apex," someone called. <words>260</words>

Elara climbed into the chronocycle's basket, balancing trays of her special bread. <words>272</words> The seeds of contagion weren't disease but awakening—a gentle poison that made people remember who they were before the tyrant rewrote their histories. <words>295</words>

The machine sparked to life, reality bending around her like heat shimmer from her ovens. <words>310</words> She would travel to the tyrant's coronation feast, forty years past, where her bread would be served to the court. <words>330</words>

As the garage dissolved into temporal flux, Elara smiled with that particular mix of kindness and calculation that marked true revolutionaries. <words>351</words> The shadows had taught her their language: patience, persistence, and the power of small acts to exceed their humble origins. <words>371</words>

In three hours or three decades—time meant nothing here—the pressed flowers' legacy would bloom in ten thousand minds, and the tyrant would fall not to armies but to remembered truth. <words>401</words> The small-town baker vanished into history, carrying tomorrow's revolution in yesterday's bread. <words>413</words>
