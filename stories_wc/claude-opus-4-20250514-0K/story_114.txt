The dying god's final exhale rippled through dimensions, and Kira yawned. <words>12</words> She sat cross-legged in the shared dream recording studio, grinding coffee beans with deliberate slowness in her grandmother's rustic grinder. <words>32</words> The ancient device creaked rhythmically, matching the pulse of fading divine energy that still clung to the walls. <words>50</words>

"Another apocalypse," she muttered, summoning a translucent spirit fish that swam lazily through the air. <words>65</words> The fish whispered river wisdom—old currents speaking of coral kingdoms bleached white by neglect. <words>79</words> Kira's enthusiasm for her laziness was an art form; she'd perfected the ability to care deeply while appearing utterly unmoved. <words>99</words>

Around her, the studio's dream-capture equipment flickered between recordings of collective unconsciousness. <words>111</words> Empty frames lined the walls, each waiting to match with its destined memory. <words>124</words> She'd hung them there herself, back when the god still breathed and coral still danced beneath warm seas. <words>142</words>

The coffee grinder's handle turned once more. <words>149</words> Another spirit emerged—a sea turtle this time, ancient and patient. <words>159</words> "The reefs remember," it said in a voice like shifting sand. <words>170</words> "But memory alone cannot rebuild." <words>175</words>

Kira sighed, her apathy a carefully constructed shield against the weight of responsibility. <words>188</words> She was the last summoner, enthusiastically lazy by choice rather than nature. <words>200</words> Working hard at hardly working had become her philosophy after watching too many eager heroes burn themselves out trying to save worlds that didn't want saving. <words>226</words>

The empty frames began to glow. <words>232</words> One by one, they started to unfold like origami dreams, revealing glimpses of possible futures. <words>247</words> In each frame, coral polyps reached toward imagined light, guided by the river wisdom her spirits carried from freshwater sources to saltwater homes. <words>271</words>

She stood slowly, stretching like a cat. <words>278</words> The god's death had created an opening—not for heroics, but for patient reconstruction. <words>291</words> Her summoned spirits swirled around the coffee grinder, each carrying fragments of aquatic memory. <words>305</words>

"Fine," she said to the empty studio, her voice sharp as sea glass worn smooth. <words>321</words> "I'll rebuild your precious reefs." <words>326</words> She paused, adding with gentle precision, "But I'm doing it my way—one lazy afternoon at a time." <words>344</words>

The frames aligned, showing her the path: not through grand gestures, but through small summonings, patient grindings, and the slow unfold of river wisdom into ocean truth. <words>372</words> She'd save the world by barely lifting a finger, channeling ancient currents through modern indifference. <words>387</words>

The coffee grinder turned one final time, releasing an aroma that smelled suspiciously like hope. <words>402</words> Kira smiled, already planning her first enthusiastically lazy nap. <words>411</words> The coral would wait; they'd waited this long already. <words>421</words> Tomorrow, she'd begin the slowest salvation ever attempted. <words>430</words> Today, she'd finish her coffee. <words>435</words>
