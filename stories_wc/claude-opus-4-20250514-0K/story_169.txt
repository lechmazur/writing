Marcus Aurelius Blackwood, premier soul-broker real estate agent of the ethereal markets, stood upon his floating tea platform, surveying the translucent properties that drifted past like memories in a dream. <words>25</words> He specialized in selling abandoned consciousness estates to newly departed spirits, but today's appointment was different. <words>41</words>

A dusty wine bottle materialized on his mahogany desk, its label reversed and barely legible through centuries of neglect. <words>60</words> Marcus knew immediately this was no ordinary vintage—it contained the essence of a forgotten song, one that could unlock the most stubborn buyer's heart. <words>85</words>

"The art of persuasion," he murmured with grandiose modesty, "begins not with words, but with understanding what the soul truly seeks." <words>106</words> He lifted the bottle, noting how the dust remained weirdly static, refusing to fall despite his movements. <words>123</words>

Throughout recycling—that peculiar period when souls shed their earthly attachments before rebirth—Marcus had developed an unusual talent. <words>141</words> By reading reversed labels on dusty glass bottles, he could decipher the musical memories trapped within. <words>157</words> Each bottle held a song that someone had forgotten to sing, a melody that had died with its creator. <words>177</words>

His fingers began to choreograph an ancient ritual, tracing the backwards letters: "AIDUALC FO GONS EHT." <words>193</words> As he decoded each word, notes began to emanate from the bottle, filling his floating tea platform with haunting harmonies. <words>214</words>

The platform swayed gently above the void, steam from forgotten teacups mixing with the ethereal music. <words>230</words> Marcus had spent centuries learning forgotten songs, not for entertainment, but because each melody was a key to understanding the deepest desires of wandering souls. <words>256</words>

"The Song of Claudia," he whispered, recognizing the piece. <words>265</words> It was said to make even the most hesitant spirit long for a new home, a fresh beginning in the celestial neighborhoods. <words>287</words>

His next client arrived—a recently departed opera singer whose soul glowed with unsung arias. <words>301</words> Marcus poured spectral tea and let Claudia's song fill the space between them. <words>314</words> The singer's essence trembled, recognizing something profound in the melody. <words>323</words>

"This penthouse in the Constellation District," Marcus suggested, gesturing to a shimmering property card, "has perfect acoustics for eternal rehearsals." <words>343</words> The dusty bottle continued its performance, each note carefully choreographed by Marcus's subtle movements. <words>357</words>

The singer's soul brightened, already imagining endless concerts among the stars. <words>367</words> "I'll take it," she sang, her decision harmonizing with Claudia's forgotten song. <words>379</words>

Marcus smiled, sealing another deal through the profound art of persuasion. <words>389</words> He placed the dusty wine bottle back on his shelf, where it would wait, weirdly static, until the next soul needed to remember what they'd forgotten to become. <words>418</words>
