Marcus Vega, once a prosperous merchant of Earth's final forests, now drifted through the abandoned corridors of Station Omega-7, his fortune lost when his cargo ship imploded near Neptune. <words>24</words> The observation deck stretched before him, its vast windows revealing the graveyard of Earth below—a brown sphere where the last tree had fallen three years ago. <words>50</words>

He clutched the rustic butter churn, an honestly strange relic from his grandmother's farm, its wooden handle worn smooth by generations of hands that had known soil and seasons. <words>79</words> The churn contained something far more precious than butter now: data crystals holding the truth about the Corporate Synthesis, the grand illusion that Earth's ecosystems could be digitally preserved while the planet died. <words>112</words>

His fingers traced the flaking edges of a travel poster—"Visit Verdant Earth!"—its lies peeling away like dead skin. <words>130</words> Behind the poster, Marcus discovered what he'd suspected: a maintenance shaft leading to the station's restricted communication array. <words>148</words> He would ascend through this forgotten passage, carrying his burden of truth. <words>160</words>

The ghost station hummed with automated systems, maintaining life support for no one but him and the occasional scavenger. <words>179</words> Marcus moved with aloof passion, his emotions carefully contained like pressurized oxygen—necessary for survival but explosive if released too quickly. <words>200</words>

As he climbed, the butter churn knocked against his ribs, each impact a reminder of what they'd lost. <words>218</words> His grandmother had warned him about the rebellious sparks in their bloodline, the tendency to question what others accepted. <words>237</words> "Some churns make butter," she'd said, "others churn up trouble." <words>247</words>

The observation deck's primary transmitter loomed above him, a tower of possibility. <words>259</words> From here, he could broadcast the evidence to every remaining human settlement, every space station, every mining colony. <words>277</words> The Corporate Synthesis had sold them digital trees while real forests burned, promised virtual gardens while soil turned to dust. <words>297</words>

Marcus connected the data crystals, his merchant's hands—once soft from counting credits—now calloused from survival. <words>313</words> The transmission would shatter their carefully constructed reality: that humanity could thrive without roots, without the honestly strange magic of chlorophyll and bark. <words>337</words>

He initiated the broadcast, watching Earth's corpse through the observation window. <words>348</words> The rebellious sparks his grandmother spoke of weren't just metaphor—they were the human spirit refusing to accept comfortable lies. <words>367</words> The butter churn sat beside him, empty of its secrets now, a wooden testament to a world that once was. <words>387</words>

As his message spread across the void, Marcus felt neither triumph nor despair, only the aloof passion of someone who had lost everything except purpose. <words>412</words> He was a shipwrecked merchant who had found his final trade: truth for illusion, one last transaction in the ledger of human honesty. <words>435</words>
