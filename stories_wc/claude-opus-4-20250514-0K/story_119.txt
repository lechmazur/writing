Maya's consciousness snapped back into her body as the revelation struck—the antique brass key clutched in her ethereal hand wasn't just a relic, it was actively draining her life force. <words>30</words> She gasped atop the rusted roller coaster track, her physical form trembling from the abrupt return. <words>46</words> The abandoned carnival stretched below her, sun shadows creeping across broken rides like dark fingers marking her remaining time. <words>65</words>

Her gift of astral projection had always been her secret, but now it threatened to become her curse. <words>83</words> The key—discovered during her latest ethereal journey through the carnival's hidden spaces—pulsed with malevolent energy that followed her back to the physical realm. <words>107</words> She understood now: it fed on spiritual wanderers, and she'd walked directly into its trap. <words>123</words>

Unyielding compassion had driven her here initially, searching for the missing teenager whose family had begged for help when police gave up. <words>145</words> Maya sometimes always felt others' pain as her own—a paradox that defined her existence, making her both vulnerable and invincible. <words>166</words> The boy's terror had called to her through the astral plane, leading her to this cursed place. <words>183</words>

She had seconds to act. <words>188</words> The key's corruption spread through her energy field, and she needed to flee before it anchored permanently to her soul. <words>208</words> But abandoning her search meant abandoning the boy. <words>216</words> Her hands shook as she stood on the narrow track, calculating escape routes by tracking sun shadows—an old survival technique her grandmother had taught her. <words>241</words>

The shadows pointed west, toward the funhouse where she'd sensed the boy's presence. <words>254</words> Maya's practiced spontaneity kicked in, that cultivated ability to act without hesitation when intuition demanded. <words>269</words> She couldn't leave him. <words>273</words> Instead, she would use the key's hunger against itself. <words>283</words>

Projecting once more, she split her consciousness, leaving a decoy tethered to her body while her true self raced toward the funhouse. <words>306</words> The key, confused by the dual presence, hesitated in its consumption. <words>318</words> Maya found the boy trapped in a mirror maze, his own astral form caught between reflections. <words>335</words>

"Trust me," she whispered through dimensions, wrapping her ethereal arms around him. <words>347</words> She pulled him free just as the key realized her deception and surged with fury. <words>363</words> Together they fled through the astral plane, following shadow paths back to safety while the key consumed her abandoned decoy. <words>383</words>

They emerged in the parking lot, the boy gasping as he returned to his body. <words>398</words> Maya smiled weakly, knowing she'd preserved not just his life, but his ability to survive whatever darkness might find him again. <words>420</words> The key remained trapped on the roller coaster, feeding on echoes of her presence—a sacrifice born from compassion that could never yield. <words>443</words> As sirens approached, Maya disappeared into the shadows, her secret intact, her purpose fulfilled. <words>458</words>
