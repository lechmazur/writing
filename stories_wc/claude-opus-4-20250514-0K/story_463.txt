The lighthouse keeper's bedroom reeked of salt and broken vows, where Sentinel Marcus Thorne stood examining the manifest, its final name freshly crossed through with ink still wet. <words>22</words> "Certainly possible," he muttered, his dry wit barely masking the weight of watching another promise erode like the cliffs below. <words>40</words>

The frayed rope hung from the bedpost—once strong enough to secure boats, now barely holding the ghosts of maritime oaths. <words>60</words> Marcus had come to confiscate it, this evidence of Captain Elara's betrayal, but something in the rope's worn fibers spoke of deeper erosion. <words>83</words>

"You're early," Elara's voice drifted from the shadows, her form materializing like fog. <words>96</words> "The list isn't supposed to be complete until dawn." <words>105</words>

"Lists have a way of finishing themselves when promises turn to ash," Marcus replied, pocketing the rope with practiced efficiency. <words>125</words> "Besides, I've learned the traditional methods require punctuality." <words>133</words>

She laughed, a sound like glass breaking underwater. <words>141</words> "Traditional methods? <words>143</words> You mean the old lighthouse keeper's rituals?" <words>150</words> Her ghostly feet began tracing familiar steps across the warped floorboards. <words>161</words> "The Mariner's Waltz—you remember it, don't you?" <words>169</words>

Despite himself, Marcus felt his boots responding to the rhythm, the shared love for that specific dance that had once bound every keeper to their duty. <words>195</words> In life, Elara had been the best dancer among them, her promises as fluid as her movements. <words>212</words> Now, as they moved through the haunted bedroom, each step revealed another layer of betrayal—names on the list were lighthouse keepers who'd trusted her coordinates, ships guided onto rocks instead of safety. <words>245</words>

"Every crossed name is a broken vow," Marcus said, matching her tempo with reckless precision, knowing one misstep in this spectral dance meant joining her eternal waltz. <words>272</words> "You eroded everything we stood for." <words>278</words>

"Stood for?" <words>280</words> Elara spun, her translucent form flickering. <words>286</words> "We were sentinels of stone and storm, Marcus. <words>294</words> The sea doesn't care about our promises—it takes what it wants." <words>305</words>

The rope in his pocket grew heavier as they danced, its frayed edges cutting through fabric, drawing blood that sizzled on the salt-stained floor. <words>329</words> This was the traditional method—to dance with the betrayer until dawn, to let their own erosion complete the ritual. <words>348</words>

As the first light pierced the lighthouse lens, Elara's form began dissolving, her final whisper carrying across the waves: "Check your own list, Sentinel." <words>372</words>

Marcus stopped dancing, pulling out the manifest. <words>379</words> There, beneath the crossed names, his own signature appeared, glowing faintly. <words>390</words> The rope fell from his pocket, and he understood—every promise erodes, even those carved in duty's stone. <words>407</words> The haunted bedroom fell silent, waiting for the next sentinel to learn that certainly possible rarely means certainly wise. <words>426</words>
