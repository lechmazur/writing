The neon sign repair shop hummed with electric ghosts, tubes of argon and mercury waiting to resurrect dead letters. <words>17</words> Kira traced her fingers along the tribal mask's labyrinthine carvings, its wooden surface cool against her palm. <words>33</words> The guilt never left her—not since she'd taken her master's life with the very blade he'd gifted her. <words>51</words>

Outside, the final petal dropped from the old rosebush, marking the end of their agreed mourning period. <words>68</words> She'd been reservedly bold in her pursuit, gleaning secrets from half-truth historians who whispered of redemption rituals in dusty archives. <words>88</words> They spoke of doors that could open between worlds, passages that might wash clean the blood from a swordswoman's hands. <words>108</words>

"You fixing that?" <words>111</words> The shop owner gestured at the mask. <words>118</words>

"No," Kira replied, adjusting her katana's weight against her hip. <words>128</words> "I'm using it to find something." <words>134</words>

The historians had been coy, mixing lies with ancient truths. <words>144</words> But she'd pieced together enough: the mask's carvings weren't decorative—they were a map. <words>157</words> Each spiral and intersection corresponded to ley lines beneath the city, converging here, in this unremarkable shop. <words>173</words>

She held the mask up to the buzzing neon tubes. <words>183</words> Their light filtered through the carved passages, projecting shadows that danced like living things on the concrete floor. <words>201</words> The pattern aligned with the shop's layout—tool racks, workbenches, the broken "OPEN" sign that hadn't lit in years. <words>219</words>

The door of release wasn't a physical thing. <words>227</words> It was a moment, a confluence of guilt and purpose, witnessed by the right eyes at the right time. <words>246</words> Kira had pursued this knowledge through three cities, following breadcrumbs left by historians who documented what others dismissed as folklore. <words>266</words>

She began to move, her steps following the mask's projected paths. <words>277</words> Each turn felt like confession, each pause an acknowledgment of her crime. <words>289</words> The shop owner watched, understanding dawning in his eyes—he'd seen this before. <words>301</words>

"Your master," he said quietly, "he knew you'd come here." <words>311</words>

The words struck like lightning. <words>316</words> The mask grew warm in her hands as she completed the pattern, arriving at the shop's center. <words>333</words> The neon signs flickered in sequence, their colors shifting from commercial brightness to something older, deeper. <words>349</words>

The door of release opened not outward but inward, into the space between heartbeats. <words>363</words> Kira felt her guilt transform—not erased but transmuted into purpose. <words>373</words> Her master had orchestrated his own death, knowing she needed this weight to find her true path. <words>390</words>

She stepped through, katana and mask in hand, into the unknown that had always been waiting. <words>406</words> The shop's neon glow faded behind her, replaced by something vast and forgiving. <words>419</words> In this new realm, she could finally pursue justice without the burden of murder, her blade clean and ready for the battles that mattered. <words>443</words>

The door closed softly, leaving only the hum of electricity and the memory of transformation. <words>458</words>
