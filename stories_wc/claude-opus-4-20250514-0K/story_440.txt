The swordsman stood before the recycling center's art disposal unit, watching paint drip from a freshly completed mural on the opposite wall. <words>17</words> In his weathered palm lay a piece of sea pottery, its edges smoothed by centuries of waves, though oceans had vanished from this chrome city long ago. <words>44</words> He knew the secret weavers would come tonight. <words>52</words>

They always appeared after murals were finished, threading reality through discarded art like spiders through morning dew. <words>69</words> The swordsman had learned to love from a distance, to care without clinging—a skill more difficult to master than any blade technique. <words>91</words> Tonight, he would meddle with their ancient patterns. <words>99</words>

Kneeling beside the street artist's bin, he began reassembling collage scraps: a torn photograph of forgotten seas, metallic fragments spelling half a name, pressed flowers from extinct gardens. <words>127</words> Each piece whispered of the impossible vow he'd made to his dying master—to preserve beauty without possessing it, to guard without grasping. <words>149</words>

"Curious," said a voice like silk through steel. <words>157</words> A weaver materialized, her fingers trailing luminous threads. <words>165</words> "A warrior playing with paper dolls?" <words>171</words>

"Even detachment requires attachment to purpose," he replied, not looking up. <words>182</words> His hands continued their delicate work, placing the sea pottery at the collage's heart. <words>196</words> The weaver laughed, a sound like circuits singing. <words>204</words>

"You know we'll unravel whatever you create," she said. <words>213</words> "It's our nature." <words>216</words>

"And it's mine to create anyway." <words>222</words> He pressed the final scrap into place—a child's drawing of waves. <words>233</words> The collage pulsed once with bioluminescent light. <words>240</words>

More weavers emerged from recycling tubes and ventilation grates, their thread-wrapped fingers itching to unpick his work. <words>257</words> But they hesitated. <words>260</words> The sea pottery glowed warmer, remembering oceans they'd never seen. <words>270</words>

"This consecrates nothing," the first weaver said, though her voice wavered. <words>281</words>

"Doesn't it?" <words>283</words> The swordsman finally stood, hand resting on his blade's pommel with practiced ease. <words>296</words> "I vow to protect what doesn't last, to honor what I'll never hold. <words>310</words> Even your unweaving becomes part of the beauty." <words>318</words>

The weavers circled his collage, threads dancing. <words>325</words> They began to work, but instead of destroying, they wove his scraps into the air itself, creating a ghostly gallery of impossible things. <words>348</words> The sea pottery rose, suspended in their web, broadcasting memories of tides across the sterile city. <words>364</words>

"Your detachment has teeth," the lead weaver admitted, amused. <words>373</words> "Perhaps some vows are possible precisely because they're impossible." <words>382</words>

The swordsman smiled, already walking away. <words>388</words> Behind him, the secret weavers played with his offering, their laughter mixing with the whisper of ancient seas. <words>406</words> His vow was consecrated not in permanence, but in the joyful seriousness of letting go. <words>421</words> The mural on the wall began to ripple, alive with threads and tides. <words>434</words>
