The morose paladin Keras stood before the abandoned solar flare observatory, its lavishly austere architecture unchanged since humanity named the last star. <words>19</words> The building's smooth obsidian walls reflected nothing, swallowing light like the void between galaxies. <words>33</words> Inside, ancient monitoring systems lay dormant, their screens dark for centuries. <words>44</words>

Keras fingered the dull sewing needle in his pocket—his only tool for the delicate work ahead. <words>60</words> The needle had once belonged to his grandmother, who'd sewn constellations into tapestries before the Great Dimming. <words>77</words> Now it would help him restore the observatory's neural threading, reconnecting humanity to the cosmos. <words>92</words>

The city-wide blackout had begun three hours ago, plunging the metropolis into darkness. <words>105</words> Perfect timing, Keras thought with bored excitement—the same contradictory emotion that had plagued him for decades. <words>121</words> Without the city's interference, the observatory's sensors might finally detect the visible changes spreading across the heavens. <words>138</words>

A shuffling sound made him turn. <words>144</words> An elderly woman emerged from the shadows, her eyes reflecting starlight that shouldn't exist. <words>158</words> "You're here to fix it," she stated, not asked. <words>167</words>

"The systems must be restored," Keras replied, recognizing a fellow keeper of old knowledge. <words>181</words> "The stars are changing, showing patterns we've never catalogued." <words>190</words>

She nodded, producing her own needle—this one gleaming with purpose. <words>200</words> "The blackout confines us here together, but perhaps that's fortunate." <words>210</words> Her fingers moved with practiced grace, threading invisible connections in the air. <words>222</words> "Two needles work faster than one." <words>228</words>

They worked in companionable silence, Keras's dull needle proving perfect for the weathered circuits. <words>242</words> The woman's bright needle handled the newer modifications, each tool essential to the whole. <words>257</words> As dawn approached, the first monitor flickered to life. <words>266</words>

Data cascaded across the screen—solar flares unlike any recorded, carrying messages in their patterns. <words>280</words> The visible changes weren't random; they were communications from the stars themselves. <words>292</words> Keras felt his perpetual melancholy lift slightly, replaced by genuine wonder. <words>303</words>

"The universe is rewriting itself," the woman whispered. <words>311</words> "And we've given humanity the chance to read its new language." <words>322</words>

The blackout ended as suddenly as it began, but the observatory hummed with renewed purpose. <words>337</words> Keras pocketed his grandmother's needle, knowing he'd return tomorrow night. <words>347</words> The woman smiled, disappearing into the morning crowds. <words>355</words>

Outside, the first visible change appeared in broad daylight—a new star, unnamed and waiting. <words>370</words> Keras walked toward the city with something approaching hope, his duty as a paladin forever altered. <words>386</words> The ancient systems were restored, but they now served a universe eager to reveal fresh mysteries. <words>402</words>
