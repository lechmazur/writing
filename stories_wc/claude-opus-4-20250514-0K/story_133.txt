Marcus had picked locks for forty years, but the rooftop orchard's iron gate yielded to his embroidered gloves with suspicious ease. <words>18</words> The colonial town sprawled below, its terracotta tiles gleaming as he entered the labyrinth of fruit trees that shouldn't exist five stories up. <words>40</words> 

He'd come during the town's annual painting festival, when artists lined the streets and no one questioned a stranger's presence. <words>61</words> The pottery class invitation had arrived unsigned, promising answers about the unclaimed throne that haunted his dreams. <words>78</words> Now, wandering between gnarled apple trees whose roots somehow gripped the building's ancient stones, Marcus felt the orchard's delightfully menacing atmosphere permeate his skeptical bones. <words>103</words>

"You're late," said a voice like honey over broken glass. <words>113</words>

A woman emerged from behind a pomegranate tree, her hands stained with clay, her smile too knowing. <words>130</words> "The pottery wheel awaits, locksmith." <words>135</words>

She led him deeper into the impossible garden, where a makeshift studio nestled between orange blossoms. <words>151</words> Other students sat at wheels, but their eyes remained fixed on their work with unnatural focus. <words>168</words>

"Shape the clay," she instructed, guiding his gloved hands. <words>177</words> "Feel how it remembers." <words>181</words>

As Marcus worked, the clay seemed to pull memories from his fingertips—every lock picked, every secret discovered. <words>199</words> The woman leaned close, her breath smelling of turned earth. <words>209</words>

"Your family's ancient duty," she whispered. <words>215</words> "They weren't mere locksmiths but guardians of the threshold." <words>224</words>

The clay transformed beneath his hands, forming a key of impossible complexity. <words>236</words> Around them, the other potters began to hum, a sound that made the fruit trees shiver. <words>252</words>

"The throne remains unclaimed because your ancestors hid it too well," she continued. <words>265</words> "But the old hunting methods—the ways of tracking power through bloodlines—must be preserved." <words>279</words>

Marcus understood then why the orchard existed here, suspended between earth and sky. <words>292</words> It was a testing ground, a place where reality grew thin. <words>303</words> His embroidered gloves, passed down through generations, bore the map to the throne room in their very stitches. <words>321</words>

"Will you accept your inheritance?" the woman asked with demure audacity, as if offering tea rather than a crown. <words>340</words>

The clay key hardened in the kiln's supernatural heat. <words>349</words> Marcus felt the weight of centuries pressing down, the burden of his bloodline's secret purpose. <words>364</words> He'd spent decades opening doors for others, never knowing he was meant to unlock destiny itself. <words>380</words>

As painting continued in the streets below, Marcus made his choice. <words>391</words> He pocketed the key, its weight both terrible and necessary. <words>401</words> The throne would remain unclaimed a while longer, but at least now, someone remembered why. <words>416</words>
