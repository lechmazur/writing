Maya's fingers traced the glass bottles containing her luminescent companions as the airport intercom announced another delay. <words>17</words> Between flights, she always made time for this ritual—examining her grandfather's lightning bug collection, each specimen a frozen constellation of woodland secrets. <words>42</words>

As a somnambulist scout, Maya walked through forests in her sleep, mapping territories her waking mind couldn't access. <words>60</words> The condition manifested after her first pilgrimage to the family's ancestral home, where she'd discovered the sunken laboratory beneath ancient oak roots. <words>82</words> Her grandfather had been a spiritual cartographer, documenting phenomena that science couldn't explain, and his notes spoke of wisdom encoded in the flight patterns of fireflies. <words>108</words>

She was unapologetically humble about her gift, deflecting praise from the research institute that funded her expeditions. <words>126</words> "I merely follow where sleep takes me," she'd say, though her nocturnal wanderings had uncovered seventeen sacred groves previously unknown to modern maps. <words>150</words>

The bottled lightning bugs weren't dead—grandfather's journals revealed they existed in stasis, their bioluminescence preserved through methods he'd developed in that underground chamber. <words>173</words> Each year, Maya returned to the ancestral home, descending into the laboratory where moss-covered equipment still hummed with inexplicable energy. <words>194</words> There, she would release one bug, following its awakened path through her somnambulant state. <words>208</words>

Her loaded curiosity had grown heavier with each pilgrimage. <words>217</words> The bugs led her to trees that whispered equations, streams that flowed upward at midnight, and clearings where time moved differently. <words>239</words> She documented everything in dream-journals, sketching maps that resembled neural networks more than geographical surveys. <words>254</words>

The institute wanted conventional data, but Maya understood her true purpose: to map spiritual wisdom the way others mapped continents. <words>275</words> Each lightning bug represented a different aspect of forest consciousness—memory, prophecy, healing. <words>287</words> When released in the sunken laboratory, they awakened dormant sensors her grandfather had embedded throughout the property. <words>304</words>

Tonight's flight would take her back for the autumn pilgrimage. <words>314</words> She held the collection closer, watching the bugs' suspended glow pulse in rhythm with her heartbeat. <words>330</words> Passengers around her saw only a young woman with peculiar luggage, never suspecting she carried keys to dimensions they couldn't perceive. <words>352</words>

The boarding announcement echoed through the terminal. <words>359</words> Maya secured the bottles in her carry-on, already feeling the pull of sleep that would guide her upon landing. <words>379</words> This year, she would release the golden bug—the one her grandfather's notes warned would reveal the forest's deepest secret. <words>399</words> Her conscious mind buzzed with questions, but her sleeping self already knew the path, waiting patiently to scout territories where science and spirit converged beneath star-mapped canopies. <words>426</words>
