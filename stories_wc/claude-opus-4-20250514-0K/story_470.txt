The practical bard Eliza traced her fingers along the brass shelving of the submarine library, her heart hammering against her ribs as she searched for the mechanism. <words>24</words> Above, the muffled sounds of the street fair filtered through the harbor waters—accordion music and laughter distorted into an ethereal symphony that made her fingers tremble with breathless longing. <words>53</words>

She had discovered her peculiar talent by accident: the ability to hear the whispered stories trapped inside stripped screws. <words>71</words> Each damaged thread held memories of the hands that had turned them, the machines they'd failed, the secrets they'd locked away. <words>92</words> This talent, precisely imperfect in its unpredictability, had led her here to the Nautilus Archive, where steam-powered preservation systems hummed beneath towering shelves of forbidden texts. <words>118</words>

Her fingernail caught on something—a stripped screw, oxidized green from decades underwater. <words>130</words> As she touched it, visions flooded her mind: a previous librarian, hastily hiding something as enemy depth charges shook the submarine's hull. <words>152</words> The screw sang its broken song, guiding her to press a specific sequence of rivets. <words>167</words>

A panel slid open with a pneumatic hiss, revealing a hidden compartment containing a secret diary bound in waterproofed leather. <words>187</words> Inside, inked in a trembling hand, were the locations of twelve other submarine libraries scattered across the world's oceans, each protecting fragments of pre-war wisdom. <words>212</words> The final entry stopped mid-sentence: "The next guardian must possess the gift to hear what others cannot—" <words>229</words>

Eliza's breath caught. <words>232</words> This was why she'd abandoned her troupe, why she'd spent years developing her practical skills alongside her bardic arts. <words>251</words> The stripped screws weren't flaws but tests, left deliberately by those who understood that ancient wisdom needed protectors who could perceive beyond the obvious. <words>275</words>

Footsteps echoed on the metal stairs. <words>281</words> The current librarian appeared, his mechanical eye whirring as it focused on the open compartment. <words>296</words> "You heard it, didn't you?" <words>301</words> His voice carried no surprise, only weary relief. <words>309</words> "The screw's lament?" <words>312</words>

She nodded, clutching the diary. <words>317</words>

"Then you must choose," he said, gesturing to the vast collection surrounding them. <words>330</words> "Accept the burden, or leave now and forget." <words>338</words>

Above them, the street fair continued its celebration of ignorance, while below, centuries of carefully preserved knowledge waited for its next guardian. <words>360</words> Eliza thought of all the stripped screws in all the world, each one a potential key to locked-away truths. <words>379</words> Her peculiar talent, she realized, had always been preparing her for this moment. <words>392</words>

"I accept," she whispered, her voice carrying the breathless longing of someone who had finally found their purpose. <words>410</words> The submarine library's lights dimmed in acknowledgment, and somewhere in the walls, a new screw deliberately stripped itself, waiting to test the next seeker. <words>435</words>
