Madame Zelena pressed her palm against the geode's entrance, her rings clicking against crystal that pulsed with peculiarly frequent waves of light. <words>18</words> Twenty years of pretending to commune with spirits had made her an expert at reading people, not portals, yet here she stood at the threshold of something undeniably real. <words>48</words>

The iridescent cave beckoned with colors that shouldn't exist, and despite her practiced cynicism, she stepped inside. <words>65</words> The air hung suspended like that breathless moment when a roller coaster stalls at its peak—all potential energy, no movement, pure anticipation. <words>88</words>

"I don't believe in this," she muttered, though her voice cracked with brazen humility. <words>102</words> The centaur horseshoe lay exactly where the old woman's journal had promised, its surface carved with runes that seemed to shift in the dancing light. <words>128</words> Zelena had spent months tracking legends of forgotten crafts, driven by a hunger to understand the authentic magic she'd only ever mimicked. <words>150</words>

She lifted the artifact, and immediately the cave filled with mists of uncertainty—not mere fog, but visible doubt itself, swirling with questions she'd buried beneath years of theatrical séances. <words>179</words> The mists coiled around her wrists, whispering accusations: fraud, charlatan, pretender. <words>190</words>

Then, cutting through the supernatural haze, came something impossible—the scent of a new book, crisp pages and fresh ink. <words>209</words> The familiar smell grounded her, reminded her why she'd started this journey. <words>221</words> Knowledge. <words>222</words> Truth. <words>223</words> The chance to transform her hollow performances into something genuine. <words>233</words>

The horseshoe grew warm in her hands, and she understood. <words>243</words> The runes weren't meant to be read; they were meant to be felt. <words>256</words> Each symbol pulsed with the memory of centaur smiths who had forged connections between worlds, and their craft flowed into her consciousness like water finding its level. <words>284</words>

"Show me," she whispered, and for once, she meant it. <words>294</words>

The mists began to strengthen rather than obscure, weaving themselves into bridges between what she'd pretended and what could be. <words>314</words> Every false séance, every fabricated message from beyond, transformed into foundation stones for authentic understanding. <words>329</words> The peculiarly frequent pulses of light synchronized with her heartbeat, and she laughed—a sound both humble and bold. <words>348</words>

When she emerged from the geode hours later, the horseshoe had crumbled to dust, its purpose fulfilled. <words>365</words> But Zelena carried its gift within her bones: the forgotten craft of building truth from the ruins of deception. <words>384</words> She was still a medium, but no longer a skeptical one. <words>395</words> The spirits she'd pretended to channel for so long finally had a authentic voice to speak through. <words>412</words>
