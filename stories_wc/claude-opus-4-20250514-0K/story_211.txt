Marcus "Lucky" Chen shuffled his deck of cards in the dusty abandoned schoolhouse, his fingers dancing with practiced ease despite the decay surrounding him. <words>24</words> The year 2087 had forgotten this Nevada ghost town, but Lucky remembered when it thrived before the water wars. <words>42</words> He'd discovered something here that changed everything: a botanical diary belonging to the town's last mayor. <words>58</words>

The leather-bound journal detailed how desert flowers could be genetically modified to produce pure water—knowledge that would make him king in this drought-ravaged world. <words>83</words> Lucky, who typically never sought power, felt its seductive pull growing stronger each day. <words>97</words> He'd already begun duplicating the diary's experiments in the schoolhouse basement, watching pale shoots emerge from cracked soil. <words>115</words>

"Another round?" asked Maya, one of five survivors who'd joined his makeshift commune. <words>128</words> They sat in a circle on the warped floorboards, playing their nightly game. <words>141</words> Lucky had instituted spin-the-bottle confessions to maintain trust—whoever the bottle pointed to revealed one secret. <words>157</words> It kept them honest, or so he told himself. <words>166</words>

The bottle spun, landing on Jakob. <words>172</words> "I saw Lucky hide extra water rations," Jakob admitted, eyes downcast. <words>183</words> The group stirred uneasily. <words>187</words>

Lucky laughed, a sound like broken bells. <words>194</words> "Of course I did! For our plants!" <words>201</words> His cheerful tone masked the creeping paranoia—they couldn't know about the diary's true potential. <words>216</words>

As weeks passed, Lucky's experiments flourished while his friends weakened. <words>226</words> He justified each deception: they'd thank him when water flowed freely. <words>237</words> The diary became his obsession, its secrets his currency. <words>246</words> He rigged the confession game, ensuring the bottle never pointed to him. <words>258</words>

One scorching morning, Maya confronted him in the basement greenhouse. <words>268</words> "We're dying while your plants thrive," she said. <words>276</words> Lucky's perpetual grin faltered. <words>280</words> He could share the water, destroy his research, and remain equals in their suffering. <words>294</words> Or he could complete his work and rule as a benevolent god. <words>306</words>

"Spin the bottle," Maya challenged, producing their confession bottle. <words>315</words> "Tell us the truth." <words>319</words>

Lucky stared at the flourishing garden, each bloom a testament to his betrayal. <words>332</words> The diary had shown him how to defy hopelessness, but at what cost? <words>345</words> He spun the bottle, watching it slow, knowing that power's sweetest corruption was believing your lies served a greater good. <words>365</words>

The bottle pointed to him. <words>370</words> Lucky's laugh echoed through the empty schoolhouse—bright, hollow, and absolutely sincere. <words>381</words> "I wanted to save us all," he confessed, still smiling as tears carved tracks through desert dust. <words>398</words> "But I saved only myself." <words>403</words>
