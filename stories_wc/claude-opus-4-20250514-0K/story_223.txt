Commander Lysander pressed her palm against the crystalline wall, fighting waves of nausea that had nothing to do with the sea she'd left behind centuries ago. <words>19</words> The fortress at rainbow canyon's end still made her seasick—its walls pulsing with tides of light that mimicked ocean swells she'd once sailed. <words>42</words> 

She clutched the translucent ghost orchid bulb, its surface cool against her fevered skin. <words>57</words> This was the last of the traded secrets, the final piece of currency in a game that had stretched across the quiet longing of centuries. <words>83</words> Each moon phase had brought another exchange: maritime charts for alchemical formulas, navigation techniques for transformation rituals, until she'd learned enough to track the fortress through time itself. <words>110</words>

"Still awkwardly charming after all these years," the mirror whispered as she entered its chamber. <words>126</words> Lysander grimaced—her stumbling gait and perpetual queasiness had indeed become endearing to those who'd helped her along the way. <words>146</words> But charm was just another tool, another secret to trade. <words>156</words>

The mirror's surface rippled like disturbed water. <words>163</words> "You've come to confront me before I lie again." <words>173</words>

"I've come to transform," Lysander corrected, her voice carrying nostalgic defiance. <words>184</words> She remembered her first glimpse of the fortress from her ship's crow's nest—how the rainbow canyon had shimmered impossibly on the horizon, how she'd betrayed her crew's position to learn its location. <words>217</words> The guilt still churned in her stomach alongside the perpetual seasickness. <words>228</words>

"The orchid bulb," the mirror said. <words>234</words> "Plant it during the new moon, and you'll become what you've always feared—honest." <words>248</words>

Lysander laughed bitterly. <words>251</words> Honesty was the ultimate transformation for someone who'd built centuries on traded secrets. <words>265</words> She'd tracked moon phases obsessively, learning their influence on the fortress's location, on the mirror's prophecies, on her own cursed immortality. <words>287</words> Each lunar cycle had deepened her understanding of the price she'd paid. <words>299</words>

"Why should I believe you won't lie?" <words>306</words> she asked. <words>308</words>

"Because you already know the truth," the mirror replied. <words>317</words> "Every secret you've traded has led here—to this moment where you must choose between eternal seasickness and mortal peace." <words>337</words>

Lysander studied her reflection: the naval uniform faded but intact, the face unchanged by time but marked by countless betrayals. <words>358</words> The fortress walls sang their crystalline song, and she swayed with their rhythm. <words>372</words> 

She pressed the ghost orchid bulb into the crystal floor. <words>382</words> As it took root, spreading luminous tendrils through the fortress foundation, Lysander felt the first honest words in centuries rise to her lips. <words>406</words> 

"I was never seasick," she whispered, watching her reflection finally age. <words>418</words> "I was homesick." <words>421</words>

The transformation began with the next moon's rise, washing away centuries of careful lies, leaving only an awkwardly charming truth behind. <words>443</words>
