The vintage spectacles caught the morning light as Hayashi, once Sheriff of Tucson, knelt in the castle's forgotten garden. <words>17</words> Spring had arrived at Matsumoto Castle, and with trembling hands that once drew pistols, he pressed rice seeds into soil. <words>36</words> The letter that brought him here—addressed to a dead samurai but somehow finding him—lay folded against his chest. <words>55</words> "Foreign devil seeks sanctuary," it had read in broken English, "from endless blood." <words>68</words>

He stirred the earth gently, gathering broken pieces of pottery that centuries of neglect had scattered through the grounds. <words>87</words> Each shard reminded him of lives he'd shattered enforcing laws that protected some while destroying others. <words>103</words> The spectacles, inherited from his Japanese grandmother, had revealed this probably improbable truth: violence begets violence, whether wearing a badge or wielding a katana. <words>127</words>

Lord Takeda emerged from morning mists, his footsteps silent on ancient stones. <words>139</words> "The seeds you plant will feed my warriors," he said, voice carrying corroded rapture—joy poisoned by endless war. <words>157</words> Hayashi's fingers found another pottery fragment, this one bearing the character for peace. <words>170</words> He'd fled Arizona's vengeance cycles only to discover Japan's feudal lords trapped in their own. <words>185</words>

"Your letter spoke of sanctuary," Takeda continued, studying the foreign lawman through narrowed eyes. <words>199</words> "Yet you tend a warrior's garden." <words>205</words>

Hayashi adjusted the spectacles, seeing clearly what others missed. <words>214</words> "I'm gathering broken pieces, sir—of myself, of this place." <words>224</words> He gestured at the shards arranged beside neat seed rows. <words>234</words> "In Tucson, I shot men whose only crime was desperation." <words>244</words> His voice cracked like old leather. <words>250</words> "Here, I plant food for men who'll die in someone else's quarrel." <words>262</words>

Thunder rolled across mountain peaks, stirring cherry blossoms into pink snow. <words>273</words> Takeda's hand moved to his sword, then stopped. <words>281</words> "You see too much, former lawman." <words>287</words>

"These spectacles belonged to my grandmother, who fled this very castle." <words>298</words> Hayashi touched the wire frames. <words>303</words> "She escaped your grandfather's service, seeking peace in America." <words>312</words> He laughed bitterly. <words>315</words> "I've returned, completing a circle I never knew existed." <words>324</words>

The lord's expression shifted—recognition dawning like corroded metal catching light. <words>334</words> "The healer's daughter... she vanished with my grandfather's spectacles." <words>343</words>

"And her grandson returns them, begging release from violence that spans oceans." <words>355</words> Hayashi pressed the last seed deep, sealing it with earth and hope. <words>367</words> "Let me tend this garden, nothing more." <words>374</words> He gathered the pottery shards, seeing in their brokenness a possible wholeness. <words>386</words> "Perhaps broken pieces, properly arranged, can still hold something beautiful." <words>396</words>

Takeda's weathered face revealed his own weariness. <words>403</words> "Stay then, gardener." <words>406</words> He turned away. <words>409</words> "May your seeds break our cycle." <words>415</words>

Rain began falling, stirring the planted earth into dark promise. <words>425</words> Hayashi removed the spectacles, polishing lenses that had witnessed too much blood across generations. <words>439</words> Here, in this improbable sanctuary, he would cultivate peace from violence-poisoned ground. <words>451</words> The broken pieces of his past might yet nurture something whole. <words>462</words>
