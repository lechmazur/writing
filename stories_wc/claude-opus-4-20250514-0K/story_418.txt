The record player wheezed its final note, needle skipping helplessly across ancient vinyl. <words>13</words> Lyra pulled her tattered sequined cape tighter, glitter cascading onto dead soil like radioactive snow. <words>28</words> The wasteland orchard stretched before her—gnarled apple trees somehow thriving in the dust storms, their fruit glowing faintly green. <words>48</words>

She clutched the stained glass box, its colors the only vibrant thing for miles. <words>62</words> Inside lay her confession, the spell she'd hidden for decades. <words>72</words> The world had turned gray after the bombs, but Lyra remembered color—remembered herself before she'd fled into this masculine disguise. <words>92</words>

"Stubborn fool," she muttered with merry bitterness, kicking at a root. <words>103</words> The headstrong mage she'd become had saved lives, yes, but at what cost? <words>116</words> Her true self remained locked away like light trapped in colored glass. <words>128</words>

The costume's residue told her story better than words—each speck of glitter a memory of the woman she'd been. <words>148</words> Before the wars, she'd danced in traveling shows, spreading joy through devastated settlements. <words>161</words> But female mages were hunted then, forced to hide or die. <words>172</words> So she'd cut her hair, deepened her voice, bound her chest, and survived. <words>185</words>

Now, standing among impossible apple blossoms, she felt tenuously certain. <words>195</words> The hunters were gone, consumed by their own hatred and radiation. <words>206</words> Only the gray remained—gray sky, gray earth, gray hearts. <words>215</words>

She opened the box. <words>219</words> Rainbow light spilled out, refracting through tears she'd forgotten how to cry. <words>231</words> The spell inside would feminize her body again, restore what she'd magically altered. <words>244</words> But more than that, it would release the color she'd hoarded all these years. <words>258</words>

"Courage," she whispered, remembering her grandmother's words. <words>265</words> "Not the absence of fear, child, but dancing despite it." <words>275</words>

The glitter swirled upward as she spoke the incantation, each particle a tiny prism. <words>289</words> Her body softened, curves returning like old friends. <words>297</words> Her voice lifted, finding its true pitch. <words>304</words> The spell expanded outward, painting the orchard in impossible hues—purple bark, golden leaves, fruit that sparkled like rubies. <words>322</words>

Color bled across the wasteland like watercolor on wet paper. <words>332</words> The gray retreated, revealing hidden beauty beneath ash and sorrow. <words>342</words> Other survivors emerged from bunkers, shielding their eyes from the sudden vibrancy. <words>354</words>

Lyra laughed—a sound both bitter and bright. <words>361</words> She'd spent forty years afraid to be herself, thinking courage meant hiding. <words>373</words> But true courage was this: standing in a radioactive orchard, glitter in her hair, finally confessing who she'd always been. <words>393</words>

The world blazed with color, and Lyra danced among the apple trees, whole at last. <words>408</words>
