Marina Volkov pressed the crumpled invitation between her palms, feeling its quiet pulse—a rhythmic thrum that only professional dream interpreters could detect. <words>21</words>

The vapor collection facility loomed before her, its crystalline towers harvesting memories from the city's sleeping population during the sacred hours of baking, when dreams calcified into harvestable essence. <words>50</words>

She had come here by impersonating Elias Chen, a missing person whose disappearance three weeks ago had left a convenient void in the facility's personnel records. <words>76</words>

The invitation, found in his abandoned apartment, bore watermarks that shifted with occasionally frequent intervals—sometimes every heartbeat, sometimes every century. <words>97</words>

Marina believed with peculiar faith that these patterns held the key to rewriting the laws carved in stone, the immutable dream-codes that governed how human consciousness could be extracted and preserved. <words>128</words>

Inside the facility, technicians moved like sleepwalkers through corridors of condensed reverie. <words>140</words>

The baking process had already begun; she could smell it—burnt sugar and ozone, the scent of thoughts crystallizing. <words>158</words>

Marina's fingers traced the invitation's creases as she navigated toward the central chamber. <words>171</words>

Each fold revealed fragments of Elias's final dream: a parliament of shadows debating reality's constitution, their voices creating that quiet pulse she'd been following. <words>196</words>

The security checkpoint accepted her false credentials without question. <words>205</words>

After all, who would dare impersonate someone who'd been erased by their own subconscious? <words>219</words>

In the extraction bay, massive condensers hummed with collected visions. <words>229</words>

Marina understood now why the invitation pulsed—it was synchronized with the facility's heartbeat, the occasionally frequent rhythm of humanity's collective unconscious being processed into law. <words>254</words>

She approached the primary console where dream-laws were encoded. <words>263</words>

The screen displayed regulations written in lucid script: "No dreamer may witness their own death," "Nightmares must dissolve at dawn," "Memory and desire shall remain separate streams." <words>290</words>

These weren't just guidelines—they were the architecture of human experience. <words>300</words>

Marina inserted the invitation into the console's reader. <words>308</words>

The paper's quiet pulse accelerated, matching her heartbeat as the system recognized something impossible—a dream that had refused to calcify, that had instead folded itself into physical form. <words>337</words>

The laws began rewriting themselves, each amendment spreading like cracks through stone. <words>349</words>

Where rigid certainties once stood, new possibilities bloomed: "Dreamers may choose their own endings," "Night and day shall dance together," "Memory may court future's promise." <words>375</words>

As alarms wailed, Marina smiled with her peculiar faith vindicated. <words>385</words>

She had done what Elias could not—delivered his final dream to its destination. <words>398</words>

The facility shuddered as humanity's unconscious restructured itself around these new truths, and Marina vanished into the vapor, becoming another missing person with a crumpled invitation pulsing quietly in her wake. <words>428</words>
