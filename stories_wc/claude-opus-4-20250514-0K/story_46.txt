The blank-faced performer sat beneath the cascading water, fingers moving across invisible keys while ferns the size of buildings swayed overhead. <words>20</words> Marielle had been Guardian of Rumors for three lunar cycles, though her expression never betrayed the weight of whispered secrets she carried. <words>41</words> During piano practice—which occurred whenever the moon's path crossed the third waterfall—she would slip the plain plastic ring onto her thumb and begin. <words>65</words>

Each phantom keystroke translated gossip into the language of dreams, a skill required of all Guardians in the Fernwater Orchard. <words>85</words> The waterfalls spoke in frequencies only her kind could hear: allegations of theft among the root-dwellers, speculation about the canopy-dancers' forbidden romances, theories about why the soil had begun to hum. <words>117</words> Marielle's uniquely typical appearance—neither beautiful nor plain, neither young nor old—made her perfect for the role. <words>133</words> People forgot her face the moment they turned away, allowing her to collect their murmurings like dewdrops. <words>150</words>

Tonight's moon path curved strangely, bending through the mist at angles that made her plastic ring vibrate. <words>167</words> She needed to approve or deny the most dangerous rumor yet: that the Orchard itself was dreaming, and its dreams were leaking into the waking world. <words>193</words> Her fingers danced faster across the air, each movement precise in its madness, calibrated to decode the truth hidden in hearsay. <words>214</words>

The giant ferns began to lean closer, their fronds unfurling to reveal eye-like patterns that watched her performance. <words>232</words> This was why she'd sought the position—not for power, but to learn the language of dreams before the boundary dissolved entirely. <words>254</words> The rumors suggested that those who mastered dream-speech could navigate both worlds, becoming bridges between the conscious and unconscious realms. <words>274</words>

As the moon reached its apex, aligning perfectly with the largest waterfall's cascade, Marielle felt the translation complete. <words>292</words> The rumor was true—the Orchard was indeed dreaming, but it wasn't a threat. <words>306</words> It was an invitation. <words>310</words> Her blank face finally shifted, the slightest smile cracking across her lips as she understood: the dreams weren't leaking out, they were welcoming others in. <words>335</words>

She stood, removing the plastic ring and placing it in the hollow of an ancient fern. <words>351</words> The next Guardian would need it when their time came to decode the gossip of two worlds becoming one. <words>370</words> Marielle's fingers still moved in phantom patterns as she walked toward the shimmering boundary where water met thought, where rumors became prophecies, where her uniquely typical face would finally find its extraordinary purpose. <words>403</words> The piano practice was over; the real performance was about to begin. <words>415</words>
