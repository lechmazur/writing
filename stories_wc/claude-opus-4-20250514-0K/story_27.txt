The prize booth's dusty shelves groaned beneath decades of forgotten treasures, but Marcus only saw the vintage pencil box gleaming like a beacon. <words>19</words>

"That one contains your curse," he said flatly, unable to lie even to himself. <words>33</words>

The booth attendant—a specter in a faded carnival uniform—smiled with polite malice. <words>46</words>

"Ah, the cynic arrives precisely when the moon waxes," she murmured, her translucent fingers tracing patterns in the air. <words>65</words>

Marcus had stumbled into the abandoned park while tracking a rare night heron, his binoculars still hanging around his neck. <words>85</words>

"I don't believe in curses," he stated, then winced as truth compelled him to add, "except I absolutely do now." <words>105</words>

The attendant's laugh tinkled like broken glass wrapped in velvet. <words>115</words>

"Your skepticism was tiresome, so I wove it into fate's tapestry," she explained, gesturing to an ancient loom behind the counter where threads of light danced. <words>141</words>

"Every cynical thought you voiced without consideration, every dream you dismissed—they all led here." <words>156</words>

Marcus reached for the pencil box, his hand trembling. <words>165</words>

"Why?" he asked simply. <words>169</words>

"To evolve your stagnant mind," she replied, her courtesy sharp as a blade. <words>182</words>

"You petrified others with your disbelief, turned their hopes to stone with careless words." <words>197</words>

"Now, you'll speak only truth until the new moon rises." <words>207</words>

The box felt warm in his hands, its brass hinges whispering secrets. <words>219</words>

"I was afraid," Marcus admitted, the words flowing unbidden. <words>228</words>

"Afraid of being wrong, of hoping, of seeing beauty without immediately dissecting it." <words>241</words>

Above them, his night heron circled, crying out in the darkness. <words>252</words>

"Your birds know truth instinctively," the attendant observed. <words>260</words>

"They migrate by ancient patterns, trust the moon's pull without question." <words>271</words>

Marcus opened the box, finding only a mirror inside. <words>280</words>

His reflection showed not his face, but the faces of everyone he'd discouraged—artists, dreamers, believers—all frozen in moments of doubt he'd created. <words>302</words>

"I see them," he whispered. <words>307</words>

"I see what I've done." <words>312</words>

The attendant's form began to fade with the setting moon. <words>322</words>

"Truth isn't cynicism," she said gently. <words>328</words>

"It's accepting both shadow and light in the tapestry." <words>337</words>

"Your curse ends when you can speak hope as honestly as you once spoke despair." <words>352</words>

Marcus clutched the pencil box, understanding flooding through him. <words>360</words>

"Thank you," he said, meaning it completely. <words>367</words>

The booth dissolved, leaving him alone with his binoculars and a strange gift. <words>380</words>

He looked up at the heron, still circling, and spoke his first conscious truth: "You're magnificent, and I don't need to know why." <words>403</words>

The pencil box hummed with approval, its purpose finally served. <words>413</words>
