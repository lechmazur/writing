Sir Aldric floated listlessly through the zero-gravity dance hall, his armor catching prismatic light from the crystalline walls. <words>17</words> Once, he had defended kingdoms; now, he guarded nothing but his own despair. <words>30</words> The trident prong from the sunken realm of Atlantis hung at his belt, its coral-encrusted surface pulsing with otherworldly energy. <words>51</words> He had retrieved it from the depths before gravity itself had abandoned this place, before the dance hall had lifted into the void between worlds. <words>77</words>

The other patrons—merchants, mystics, and refugees from a dozen realities—spun gracefully through the air, but Aldric merely drifted. <words>96</words> In this place where up and down held no meaning, the normally abnormal had become mundane. <words>113</words> Tentacled beings waltzed with humans, while machines partnered with pure energy, all suspended in sacred disorder. <words>130</words>

The ancient watchtower clock, salvaged from Earth and mounted impossibly on what some called the ceiling, began to chime. <words>150</words> But instead of twelve, it struck thirteen—an unexpected hour that existed only here, in the spaces between. <words>168</words> As the thirteenth bell resonated through the weightless air, Aldric felt the trident prong quicken against his hip. <words>186</words>

The artifact pulled him toward forgotten paths that wound through the dance hall's hidden dimensions. <words>201</words> These passages existed in the corners of vision, accessible only to those who carried relics of drowned worlds. <words>219</words> Aldric let himself be drawn through spiraling corridors where time flowed sideways and memories crystallized into floating gems. <words>237</words>

At the path's end, he found himself in the hall's heart—a sphere of pure silence where no music reached. <words>257</words> Here, the deepening horizons of reality folded inward, revealing infinite layers of existence. <words>270</words> The trident prong sang in frequencies only his soul could hear, awakening something long buried within him. <words>287</words>

Aldric understood now why he had been brought here. <words>296</words> The silent vow he had carried for centuries—to restore honor to his fallen order—could finally be voiced. <words>313</words> Not through words, but through the dance itself. <words>321</words> He pushed off from the sphere's wall, spinning into the chaotic beauty of the hall. <words>337</words>

His movements became prayer, each gesture echoing through ages past and future. <words>349</words> The other dancers sensed the change and began orbiting around him, their bodies forming constellations of meaning. <words>366</words> The trident prong blazed with submarine light, transforming the dejected knight into a beacon of purpose. <words>382</words>

In this place of sacred disorder, where the normally abnormal reigned supreme, Sir Aldric finally found his voice. <words>400</words> His vow rippled outward through deepening horizons, reaching every sunken realm, every forgotten kingdom, every lost soul seeking redemption in the dance. <words>423</words>
