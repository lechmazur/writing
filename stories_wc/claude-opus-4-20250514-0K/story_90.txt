The contrite swordsman adjusted his cracked monocle, squinting through the spider-webbed glass at the floating island spa's marble reception desk. <words>18</words> "I'm here for the royal tattoo reading," he announced, his voice carrying the hypnotically rigid cadence of someone who'd practiced this line too many times. <words>44</words>

The receptionist, a woman whose smile could curdle milk, handed him a ball of yarn. <words>59</words> "Third cloud on the left, past the levitating mud baths." <words>69</words>

He'd spent years regretting the incident that earned him his reputation – accidentally skewering the Duke's prized peacock during a demonstration. <words>90</words> But now, in the hush where hope takes root, he had a chance at redemption. <words>105</words> The pretender to the throne bore cryptic tattoos that, when properly unraveled, would reveal their true identity. <words>122</words>

The spa's atmosphere was unsettling – too peaceful, like a library where someone might scream at any moment. <words>140</words> Aromatherapy candles floated past his nose, smelling suspiciously of regret and lavender. <words>152</words>

He found the pretender lounging in a mineral pool, back exposed. <words>163</words> The tattoos writhed across their skin like living things, forming patterns that hurt to look at directly. <words>180</words> "Excuse me," the swordsman said, approaching with the yarn, "I'm your... tattoo therapist." <words>193</words>

The pretender grunted approval without turning. <words>198</words>

With trembling hands, he began his work, using the yarn to trace the tattoo lines. <words>213</words> Each connection revealed a letter, a word, a confession. <words>222</words> The pretender was actually Morris, the castle's former jester, who'd staged his own death by pratfall. <words>238</words>

"You know," Morris said suddenly, "I always admired your swordsmanship, even after the peacock thing." <words>253</words>

The swordsman's hands froze. <words>257</words> This unexpected kindness from his target felt like a key turning in a lock he didn't know existed. <words>275</words>

"That bird had it coming," Morris continued. <words>282</words> "Duke trained it to attack anyone who bowed improperly. You saved countless ankles." <words>295</words>

The yarn slipped from the swordsman's fingers. <words>302</words> For three years, he'd carried guilt like armor, but Morris's words dissolved it like sugar in rain. <words>319</words>

"I can't unmask you," he whispered. <words>325</words>

Morris turned, revealing a face painted in the traditional jester's style but with tears cutting through the makeup. <words>343</words> "Then help me yarn a better story. The kingdom deserves better than another tyrant." <words>357</words>

They spent the remaining hours weaving tales and plans, two broken men freed by kindness in a spa that defied gravity. <words>378</words> The swordsman's rigid posture finally relaxed as he realized that sometimes the best way to serve justice is to let mercy win. <words>400</words>
