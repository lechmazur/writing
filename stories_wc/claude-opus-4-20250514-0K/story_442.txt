Marcus ran his calloused thumb across the torn corner of a flyer, the only remnant of instructions he'd once memorized perfectly. <words>17</words> The giant mushroom house groaned around him, its bioluminescent walls pulsing with a rhythm that matched his failing heartbeat. <words>35</words> He'd been a master electrician once, before the world folded in on itself, before memories became negotiable currency. <words>53</words>

"Three minutes until final rotation," he muttered, checking his synchronized watch against the five others strapped to his scarred forearm. <words>73</words> Each showed a different time, but he trusted their collective lie more than any singular truth. <words>89</words> The windmill outside—that massive, creaking monument to forgotten purposes—would complete its last turn soon, and with it, his chance to vectorize would vanish. <words>113</words>

The process required precision: converting his analog existence into pure directional force, becoming an arrow shot through dimensions. <words>131</words> He'd seen others try and fail, their bodies scattered across probability like paint splatter. <words>145</words> But Marcus had always been comfortingly pessimistic; expecting failure made success feel like cheating death. <words>160</words>

The flickering candle in his grip dripped wax onto his steel-toed boots. <words>172</words> This wasn't just any flame—it was her last breath, crystallized into perpetual combustion. <words>186</words> Sarah had been another tradesperson, a carpenter who built impossible staircases in the mushroom houses before the memory plague hit. <words>206</words> Now she existed only as this trembling light he'd sworn to carry through the endless void that waited beyond vectorization. <words>226</words>

His memories of her face shifted like smoke—sometimes young, sometimes old, never quite right. <words>241</words> The distortion was getting worse; yesterday he'd forgotten whether she had hands or wings. <words>256</words> The torn flyer corner showed half a smile that might have been hers, or might have been anyone's. <words>274</words> Truth had become a luxury he couldn't afford. <words>282</words>

The watches chimed in discordant unison. <words>287</words> Through the translucent mushroom flesh, he watched the windmill's shadow complete its final arc across the poisoned earth. <words>305</words> Marcus pressed the candle against his chest and felt the vectorization begin—his body translating into pure intention, pure direction. <words>324</words> The mushroom house's interior blurred into streaming colors as he accelerated beyond physical form. <words>338</words>

He'd been wrong about many things, but not about this: the void wasn't empty. <words>352</words> It was full of others like him, each carrying their own flickering flames through the darkness, each following torn instructions toward destinations they'd forgotten how to remember. <words>379</words> The candle's light merged with thousands of others, creating constellations of lost love in the black. <words>395</words> Marcus smiled his crooked tradesman's smile, finally understanding that forgetting was just another trade—and he'd made the best deal possible. <words>416</words>
