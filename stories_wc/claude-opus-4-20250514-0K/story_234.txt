The gentle swordsman Kenzo stood beneath the tyrannosaur skeleton, studying the half-painted sundial someone had left on the museum floor. <words>18</words> His calloused fingers traced the coded angles—a message only late bloomers like himself would understand. <words>33</words>

"Faithfully unfaithful," he muttered, the paradox that defined his life. <words>43</words> He'd sworn loyalty to countless masters, breaking each vow to serve humanity's greater good. <words>58</words> The empty matchbox in his pocket—his last memento from Master Chen—rattled as he moved. <words>73</words>

The orchard dog outside had finally stopped barking at night. <words>83</words> That was the signal. <words>87</words> Kenzo's xenophile nature had led him here, following whispers of an alien artifact hidden within the museum's collection. <words>105</words> Not to destroy it, as his current employer demanded, but to understand it. <words>118</words>

"You're late," a voice echoed through the prehistoric gallery. <words>127</words>

Dr. Sarah Martinez emerged from behind a stegosaurus, her lab coat incongruous among the ancient bones. <words>143</words> "Took you long enough to decode my sundial." <words>151</words>

"Some of us bloom slowly," Kenzo replied, hand instinctively finding his sword's hilt. <words>164</words> "The artifact?" <words>166</words>

She snorted—brusque affection radiating from every gesture. <words>173</words> "Always business with you warrior types." <words>179</words> She led him deeper into the museum, past skeletal sentinels frozen in time. <words>192</words> "It's not what you think. <words>197</words> Not a weapon." <words>200</words>

In the restoration lab, she revealed it: a crystalline sphere that seemed to contain swirling galaxies. <words>216</words> "The indigenous people called it the Universe's Seed. <words>224</words> They knew what we're only beginning to understand—that late bloomers aren't behind schedule. <words>237</words> They're exactly on time." <words>241</words>

Kenzo reached out, and the sphere responded, levitating into his cupped hands. <words>253</words> The weight of infinite possibility settled into his palms. <words>262</words> All his wandering, his broken oaths, his love for foreign wisdom—it had led here. <words>276</words>

"Your employer will come for it," Sarah warned, already packing equipment. <words>287</words>

"Let them." <words>289</words> Kenzo's gentle nature never wavered, even in defiance. <words>297</words> "I've been faithfully unfaithful before." <words>302</words> He tucked the empty matchbox deeper into his pocket—Chen would have understood. <words>314</words> Some betrayals serve a higher loyalty. <words>320</words>

The dinosaur skeletons watched as they fled through the moonlit galleries, two late bloomers carrying the universe in cupped hands, finally understanding that timing isn't about speed—it's about readiness. <words>349</words> Outside, even the orchard dog slept peacefully, as if sensing that something long-awaited had finally begun. <words>365</words>

Kenzo smiled at Sarah's gruff kindness as she hotwired the van. <words>376</words> "Where to?" <words>378</words> she asked.

"Wherever understanding blooms," he answered, cradling infinity with a swordsman's gentle precision. <words>390</words> The night stretched before them, patient as prehistoric time. <words>399</words>
