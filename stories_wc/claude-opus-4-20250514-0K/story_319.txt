The frail guard clutched the sour-smelling alchemy phial, its contents swirling like trapped storm clouds. <words>14</words> Throughout the sorting ceremony on the tidal island, he had watched young initiates receive their painted allegiances—blue for the healers, red for the warriors, black for the scholars. <words>43</words> But Matthias knew his own fate had been predetermined long before his birth: gold for the eternal guardians, those who would never leave this sacred place. <words>69</words>

His trembling fingers traced the latest message carved into the ancient oak's bark: "Low tide tomorrow. <words>85</words> Your chance." <words>87</words> For months, these anonymous carvings had appeared, offering hope to one resolutely wavering between duty and freedom. <words>104</words> Each message vanished with the next high tide, as if the island itself conspired to keep his secret. <words>122</words>

The phial contained essence of forget-me-vine, powerful enough to dissolve the golden paint that would soon mark his forehead. <words>141</words> Its acrid smell made him gag, but he tucked it carefully beneath his ceremonial robes. <words>157</words> Tomorrow, when the elders painted his allegiance, he would yank the cork and splash the liquid across his face before the pigment could set. <words>182</words> The chemical reaction would create a different color entirely—purple, the mark of the wanderers. <words>196</words>

As sorting continued, Matthias watched the tide recede, revealing the narrow causeway that connected their island to the mainland. <words>215</words> By dawn, it would be exposed for exactly three hours. <words>225</words> He thought of his grandfather, another guardian who had spent sixty years pacing these same stone walls, watching others come and go. <words>247</words> The old man had died staring at the horizon, whispering about distant mountains he'd never see. <words>263</words>

A new carving appeared on the oak as he passed: "Your mother escaped. <words>276</words> So can you." <words>279</words> His heart stuttered. <words>282</words> The guards never spoke of those who fled their painted destinies, but now he understood why his mother's portrait had been removed from the Hall of Guardians. <words>309</words>

That night, as fellow initiates celebrated their assignments, Matthias prepared. <words>319</words> He packed light—just bread, water, and the precious phial. <words>329</words> The sour smell had become oddly comforting, a promise of transformation. <words>340</words> When the ceremony bell tolled at dawn, he stood with the others, outwardly calm but inwardly wild with hope. <words>359</words>

The elder approached with the golden paint, and Matthias felt the weight of centuries pressing down. <words>375</words> But as the brush neared his skin, he thought of mountains and freedom and the mysterious ally who carved hope into bark. <words>397</words> His hand found the phial. <words>402</words> Tomorrow's tide would carry him away from everything he'd known, toward a fate he would choose himself. <words>419</words> The melancholy of leaving battled with hope as his fingers tightened around the cork, ready to yank it free. <words>438</words>
