The Probability Mapping Center hummed with quantum calculations, its walls lined with temporal charts spanning millennia. <words>16</words> Mira, the peculiar collector of abandoned potentials, sat infuriatingly calm before the piano bench that had materialized from Timeline-7834. <words>35</words> Her fingers traced the arrangement of keys left behind—not musical keys, but the kind that unlock doors between what was and what could have been. <words>60</words>

She held an old pencil stub, worn down to barely an inch, its graphite core exposed like a nerve. <words>79</words> This wasn't just any pencil—it had sketched Mozart's unfinished requiem, drafted Tesla's lost inventions, outlined poems that would have changed hearts across centuries. <words>103</words> Each mark it had made represented buried talents, gifts that circumstance or cowardice had kept underground. <words>119</words>

The Center's algorithms had detected a convergence point approaching—a moment when all abandoned possibilities would either bloom or wither forever. <words>139</words> Mira had collected these fragments of unrealized genius for three thousand years, waiting for this precise temporal intersection. <words>157</words> Now, she needed to decode the key arrangement before the probability waves collapsed. <words>171</words>

Seven brass keys, three silver, one carved from bone. <words>180</words> She began to tweak their positions with methodical precision, each adjustment sending ripples through the timestream monitors. <words>197</words> The bone key—that was Beethoven's, left after his final symphony remained unwritten. <words>209</words> The smallest brass one belonged to a nameless girl from ancient Mesopotamia whose mathematical theorems could have advanced civilization by centuries. <words>231</words>

As Mira worked, her fractured grace became apparent—she moved like a dancer with broken wings, beautiful in her damaged determination. <words>251</words> The pencil stub grew warm in her pocket, resonating with each correctly placed key. <words>266</words> She understood now why she'd remained infuriatingly calm through epochs of watching genius die unborn. <words>282</words> This was her final stand, not against an enemy, but against the universe's tendency to waste its own gifts. <words>301</words>

The last key clicked into place—a small iron one that had belonged to a slave who'd invented a new form of mathematics in secret. <words>326</words> The piano bench began to glow, and suddenly Mira could see them all: the artists, inventors, poets, and dreamers whose talents had been buried by fear, oppression, or simple bad timing. <words>358</words> The pencil stub dissolved into light, its graphite becoming a bridge between what was lost and what could still be found. <words>379</words>

The Probability Mapping Center's screens exploded with new timelines—branches where buried talents bloomed like desert flowers after rain. <words>397</words> Mira smiled as she faded, her collection finally serving its purpose, her own peculiar talent for patient preservation having changed the shape of eternity itself. <words>422</words> Across millennia, sleeping gifts began to wake. <words>428</words>
