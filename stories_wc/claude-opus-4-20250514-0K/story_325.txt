Dr. Evangeline Thorpe adjusted her worn-out leather belt, its cracked surface matching the weathered wood of the high altitude tea house where she'd arranged this peculiar meeting. <words>24</words> The mad botanist's carnivorous plants writhed in their portable terrariums, sensing the thin mountain air through their sealed containers. <words>43</words>

"You have the film?" she asked, her tone comically serious despite addressing a Venus flytrap named Gerald. <words>60</words>

The tea house proprietor, Mr. Chen, emerged during intermission of the traditional shadow puppet show downstairs. <words>76</words> His loyalty was fickle—last week he'd sold information to her rival, but today he needed her expertise. <words>94</words>

"The unexplained phenomena began three nights ago," Chen whispered, producing an antique film reel. <words>108</words> "Patrons report seeing ancient pathways appearing in the walls, glowing like bioluminescent roots." <words>121</words>

Evangeline's plants grew agitated. <words>125</words> She'd spent decades searching for these legendary routes—underground networks that allegedly connected sacred botanical sites across continents. <words>142</words> Her fingers trembled as she held the black-and-white film to the lamplight. <words>155</words>

"The hidden sections," Chen continued, "only appear when the film ionizes the air during projection." <words>171</words> He glanced nervously at her pitcher plants, which seemed to lean toward him with predatory interest. <words>188</words>

"Fascinating," Evangeline muttered, threading the film through her modified projector. <words>198</words> The device hummed, releasing charged particles that made her hair stand on end. <words>212</words> As the grainy images flickered across the tea house wall, something extraordinary occurred. <words>226</words>

Between frames, luminous mycorrhizal networks materialized—ancient pathways pulsing with botanical memory. <words>237</words> Her carnivorous plants began singing, a subsonic vibration that made the teacups rattle. <words>251</words> The worn-out leather belt around her waist grew warm, an heirloom from her grandmother who'd first theorized about these hidden routes. <words>273</words>

"They're real," she breathed, watching the pathways branch across continents like phantom root systems. <words>288</words> The unexplained phenomena wasn't supernatural—it was botanical archaeology encoded in celluloid. <words>299</words>

Chen stepped backward, clearly reconsidering his allegiances as Evangeline's sundews unfurled with suspicious timing. <words>313</words> "Our arrangement?" he ventured. <words>317</words>

"Your fickle loyalty has served its purpose," she replied, carefully rewinding the film. <words>330</words> "But these ancient pathways belong to no one." <words>338</words> She gathered her plants, their leaves rustling with satisfaction. <words>347</words> The high altitude tea house had revealed its secret during a simple intermission, but the journey ahead would require more than comically serious dedication. <words>372</words>

As she descended the mountain, the ionized air still crackling around her, Evangeline knew her carnivorous companions would help her trace every glowing thread of the botanical network that connected the world's forgotten gardens. <words>406</words> The mad botanist had found her map at last. <words>415</words>
