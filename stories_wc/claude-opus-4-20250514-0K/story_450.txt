Marina's fingers traced the scorched patch from the Endeavor VII, her grandmother's final mission before the accident that changed everything. <words>17</words> The thought experiment chamber hummed around her, its chrome walls reflecting infinite versions of herself—each dancing, each denying. <words>35</words>

"Bubble bath time," the automated voice announced, flooding the chamber with lavender-scented foam that rose to her waist. <words>53</words> This daily ritual was supposed to help process trauma, but Marina had twisted it into something else entirely. <words>71</words>

She began to move, her body speaking the truths her clumsy tongue could never articulate. <words>86</words> Words had always betrayed her—consonants tumbling over themselves, meanings dissolving before they reached her lips. <words>101</words> But dance? <words>103</words> Dance was her native language, the only way she could mimic the conversations happening in her head. <words>120</words>

The patch felt heavy in her palm, heavier than denial itself. <words>131</words> Grandmother had prophesied this moment before launching: "When the bubbles rise and memories dance, you'll know what must be done." <words>152</words> Marina had spent years interpreting those words, refusing to accept their simplest meaning. <words>165</words>

The chamber's walls flickered, displaying the family's yearly photos—a tradition that mapped their slow unraveling. <words>180</words> 2157: everyone smiling, Grandmother center-stage. <words>185</words> 2158: the empty space where she should have stood. <words>194</words> 2159: forced grins barely concealing the fractures. <words>201</words> Each year after, they'd gathered, pretending the void wasn't consuming them. <words>212</words>

Marina's movements grew sharper, angrier. <words>217</words> The prophecy wasn't about healing or closure—she understood that now. <words>227</words> It was about admission. <words>231</words> The patch wasn't just debris; it was evidence. <words>239</words> Evidence that Grandmother had sabotaged her own mission, choosing the vastness of space over the suffocation of family expectations. <words>258</words>

The bubbles rose higher, and Marina's dance became a conversation with ghosts. <words>270</words> Her body screamed what her voice couldn't: "You left us!" <words>280</words> "You chose escape!" <words>283</words> "We were never enough!" <words>287</words>

But as the foam reached her shoulders, another truth emerged through her movements. <words>300</words> The yearly photos hadn't documented their decay—they'd documented their survival. <words>310</words> They'd gathered despite the pain, honoring a tradition even when its creator had abandoned them. <words>326</words>

The prophecy's twist revealed itself in Marina's final leap. <words>335</words> She wasn't meant to expose the truth or seek revenge. <words>345</words> She was meant to mimic Grandmother's choice—but inversely. <words>353</words> Where Grandmother had chosen distance, Marina would choose proximity. <words>362</words> Where denial had reigned, acceptance would bloom. <words>369</words>

As bubbles burst against the ceiling, Marina clutched the patch and whispered her first clear words in years: "I forgive you." <words>390</words> The chamber's walls dissolved, revealing her waiting family. <words>398</words> This year's photo would be different. <words>404</words> This year, they'd acknowledge the empty space while celebrating those who remained. <words>416</words>
