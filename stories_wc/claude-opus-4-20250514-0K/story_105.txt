The outcast scholar pressed her palm against the cold tile, feeling for the loose edge she'd discovered months ago in the witch's flying carpet garage restroom. <words>20</words> Behind it lay dozens of diaries, each one documenting another soul who'd stumbled into this liminal space between worlds. <words>38</words> In the hush of a half-lit corridor just beyond the door, she could hear the carpets rustling like restless birds. <words>58</words>

Her fingers found the seashell she'd been carrying, its strange symbol pulsing with warmth against her skin. <words>75</words> The symbol matched one drawn obsessively throughout the diaries—a spiral that seemed to turn inward and outward simultaneously. <words>93</words> Each writer had described the same phenomenon: how touching the shell revealed their truest self, mirroring the soul in ways both beautiful and terrible. <words>117</words>

A jolt of recognition shot through her as she read the latest entry. <words>130</words> The handwriting was her own, though she had no memory of writing it. <words>143</words> "I am strangely trustworthy," it began, "because I have learned to trust the darkness within myself." <words>159</words> The words continued, describing how she'd discovered that midnight only lasts so long—that even the deepest shadows must eventually yield to dawn. <words>182</words>

She flipped through more pages with trembling hands, her breath coming in sharp gasps that somehow felt peaceful. <words>200</words> This frantic peace, she realized, was what all the diary writers had experienced. <words>213</words> They'd each been scholars, outcasts, seekers who'd found their way to this garage where witches stored their flying carpets between journeys. <words>235</words>

The shell grew warmer, and suddenly she understood. <words>243</words> The garage wasn't just a storage space—it was a waystation for souls in transition. <words>257</words> The carpets weren't merely transportation; they were vessels that carried people through their own internal landscapes. <words>273</words> And the diaries weren't just records; they were maps left by travelers who'd learned to navigate their own depths. <words>292</words>

She pulled out a fresh notebook and began to write, adding her story to the collection. <words>308</words> "To those who come after," she wrote, "know that the symbol on the shell is a mirror turned inside out." <words>328</words> "It shows not what you appear to be, but what you truly are beneath all pretense." <words>344</words> "Trust it, even when it reveals what frightens you." <words>353</words> "Especially then." <words>355</words>

As she tucked the diary behind the tile, a carpet drifted into the restroom, hovering expectantly. <words>371</words> She climbed aboard, clutching the shell, ready to prove her theory about midnight's impermanence. <words>385</words> The carpet lifted, carrying her through the half-lit corridor and into a sky where stars were already yielding to the first blush of dawn. <words>409</words> In that moment of frantic peace, she finally understood: every soul's darkness was merely waiting for its sunrise. <words>427</words>
