The renegade matchmaker drifted between channels of static, her fingers tracing the colorless plastic button sewn to her collar. <words>19</words> In the floating library's observation deck, she watched Earth shrink below the zeppelin's silver belly. <words>34</words> She had abandoned her traditional trade of pairing hearts for a more ambitious calling: matching souls across star systems. <words>53</words>

The button had arrived yesterday in a package marked only with coordinates. <words>66</words> Complicatedly simple in its design, it bore microscopic etchings that shifted when tilted toward distant constellations. <words>82</words> She knew it was the key to deciphering the interstellar secret that had haunted her dreams. <words>98</words>

"Every person carries untold stories," she murmured, pressing the button against the window. <words>111</words> The library's ancient books rustled in response, their pages whispering of lovers separated by light-years. <words>127</words> She had collected these accounts during her exile from the Matchmaker's Guild, each one a thread in the cosmic tapestry she was weaving. <words>151</words>

Outside, a flag bearing the library's insignia rippled in the high-altitude wind. <words>164</words> With each wave of the fabric, she felt time fold and unfold, revealing glimpses of other channels—parallel dimensions where different choices had been made. <words>189</words> In one, she remained earthbound, arranging suburban marriages. <words>197</words> In another, she had never discovered the button at all. <words>207</words>

But here, suspended between sky and space, she lamented the matches that might never be. <words>223</words> The button grew warm in her palm, responding to her sorrow with sharp gentleness, like a needle threading hope through despair. <words>245</words> It projected holographic star maps across the curved ceiling, showing pathways between worlds where compatible souls unknowingly yearned for each other. <words>267</words>

She had been naive to think love obeyed planetary boundaries. <words>277</words> The universe itself was a vast dating algorithm, and she had stumbled upon its source code. <words>294</words> The Guild had cast her out for suggesting off-world pairings, calling her methods too radical, too dangerous. <words>312</words> They couldn't comprehend that some hearts were meant to beat in different gravities. <words>325</words>

As the zeppelin crossed into the mesosphere, the button finally revealed its secret. <words>339</words> Not coordinates to a place, but to a moment—a convergence point where all channels aligned. <words>355</words> There, she could broadcast her collected love stories across the cosmos, letting them find their intended recipients like messages in infinite bottles. <words>379</words>

She smiled, understanding at last why the universe had chosen a renegade for this task. <words>395</words> Only someone already untethered from convention could unite the untethered hearts scattered among the stars. <words>410</words> The button dissolved into light, becoming part of her, and she began her true work. <words>426</words>
