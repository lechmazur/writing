Mira wiped down the bar with practiced indifference, her collection of seashells rattling in her apron pocket—broken pieces she'd gathered from dreams that washed up like flotsam. <words>24</words> The vacuum chamber garden behind The Last Light Tavern hummed with impossible life, where plants grew in airless splendor and time itself grew confused. <words>48</words>

She'd worked here seventeen years, or perhaps negative three, depending on how you counted when the sands flowed backward. <words>67</words> The fossilized footprints in the dried riverbed out back led somewhere else entirely—she'd discovered them last week while dumping stale ale. <words>88</words> Or next week. <words>91</words> Time was predictably unpredictable here. <words>96</words>

"Another round," croaked the regular in the corner, his face a map of temporal wrinkles. <words>111</words>

Mira poured, but her mind wandered to those ancient impressions in stone. <words>123</words> They called to her with the weight of inescapable callings, like gravity pulling at her bones. <words>139</words> She'd tried ignoring them, tried focusing on her mundane work, but destiny was a persistent drunk who wouldn't leave at closing time. <words>162</words>

That night, she randomized her routine—left foot first instead of right, counterclockwise bar wipes, pouring bottom-shelf whiskey into top-shelf bottles. <words>182</words> Small rebellions against the predetermined. <words>187</words> But the footprints still sang their fossil song. <words>195</words>

"You hear it too," said the regular, suddenly clear-eyed. <words>204</words> "The path that leads backward to go forward." <words>212</words>

Mira's shells clicked like broken teeth. <words>218</words> "I'm just a tavern-hand." <words>222</words>

"Were," he corrected with flippant solemnity. <words>228</words> "Will be. <words>230</words> The garden knows better." <words>234</words>

She followed the footprints at midnight, or noon—hard to tell when time flowed upstream. <words>248</words> Each fossilized step led deeper into the vacuum chamber garden, where roses bloomed in reverse and memories grew like weeds. <words>268</words> The shells in her pocket began to sing, their broken edges harmonizing with the soundless space. <words>284</words>

At the garden's heart stood a door made of crystallized time. <words>295</words> Mira touched it, and her imagination catapulted beyond known realms—she saw herself as bartender to gods, serving drinks that hadn't been invented yet, polishing glasses that reflected futures past. <words>323</words> She saw the shells whole again, singing stories of seas that would dry up yesterday. <words>338</words>

The calling wasn't to leave her life behind but to serve it differently—predictably unpredictable, like time itself in this place where physics went to drink. <words>363</words> She returned to the tavern transformed, still scrappy, still wiping tables, but now she poured possibility itself into every glass. <words>383</words>

The regular raised his drink in salute. <words>390</words> "Welcome to the real job, tavern-hand." <words>396</words>

Mira grinned, shells singing in her pocket. <words>403</words> Tomorrow, she'd walk those footprints again. <words>409</words> Or yesterday. <words>411</words> Time would tell, backward as always. <words>417</words>
