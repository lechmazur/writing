Ezra maintained seventeen separate identities across the station's social networks, each one meticulously crafted to appear genuine while remaining utterly hollow. <words>17</words> Living in a converted maintenance shaft behind the nebula observation deck, he sold customized personality algorithms to those desperate to fit in. <words>38</words> His fingers worked the broken zipper pull that served as his shop's doorbell, its metallic scraping announcing another client seeking manufactured authenticity. <words>60</words>

"I need to be more spontaneous," whispered the customer, a middle manager whose regulation jumpsuit bore exactly three approved accessories. <words>80</words>

Ezra nodded gravely, pulling up holographic displays of local folklore from the station's founding days. <words>95</words> "The original colonists believed the nebula sang different songs to each listener," he intoned, highlighting contradictions between various accounts. <words>114</words> "Some heard warnings, others promises, yet all claimed to hear the same frequency." <words>127</words>

The customer shifted uncomfortably. <words>131</words> "What does that have to do with—"

"Everything." <words>138</words> Ezra's fingers danced across his console, propagating code fragments through nested subroutines. <words>150</words> "True spontaneity emerges from embracing contradictions, not downloading responses." <words>159</words>

Through the observation deck's transparent aluminum walls, the nebula pulsed with colors that had no names in any human language. <words>179</words> Ezra had spent years here, listening to the hush of unspoken promises between the stars, learning that isolation could be more honest than connection. <words>203</words>

"Your algorithm," he continued, "will generate responses that feel personal to others while keeping you impersonally distant." <words>220</words> He demonstrated on his screen: conversations that seemed intimate but revealed nothing, jokes that appeared spontaneous but followed rigid patterns. <words>241</words>

The customer's eyes widened. <words>245</words> "That's not what I wanted—"

"No," Ezra agreed, yanking the broken zipper pull to seal his shop. <words>258</words> "But it's what everyone buys." <words>263</words>

As the customer left, Ezra returned to his true work: documenting how each folklore contradiction revealed cracks in the station's mandatory harmony. <words>285</words> Every legend spoke of individuals who heard the nebula's true song and chose exile over conformity. <words>301</words> He was propagating these stories through hidden channels, planting seeds of doubt in perfectly ordered minds. <words>317</words>

The broken zipper pull caught starlight, transforming into something almost beautiful. <words>328</words> Ezra had salvaged it from his old uniform, the day he'd walked away from his assigned role as Social Cohesion Officer. <words>349</words> Now he sold fake personalities to fund his real mission: helping others forge paths toward genuine solitude. <words>366</words>

Outside, the nebula swirled with ancient indifference, its silence more eloquent than any algorithm could capture. <words>382</words> Ezra smiled, knowing that tomorrow another seeker would arrive, and perhaps this time, he'd tell them the truth: freedom meant accepting that some connections were meant to be broken. <words>412</words>
