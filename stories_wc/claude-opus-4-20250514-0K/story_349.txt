Marcus gripped the dried herb bundle, its lavender and sage scent cutting through the acrid smoke of burnt timber below. <words>17</words> The abandoned observatory perched on the cliff's edge had become his refuge since the drone he'd been piloting somehow crossed into this medieval realm three months ago. <words>44</words> Through the cracked dome, he watched the orchard in the valley—tomorrow's scheduled burning would claim those ancient trees, the local lord's punishment for harboring refugees. <words>69</words>

The hush before destruction always felt heaviest. <words>76</words>

"Next pairing!" called the matchmaker, her voice echoing off stone walls. <words>87</words> Marcus almost laughed at the absurdity—a speed dating event in a dying world, organized by desperate villagers hoping to preserve bloodlines before war consumed everything. <words>112</words> He'd agreed to participate only to disseminate his plan among potential allies. <words>124</words>

A woman in patched robes sat across from him, her eyes reflecting the same cynically hopeful gleam he'd developed—that peculiar mix of expecting nothing while secretly praying for everything. <words>153</words>

"You're the sky-watcher," she said. <words>158</words> "The one who claims to see beyond our horizons of mercy." <words>169</words>

"I've seen worlds without lords who burn orchards," Marcus replied, crushing herbs between his fingers. <words>185</words> "Where mercy extends past noble whims." <words>191</words>

She leaned forward. <words>194</words> "The refugees need those fruit stores for winter." <words>202</words>

"I know." <words>204</words> He'd spent weeks calculating drone specifications, trying to rebuild his tech from memory and scavenged materials. <words>220</words> "What if I told you we could lure possibility from the brink of despair?" <words>234</words>

"Five minutes!" the matchmaker announced. <words>239</words>

Marcus spoke quickly, outlining his plan—use the observatory's remaining lenses to create a signaling system, coordinate the refugees' escape while the lord's men watched the burning. <words>265</words> His drone knowledge could map safe routes through mountains others deemed impassable. <words>277</words>

"You're mad," she whispered, but her hand covered his. <words>286</words> "Beautifully mad." <words>288</words>

"Will you help?" <words>291</words>

She tucked the herb bundle into her sleeve—their signal to others who'd join them. <words>306</words> "We have until dawn." <words>310</words>

As pairs rotated again, Marcus felt that charred serenity settle over him—the peace that comes after accepting that some worlds must burn for others to grow. <words>337</words> By midnight, he'd recruited twelve allies through carefully coded conversations, each carrying herbs to mark safe houses. <words>354</words>

The observatory filled with whispered preparations as the orchard waited below, its trees standing like soldiers before execution. <words>372</words> Marcus touched the cold telescope, remembering Earth's horizons, then turned to his new companions. <words>386</words> Sometimes mercy meant teaching others to fly before the ground burned beneath them. <words>399</words> Tomorrow, while smoke filled the valley, they would shepherd hundreds through passages mapped by a pilot who'd learned that hope could be both cynical and necessary, like dried herbs preserving summer's memory through winter's darkest days. <words>436</words>
