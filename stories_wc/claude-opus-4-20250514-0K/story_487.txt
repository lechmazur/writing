The greenhouse labyrinth hummed with carnivorous whispers as Brutus, all seven feet of docile muscle, cradled the conductor's baton like a newborn. <words>20</words> His massive hands, scarred from years of enforced violence, trembled with disturbingly calm precision as he studied the shredded treasure map he'd discovered beneath the conservatory's rotting floorboards. <words>47</words>

"Non capisco," muttered the Italian groundskeeper, watching Brutus piece together fragments that supposedly led to the baton's true power—raising the dead. <words>69</words> Brutus couldn't explain in the man's language that he needed this, needed to transform himself from hired muscle to mythmaker. <words>89</words>

The drum solos from the jazz festival outside penetrated the glass walls, each beat matching Brutus's methodical movements as he navigated between Venus flytraps the size of armchairs. <words>117</words> He'd spent months learning their feeding schedules, their languages of hunger, becoming fluent in survival where words failed him. <words>137</words>

"Attention!" screamed a French botanist, but Brutus had already twisted away from a lunging pitcher plant, his body moving with ballet-like grace that contradicted his brutish frame. <words>165</words> The map's pieces revealed a path through the verdant maze, past the German-labeled specimens and Japanese warning signs he couldn't read but understood through instinct. <words>191</words>

His employer had hired him to retrieve the baton, believing only in its monetary value, but Brutus saw more—a chance to conduct his own resurrection. <words>217</words> Each nationality of plant seemed to sing in its own tongue as he passed, a botanical babel that somehow made perfect sense to someone who'd always been dismissed as dumb muscle. <words>249</words>

The drums crescendoed as Brutus reached the labyrinth's heart, where the map's final piece revealed not just a location but a ritual. <words>272</words> He raised the baton with disturbing calm, and the plants responded, their deadly mouths opening in silent screams that transcended language. <words>294</words>

"Impossibile," gasped the groundskeeper, having followed despite the danger, as vines began to twist and writhe. <words>310</words>

But Brutus conducted with brash tenderness, each movement deliberate yet gentle, and slowly the plants' victims began to emerge—not as corpses but as compost transformed into new growth. <words>339</words> He wasn't raising the dead; he was showing that death itself was just another language, another transformation in the eternal conversation between violence and creation. <words>365</words>

The jazz drums faded as Brutus lowered the baton, surrounded by impossible blooms that shouldn't exist, couldn't exist, yet did. <words>386</words> He'd molded his myth from the mud of reality, proving that even a bruiser could conduct symphonies of resurrection when given the right instrument and the courage to twist expectations. <words>417</words>

The groundskeeper finally understood without words: some languages are written in actions, not alphabets. <words>432</words>

Brutus smiled, tucking the baton away, his life's violent opus complete. <words>443</words>
