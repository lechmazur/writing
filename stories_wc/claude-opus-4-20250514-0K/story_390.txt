In the jade-scented corridors of the Forbidden City, Li Wei pressed dried chrysanthemums between sheets of rice paper, each petal whispering of futures he'd rather not fulfill. <words>24</words> The calm assassin had developed an unusual habit: preserving flowers in his botanical press while waiting for his targets to arrive. <words>44</words> His latest assignment involved the Emperor's fortune-teller, who had prophesied that "death would come wearing the pattern of a butterfly's wings." <words>66</words> Li Wei found this figuratively literal prediction amusing – he actually wore silk robes embroidered with butterflies, a gift from his grandmother. <words>88</words>

The palace hummed with whispers of longing as servants gossiped about the prophecy, each interpreting it differently. <words>105</words> Some believed actual butterflies would herald doom; others thought it meant death would flutter in unexpectedly. <words>121</words> Li Wei knew better – prophecies were merely ingredients waiting to be amalgamated into something more palatable. <words>138</words>

He studied his botanical press, where yesterday's peony had left an imprint shaped remarkably like wings. <words>154</words> "How convenient," he muttered, carefully arranging lotus petals in the exact pattern of the Monarch butterfly adorning his sleeve. <words>173</words> The fortune-teller would arrive soon, before the first question is asked at dawn's meditation. <words>188</words>

What the palace didn't know was that Li Wei had been hired not to kill, but to spin a prophecy into raw possibility. <words>211</words> The Emperor, terrified of his own fortune-teller's predictions, wanted them... reinterpreted. <words>222</words> Li Wei's method involved creating pressed flower arrangements that would "accidentally" fall from the fortune-teller's sleeves during readings. <words>241</words> When interpreted, these botanical butterflies would transform dire predictions into fortune cookie wisdom. <words>254</words>

The fortune-teller entered, eyeing Li Wei suspiciously. <words>261</words> "You're the assassin who kills with kindness?" <words>268</words> she asked, noting his flower-pressing station. <words>274</words>

"I prefer 'narrative restructuring specialist,'" Li Wei replied, offering her tea infused with pressed jasmine. <words>289</words> "Your butterfly prophecy needs work – too doom-and-gloom for the Emperor's delicate constitution." <words>302</words>

She laughed nervously. <words>304</words> "And you'll fix this by playing with flowers?" <words>312</words>

"By the pattern of a butterfly's wings," he corrected, showing her his latest creation. <words>326</words> "See? <words>327</words> When pressed correctly, these petals predict 'transformation' instead of 'termination.'" <words>336</words> He demonstrated how the arrangement could fall naturally during her dramatic gestures. <words>348</words>

Together, they spent the night amalgamating botanical prophecies, each one more ridiculously optimistic than the last. <words>364</words> The fortune-teller discovered that pressed flowers spoke louder than crystal balls, especially when arranged by an assassin who'd rather press petals than pressure points. <words>389</words>

By dawn, they'd created an entire language of floral prophecy, turning whispers of longing into blooms of possibility. <words>407</words> The Emperor would receive his reading, none the wiser that his death had been postponed indefinitely by a botanical butterfly effect. <words>429</words>

Li Wei smiled as the fortune-teller left, her sleeves rustling with hidden petals. <words>443</words> Sometimes the best assassination was the one that never happened, replaced instead by the gentle art of pressing flowers into fate. <words>465</words>
