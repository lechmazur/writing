The carnival had been dead for years, but Murphy still polished glasses behind the makeshift bar he'd built inside the old ticket booth. <words>20</words> His worn wallet sat open on the counter, displaying a photograph that flickered between different faces—sometimes a woman, sometimes a child, sometimes nothing at all. <words>44</words>

"Another reality bleeding through," he'd drone to anyone who'd listen, his voice carrying that abrasively charming quality of someone who'd seen too much to care about social niceties. <words>72</words> The transient realities had started when the carnival closed, when the laughter died and left only echoes that didn't match any memory. <words>94</words>

Outside, the broken payphone booth stood like a confessional for the lost. <words>106</words> Murphy had discovered that between 11:59 and midnight, when the world held its breath in that peculiar hush where truces form without words, the phone would ring. <words>134</words> Not for incoming calls—but outgoing confessions from other whens, other wheres. <words>145</words>

"I killed her in timeline seven," a voice had whispered last Tuesday. <words>157</words> "But she's still serving coffee at the diner in timeline twelve." <words>168</words>

Murphy poured himself another whiskey, the amber liquid shifting colors in the unstable light. <words>182</words> Each confession he overheard taught him more about the fractures, about how the carnival's closure had torn something fundamental in the fabric of here and now. <words>208</words>

The photograph in his wallet changed again—this time showing the carnival in its glory days, himself younger, standing next to a fortune teller's tent that had never existed in this reality. <words>240</words> Or had it? <words>243</words> The boundaries grew thinner each night. <words>249</words>

"The midnight took her," he'd tell patrons who materialized from the fog, some solid, some translucent, all thirsty for something stronger than alcohol. <words>272</words> "Swallowed her whole when the last carousel horse stopped spinning." <words>282</words> They'd nod with enigmatic familiarity, as if they'd heard this story before, or would hear it tomorrow, or were living it right now in another skin. <words>308</words>

Murphy's quest was simple: reclaim the light that midnight had stolen. <words>319</words> Not metaphorical light—the actual luminescence that had made the carnival magical, that had kept the realities properly sorted and labeled. <words>339</words> The confessions from the payphone gave him clues, each overheard secret a breadcrumb leading back to when things were whole. <words>359</words>

Tonight, as the clock approached that liminal moment, Murphy closed the worn wallet and walked to the phone booth. <words>378</words> The receiver was already warm against his ear, and through the static came his own voice, confessing from another reality: "I know where she hid the light." <words>406</words> The carnival lights flickered once, casting shadows that belonged to no earthly geometry, and Murphy smiled his first genuine smile in years. <words>429</words> Tomorrow, or yesterday, or in the eternal now of midnight's pause, he would finally bring her home. <words>446</words>
