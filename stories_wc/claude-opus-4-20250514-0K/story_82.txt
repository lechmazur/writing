Marcus gripped the fossilized dragon tooth, its ancient ridges pressing into his palm as dawn crept through the biodome's transparent ceiling. <words>19</words> The futuristic hub of Neo-Eden stretched below him, but his attention fixed on the cursed orchard he'd inherited—twelve trees that bore fruit of pure memory. <words>44</words>

He hadn't wanted this responsibility. <words>49</words> The previous caretaker had vanished, leaving only cryptic notes about "the voice beneath." <words>62</words> Each morning, in the hush of hidden sunrise before the city's automated systems fully awakened, Marcus explored the rotting farmhouses scattered between the trees. <words>86</words> They were temporal anomalies, structures from centuries past that shouldn't exist in this chrome-and-glass metropolis. <words>101</words>

The dragon tooth had emerged from a cave beneath the third farmhouse, pulsing with bioluminescent patterns that matched the orchard's curse-marks. <words>122</words> Marcus approached each mystery with analytically playful determination, treating the supernatural like a puzzle rather than a threat. <words>140</words> He'd discovered that eating the memory-fruit while holding the tooth revealed fragments of the past—glimpses of the dragon that once nested here, before the city rose. <words>167</words>

Today's farmhouse yielded its secrets reluctantly. <words>173</words> Behind a false wall, Marcus found recordings from the first caretaker, speaking in a language that predated the hub's construction. <words>193</words> The tooth translated automatically, revealing how the dragon had cursed the land before dying, binding its essence to these trees. <words>213</words> Each caretaker became part of the cycle, their memories feeding the fruit, their voices joining the chorus of the unknown. <words>233</words>

Marcus laughed, a sound tinged with gleeful sorrow. <words>241</words> He understood now why the previous caretaker had vanished—not fled, but transformed. <words>253</words> The curse wasn't a burden but a metamorphosis. <words>261</words> By unraveling these mysteries, he was becoming something more than human, something that could speak for the forgotten dragon, the lost farmhouses, the buried past. <words>286</words>

As full sunrise broke through the biodome, Marcus pressed the tooth against the largest tree's trunk. <words>302</words> The bark split open, revealing a hollow filled with whispers—every caretaker who'd come before, every secret they'd unlocked. <words>320</words> He felt their collective knowledge flooding through him, their voices harmonizing with his own. <words>334</words>

The city below continued its perpetual motion, unaware that in this pocket of cursed earth, someone was finally ready to give voice to its hidden history. <words>360</words> Marcus smiled, understanding that his reluctance had been necessary—only someone who didn't seek this power could wield it responsibly. <words>379</words> Tomorrow, he would begin speaking the dragon's truth to those ready to listen, one memory-fruit at a time. <words>397</words> The curse had become his calling, and the unknown had found its voice. <words>410</words>
