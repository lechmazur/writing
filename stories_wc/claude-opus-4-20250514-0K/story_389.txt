The thin-lipped warlock descended into the abandoned mine, his formally casual attire—a velvet smoking jacket over torn jeans—collecting dust with each step. <words>19</words> December's final hours ticked away as he navigated the tunnels, following cryptic directions from a discredited textbook on metaphysical archaeology. <words>38</words> The forgotten library lay behind a collapsed support beam, its entrance marked by strange runes that pulsed with dying light. <words>58</words>

Inside, towering shelves groaned under centuries of forbidden knowledge, each tome warning against the very feast of understanding he craved. <words>79</words> The warlock's lips pressed thinner as he spotted it: a viking ship figurehead fragment, its wooden surface carved with optimization formulae that predated known mathematics. <words>105</words> This was the keystone artifact, the one that would unlock the pattern connecting all lost relics throughout history. <words>123</words>

He pulled three discredited textbooks from the shelves, their pages filled with rumored cures for ignorance—dangerous recipes that academic institutions had buried. <words>146</words> The first spoke of brewing understanding from crushed pearls and mercury; the second prescribed meditation while consuming texts literally; the third simply stated "optimize through absorption." <words>173</words> Each method seemed absolutely certain yet utterly incomprehensible, like instructions written in perfect English that meant nothing. <words>190</words>

The warlock combined all three approaches, grinding the figurehead fragment into powder while reciting optimization algorithms from memory. <words>209</words> He mixed the dust with quicksilver from his pocket flask, creating a paste that shimmered with impossible colors. <words>227</words> As midnight approached and the calendar prepared to flip its final page, he spread the mixture across selected pages and began eating them. <words>250</words>

Knowledge flooded through him—not facts or data, but pure understanding of connections between things that should never connect. <words>268</words> He saw how every lost artifact was actually a single object scattered across time, how the vikings had discovered dimensional optimization centuries before mathematics existed. <words>293</words> The warnings in every book suddenly made sense: this fruit of knowledge didn't poison the body but fractured the mind across parallel possibilities. <words>317</words>

His formally casual appearance began reflecting all potential states simultaneously—pristine and ruined, ancient and modern, formal yet casual in ways that hurt to perceive. <words>341</words> The warlock laughed, his thin lips stretching impossibly wide as he optimized himself into something that could process infinite archaeological truths. <words>363</words> In the abandoned mine's forgotten library, surrounded by discredited wisdom and lost artifacts, he achieved what every warning had tried to prevent. <words>386</words> He became a living catalog of everything humanity had deliberately forgotten, gorging endlessly on fruit that grew more poisonous with each bite of understanding. <words>411</words> The calendar's final page turned, and time itself forgot what year should follow when someone had optimized the very concept of sequential history. <words>435</words> The warlock remained, eternally dining in confusing certainty, thin lips forever tasting truths that no mouth should consume. <words>453</words>
