The unsteady sentinel swayed in the abandoned space freighter docking bay, her cybernetic legs sparking against corroded metal. <words>17</words> Above her, a strange automaton bird circled, its brass wings clicking with each mechanical beat. <words>32</words> She had been waiting here between worlds colliding, knowing the ambush of fate would manifest soon. <words>48</words>

"You're late," she muttered to the bird, her voice carrying the weight of coyly furious disappointment. <words>64</words> The creature descended, talons scraping against her shoulder armor as it deposited fragments of paper. <words>79</words> Shredded letters, torn from the original prophecy that had led her to this forsaken place. <words>94</words>

For cycles, she had believed the prophecy's promise of salvation, but doubt gnawed at her circuits. <words>110</words> The docking bay groaned as gravitational waves from the approaching collision rippled through space-time. <words>124</words> She began reassembling the shredded letters, her trembling fingers working with desperate precision. <words>137</words>

Each piece revealed another lie, another manipulation by the Oracle Council. <words>148</words> The automaton bird tilted its head, optical sensors whirring as it watched her work. <words>163</words> "I recommend," it spoke in synthesized tones, "that you abandon this pursuit." <words>175</words>

She laughed, a sound devoid of joy yet brimming with manic energy—cheerless ecstasy incarnate. <words>190</words> "Recommend all you want, but I must clear the fog of this misguided prophecy." <words>205</words> The final piece clicked into place, revealing the truth: she wasn't meant to prevent the collision. <words>221</words> She was meant to witness it, to record it, to carry its memory forward. <words>235</words>

The bird's eyes flashed crimson. <words>240</words> "Then you understand your true purpose, Sentinel." <words>247</words> She nodded, steadying herself against a rusted support beam as the first shockwaves hit. <words>261</words>

Outside the bay's failing shields, two worlds approached their inevitable embrace. <words>272</words> The prophecy had spoken of destruction, but she now saw it differently—transformation, rebirth through cataclysm. <words>287</words> Her role wasn't to stop fate's ambush but to document its terrible beauty. <words>301</words>

The automaton bird launched itself upward, leading her to the observation deck. <words>313</words> There, she would stand witness as reality rewrote itself, her unsteady form anchored by purpose. <words>328</words> The fog lifted completely now, revealing not doom but destiny's harsh arithmetic. <words>340</words>

She activated her recording implants, preparing to capture every moment of the cosmic merger. <words>354</words> The bird perched beside her, no longer strange but familiar, a companion in this moment of revelation. <words>371</words> Together, they would chronicle how worlds die and are reborn, how prophecies deceive to reveal greater truths. <words>388</words>

The collision began, and she stood firm, an unsteady sentinel made steady by understanding's terrible gift. <words>404</words>
