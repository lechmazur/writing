Captain Vera Chen's morning jog through the abandoned Kepler-7 spaceport always ended the same way: standing on the flight deck, clutching her single chopstick like a divining rod, searching for the waterfall that haunted her dreams. <words>35</words>

The chopstick—survivor of a cargo run gone wrong—trembled in her grip as she jogged past rusted launch towers, its wood somehow attuned to water's hidden songs. <words>62</words>

"Abstractly physical," the fence on Titan-3 had called it when he'd sold her the contraband detection method. <words>79</words>

She'd laughed then, before the Confederacy seized her ship, before her partner vanished into the detention camps, before her heart staged its own revolt against hope. <words>105</words>

Now she ran these dawn circuits religiously, the chopstick pulling her forward, promising salvation in the form of cascading water on a world that hadn't seen rain in decades. <words>134</words>

The flight deck's cracked transparisteel dome revealed stars fading into artificial dawn, and Vera slowed her pace, breathing hard. <words>153</words>

She'd smuggled everything—weapons, refugees, forbidden texts—but never her own grief. <words>163</words>

That lived inside her chest, a contraband too precious to traffic. <words>174</words>

At the control station, she performed her ritual: boiling water in her thermos, steeping the black market tea, reading the leaves' patterns with desperate precision. <words>199</words>

Today's formation startled her—a perfect spiral, like water circling a drain, or perhaps emerging from hidden springs. <words>216</words>

The chopstick hummed against her palm, and suddenly she understood: the waterfall wasn't a place but a moment, a memorial to what the heart releases when it finally breaks free. <words>246</words>

She'd been searching outside when the cascade lived within—tears she'd never allowed herself, sorrow transformed into this relentless forward motion. <words>266</words>

"Chen, you magnificent fool," she whispered, her voice cutting through the empty deck with biting sincerity. <words>282</words>

The leaves had shown her truth in their swirling dance: every morning jog was a pilgrimage, every breath a rebellion against the weight that crushed lesser smugglers. <words>309</words>

She stood, pocketing the chopstick, and faced the viewport. <words>318</words>

Somewhere beyond those stars, her partner still lived—she could feel it in the wood's grain, in the tea's bitter prophecy. <words>338</words>

The waterfall she sought was the reunion itself, that rushing moment when separated streams converged again. <words>354</words>

Her heart's revolt had never been against hope but against accepting anything less than complete restoration. <words>370</words>

Vera began her jog back through the spaceport's bones, no longer searching but preparing. <words>384</words>

The chopstick pointed true north now—not toward hidden water but toward the rescue mission she'd been rehearsing for with every dawn run. <words>407</words>

Tomorrow, she'd steal a ship. <words>412</words>

Today, she'd finally found her waterfall: the courage pooling in her chest, ready to overflow. <words>427</words>

The tea leaves had memorialized this moment perfectly, their pattern already dissolving but its message eternal—the heart knows its own geography. <words>448</words>

She ran faster now, a smuggler carrying the most dangerous cargo of all: undaunted love. <words>464</words>
