Margot's fingers traced the ancient petroglyphs, her scuffed plastic comb tucked behind her ear like a cigarette. <words>16</words> The ruthless flower arranger had abandoned her Tokyo studio for this windswept Scottish moor, drawn by cryptic rock art that haunted her dreams. <words>39</words> 

"You feel it too," said the stranger who'd given her a lift, his voice cutting through the radio's folk ballad. <words>59</words> "The watcher's burden—knowing these stones hold answers we're meant to decode." <words>70</words>

Margot nodded, her intellectually spontaneous nature recognizing a kindred spirit. <words>80</words> Their conversation during the spontaneous road trip had meandered through quantum physics, medieval herbalism, and the mathematics of ikebana. <words>98</words> Now, standing in the mysterious stone circle, she understood why she'd accepted a ride from someone who introduced himself only as "Thursday." <words>120</words>

"The symbols distinguish themselves," she murmured, pulling out her comb to point at spiraling forms. <words>135</words> "See how they mirror the Fibonacci sequence I use in my arrangements?" <words>147</words>

Thursday laughed—a sound like wind chimes in a hurricane. <words>156</words> "Polite anarchy, that's what you practice. <words>162</words> Forcing nature into vases while honoring its chaos." <words>170</words>

The radio singer paused between verses, and in that pregnant silence, the stones seemed to hum. <words>186</words> Margot's eyes widened as the petroglyphs shifted, revealing layers beneath layers. <words>197</words> "They're instructions," she breathed. <words>201</words> "Not just art—they're showing us how to see." <words>209</words>

"The burden is knowing that seeing changes everything," Thursday said softly. <words>220</words> "Once you decode them, you become another watcher." <words>228</words>

Margot thought of her pristine studio, where she'd earned her ruthless reputation by creating arrangements that made grown collectors weep. <words>248</words> She'd stripped flowers of sentiment, revealing their mathematical bones. <words>257</words> But here, surrounded by stones older than memory, she felt the weight of something greater. <words>272</words>

"I've spent years distinguishing pattern from chaos," she said, her comb catching moonlight as she gestured. <words>288</words> "But what if they're the same thing?" <words>295</words>

Thursday smiled, and she noticed his eyes held the same spiral patterns as the rock art. <words>311</words> "Now you're asking the right questions." <words>317</words>

As the singer's voice resumed, weaving through standing stones and starlight, Margot understood. <words>330</words> The watcher's burden wasn't knowledge—it was the responsibility of seeing connections others couldn't. <words>343</words> Her flowers had always been messages, each arrangement a coded transmission to those who knew how to look. <words>361</words>

She pocketed her comb and touched the central stone. <words>370</words> The petroglyphs pulsed once, acknowledging her acceptance. <words>377</words> "I'll keep arranging," she told Thursday. <words>383</words> "But now I know what I'm really doing." <words>391</words>

"Welcome to the watch," he replied, already walking back to his car. <words>403</words> "The burden suits you." <words>407</words>

Margot remained among the stones, decoding their ancient conversation, understanding at last why beauty and terror shared the same mathematical heart. <words>428</words>
