Marcus had spent forty years mapping abandoned railways, his weathered hands tracing forgotten paths through wilderness where iron once ruled. <words>18</words> The seasoned woodsman stood in the radio wave garden, electromagnetic pulses creating an invisible forest around monitoring equipment that tracked dying signals. <words>39</words> His artfully messy beard caught raindrops as he clutched his grandmother's antique hairbrush—the last thing she'd given him before the lies began. <words>62</words>

"Just one more measurement," he muttered with despairing cheer, the kind that comes from knowing you're running out of time. <words>82</words> The abandoned water tower loomed ahead, its rusted shell perfect for measuring echoes that would reveal the old Northern Pacific line's true path. <words>106</words> For decades, he'd told everyone—his wife, his children, the historical society—that he was preserving history. <words>122</words> But really, he was searching for the spot where his brother had vanished fifty years ago, following rails that maps claimed never existed. <words>146</words>

Inside the tower, Marcus shouted, timing the echo's return: 2.3 seconds. <words>157</words> He scribbled calculations on water-stained paper, his hands trembling not from cold but from proximity to truth. <words>175</words> The railway ran directly beneath—exactly where Thomas had disappeared. <words>184</words>

His radio crackled: "Dad, Mom's asking for you." <words>192</words>

The hospital was twenty miles away, but the radio wave garden's peculiar properties carried his daughter's voice clearly. <words>210</words> Marcus pressed the hairbrush against his chest, remembering how his mother had brushed Thomas's hair the morning he left. <words>229</words> She'd died believing Marcus had searched everywhere, never knowing he'd been too afraid to check the one place that mattered. <words>249</words>

"Tell her I'm coming," he transmitted back. <words>256</words> "And tell her—tell her about Thomas. <words>262</words> Tell her I know where he is." <words>269</words>

The confession short-circuited years of careful deception. <words>276</words> His daughter's silence stretched between electromagnetic pulses before she whispered, "She already knows, Dad. <words>290</words> She's always known you were looking." <words>296</words>

Marcus ran through the garden, past towers humming with invisible life, his boots crushing wet grass. <words>312</words> The hairbrush bounced in his pocket—evidence of a family that had loved despite secrets. <words>327</words> He burst into the hospital room just as the monitor's rhythm slowed. <words>339</words>

"I found him," he gasped, grasping her hand. <words>347</words> "Under the water tower. <words>351</words> The old Northern line. <words>355</words> I was scared to look there because—because I told him to take that route." <words>369</words>

Her eyes, clouded but understanding, found his. <words>376</words> She squeezed once—forgiveness in failing flesh. <words>382</words>

During the final beep of the hospital monitor, Marcus felt the weight of five decades lift. <words>398</words> He was freed by honesty, even as he lost everything. <words>408</words> Outside, the radio waves carried his truth into the morning, where abandoned railways waited to reveal their dead. <words>426</words>
