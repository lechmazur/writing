Marla pressed the fabric scrap against her bleeding palm, twenty thousand feet up the World Tree where oxygen thinned and nightmares grew thick as sap. <words>19</words>

She'd spent years perfecting her craft—selling false dreams to desperate climbers who believed the tree's crown held answers. <words>37</words>

But tonight, in the hush after a child's last bedtime story echoed up through the branches, she discovered her own terror. <words>58</words>

The nightmares weren't metaphors. <words>62</words>

They hung from twigs like overripe fruit, each one a perfect sphere of someone's worst moment crystallized. <words>79</words>

The fabric in her hand—torn from a climber's shirt three days ago—began humming with frequencies that made her teeth ache. <words>99</words>

She'd taken it as payment for a map that led nowhere, but now it pulled her further up, toward where branches scraped the underbelly of space. <words>125</words>

There, stuck to the bark with something viscous, were hundreds of sticky notes. <words>138</words>

Each dawn, the tree rearranged them—a puzzle that reset itself, mocking every attempt at comprehension. <words>153</words>

Marla had dismissed the stories of climbers who claimed to hear music in the patterns, but now, bleeding and alone, she understood. <words>176</words>

The mundane horror wasn't in the supernatural elements—it was in recognizing her mother's handwriting on note after note. <words>194</words>

Messages her mother had left on the refrigerator, shopping lists, reminders to take medicine. <words>208</words>

All here, impossibly here, at the junction where personal nightmares collided with universal dread. <words>222</words>

The fabric scrap pulled harder. <words>227</words>

Marla climbed, her con artist's fingers finding holds in bark that wept starlight. <words>240</words>

She began unscrambling the sticky notes, not randomly as others had tried, but following the melody the fabric hummed. <words>258</words>

"Eggs, milk, don't forget your lunch money"—mundane words that, rearranged, became syllables of something ancient. <words>272</words>

Each correct placement sent ripples through the tree's massive trunk. <words>282</words>

The nightmares shuddered in their shells. <words>288</words>

As she worked, Marla understood her true purpose—not to reach the crown, not to steal dreams, but to compose the cosmic lullaby hidden in her mother's everyday notes. <words>317</words>

The tree had been waiting for someone who could recognize the profound in the prosaic. <words>333</words>

With trembling hands, she placed the final note: "Sleep tight, my darling." <words>345</words>

The tree exhaled, and every nightmare cracked open, releasing not horrors but lullabies from across the universe—songs that mothers hummed to children, that winds sang to mountains, that atoms whispered to the void. <words>378</words>

Marla wept as the music washed over her, the fabric scrap dissolving into stardust between her fingers. <words>395</words>

She'd spent her life running from the ordinary, only to discover that the most pristine chaos lived in a mother's grocery list, transformed. <words>419</words>

The tree swayed, cradling her like the child she'd forgotten she'd once been. <words>432</words>

Above, the cosmos hummed its terrible, beautiful song. <words>440</words>

Below, children slept peacefully for the first time in centuries. <words>450</words>

And Marla, no longer a con artist but a conductor, finally understood that some heights could only be reached by descending into the simple, terrifying truth of being loved. <words>479</words>
