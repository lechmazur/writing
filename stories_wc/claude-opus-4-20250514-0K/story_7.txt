Before mortals learned to fold their hands in supplication, the Collector moved through the amber-lit halls of the nectar facility, her porcelain fingers clutching a twisted carnival cane. <words>26</words> The facility hummed with the ancient work of extracting essence from dying stars, each drop worth more than civilizations yet unborn. <words>46</words>

She was no ordinary curator of consciousness. <words>53</words> Her shelves held dolls that breathed with stolen souls, each one a fragment of divinity trapped in ceramic and cloth. <words>73</words> The gods had forbidden such collection, declaring the boundaries between animate and inanimate sacred and inviolate. <words>89</words>

But she was expectantly resigned to her fate—knowing punishment would come, yet certain her work must continue. <words>106</words> The twisted cane in her hand pulsed with carnival memories: laughter that became screams, joy that curdled into terror. <words>125</words> It was her divining rod, pointing toward the next soul ready for harvest. <words>138</words>

Tonight, she followed star paths through the facility's crystalline corridors, each constellation a map to power the gods hoarded. <words>157</words> The nectar workers, beings of pure light, drifted past without seeing her. <words>169</words> Her porcelain skin reflected their glow, making her appear as one of them. <words>182</words>

The cane led her deeper, past vats of golden essence that would one day flow through mortal veins as dreams. <words>202</words> She sought something rarer: the chorus of healing, a frequency that could mend what the gods had torn asunder. <words>221</words> Legend spoke of it hidden here, in the space between extraction and refinement. <words>234</words>

Her collection needed it. <words>238</words> The dolls grew restless, their trapped souls crying out in harmonies that shattered lesser vessels. <words>253</words> Only the chorus could quiet them, transform their anguish into something beautiful. <words>265</words>

She found it in the facility's heart—a chamber where rejected nectar pooled, too pure for mortal consumption. <words>282</words> The carnival cane writhed, recognizing kindred power. <words>289</words> Here, the boundary between sacred and profane blurred like watercolors in rain. <words>301</words>

With practiced movements, she began to uphold the ancient rite of extraction, drawing the chorus into glass vials. <words>318</words> Each note captured was a rebellion against divine law, a step through boundaries once thought unbreachable. <words>334</words>

The facility shuddered, sensing violation. <words>339</words> But she continued, expectantly resigned, knowing that soon mortals would learn prayer and the gods would notice their missing music. <words>359</words> Her dolls would sing with the chorus of healing, and perhaps—just perhaps—their songs would teach the gods why some boundaries deserve breaking. <words>382</words>

She departed as she came, following star paths back to her sanctuary, carrying liquid starlight and forbidden sound. <words>399</words> Tomorrow, her collection would wake to new voices. <words>407</words> Tonight, she walked between worlds, a porcelain rebel clutching carnival memories and stolen divinity. <words>421</words>
