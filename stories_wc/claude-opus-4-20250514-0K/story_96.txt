Beneath the city's concrete arteries, Vera composed verses on napkins and receipts, her words bleeding ink like wounds that refused to heal. <words>20</words> She volunteered at the witch's familiar menagerie three nights a week, not for love of creatures, but because the work demanded nothing of her soul. <words>44</words> The menagerie sprawled through abandoned subway tunnels, housing ravens that spoke backwards prophecies and cats whose purrs could shatter glass. <words>64</words>

While crocheting blankets for the newborn familiars—a task she performed with mechanical precision—Vera discovered the antique map wedged behind a cage of phosphorescent beetles. <words>88</words> The parchment bore continents that never existed, and a fresh tear ran through its center like a river of possibility. <words>108</words> She studied it with the same detached fascination she reserved for her poetry, recognizing something statically unique in its impossible geography. <words>129</words>

The map's torn edge matched perfectly with a fragment she'd found years ago in her grandmother's effects. <words>146</words> When joined, the pieces revealed a location marked with symbols that pulsed faintly: "Where the Brimming Cup Overflows." <words>164</words> Vera understood this wasn't about destiny or grand adventures—those belonged to people who still believed in such things. <words>182</words>

She continued her blanket, loop after loop, while memorizing the map's details. <words>194</words> The witch who ran the menagerie noticed nothing; Vera had perfected the art of being simultaneously present and absent. <words>213</words> Her fingers worked the yarn as her mind traced routes through non-existent lands, calculating distances between points that shouldn't exist. <words>234</words>

On her final volunteer shift, Vera seized the complete map with the same casual indifference she brought to everything. <words>253</words> The familiars watched her leave without protest—perhaps they recognized a kindred spirit in someone so thoroughly disconnected from ordinary passions. <words>274</words> She walked the tunnel system until she found the junction indicated on the map, where reality thinned like worn fabric. <words>294</words>

The Brimming Cup wasn't a place but a moment—when possibilities threatened to spill over their boundaries. <words>310</words> Vera stepped through the veil between worlds, not seeking transformation or revelation, but simply to surprise fate with an unplanned encore. <words>331</words> Her poetry had always been about capturing the overflow of existence without drowning in it. <words>346</words>

In the space beyond the map's edge, she found others like herself—collectors of fragments, weavers of borrowed time. <words>364</words> They welcomed her with the same disinterested passion she understood, offering neither questions nor explanations. <words>379</words> Here, she could write verses on surfaces that remembered themselves differently each dawn, crafting words for audiences that might never exist. <words>401</words> The torn map had led her not to adventure, but to a place where indifference itself became a form of devotion. <words>422</words> Vera smiled without warmth or joy, simply acknowledging that sometimes the universe's best jokes were the ones nobody laughed at. <words>443</words>
