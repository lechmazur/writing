The hedge maze breathed with ancient whispers as Sir Elara pressed deeper, her armor catching moonlight like scattered hope. <words>16</words> The streetlamp at the maze's entrance flickered its final protest before surrendering to darkness, plunging her quest into that peculiar hush that follows extinguished light. <words>42</words>

She clutched the stray jigsaw edge—that impossible fragment that had appeared in her palm after touching the Regret Engine's exhaust port three nights prior. <words>66</words> Its serrated border hummed against her gauntlette, singing frequencies only the cleverly naive could perceive without madness. <words>83</words> Elara understood just enough to follow its pull, but not enough to fear what understanding might cost. <words>100</words>

The mystic orchard garden revealed itself through a gap that shouldn't exist, where hedge walls bent like grieving mothers. <words>119</words> Silver-bark trees bore fruit that wept memories, each drop a moment someone wished they could reclaim. <words>135</words> At the garden's heart thrummed the machine—a brass monstrosity of gears and grief, endlessly cycling regrets through crystalline tubes. <words>154</words>

"Every lost thing feeds it," she whispered, watching souls' discarded possibilities flow like luminous blood through its veins. <words>172</words> The agonizing bliss of her purpose seized her: to sabotage this parasitic engine, to reclaim what it had stolen from humanity's hope. <words>195</words>

The jigsaw edge grew warm, its cryptic frequencies intensifying. <words>204</words> Elara pressed it against the machine's primary resonance chamber, feeling the harmonics align with excruciating precision. <words>220</words> She was clever enough to recognize the pattern, naive enough to trust it completely. <words>235</words>

The neutralization began as a whisper—discordant notes threading through the engine's symphony of sorrow. <words>249</words> Gears stuttered, tubes cracked, and regrets began flowing backward, seeking their original owners like homing birds. <words>265</words> The machine shrieked in frequencies that made the orchard's fruits burst with joy-rot sweetness. <words>280</words>

Elara's armor resonated with the collapsing harmonics, each vibration a caress of agony and ecstasy combined. <words>296</words> She held the jigsaw edge steady as the engine's death throes peaked, watching decades of stolen possibilities fountain skyward in prismatic geysers. <words>319</words>

When silence finally claimed the garden, only the edge remained, now smooth and complete—a piece of something larger she'd someday understand. <words>340</words> The hedge maze began unraveling, its purpose fulfilled, releasing the orchard to whoever might stumble upon its healing fruits. <words>359</words>

Sir Elara emerged into dawn, her quest complete yet somehow just beginning. <words>371</words> The streetlamp sparked back to life as she passed, illuminating her path forward. <words>384</words> Behind her, where the Regret Engine had fed, wildflowers pushed through brass and crystal remains, reclaiming the lost with gentle persistence. <words>406</words>
