Elara's bowstring had snapped during the tournament finals, leaving her dreams of Olympic glory scattered like arrows in tall grass. <words>19</words> Now she drove aimlessly through the mountain pass, her quiver rattling in the backseat like hollow bones. <words>36</words> The roadside sign promised "Nature's Miracle: The Inverted Falls," and though such tourist traps normally repelled her, she pulled over with anxiously calm resignation. <words>61</words>

The waterfall did flow upward, defying physics through some geological trick of pressure and wind. <words>77</words> Tourists snapped photos while Elara stood apart, fingering the tarnished silver comb in her pocket—her grandmother's, who'd also been an archer before arthritis stole her draw. <words>104</words> The comb had adorned champions' hair for three generations until today. <words>115</words>

"Magnificent, isn't it?" <words>118</words> The voice belonged to a weathered man sketching in a leather journal. <words>130</words> "I'm documenting how people react to wonders—part of my study on social movements and collective awe." <words>147</words>

Elara shrugged with passionate disinterest, the contradiction of caring too much about appearing not to care. <words>164</words> "Water going the wrong way. <words>169</words> So what?" <words>171</words>

"Ah, but that's the bridge of regret talking," he said, not looking up from his sketching. <words>187</words> "The space between what was and what should have been, where we all stand sometimes, watching life flow backward." <words>206</words>

She wanted to walk away but found herself rooted. <words>215</words> Above them, Jupiter and Saturn aligned in their centuries-long dance, invisible in daylight but pulling at tides and hearts nonetheless. <words>235</words> The slow dance of celestial bodies that made human disappointments seem both cosmic and insignificant. <words>250</words>

"You're an athlete," he observed. <words>255</words> "The way you hold your shoulders—pulled back but drooping. <words>264</words> Victory escaped you today." <words>268</words>

The words made her confront what she'd been avoiding. <words>277</words> "Archer," she admitted. <words>280</words> "Former archer, I suppose." <words>284</words>

"Nothing former about it. <words>288</words> You're still an archer; you've just met your inverted waterfall—a moment flowing against expectation." <words>302</words> He showed her his sketch: not the falls, but the crowd's faces, each reflecting a different shade of wonder or skepticism. <words>323</words> "I study how people move together through disbelief into acceptance. <words>333</words> Social movements begin with individuals confronting their own inverted waterfalls." <words>343</words>

Elara pulled out the comb, its tarnish catching strange light from the upward spray. <words>358</words> Her grandmother had worn it through her own defeats, through competitions where her arrows flew wide, through the slow loss of her gift. <words>382</words> Yet she'd kept teaching, kept passing down wisdom like silver combs through generations. <words>395</words>

"Perhaps," Elara said, securing her hair with the comb, "disappointment is just another target to aim past." <words>412</words>

The man smiled, adding her portrait to his collection of transformed faces. <words>424</words> Above them, the water continued its impossible ascent, and the planets continued their eternal dance, and somewhere between earth and sky, an archer began to draw a new bow. <words>454</words>
