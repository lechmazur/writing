The ancient Roman bathhouse had been transformed into an acoustically perfect concert hall, its marble columns now supporting speakers instead of steam. <words>20</words> Elena Voss adjusted her teacher's blazer, feeling the alien technology beneath that maintained her human disguise, as students filed in for the evening's performance. <words>44</words> She clutched the single puzzle tile in her pocket—the last fragment of her people's scattered knowledge, hidden among Earth's artifacts for centuries. <words>67</words>

The church organ's first note reverberated through the stone chambers, and Elena's dual hearts quickened. <words>83</words> Each concert brought her closer to decoding the tile's frequency patterns, yet fear paralyzed her—fear of exposure, fear of failing her extinct civilization. <words>107</words> She was righteously flawed, torn between her duty to preserve and her terror of revelation. <words>123</words>

"Ms. Voss?" <words>125</words> A student approached, pointing at the organ loft. <words>134</words> "Why does the music sound different here than in modern halls?" <words>145</words>

Elena compared the ancient acoustics to her memories of home—how her people had hidden messages in resonances, in the spaces between sounds. <words>168</words> "Because the Romans understood something we've forgotten," she said, her voice carrying fierce tenderness for both worlds she straddled. <words>188</words>

As the organist played Bach's Toccata, the puzzle tile began vibrating against her palm. <words>203</words> The bathhouse's curved ceiling caught and held each note, creating interference patterns that matched the tile's engravings. <words>220</words> Elena's breath caught—this was it, the key to unlocking her people's final message. <words>234</words>

But to activate it fully, she would need to reveal herself, to let her natural form resonate with the frequencies. <words>254</words> Throughout countless concerts, she had waited, afraid. <words>261</words> Tonight, watching her students' faces transform with wonder at the music, she understood that knowledge meant nothing if it remained buried by fear. <words>284</words>

During the crescendo, Elena stepped into the reverberating sound waves. <words>294</words> Her disguise flickered as she pressed the tile against a marble column. <words>306</words> Light erupted from the stone, projecting star maps and equations across the ancient walls. <words>321</words> Students gasped, but not in horror—in awe. <words>329</words>

"Your world and mine can learn from each other," Elena said, her true melodic voice harmonizing with the organ. <words>349</words> "I was sent to teach, but I was too afraid to truly share." <words>362</words> She held up the now-glowing tile. <words>369</words> "This contains medical knowledge that could save both our species. <words>379</words> My fear nearly let it die with me." <words>387</words>

The organ's final note faded, leaving only truth echoing in the transformed bathhouse. <words>400</words> Elena stood exposed but unafraid, her students approaching with curiosity rather than fear. <words>413</words> She had broken free by choosing connection over concealment, teaching her greatest lesson yet. <words>428</words> In the ancient stones' reverberation, two civilizations began their first honest conversation. <words>440</words>
