Marcus stood rigid beside the reinforced glass wall of the lunar greenhouse, his hand instinctively hovering near his concealed weapon. <words>18</words> The faded photograph tucked in his breast pocket seemed to burn through the fabric, a constant reminder of Earth's green parks he'd never see again. <words>42</words> 

For three years, he'd protected Ambassador Chen during her diplomatic visits to this crater-edge sanctuary, where genetically modified ferns grew in low gravity. <words>66</words> Each visit, he collected fragments of overheard stories from the botanists—whispers about escape pods, oxygen rationing, and the underground resistance movement. <words>87</words> These stolen narratives had become his obsession, pieces of a puzzle that might lead to his freedom from Chen's iron grip. <words>108</words>

"Your breathing has changed," Chen observed without turning from the orchids. <words>119</words> "Still dreaming of that serendipitously stubborn notion of yours?" <words>128</words>

Marcus maintained his professional facade, though serene anger flowed through him like the recycled water feeding the plants. <words>146</words> The photograph showed his daughter's fifth birthday party in Central Park—she'd be eight now, if she'd survived the wars. <words>166</words> Chen had promised to search for her, leveraging that hope to bind him to servitude. <words>182</words>

During today's visit, he'd overheard Dr. Patel mention the Council's plan to ratify new citizenship protocols for lunar-born humans. <words>201</words> The conversation fragment revealed a loophole: bodyguards who'd served five years could claim residency and autonomous status. <words>218</words> Two more years of bondage, unless... <words>224</words>

"The memorial greenhouse visit next week," Chen continued, studying a blood-red bloom. <words>237</words> "I won't require your services." <words>242</words>

Marcus's pulse quickened. <words>245</words> The ambassador never traveled without him; this deviation meant she'd discovered his eavesdropping. <words>259</words> Or perhaps she knew about the forged death certificate he'd submitted to the Council, claiming his daughter had perished. <words>278</words> If the Council ratified his application based on that lie, he'd achieve his timely rebirth as a free citizen. <words>297</words>

"I understand," he replied, his fingers brushing the photograph. <words>306</words> The stories he'd collected painted Chen as more than a diplomat—she trafficked in human desperation. <words>322</words> Others had tried to break free; their names now adorned memorial plaques throughout the greenhouse. <words>338</words>

Yet his serendipitously stubborn nature had uncovered what others missed: Chen needed him alive more than dead. <words>356</words> The photograph wasn't just his weakness—it was hers too. <words>365</words> She'd fabricated his daughter's survival to control him, but that fiction had become her trap. <words>381</words> 

As Earth rose beyond the crater's edge, Marcus felt the approaching moment of rebirth. <words>395</words> Sometimes freedom required not breaking chains, but understanding who truly wore them. <words>407</words> The greenhouse's serenity masked his cold determination—soon, he would water these plants as a free man. <words>424</words> Chen's carefully cultivated control would wither like leaves in lunar vacuum, and his patient anger would finally bloom. <words>442</words>
