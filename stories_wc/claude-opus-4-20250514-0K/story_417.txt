Brother Cornelius pressed the plain metal bottle cap between his trembling fingers, its ridged edges biting into his flesh as he sat in the mahogany chair. <words>19</words> The Victorian parlor, inexplicably transported to this suffocating jungle, creaked with moisture while vines crept through the wallpaper's peeling roses. <words>38</words> He had been studying the Unwritten Codex for seventeen hours straight, searching for loopholes in those unspoken agreements that bound reality together. <words>61</words>

"The theoretically playful nature of existence," he muttered, eyes bloodshot, "suggests we can uproot the very foundations of what we accept as true." <words>84</words> The bottle cap—his holy relic from a divine vision involving a cola advertisement—caught the filtered green light streaming through the foliage-choked windows. <words>107</words>

Outside, howler monkeys shrieked their evening prayers, but Cornelius heard only the whispers of cosmic truth scratching at his skull. <words>127</words> He rose abruptly, knocking over his teacup, and began pacing the Persian rug now sprouting mushrooms in the jungle's relentless humidity. <words>149</words> The unspoken agreement between sanity and madness had always been flexible, hadn't it? <words>162</words> Like the agreement between civilization and wilderness that this very parlor violated by existing here, complete with its crystal chandelier dripping condensation. <words>185</words>

"I must tell someone," he gasped, clutching the bottle cap against his chest. <words>198</words> "The vulnerability of confession will grant me strength." <words>206</words> He stumbled to the servants' quarters, though no servants had occupied this jungle mansion for decades. <words>223</words> In the darkness of what had once been a scullery maid's room, now home to phosphorescent fungi, he knelt. <words>242</words>

"I know the truth," he whispered to the shadows, his voice cracking with earnest conviction. <words>257</words> "This bottle cap contains the universe's programming language, written in microscopic scratches only visible to those who've rejected the unspoken agreement of rational sight." <words>281</words> The darkness seemed to lean in, listening. <words>288</words> "I've been afraid to fully embrace this knowledge because once I do, I'll uproot myself from everything human." <words>306</words>

A gecko chirped from the corner, its eyes reflecting his candle's flame like tiny stars. <words>321</words> Cornelius laughed—a sound caught between sob and celebration. <words>329</words> "But that's the cosmic joke, isn't it?" <words>336</words> He pressed the bottle cap to his forehead. <words>344</words> "The unspoken agreement was always that we'd pretend the universe makes sense, when really it's all theoretically playful chaos wearing a Victorian suit in a jungle." <words>371</words>

In that moment of absolute vulnerability, confessing his deepest absurdity to the indifferent darkness, Brother Cornelius felt an inexplicable strength bloom in his chest. <words>395</words> He had uprooted himself from reason and found something more authentic: the earnest acceptance of magnificent nonsense. <words>412</words> The bottle cap pulsed with imagined warmth against his skin. <words>422</words> Tomorrow, he would dance. <words>426</words>
