Detective Martinez stood in the Vanishing Point Gallery, her bloodshot eyes scanning the crime scene as the final siren's echo died into nothing. <words>19</words> The city's emergency system had just announced another blackout, but she barely noticed anymore. <words>33</words> "Great," she muttered, pulling out her phone's flashlight, "because what this case needed was mood lighting." <words>49</words>

She began to rummage through the victim's scattered belongings, each item a potential clue to why someone would die clutching a kaleidoscope. <words>71</words> The vintage toy lay broken beside him, its colored glass fragments catching her light like guilty tears. <words>88</words> Martinez picked it up carefully, peering through the cracked lens with the kind of confidence only the completely lost can muster. <words>109</words>

The fleeting images in the half-damaged kaleidoscope shifted: a young boy's birthday party, a woman's laugh, a hospital bed. <words>128</words> Not random patterns, she realized, but memories—somehow trapped in the twisting mirrors and colored shards. <words>143</words> "Because normal evidence is so last season," she said to the corpse, who offered no rebuttal. <words>159</words>

A single playing card slipped from the victim's pocket: the Queen of Hearts, worn soft from handling. <words>176</words> Martinez recognized it immediately—the same card from the cold case that had haunted her for three years. <words>193</words> The Gallery Owner's murder. <words>197</words> The Dealer's signature. <words>200</words>

She lifted the kaleidoscope again, and this time saw her own memories fracturing through it: her partner's funeral, the case files she'd memorized, the warnings she'd ignored. <words>228</words> The Dealer was collecting again, and she was confidently unsure whether these visions were evidence or invitation. <words>245</words>

"You know what they say about dancing with death," she announced to the empty gallery, where paintings hung at angles suggesting reality itself had given up. <words>271</words> "Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow, but the music always stops." <words>282</words> She pocketed both the card and kaleidoscope, knowing the Dealer expected her to follow this breadcrumb trail. <words>299</words>

The memories in the kaleidoscope weren't just the victim's—they were everyone the Dealer had killed, a twisted collection preserved in prismatic fragments. <words>321</words> Each turn revealed another face, another life cut short, another move in a game she'd been losing for years. <words>340</words>

Martinez headed for the gallery's back exit, her exhausted mind already three steps ahead and two steps behind. <words>358</words> The Dealer wanted to finish their dance, and she'd finally found the tempo: memory's impact measured in bodies, time signatures written in blood. <words>382</words> "Fine," she said, her voice dripping with the kind of sarcasm that only comes from accepting the inevitable while flipping it off. <words>404</words> "Let's tango." <words>406</words>
