The gravedigger Itzel pressed her vintage magnifying glass against the temple stone, searching for the hairline fracture where worlds overlap. <words>17</words> Years of steady work among the dead had taught her to recognize the signs—the way reality trembled at its edges, how the ancient Aztec temple reimagined itself in modern concrete and rebar still remembered its original form. <words>53</words>

She worked with diligently whimsical precision, humming funeral songs backward while measuring the depth of shadows that shouldn't exist. <words>72</words> The magnifying glass, inherited from her grandmother who'd served as the last true keeper, revealed what naked eyes couldn't: microscopic hieroglyphs that shifted between Nahuatl and binary code. <words>100</words>

"I know what you've done," whispered Carlos, the museum director who'd hired her to maintain the temple-turned-cultural-center's grounds. <words>119</words>

During the hush that follows a sudden confession, Itzel continued her work, knowing this moment had been prophesied in the overlapping calendars. <words>141</words> She began to kindrelize—a ritual her grandmother had named for the way it kindled reality while generalizing the specific into universal truth. <words>164</words> Her fingers traced spirals in the air, following patterns only visible through the magnifying glass. <words>179</words>

Through the hush of wind passing a broken fence line surrounding the temple grounds, the transformation accelerated. <words>196</words> The fence, deliberately damaged at precise points, created acoustic channels that turned wind into wordless prayers. <words>212</words> Carlos stood frozen as the temple's dual nature fully manifested—steel beams became obsidian pillars, fluorescent lights flickered into torch flames, and Itzel's coveralls transformed into feathered ceremonial robes. <words>241</words>

"You think I disturb the dead," she said, her voice carrying the raucous silence of a thousand unspoken names. <words>261</words> "But I preserve ritual practices that keep the living world from collapsing into the realm of Mictlan." <words>278</words>

The magnifying glass revealed the truth written in overlapping scripts: every grave she'd dug created an anchor point, every body properly positioned according to astronomical alignments that existed in multiple realities simultaneously. <words>310</words> Carlos had discovered her careful modifications to burial positions, not understanding she was maintaining the cosmic balance. <words>327</words>

Now, as past and present occupied the same space, he saw the necessity. <words>340</words> The dead walked through walls that were simultaneously there and not there, honoring appointments with destiny that transcended linear time. <words>360</words> Itzel's steady hands had kept the boundary permeable but stable, allowing the ancient ways to persist without overwhelming the modern world. <words>382</words>

She offered Carlos the magnifying glass. <words>388</words> "Look closer," she said, gesturing toward the graves she tended. <words>398</words> Through its lens, he saw not death but transformation—each burial a doorway keeping all worlds in their proper, overlapping order. <words>418</words> The raucous silence swallowed his apology. <words>424</words> Some confessions, once spoken, remake the universe. <words>431</words> Itzel smiled her diligently whimsical smile and returned to her work, steady as stone, light as wind. <words>448</words>
