Marcus clutched the weathered fragment of marble, its edges worn smooth by countless hands before his. <words>14</words> The naive summoner had stumbled into the Society of Whispered Truths only three weeks ago, drawn by rumors of midnight gatherings where reality bent like light through water. <words>42</words> Now, standing in their treasure vault—a peculiarly virtual space that existed between television commercials, suspended in those fleeting moments when consciousness drifted—he understood why they'd chosen him. <words>70</words>

The piece of broken statue thrummed against his palm, warm despite the vault's ethereal chill. <words>85</words> It had belonged to an ancient oracle, they'd told him, one who could hum melodies that reached beyond the veil of existence. <words>107</words> Marcus needed that power now, needed to elevate his voice until fate itself would pause to listen. <words>124</words>

"You have seven minutes," the Keeper's voice echoed from nowhere and everywhere, tinged with distant warmth that reminded Marcus of his grandmother's kitchen. <words>147</words> "Between this commercial break and the next, the vault's defenses weaken." <words>158</words>

The other treasures glowed softly on their pedestals—a compass that pointed to lost loves, a mirror reflecting unborn dreams—but Marcus ignored them all. <words>181</words> He pressed the statue fragment to his throat and began to hum, feeling the first seeds of understanding bloom within him. <words>202</words>

The melody started low, barely a whisper, but the fragment amplified it, spreading vibrations through the virtual architecture. <words>220</words> Shelves of forgotten artifacts trembled, their contents awakening to his untrained song. <words>232</words> He'd been told the truth during those rumor-charged midnight gatherings: every summoner began naive, but the right relic could transform ignorance into wisdom. <words>255</words>

His humming grew stronger, more confident, as the lullaby his mother once sang emerged from memory. <words>271</words> The fragment grew hot against his skin, its ancient power recognizing the purity of his intent. <words>287</words> He wasn't seeking wealth or dominion—he simply wanted fate to hear him, to know that somewhere in the vast cosmos, a young man refused to accept that his sister's illness was inevitable. <words>319</words>

The vault shuddered, reality flickering like static between channels. <words>328</words> Other members of the society materialized briefly, their faces masks of encouragement and concern. <words>342</words> They understood what he risked; naive summoners who pushed too hard often found themselves scattered across dimensions, their voices forever lost between commercial breaks. <words>366</words>

But Marcus continued, his lullaby now a beacon cutting through layers of existence. <words>379</words> The broken statue piece crumbled to dust, its essence merging with his voice as the melody reached its crescendo. <words>398</words> In that moment, suspended between one reality and the next, Marcus felt fate lean in to listen, and he knew his sister would wake tomorrow with color returned to her cheeks. <words>429</words> The commercials ended, the vault dissolved, but the seeds of understanding had taken root—sometimes, the most powerful magic comes from those naive enough to believe it possible. <words>457</words>
