Mortician Elara Thorne adjusted her spectacles, examining the tarnished silver bracelet that had arrived with no body attached. <words>16</words> In her thirty years of preparing the deceased, she'd never encountered such a peculiar delivery—just the jewelry and a map marked with singing notes. <words>39</words>

The map led to the mangrove labyrinth at the edge of town, where locals whispered of spirits who sang lullabies to steal dreams. <words>62</words> Elara's curiosity, which had often landed her in what her grandmother called "polite anarchy," compelled her forward as night began yielding to golden embers. <words>87</words>

She entered the twisted roots and brackish waters, following footprints that vanished after a single heartbeat—there, then gone, like memories of the dead. <words>111</words> The spirits' songs grew louder, a loudly serene chorus that made her teeth ache with its impossible contradiction. <words>129</words>

"Welcome, death-keeper," a voice rustled through the leaves. <words>137</words> A translucent figure materialized, wearing an identical bracelet to the one in Elara's pocket. <words>151</words> "You've come for the dream journals." <words>157</words>

It wasn't a question. <words>161</words> Elara nodded, understanding flooding through her—the rustle of revelation like autumn leaves cascading through her mind. <words>177</words> The spirits were collectors too, but they gathered dreams from the dying, preserving final visions in journals hidden throughout the labyrinth. <words>199</words>

"To retrieve them, you must imitate us," the spirit continued. <words>209</words> "Sing our song, walk our paths, become what exists between life and death." <words>222</words>

Elara opened her mouth, producing a sound that shouldn't have been possible—notes that bent reality, that made the mangroves dance. <words>243</words> She moved through the maze, her footsteps beginning to fade like those she'd followed, her solid form flickering between states. <words>264</words>

Hours passed, or perhaps minutes—time moved strangely here. <words>272</words> She collected journal after journal, each containing the final dreams of souls she'd prepared for burial. <words>288</words> Mrs. Chen's last vision of her childhood garden. <words>296</words> Young Thomas's dream of flying with paper wings. <words>304</words> Her own grandfather's forgotten memory of teaching her to tie fishing knots. <words>316</words>

As dawn fully broke, painting the sky in honey and copper, Elara emerged from the labyrinth carrying seven leather-bound journals. <words>336</words> The bracelet on her wrist—when had she put it on?—gleamed with new purpose. <words>349</words> She understood now why the spirits had summoned her. <words>358</words>

In her mortuary, between the careful preservation of bodies and the gentle closing of eyes, she would also preserve dreams. <words>378</words> The spirits had chosen their accomplice well—someone who already lived at the boundary, who understood that death was merely another form of transformation. <words>402</words>

Elara smiled, organizing the journals on her shelf beside the embalming fluids. <words>414</words> Tomorrow, another bracelet would arrive. <words>419</words> Tomorrow, she would return to the singing labyrinth. <words>427</words> The dead deserved to have their dreams remembered, and she would be their loudly serene guardian, creating polite anarchy in the order of things. <words>452</words>

After all, curiosity had finally given her purpose beyond flesh and formaldehyde. <words>464</words> The rustle of revelation had shown her the truth: some treasures were worth becoming slightly less human to protect. <words>483</words>
