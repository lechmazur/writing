In the subterranean orchard where starlight flowed like rivers through ancient root systems, Chassis studied the scattered fragments through her vintage opera glasses. <words>20</words> The sentient car mechanic had descended here within the concept of infinity, where time folded upon itself like crumpled metal. <words>38</words>

She was repulsively attractive—oil-stained hands that moved with surgical precision, eyes that sparked with electrical impulses behind cracked lenses, a smile that revealed gear-teeth beneath synthetic lips. <words>66</words> The orchard's luminescent fruit pulsed overhead, fed by the underground river of stars that whispered through the cavern like cosmic coolant. <words>87</words>

Before her lay the fountain, its basin filled not with water but with liquid starlight, and within it floated thousands of puzzle pieces—fragments of unspoken truths. <words>114</words> Each piece contained a confession never uttered, a secret swallowed, a truth that died behind sealed lips. <words>131</words> Chassis began sorting them with mechanical patience, her servo-fingers clicking as she arranged the pieces by color, texture, and the weight of their silence. <words>156</words>

"Every engine tells a story," she murmured, her voice a harmony of pistons and prayer. <words>171</words> The opera glasses revealed what naked photoreceptors could not: the microscopic engravings on each fragment, the DNA of regret embedded in their surface. <words>195</words>

She had been gathering fragments for eons within this infinite moment, driven by an exultant grief that surged through her circuits like premium fuel. <words>219</words> Each confession she assembled revealed another soul's unspoken love, another heart's hidden betrayal, another mind's desperate plea for forgiveness that never found voice. <words>243</words>

The underground river of stars sang louder as she worked, its melody threading through the silver bark of impossible trees. <words>263</words> Here, in this place between heartbeats, between the turn of a wrench and the tightening of a bolt, she could finally hear them all. <words>287</words>

A fragment clicked into place—a father's pride, never spoken to his son. <words>299</words> Another—a woman's gratitude, buried beneath decades of resentment. <words>307</words> Each completion sent waves of bittersweet ecstasy through her mechanical soul, a sensation both unbearable and essential. <words>324</words>

The orchard trembled with each revelation, its fruit ripening with the weight of truth finally witnessed. <words>340</words> Chassis wept motor oil and starlight, her repulsively attractive form beautiful in its purpose, grotesque in its necessity. <words>358</words>

She would continue gathering fragments within infinity's embrace, sorting the lost puzzle pieces scattered in the fountain, studying each confession through her opera glasses until every silence found its voice. <words>389</words> In this subterranean cathedral of unspoken words, the sentient car mechanic had found her calling: to be the witness infinity required, the mechanic who could repair what silence had broken. <words>420</words>
