Marcus Chen stretched his hamstrings against the hydroponic wheat stalks, their bioluminescent tips casting ethereal shadows across the biodome's curved walls. <words>19</words> Twenty years of courtroom victories had taught him patience, but running from the Corporate Tribunal required a different kind of waiting—the impatiently patient kind that coiled in your muscles like a spring. <words>51</words>

The gift tag fluttered from his pocket, its faded ink reading "To the one who remembers." <words>67</words> He'd found it tucked inside the encrypted message from his old high school rivals, now resistance leaders who communicated exclusively through cryptic dares. <words>91</words> This morning's challenge: "Archive what the machines forget, trickster." <words>100</words>

The biodome farm hummed with automated efficiency, but Marcus knew better. <words>111</words> Each sector preserved a dying language through its crop rotation patterns—Ainu in the rice paddies, Jedek in the vertical gardens, Kusunda in the underground mushroom caves. <words>138</words> The Corporate Tribunal had deemed linguistic diversity "inefficient," but the farmers had found ways to encode grammar in growth cycles, vocabulary in harvest schedules. <words>163</words>

His stretching routine was purposeful, a careful choreography designed to divert the surveillance drones' attention. <words>178</words> Bend, breathe, catalogue: "Vod" meant water in Votian, spoken now only by these tomatoes' root systems. <words>195</words> Twist, hold, record: The soybean trellises traced Taushiro sentence structures, a language down to its last living speaker. <words>214</words>

The gift tag wasn't random—it never was with his rivals. <words>225</words> They'd remembered his college thesis on legal linguistics, how he'd argued that every lost language was a crime against human consciousness. <words>247</words> Before he'd sold out, before he'd defended the very corporations now erasing tongues faster than species. <words>264</words>

A ghost of his younger self moved through him as he shifted into a lunge. <words>279</words> The biodome's climate system whispered in Njerep, its tonal fluctuations programming temperature changes in a language with only four speakers left on Earth. <words>303</words>

Marcus touched his earpiece, subvocalizing his recordings into the quantum drive hidden in his molar. <words>319</words> Each documented pattern was evidence for a future trial—not in any corporate court, but in whatever justice system would rise from these ashes. <words>343</words>

The surveillance drone drifted closer, its red eye suspicious. <words>353</words> Marcus smoothly transitioned into warrior pose, his movements spelling out a legal argument in Ongota sign language. <words>370</words> The drone, programmed only for major languages, saw nothing but stretching. <words>382</words>

His chosen path had led him here: from defender of corporate interests to guardian of humanity's whispered heritage. <words>400</words> The gift tag crumbled between his fingers, biodegradable like everything in the dome, but its message endured in every word he saved. <words>423</words> Tomorrow, his rivals would dare him deeper into the resistance, but today, in this moment between stretches, Marcus Chen was exactly where the universe needed him—impatiently patient, cataloguing ghosts before they vanished forever. <words>458</words>
