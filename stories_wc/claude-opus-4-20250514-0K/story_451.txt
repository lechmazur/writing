Cassandra pressed the baseball against her chest, its leather worn smooth by impossible years. <words>13</words> The signature read "Tommy Chen, 2087" – proof that her twin brother had survived the coming apocalypse. <words>29</words> She'd hired twelve actors over the past month, each performing as potential versions of herself, hoping one would trigger the memories stolen when they were separated at birth. <words>58</words>

The farmers market buzzed below the mountain's base, oblivious to her presence at the abandoned observatory. <words>74</words> Here, where crystal formations cast angular shadows across the stone floor, she waited for actor number thirteen. <words>91</words> Each candidate received the same cryptic invitation: "Your typically unique features match our requirements. <words>105</words> Audition at sunset, peak trail marker seven." <words>112</words>

This one arrived different – moved different. <words>118</words> Instead of studying Cassandra's mannerisms, the woman simply sat cross-legged and closed her eyes. <words>132</words> "You're not an actor," Cassandra whispered. <words>138</words>

"Neither are you," her mirror image replied. <words>145</words> "But we've both been playing parts since the agency separated us." <words>156</words>

The baseball grew warm between them. <words>162</words> "Tommy told me you'd have it," the twin continued. <words>171</words> "Said you'd need proof before you'd believe." <words>178</words>

"Tommy's our brother?" <words>181</words> Cassandra's voice cracked. <words>184</words>

"Was. <words>185</words> Will be. <words>187</words> Time travel makes tense complicated." <words>192</words> The woman – Celeste, memory suddenly supplied – reached for the ball. <words>203</words> "The forbidden knowledge isn't about the apocalypse. <words>210</words> It's about what we become after." <words>216</words>

Cassandra had to subdue the urge to run. <words>224</words> Twenty-three years of searching, of hiring strangers to excavate her identity from genetic echoes, and here sat the answer. <words>243</words> "The prophecy says only one twin survives." <words>250</words>

"Prophecies assume linear time." <words>254</words> Celeste traced Tommy's signature. <words>258</words> "He came back to tell us we don't die – we merge. <words>269</words> Become something typically unique to this timeline." <words>276</words>

The crystal shadows shifted, revealing symbols carved in the observatory walls – coordinates, dates, warnings. <words>291</words> Their clandestine meeting place had been chosen by their future-past brother, a sanctuary where forbidden knowledge could be exchanged beyond the agency's reach. <words>315</words>

"The actors you hired," Celeste said softly. <words>322</words> "Each one carried a piece of us. <words>329</words> You were assembling yourself before you even knew I existed." <words>339</words>

Below them, the farmers market began closing, vendors packing away tomorrow's sustenance. <words>351</words> But the twins sat in crystalline silence, holding a baseball signed by hope itself, preparing to outlive an apocalyptic prophecy by becoming something entirely new. <words>376</words>

"Ready to remember?" <words>379</words> Celeste asked. <words>381</words>

Cassandra nodded, understanding finally why she'd always felt incomplete. <words>390</words> Not because she was missing her twin, but because she was destined to become whole. <words>406</words> The baseball pulsed once, bright as a star, and the forbidden knowledge flooded home. <words>421</words>
