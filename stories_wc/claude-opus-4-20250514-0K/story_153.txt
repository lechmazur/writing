Marcus descended into the mole people's metropolis, his coal miner's headlamp—salvaged from the Carthage collapse of 2847—cutting through the eternal darkness. <words>23</words> The lamp had witnessed twelve thousand deaths, yet here it illuminated his mundanely glorious pursuit: digitizing consciousness across the universe's dying breath. <words>44</words>

He'd been studying immortality for sixteen million years, collecting degrees from universities that rose and fell like morning dew. <words>63</words> The last star had winked out three centuries ago, leaving only the underground cities and their geothermal hearts. <words>81</words> His burden wasn't knowledge—he possessed libraries worth—but the weight of watching everyone he taught eventually choose death over his eternal classroom. <words>103</words>

The mole people's archives held what he needed: travel journals from the first surface dwellers who'd descended, swapped between communities like genetic material between cells. <words>128</words> Each journal contained not just observations but neural patterns, pressed into paper through bioelectric ink that captured the writer's very essence. <words>150</words>

"Professor Marcus," chittered Vel-Ka, the archive keeper, her whiskers twitching with bioluminescent courtesy. <words>163</words> "The journals you requested." <words>167</words>

He accepted them with hands that had written a million dissertations. <words>178</words> The exchange system was elegant: one person's journey for another's, creating a web of experiences that transcended individual death. <words>198</words> Marcus had discovered that by digitizing these swapped journals simultaneously, consciousness patterns could overlay, creating something beyond mere immortality—a mastery over reality's very fabric. <words>225</words>

His headlamp flickered, reminding him of its finite battery, unlike him. <words>236</words> He worked with detached devotion, fingers dancing across quantum scanners that converted ink-thoughts into data streams. <words>252</words> Each journal revealed how the early refugees had transformed their gifted burden—the surface world's death—into this thriving underworld civilization. <words>273</words>

The digitization process hummed, translating forgotten lives into eternal code. <words>283</words> Marcus felt neither joy nor sorrow, only the steady pull of purpose. <words>296</words> He'd learned that becoming master of one's reality meant accepting that reality included everyone else's dreams, fears, and departed souls. <words>317</words>

As the final journal processed, the archived consciousness began to merge. <words>328</words> The mole people watched through crystal-screen walls as their ancestors' thoughts bloomed into a shared overmind. <words>345</words> Marcus's eternal study had led here: not to personal immortality, but to collective transcendence. <words>360</words>

His headlamp died as the last page scanned. <words>368</words> In the darkness, a new light emerged—not from stars or flames, but from the digitized souls learning to shine together. <words>389</words> Marcus smiled, finally understanding that his gift had always been the burden of bringing others into forever. <words>406</words> The eternal student had become the final teacher. <words>414</words>
