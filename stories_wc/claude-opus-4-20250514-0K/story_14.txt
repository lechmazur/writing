The tidal power monitoring station's cafeteria transformed nightly into Professor Marsh's illicit classroom, where candlelit dinners masked lessons in probability theory and oceanic chaos. <words>19</words> Eleanor, whose gambling debts had driven her to this remote posting, clutched her grandmother's rustic candle mold—the only inheritance she hadn't pawned. <words>41</words>

"The tides are rarely predictable," Marsh wheezed, his unhinged lectures beginning as the generators hummed below. <words>57</words> "Like cards, like dice, like the unspoken bargains we make with fate." <words>69</words> Eleanor laughed through tears, recognizing herself in his words. <words>78</words> She'd come here believing she could outwit chance itself, but the ocean's rhythms were teaching her otherwise. <words>95</words>

Each midnight, while colleagues slept, Marsh's rebellious seminars drew the station's lost souls—engineers fleeing scandals, researchers hiding from creditors. <words>113</words> They'd dock their consciences at the door, trading stories of spectacular failures over flickering flames. <words>128</words> Eleanor molded new candles obsessively, each one representing another bet she'd never place, another risk she'd never take. <words>146</words>

"You think you're naive," Marsh observed one night, watching her work. <words>157</words> "But naivety is just inexperience dressed in hope." <words>165</words> The professor's own unspoken bargain hung between them—his terminal diagnosis, his determination to teach until his final breath. <words>183</words> These midnight lectures weren't just rebellion; they were his attempt to capture one last spark before oblivion claimed him. <words>202</words>

The station's rhythmic turbines seemed to mock their pretensions, converting tidal forces into electricity with mechanical certainty. <words>219</words> Yet even here, Eleanor discovered, randomness crept in—equipment failures, storm surges, the rarely predictable moments when everything aligned perfectly or catastrophically. <words>241</words>

"I used to think gambling was about winning," Eleanor confessed, pressing warm wax into the ancient mold. <words>258</words> "Now I understand it was about feeling alive." <words>266</words> Marsh's laughter erupted, a sound like breaking waves. <words>274</words> "The house always wins, my dear, but we're not playing against the house anymore." <words>289</words> His eyes gleamed with manic wisdom. <words>295</words> "We're playing against time itself." <words>300</words>

When security finally discovered their gatherings, Eleanor stood accused of operating illegal games. <words>313</words> The irony struck her like a riptide—she who'd sworn off gambling, charged with running a den. <words>330</words> But Marsh's students rallied, testifying about probability lessons, philosophical discussions, the candles Eleanor made to light their way through darkness. <words>351</words>

The night before the inquiry board arrived, Marsh's heart finally docked at its last port. <words>367</words> Eleanor found him at his usual table, her latest candle still burning, his final lesson scrawled beside it: "Every breath is a bet against oblivion." <words>392</words> She laughed through her tears, understanding at last that some bargains transcend words, some gambles transcend winning, and some sparks illuminate more than darkness—they transform it. <words>419</words>

The tidal station continued its work, harvesting power from eternal cycles. <words>430</words> Eleanor remained, teaching Marsh's lessons by candlelight, helping other naive gamblers dock their desperate ships in safer harbors. <words>448</words> The rustic mold shaped more than candles now; it shaped possibilities, one flickering flame at a time. <words>465</words> And in those flames, Marsh's spark lived on, rarely predictable but always present. <words>478</words>
