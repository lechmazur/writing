The mist-shrouded island held secrets that even Marcus, a reformed cardsharp who hadn't touched liquor in seven years, couldn't shuffle away. <words>20</words> He sat at the mahogany table in the abandoned lighthouse, his fingers tracing the rim of an antique ink well that had appeared in seventeen different strangers' dreams. <words>48</words> 

His gift was peculiar—he could analyze the cameo appearances of objects in people's dreams, reading them like marked cards in a rigged deck. <words>72</words> The ink well had shown him fragments: a woman writing hushed pleas for forgiveness, a child dipping quills in midnight, a soldier sealing his final letter. <words>99</words> Each dreamer had visited this island, and each had vanished precisely at the moment their coffee cooled in an abandoned mug. <words>120</words>

Marcus needed to hasten his investigation. <words>126</words> The ferry wouldn't return for three days, and already he could feel the island's influence—that boisterously quiet presence that screamed in silence, like a crowd holding its breath before the river card drops. <words>159</words> He'd come here to dare the unimaginable: to enter his own dreams and confront whatever entity collected these lost souls. <words>179</words>

The lighthouse keeper's journal, discovered beneath rotting floorboards, revealed the truth with maddening clarity. <words>194</words> "The ink well chooses those who write their deepest regrets," the keeper had scrawled. <words>209</words> "It appears first in dreams, then manifests when the dreamer arrives here, drawing them to sign their names in the ledger of the disappeared." <words>234</words>

Marcus touched the well's obsidian surface, feeling the pull of centuries-old ink that never dried. <words>250</words> His own regrets—the fortunes he'd stolen with sleight of hand, the trust he'd betrayed with marked decks—surfaced like bile. <words>270</words> But sobriety had taught him to face his demons without flinching. <words>281</words>

As his coffee cooled in the cracked mug beside him, Marcus made his choice. <words>295</words> Instead of signing his name, he overturned the ink well, watching the impossible liquid pool and evaporate like morning mist. <words>315</words> The lighthouse trembled, and through the fog, he glimpsed them—hundreds of souls frozen in the moment of their regret, their hushed pleas finally audible. <words>340</words>

"You've broken the game," a voice whispered, neither male nor female, young nor old. <words>355</words> "A cardsharp who plays honest. <words>360</words> How wonderfully paradoxical." <words>363</words>

Marcus felt it then—grudging admiration from whatever force had orchestrated this supernatural con. <words>376</words> The mist began to lift, revealing a sunrise that hadn't touched this island in decades. <words>392</words> One by one, the trapped souls faded like bad bets folding into light. <words>405</words> Marcus stood, pocketing the empty ink well—evidence that sometimes the best hand is the one you refuse to play. <words>425</words>
