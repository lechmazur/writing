The soothsayer's fingers trembled as she traced the water rings on the bar top, each circle revealing another decade of drought that had transformed this place into a neon graveyard. <words>24</words> "Oh fantastic," she muttered, her voice dripping with molten sarcasm, "the future's about as bright as these flickering billboards advertising dead casinos." <words>47</words>

Outside, the maze of towering advertisements stretched endlessly across the desert, their promises of luxury resorts now mocking epitaphs to humanity's environmental hubris. <words>71</words> She pulled out her pocket puzzle box, its thirteen locks clicking like a nervous heartbeat—each one sealed during the lost years when the aquifers ran dry. <words>98</words>

"Probably unlikely," the last weatherman had said on broadcast, right before the dust storms became permanent. <words>114</words> Now here she was, Cassandra of the Climate Apocalypse, reading prophecies in beer stains while civilization's corpse blinked product placement at her through the window. <words>139</words>

The bar's owner had carved the rings himself, a careful record of every glass set down during the years between Before and After. <words>163</words> She magnified her vision, letting the overlapping circles blur into maps of underground rivers that once flowed here, back when soothsayers predicted love and fortune instead of rationing schedules. <words>192</words>

"To shape destiny with bare hands," she laughed bitterly, remembering her grandmother's words. <words>206</words> As if anyone's hands stayed bare anymore—everyone wore gloves against the caustic dust. <words>220</words> She'd tried warning them, tried explaining that the billboards' promises were consuming more water than the entire population, but who listens to a mildly panicked prophet when there's money to be made? <words>253</words>

Another lock clicked open on the puzzle box. <words>261</words> Inside, seeds waited—thirteen varieties from the lost years, each one a middle finger to the corporate prophets who'd promised infinite growth on finite sand. <words>286</words> The water rings showed her the pattern: where the old aquifers intersected, where life might return if someone cared enough to try. <words>309</words>

She stood, pocketing the box and its precious cargo. <words>319</words> Outside, a billboard for Arctic Ice Premium Water flickered and died, its irony finally exhausted. <words>335</words> "Stewardship," she spat, the word tasting like battery acid and hope. <words>347</words> The maze of advertisements couldn't stop her—she'd read their death in condensation rings and bar-top philosophy. <words>364</words>

Tomorrow, she'd plant the first seed where the circles prophesied rain might return. <words>378</words> Today, she'd practice shaping destiny by teaching others to read the signs that had always been there, magnified in every wasted drop. <words>401</words> After all, even mildly panicked soothsayers had to start somewhere, and the future was probably unlikely to wait. <words>419</words>
