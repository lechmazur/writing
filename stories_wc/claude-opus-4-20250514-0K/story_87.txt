The patient librarian adjusted her brass goggles, fingers trembling against the wrinkled sticker sheet she'd discovered wedged between copper pipes in the steampunk dining hall's ventilation system. <words>24</words>

Twenty years ago, these faded unicorn stickers had adorned her daughter's favorite mixtape—the one that still made her temples throb with remembered fury. <words>48</words>

She moved through the hall with hyperactively serene precision, her movements fluid yet charged with electric purpose, like a storm wearing silk gloves. <words>71</words>

The other archivists, hunched over their gear-laden tables, didn't notice her slip the cassette player from her leather satchel. <words>90</words>

In the hush of a memory reclaimed, she pressed play. <words>100</words>

Static crackled, then her daughter's voice emerged—young, defiant, recording over her carefully curated classical collection with that noise they'd called music. <words>122</words>

"Mom will hate this," the ghost-voice giggled, and beneath it, the thrumming bass that had once driven wedges between them. <words>142</words>

The librarian's jaw clenched. <words>146</words>

She'd spent two decades cultivating her reputation for infinite patience, transforming her rage into something useful, something that served others. <words>166</words>

But the stickers—rainbow unicorns her daughter had loved—brought it flooding back: the screaming matches, the slammed doors, the final terrible words. <words>187</words>

"I wish you weren't my mother." <words>193</words>

The dining hall's steam pipes hissed in rhythm with her breathing. <words>204</words>

She'd won that war, hadn't she? <words>210</words>

Sent her daughter to that rigid boarding school, erased every trace of rebellion, molded her into someone respectable. <words>228</words>

The girl returned home polished, proper, hollow-eyed. <words>235</words>

They never fought again. <words>239</words>

They never really spoke again, either. <words>245</words>

The mixtape reached a song she recognized—one she'd secretly loved but never admitted, too proud to bridge that chasm. <words>264</words>

Her daughter had known anyway, had included it between the angry punk anthems like an olive branch she'd been too blind to see. <words>287</words>

The hollow victory tasted like rust in her mouth. <words>296</words>

Around her, the dining hall's clockwork chandeliers ticked their measured time, but she existed outside it now, suspended in the space between who she'd been and who she'd forced herself to become. <words>328</words>

With savage grace, she smoothed the wrinkled sticker sheet, each crease a small betrayal she could never undo. <words>346</words>

Tomorrow, she would mail it to her daughter—not an apology, for some wounds cut too deep for words, but perhaps a beginning. <words>369</words>

The librarian tucked the mixtape back into her satchel, its weight both terrible and necessary. <words>384</words>

To bury an old hatred, she realized, sometimes meant excavating it first, examining its bones in the unforgiving light. <words>403</words>

She left the dining hall with her patient smile intact, but her eyes held something new—the fierce tenderness of someone learning to forgive herself. <words>428</words>
