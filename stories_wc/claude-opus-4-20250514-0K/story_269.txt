The nostalgic tailor pressed his weathered palm against the dusty mirror, watching his reflection splinter into countless versions of himself across the brass-rimmed surface. <words>20</words> Each fragment showed a different path—a soldier, a clockmaker, a madman—all the parallel lives he might have lived. <words>37</words>

"After the last code is broken," he whispered to the storm-darkened observation deck, "we all become what we were meant to be." <words>59</words> The steampunk platform groaned beneath him, its copper pipes hissing as lightning struck the tower's weathervane. <words>75</words>

His apprentice cowered behind the telescope mount, eyes wide with terror. <words>86</words> "Master Chen, the mirror—it's showing things that shouldn't exist." <words>95</words>

Chen turned, his scissors gleaming subtly menacing in the electric light. <words>106</words> "I must reassure you with an improbable confession," he said, his voice cutting through the thunder. <words>122</words> "I've stitched more than fabric in my years." <words>130</words> He gestured to his coat, where impossible seams connected patches from different eras, different worlds. <words>145</words> "Each thread I pull draws from another life I'm living." <words>155</words>

The apprentice gasped as Chen's reflection multiplied in the dusty mirror, each version moving independently. <words>170</words> "The Victorian gentleman there discovered immortality through textile," Chen continued, pointing. <words>181</words> "The revolutionary in that corner unraveled the fabric of reality itself." <words>192</words> His smile held equal parts hope and desperation. <words>200</words> "And I, the simple tailor, found the pattern that connects them all." <words>212</words>

Rain lashed against the observation deck's glass dome as Chen approached the mirror. <words>225</words> "The final code wasn't numbers or words—it was the weave of existence itself." <words>238</words> He touched a specific point on the glass, and the reflections began to merge. <words>252</words> "Each stitch I made in this life pulled threads from the others." <words>264</words>

"But why?" the apprentice asked, no longer trembling. <words>272</words>

"To ascend beyond mortal limits requires sacrifice from every possible self," Chen explained, his form beginning to shimmer. <words>289</words> The mirror cracked, releasing wisps of golden light that smelled of moth balls and machine oil. <words>305</words> "I've been preparing for centuries across infinite timelines." <words>313</words>

As the storm reached its crescendo, Chen's parallel selves stepped through the broken mirror. <words>327</words> The soldier, the clockmaker, the madman—all converging into one transcendent being. <words>338</words> "Don't fear what you're witnessing," he said gently. <words>346</words> "This is merely the threading of a needle through dimensions." <words>356</words>

His apprentice watched in awe as Master Chen began to glow, his human form dissolving into pure potential. <words>374</words> "Remember," Chen's voice echoed from everywhere and nowhere, "a good tailor knows that every ending is just another seam waiting to be sewn." <words>397</words>

The observation deck fell silent except for the rain, leaving only a needle suspended in midair where Chen had stood. <words>417</words> The apprentice reached for it, understanding at last that some patterns were meant to be continued. <words>433</words> In the dusty mirror's fragments, a thousand new reflections smiled back, each holding scissors and thread. <words>449</words>

The storm passed, but the possibilities remained infinite. <words>457</words>
