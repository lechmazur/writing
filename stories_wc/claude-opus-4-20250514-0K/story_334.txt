Marcus spun the brass top on the observatory's control panel, its gyroscopic dance reflecting in the monitors that tracked Earth's magnetic anomalies. <words>20</words> He'd been the station's sentinel for three years, confident that his artificially authentic reports kept the world blissfully unaware of what really pulsed through those field lines. <words>47</words>

The top wobbled, and reality flickered. <words>53</words>

Through the shimmer, Marcus glimpsed himself in another observatory—one where he'd chosen differently, where loyalty to truth had trumped loyalty to comfort. <words>75</words> That Marcus looked haggard, haunted by knowledge the public couldn't handle. <words>86</words> The vision dissolved as quickly as it appeared, leaving only the familiar hum of equipment and his own practiced smile. <words>106</words>

"Another quiet night," he murmured, typing false readings into the log. <words>117</words> The magnetic disturbances were intensifying, creating rifts that showed him infinite versions of this moment—some where he reported the truth, others where he buried it deeper. <words>143</words> Each glimpse lasted seconds, stolen moments of parallel possibilities that made him yelp involuntarily when they struck. <words>160</words>

His supervisor trusted him completely. <words>165</words> The public slept soundly, believing Earth's magnetic field remained stable. <words>175</words> But Marcus had seen the data, felt the tremors of something approaching—something that would shatter their mediocre peace. <words>193</words> He'd decided long ago to be exceptional in his deception, to steal thunder from the gods of mediocrity by crafting the most perfectly mundane reports. <words>218</words>

The top spun faster now, its point drilling into the desk as another rift opened. <words>233</words> This time, he saw himself standing before world leaders, warning them of the magnetic apocalypse. <words>249</words> They laughed at him, called him mad. <words>256</words> In another glimpse, he remained silent and watched cities fall. <words>266</words> The conflicting loyalties—to truth, to stability, to his own ego—pulled at him like the very magnetic forces he monitored. <words>285</words>

He'd chosen this path before anyone would cry, before the first tear would be shed over what was coming. <words>304</words> His fingers hesitated over the keyboard. <words>310</words> Tonight's readings showed unprecedented activity, patterns that matched his stolen glimpses of catastrophe. <words>324</words> The top slowed, teetered, fell silent. <words>330</words>

Marcus stared at the blank report field, cursor blinking with mysterious familiarity—he'd been here before, would be here again, across infinite observatories in infinite realities. <words>355</words> His overconfidence had always been a mask for the terror of knowing too much. <words>369</words> The magnetic field pulsed, offering another glimpse: himself, finally choosing truth, finally becoming authentically authentic. <words>385</words>

He began typing the real data, each keystroke a small rebellion against the comfortable lies he'd perfected. <words>402</words> Before the first tear is shed, someone must speak. <words>411</words> The top lay still, its spinning done, as Marcus prepared to wake the world. <words>425</words>
