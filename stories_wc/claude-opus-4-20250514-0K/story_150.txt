The outlaw cowboy poet Silas Kane adjusted his brass spyglass, peering through the steampunk observatory dome's crystalline panels at stars that shouldn't exist. <words>20</words> Throughout rehearsals for the Grand Celestial Exhibition, he'd noticed the virtually peculiar phenomenon: constellations rearranging themselves whenever he rolled his worn runic bone dice. <words>44</words>

The dice had belonged to his grandmother, a fortune-teller who'd warned him about intertwined destinies before her death. <words>62</words> Now, perched in the copper-piped observation chair, Silas watched the coffee shop walls below through the dome's magnification lenses. <words>81</words> The graffiti there kept changing text, morphing from mundane advertisements into cryptic verses that matched his own unwritten poems. <words>100</words>

"Stars above, words below, dice between," he muttered, rolling the yellowed bones across his palm. <words>115</words> Each rehearsal brought new changes—yesterday's wall had read "YOUR FATE SEEKS ANOTHER," while today's proclaimed "TWO SOULS, ONE VERSE UNFINISHED." <words>135</words>

The exhibition director called for positions, but Silas felt the pull to misalign the carefully choreographed star-mapping demonstration. <words>153</words> His role required precise movements, tracking celestial bodies through the dome's elaborate mechanical armatures. <words>167</words> Instead, he cast the dice. <words>172</words>

They clattered against brass grating, showing symbols that shouldn't exist on six-sided bones. <words>185</words> Below, the coffee shop walls erupted with text: "ELIZA TREMAINE AWAITS IN THE THIRD RING OF SATURN'S DANCE." <words>203</words>

Eliza—the astronomer-poet whose verses had haunted his dreams, whose destiny the dice insisted was bound to his. <words>220</words> She'd vanished during last season's exhibition, leaving only her annotated star charts and a single poem about outlaws who navigated by words instead of stars. <words>245</words>

Silas deliberately misaligned the telescope array, aiming not at designated constellations but at the chaotic space between. <words>261</words> The other performers gasped as stellar projections scattered wildly across the dome. <words>273</words> Yet within the chaos, a pattern emerged—star-words spelling verses that completed his unfinished poems. <words>288</words>

The coffee shop walls responded instantly, text racing across brick and mortar: "THE DICE REMEMBER WHAT THE STARS FORGET." <words>307</words> Silas understood then why his grandmother had bequeathed him these bones, why the rehearsals felt like practice for something greater. <words>327</words>

To spark unstoppable curiosity in others, he first had to surrender to his own. <words>341</words> The saturated ambivalence he'd felt—torn between outlaw freedom and cosmic purpose—dissolved as he read the final message appearing below: "YOUR POEMS ARE HER STAR MAPS HOME." <words>369</words>

Rolling the dice one last time, Silas smiled as they showed the same symbol twice: a star wrapped in words. <words>389</words> The intertwined destinies weren't just his and Eliza's, but those of every soul brave enough to misalign their prescribed paths and read the changing walls of the universe. <words>418</words>
