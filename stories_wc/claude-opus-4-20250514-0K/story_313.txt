Marcus rolled the empty tape dispenser between his fingers, its plastic wheel spinning freely where adhesive strips once lived. <words>16</words> The dystopian farm stretched endlessly beyond the compound's walls, rows of synthetic crops glowing faintly under artificial suns. <words>33</words> He'd been running small cons since the Resource Wars ended, but tonight felt different—heavier. <words>47</words>

"Story time," announced the overhead speaker, and Marcus shuffled toward the communal hall with the other workers. <words>64</words> But instead of joining them, he slipped into the abandoned greenhouse where he conducted his real business. <words>81</words> The empty dispenser had belonged to his last mark, an old woman who'd trusted him with her ration cards. <words>100</words> She'd used the last piece of tape to seal her goodbye letter before the Collectors took her. <words>117</words>

The lull of remorse pressed against his chest like a physical weight. <words>129</words> Marcus was unusually normal for a con artist—no grand ambitions, no master schemes, just small tricks to survive another day. <words>149</words> But survival had costs he'd never calculated. <words>156</words>

A shimmer in the air made him look up. <words>165</words> The old woman materialized, translucent and patient. <words>172</words> "You're not the first ghost tonight," Marcus said with mild fervor, trying to maintain his composure. <words>188</words> Three others had already appeared—all his marks from the past month. <words>199</words>

"Why?" <words>200</words> the woman asked simply. <words>204</words>

Marcus found himself interrogating them instead, desperate to understand why they'd returned. <words>216</words> "Don't you hate me?" <words>220</words> he demanded. <words>222</words> "I took everything you had left." <words>228</words>

"We had nothing left to take," another ghost whispered. <words>237</words> "You gave us something—hope that someone still cared enough to notice us." <words>249</words>

The revelation struck Marcus harder than any enforcer's baton. <words>258</words> His cons hadn't been thefts; they'd been connections. <words>266</words> In this sterile world of quotas and synthetic existence, even being swindled meant being seen. <words>281</words>

"I can't return what I took," Marcus said, clutching the dispenser. <words>292</words>

"Then comfort others," the old woman suggested, already fading. <words>301</words> "Use your skills differently." <words>305</words>

As the ghosts dissipated, Marcus understood. <words>311</words> He'd spent years taunting the jaws of defeat and grinning, thinking cleverness meant survival. <words>325</words> But on this farm where humanity withered like untended crops, perhaps the greatest con was making people feel human again. <words>345</words>

He pocketed the empty dispenser—a reminder that even depleted things once served a purpose. <words>359</words> Tomorrow, during story time, he'd spin tales that picked pockets of despair instead of credits. <words>374</words> The compound needed a new kind of con artist, one who trafficked in hope. <words>388</words> Marcus smiled genuinely for the first time in years, ready to pull his greatest swindle yet—making life worth living. <words>407</words>
