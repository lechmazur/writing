Mara arranged the funeral lilies with practiced precision, her neutrally passionate demeanor masking the questions that plagued her nights. <words>17</words> The morbid florist had served the floating rock dojo for decades, crafting wreaths for masters who transcended mortality through meditation. <words>36</words> Yet she remained earthbound, her tempered beliefs caught between the material world of stems and petals and the ethereal promises of enlightenment. <words>58</words>

Tonight, she climbed the carved steps to Master Chen's abandoned chamber, a plain white candle trembling in her grip. <words>77</words> The room held only dust and a weathered trunk overflowing with typed pages—the backlog of Chen's philosophical writings. <words>95</words> In the last flicker of a guttering lantern, shadows danced across walls inscribed with cosmic diagrams. <words>111</words>

"You seek understanding," a voice whispered. <words>117</words>

Mara turned to find Novice Jun, the dojo's youngest student, watching her with knowing eyes. <words>133</words> "Master Chen requested you oblige his final wish," Jun continued, gesturing to the trunk. <words>148</words> "He said the florist who prepares souls for departure might comprehend what others cannot." <words>162</words>

With boldly timid movements, Mara knelt before the trunk and lifted the first yellowed page. <words>178</words> Chen's words spoke of death as transformation, of cosmic cycles that rendered mortality meaningless yet precious. <words>195</words> Each page revealed how her work—arranging flowers for the dead—mirrored the universe's constant reshaping of matter into new forms. <words>215</words>

Hours passed as she read, the plain white candle burning lower, its wax pooling like temporal boundaries dissolving. <words>234</words> The floating rock beneath them hummed with ancient energy, and Mara felt her tempered beliefs shifting, expanding. <words>252</words> She wasn't merely a morbid florist; she was a curator of transitions, a witness to the eternal dance between form and formlessness. <words>275</words>

"Death feeds life," she murmured, understanding blooming like the flowers she'd arranged on countless caskets. <words>291</words> "Life feeds death. <words>294</words> The cycle never breaks, only bends." <words>300</words>

Jun smiled, his young face suddenly ancient. <words>307</words> "Master Chen knew you would understand. <words>313</words> Your neutrally passionate nature allows you to see without attachment, to touch death daily without fear or fascination." <words>331</words>

As the guttering lantern finally died, Mara stood transformed. <words>340</words> The plain white candle had burned to nothing, but its light lived on in her comprehension. <words>357</words> She descended the steps with purpose, knowing tomorrow she would arrange flowers differently—not as endings but as punctuation marks in an infinite sentence. <words>381</words> The cosmic cycles Chen described weren't abstract philosophy but the very breath of existence, inhaled and exhaled through every petal she placed, every soul she honored with her morbid yet sacred art. <words>414</words>
