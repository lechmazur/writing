The town-weary traveler pressed her palm against the carnival's rusted gate, hearing only the metal sign tapping its morse code against the frame in the coastal wind. <words>22</words> Years of wandering had taught her that some doors open themselves when touched with the right kind of exhaustion. <words>40</words> This one did. <words>43</words>

Inside the abandoned house of mirrors, salt air had oxidized the reflections into abstract smears. <words>58</words> She moved through the maze of warped glass, each panel showing her a different version of what she might have been. <words>79</words> The tapping from outside followed her like a metronome, its rhythm intentionally accidental—the way the universe speaks when it pretends not to care. <words>103</words>

At the maze's heart, she found it: a stained glass panel depicting a woman's hands cupping darkness studded with stars. <words>124</words> The cradle of sparks, she thought, recognizing the image from dreams that had driven her from town after suffocating town. <words>144</words> The glass hummed with potential, waiting. <words>150</words>

She understood then that the tapping wasn't random. <words>158</words> Each strike of metal on metal sent vibrations through the carnival's skeleton, through the mirrors, into this singular panel. <words>177</words> The sound waves fertilized something dormant in the glass, coaxing light from its leaded seams. <words>192</words>

Years of running had brought her here, to this moment of hammered repose—not peace exactly, but a bruised kind of stillness. <words>214</words> She'd fled the confines of her mind only to discover that geography couldn't cure what lived inside her skull. <words>233</words> But this place, this intentional accident of abandonment and weather, offered something else. <words>247</words>

The stained glass woman's hands began to glow. <words>255</words> Not with external light—the carnival had no power—but with an inner radiance that pulled at something behind the traveler's ribs. <words>276</words> She pressed her forehead against the panel, feeling its coolness, its patient accumulation of coastal storms and tapped-out messages. <words>296</words>

In the hush before someone finally says, "I love you," there exists a peculiar silence. <words>312</words> She'd lived in that silence for years, waiting for someone else to break it. <words>327</words> But here, surrounded by infinite fractured selves, she understood. <words>336</words> The tapping intensified, and with each strike, another spark bloomed in the glass woman's palms. <words>351</words>

"I love you," she whispered to her thousand reflections, to the worn body that had carried her this far. <words>371</words> The words fertilized the air itself, and the stained glass panel shattered—not into sharp edges but into light. <words>390</words> The sparks scattered through the mirrors, multiplying infinitely, until the abandoned carnival blazed with the peculiar fire of self-recognition. <words>409</words> The traveler stood in the ruins of her old geography, finally home in the only place that mattered—the acceptance blooming behind her eyes. <words>433</words>
