The elusive puppeteer stood amid dusty shelves, examining the plain ring that controlled the forgotten lighthouse library's ancestral records. <words>17</words> His fingers traced its specifically universal design—a pattern that appeared in every culture's mythology, yet belonged to none. <words>35</words> 

"The rain comes," he announced to the empty reading room, his voice carrying absurd solemnity. <words>50</words> For centuries, his kind had tracked rain patterns to determine when the library would reveal its secrets. <words>67</words> Today's downpour matched the ancient meteorological blueprint perfectly. <words>75</words>

He began to paddle through the flooded lower archives, where seawater had breached during high tide. <words>91</words> The lighthouse had been built to water the seeds of curiosity in those brave enough to seek truth. <words>109</words> Each stroke of his makeshift oar disturbed centuries of sediment, unveiling the ancestors' waterproofed scrolls beneath. <words>125</words>

Throughout tailgating season, when crowds gathered outside for football festivities, the puppeteer worked alone inside. <words>140</words> The revelers' noise masked the mechanical grinding as hidden gears turned, triggered by his ring's proximity to specific shelves. <words>159</words> Stone panels slid aside, revealing genealogical charts that connected every human to a single primordial source. <words>175</words>

"Specifically universal," he muttered, understanding dawning. <words>181</words> The ring wasn't just a key—it was a genetic marker, passed through bloodlines of knowledge-keepers. <words>197</words> His ancestors had built this repository knowing that someday, someone would need proof of humanity's shared origins. <words>214</words>

Water dripped from ancient texts as he lifted them carefully. <words>224</words> Each page revealed another branch of the human family tree, meticulously documented by lighthouse keepers who tracked more than ships. <words>244</words> They had tracked rain patterns because water, like blood, connected all living things. <words>257</words>

The puppeteer's true nature emerged as he worked—not someone who controlled others, but one who pulled invisible strings connecting past to present. <words>280</words> His elusiveness stemmed from necessity; those who unveiled the ancestors often faced resistance from people preferring division to unity. <words>299</words>

As tailgaters cheered outside, celebrating tribal victories, he paddled deeper into flooded chambers. <words>312</words> The specifically universal truth waited at the lighthouse's heart: a massive family tree carved in stone, showing how every human shared common ancestors. <words>336</words> The plain ring glowed faintly, responding to his DNA, confirming his place in the eternal lineage. <words>352</words>

Rain intensified, as predicted by the ancient tracking system. <words>361</words> The puppeteer smiled with absurd solemnity, knowing he'd finally watered the seeds of curiosity his ancestors had planted. <words>379</words> Tomorrow, when the tailgaters departed and the waters receded, he would share what the lighthouse library had unveiled. <words>397</words> Humanity's story was specifically universal—unique to Earth, yet encompassing every soul who'd ever lived. <words>411</words>
