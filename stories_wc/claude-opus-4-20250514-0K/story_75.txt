The minstrel Korvain crouched between towering moss spires in the nano-forest, his fingers trembling over a plain plastic bookmark. <words>19</words> The bookmark held encrypted text—wedding vows that should have united the resistance twenty years ago, before the Silencing. <words>36</words>

He'd spent decades learning extinct crafts: cryptography, analog music, the art of remembering. <words>49</words> Each skill was a weapon against the Council's digital tyranny, each song a seed for grassroots movements that sprouted in whispered gatherings. <words>71</words> But Korvain remained guarded, skeptically credulous of every promise of revolution, having seen too many crushed beneath surveillance algorithms. <words>90</words>

The nano-forest hummed with engineered life, each synthetic leaf a camera, each root a data conduit. <words>106</words> Here, in this manufactured wilderness no larger than a city block, rebels met to exchange forbidden knowledge. <words>123</words> Korvain's lute hung silent on his back—playing it would trigger the sensors. <words>136</words>

The bookmark's surface shimmered as his decryption key worked through layers of code. <words>149</words> These vows belonged to Elena and Marcus, leaders who'd promised to bind the scattered cells through marriage, through symbol, through hope. <words>171</words> Instead, Elena had vanished the night before the ceremony, taking with her the movement's momentum. <words>186</words>

Letters materialized: "I cannot marry our cause to bloodshed." <words>195</words>

Korvain's jaw clenched. <words>198</words> Elena had written these words in her hidden diary—he'd found it last week in the ruins of the old safehouse. <words>218</words> The final entry, her last vow to the revolution: "I disown violence, but not change." <words>234</words>

Anger coursed through him, but it was a strange, peaceful rage. <words>245</words> She'd abandoned them not from cowardice but principle. <words>253</words> The movement had survived, evolved, grown beyond her vision into something harder, sharper. <words>266</words>

A rustling made him freeze. <words>271</words> Through the synthetic canopy, a young woman approached, her eyes holding that same skeptically credulous gleam he recognized in revolutionaries. <words>291</words> She wore the mark of the new generation—those who'd never known the world before the Silencing. <words>307</words>

"You're the keeper of old songs," she whispered. <words>315</words>

Korvain nodded, pocketing the bookmark. <words>320</words> Elena's encrypted confession would remain his secret. <words>327</words> The movement needed its myths intact, its martyrs unblemished. <words>336</words>

"Teach me," the woman said. <words>341</words> "The Council's grip weakens. <words>345</words> The roots are finally listening to us instead of them." <words>355</words>

He studied her face, finding determination unmarred by decades of disappointment. <words>366</words> Perhaps this time would be different. <words>372</words> Perhaps the grassroots would finally choke out the artificial garden. <words>382</words>

"First lesson," Korvain said, his guarded heart cracking slightly open. <words>392</words> "Revolution isn't in the grand gestures. <words>398</words> It's in the small acts of remembering what they want us to forget." <words>412</words>

The nano-forest swayed, and somewhere in its depths, a real bird sang. <words>425</words>
