The minstrel's broken watch band dangled like a question mark against the black velvet sky-lounge's obsidian floor. <words>17</words> Above the endless city, where neon rivers carved through concrete canyons, she sat dismayed among scattered polaroid photographs. <words>35</words> Each image held fragments of the night garden that existed between moments—roses blooming in streetlight halos, vines threading through fire escapes. <words>57</words>

"Boundaries," she muttered, tracing her finger across a photo's edge where reality blurred into something else. <words>73</words> Her job was subjectively rational: map the unmappable, chart where day surrendered to permanent twilight. <words>88</words> The city below never slept, never woke, just breathed in electric sighs. <words>100</words>

She excavated memories from the polaroids like an archaeologist of the impossible. <words>112</words> Here, a clock tower frozen at midnight; there, a garden gate that opened onto starlit alleys. <words>129</words> The photographs were her only proof that the secret gardens existed—those pockets where time forgot its purpose. <words>147</words>

The lounge itself defied physics, suspended on nothing but collective belief. <words>158</words> Its patrons sipped cosmos while the cosmos sipped them back. <words>169</words> She'd played here once, before the city expanded beyond horizons, before her songs became searches. <words>185</words>

A polaroid slipped from her fingers, landing face-up: her younger self, guitar in hand, standing before a wall of moonflowers. <words>206</words> The watch on her wrist still whole, still counting moments that mattered. <words>219</words> Now she understood—the gardens weren't hidden; they were the spaces between boundaries, the pauses between notes. <words>236</words>

She arranged the photographs in constellation patterns across the floor. <words>246</words> Each image connected to another by invisible threads of possibility. <words>256</words> The broken watch band became her compass needle, pointing toward temporal fractures. <words>268</words>

"Every map needs edges," she said to the empty lounge, her voice carrying laconic exuberance. <words>283</words> "Even endless ones." <words>286</words>

The city's lights began forming patterns only she could read. <words>297</words> Street grids became musical staves; traffic flows became melodies. <words>306</words> She pulled out her guitar, its strings still remembering garden songs. <words>317</words>

As she played, the polaroids lifted, swirling in impossible drafts. <words>327</words> They revealed what she'd always known: the night wasn't endless—it was infinite, folding back on itself like origami darkness. <words>347</words> The gardens existed in every crease. <words>353</words>

Her map took shape in music rather than lines. <words>362</words> Each chord drew boundaries that bent rather than broke. <words>371</words> The sky-lounge trembled with recognition. <words>376</words>

She smiled, no longer dismayed. <words>381</words> The broken watch band had freed her from linear time. <words>391</words> Now she could navigate the endless night by its own subjectively rational rules. <words>404</words> The secret gardens bloomed wherever her songs reached, transforming the city's electronic pulse into something wilder, something true. <words>422</words>
