The navigation room of the Voidreaper hummed with stolen constellations, where Captain Zara Thorne rolled her telekinetic dice across a fragment of medieval tapestry. <words>22</words> The dice tumbled through empty air, guided by her mind, landing on the dragon-emblazoned cloth with unnatural precision. <words>39</words> Each throw was a gamble against extinction itself—her crew's last hope of decoding the agricultural coordinates hidden in Earth's lost languages. <words>60</words>

"The Terran seed vaults," she whispered, studying the tapestry's faded runes. <words>71</words> Her grandfather had stolen it from a museum ship decades ago, recognizing symbols from humanity's abandoned farming colonies. <words>89</words> The dice weren't mere instruments of chance; they were navigation tools, each face inscribed with fragments of dead alphabets that resonated with the tapestry's ancient weave. <words>115</words>

Around her, the crew exchanged whispered secrets about the location of fertile worlds. <words>128</words> The Corporation had systematically destroyed traditional farming knowledge, forcing colonies to depend on synthetic nutrition that weakened each generation. <words>148</words> But Zara was philosophically practical—she believed survival required both ancient wisdom and modern piracy. <words>162</words>

She focused her telekinesis, and the dice danced above the dragon's embroidered flames. <words>175</words> The combination revealed coordinates in a script that hadn't been spoken for centuries. <words>188</words> "Set course for the Demeter System," she commanded. <words>196</words>

Her first mate, Koji, traced the navigation hologram with scarred fingers. <words>207</words> "Captain, that's deep in Corporation territory." <words>213</words>

"Every world we save gets a tree," Zara replied, touching the small bonsai magnetized to her console. <words>230</words> It was her family's tradition—one tree for each new member of their scattered rebellion. <words>245</words> Her grandmother had planted the first when they fled Earth's agricultural collapse. <words>257</words> Now their forest grew across hidden stations, each tree carrying genetic memories of lost crops. <words>273</words>

The dice spun again, this time igniting holographic flames that merged with the tapestry's dragons. <words>288</words> The navigation room erupted in sacred disorder as star charts collided with medieval mythology, revealing trade routes that connected ancient Earth to distant colonies through linguistic breadcrumbs. <words>315</words>

"The Corporation thinks they've erased our roots," Zara murmured, watching her dice settle into a pattern that matched the dragon's scales. <words>336</words> "But languages are seeds—bury them deep enough, and they'll always find a way to grow." <words>352</words>

She pressed her palm against the tapestry, feeling the warmth of centuries-old thread. <words>365</words> Her telekinetic gift wasn't just for gambling; it was for reading the quantum echoes of human knowledge embedded in ancient artifacts. <words>387</words> The dice rose one final time, spelling out coordinates in cuneiform, Sanskrit, and Ogham. <words>401</words>

"Prepare for jump," she announced. <words>406</words> "We're bringing the harvest home." <words>411</words>

The Voidreaper's engines roared to life, carrying their sacred disorder toward worlds where dragons once meant rain, and dice could still divine the future of seeds. <words>438</words>
