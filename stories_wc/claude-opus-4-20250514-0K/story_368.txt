The orchard temple appeared through morning mist, its crumbling walls strangled by fruit-laden vines that bloomed in defiance of winter's grip. <words>18</words> Kira approached with the confident uncertainty of someone who had survived too much to fear ghosts, yet knew better than to trust appearances. <words>40</words> The cursed cameo brooch burned cold against her chest, its ivory profile depicting a woman whose expression seemed to shift when viewed peripherally. <words>64</words>

She'd stolen it three days ago from a merchant who claimed it showed futures that never came to pass—theoretically random glimpses of what might have been. <words>91</words> But Kira had discovered its true nature: the brooch didn't show random futures at all. <words>107</words> It revealed the past through reversed patterns, each vision a mirror-image of history playing backwards. <words>123</words>

Inside the temple, pomegranates hung heavy from twisted branches that had grown through gaps in the stone ceiling. <words>142</words> Their seeds glowed faintly in the half-light, and Kira understood why she'd been drawn here. <words>158</words> This place existed across an unwritten calendar, where seasons meant nothing and time folded upon itself like origami. <words>177</words>

She pressed her palm against the brooch, and immediately the world inverted. <words>190</words> She saw the temple in its glory—monks walking backwards through doorways, un-lighting candles, un-speaking prayers. <words>206</words> Then further back: the builders un-laying stones, architects un-drawing plans, until she witnessed the first seed being un-planted in virgin soil. <words>229</words>

The vision shattered when she heard it—a distant echo of laughter that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. <words>249</words> Not an echo of sound, but of joy itself, reverberating through dimensions. <words>262</words> It was the laughter of the temple's children, orphans like herself who had once found sanctuary here before time reversed their existence. <words>285</words>

Kira understood then what she must do. <words>293</words> To harvest hope from darkness meant accepting that some futures could only be reached by walking backwards through pain. <words>313</words> She removed the brooch and hung it on a pomegranate branch, where it caught the light like a frozen teardrop. <words>334</words>

The curse broke with the soft sound of fruit falling upward. <words>346</words> Time stuttered, contracted, then expanded in all directions at once. <words>356</words> The temple began to rebuild itself, stones rising from dust, murals brightening on walls, bells un-rusting in towers. <words>375</words> And in that space between destruction and creation, between past and future, Kira felt the other orphans reaching through the veil—not as ghosts, but as possibilities waiting to be born. <words>407</words>

She smiled, understanding that her streetwise cynicism had been the key all along. <words>421</words> Only someone who expected nothing could see everything. <words>429</words> The temple doors opened inward and outward simultaneously, welcoming her to a home that existed in every moment except now. <words>450</words> She stepped through, confident in her uncertainty, ready to tend an orchard that grew backwards into hope. <words>468</words>
