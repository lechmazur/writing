The meek blacksmith Corwin descended the algae-slick stairs to the underwater city planning office, clutching his waterproofed softcover dictionary like a talisman. <words>20</words> In this drowned metropolis where buildings wore barnacles like jewelry, words had become currency, and definitions shifted like tides. <words>38</words> The office existed in plain sight beneath the harbor, openly hidden from those who never thought to look down. <words>58</words>

Commissioner Delacroix waited at her coral desk, surrounded by blueprints for cities that would never rise. <words>74</words> "You've brought it," she said, eyeing the dictionary. <words>83</words> "The unfinished bargain your grandfather started sixty years ago." <words>92</words>

Corwin nodded, remembering the hitchhikers who'd passed through his forge over decades, each carrying fragments of the same impossible story. <words>112</words> He'd verified their tales one by one: a sunken city where heartbreak powered the generators, where grief illuminated the streets. <words>133</words> His grandfather had promised to deliver a dictionary that could translate sorrow into light, but died before completing the exchange. <words>154</words>

"I've added the missing words," Corwin said, his voice barely disturbing the office's pressurized silence. <words>170</words> Each definition he'd written glowed faintly through the pages—words for thirteen shades of longing, twenty-seven varieties of loss. <words>189</words> The hitchhikers had taught him these distinctions, payment for horseshoes and harbor repairs. <words>202</words>

Delacroix opened the book, and phosphorescent text spiraled upward like disturbed plankton. <words>214</words> "Your grandfather understood that our city runs on refined sadness," she said. <words>227</words> "But he couldn't bear to complete his work after your grandmother died." <words>239</words>

"He never told me," Corwin whispered. <words>245</words>

"The heartbreak would have powered our streets for a century." <words>255</words> She traced a finger across a definition. <words>262</words> "Instead, we've subsisted on smaller griefs, collected drop by drop." <words>272</words>

Across the hush of time's final ripple, Corwin saw his choice clearly. <words>284</words> The dictionary contained enough concentrated sorrow to ignite the city's cold engines forever. <words>297</words> His own heartbreak—a lifetime of loneliness in the forge, of chances not taken—saturated every page. <words>313</words>

"Will you complete what he began?" <words>319</words> Delacroix asked. <words>321</words>

Corwin thought of the hitchhikers' stories, how they'd described the city's luminous regret—streets that shimmered with old tears transformed into light. <words>343</words> He thought of his grandfather, unable to transmute his grief into something useful. <words>356</words> The unfinished bargain had waited three generations for someone weak enough to let go, strong enough to give their pain purpose. <words>378</words>

He pushed the dictionary across the desk. <words>385</words> "Light your city," he said. <words>390</words>

As Delacroix pressed her palm to the cover, the pages ignited with cold fire, and throughout the drowned metropolis, streetlamps bloomed like anemones fed on sorrow. <words>416</words> Corwin climbed back to his forge, emptied but somehow illuminated, knowing his heartbreak now lit the way for others lost beneath the waves. <words>440</words>
