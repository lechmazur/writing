Marina's fingertips traced the dusty counter of the abandoned carnival shooting gallery, her gift for hearing the dead stirring as autumn wind rattled through broken targets. <words>24</words> Years of diving shipwrecks had taught her to listen for whispers beneath surfaces, but here, surrounded by rusted rifles and shattered prizes, the voices came unbidden. <words>50</words>

She clutched the amber pendant—her grandmother's final gift—watching the prehistoric mosquito suspended within catch fading light through gaps in the rotting tent. <words>73</words> Every October, three generations of women had gathered here before the carnival closed, teaching daughters to shoot straight and speak truth. <words>94</words> Now Marina came alone, stepping finally from her mother's towering shadow, that legendary salvage diver who'd never believed in ghosts. <words>114</words>

"You came," whispered a familiar voice, joyfully melancholic in its ethereal timber. <words>126</words>

Marina's heart, frozen since the diving accident that claimed her mother, began its painful thaw. <words>141</words> She'd been writing a letter of goodbye to this place when the call came—half-finished words about endings suddenly becoming about beginnings. <words>164</words>

"I had to," Marina replied to the air, her rebellion fleeting but necessary. <words>178</words> "The family tradition dies with me otherwise." <words>185</words>

The ghost of her grandmother materialized between the bent metal ducks, translucent and smiling. <words>199</words> "Traditions evolve, child. Your mother heard shipwrecks sing; you hear their drowned. Both gifts honor our line." <words>216</words>

Marina touched a rifle, rust flaking beneath her fingers like scales from ancient fish. <words>231</words> The amber grew warm against her chest, arousing memories of childhood victories here—perfect shots winning stuffed bears while grandmother whispered secrets about seeing beyond veils. <words>256</words>

"Mom thought I was crazy," Marina said, tears cutting channels through salt-dried cheeks. <words>269</words>

"She thought you were powerful," her grandmother corrected. <words>277</words> "Too powerful for her rational world. Between the lines of that letter you're writing, read her fear of losing you to gifts she couldn't understand." <words>302</words>

Marina loaded the ancient rifle with phantom ammunition, muscle memory guiding hands that knew both triggers and diving equipment. <words>321</words> She aimed at the last intact target—a painted ship sailing forever toward a painted horizon. <words>337</words>

"I choose both worlds," she declared, firing. <words>344</words>

The shot echoed impossibly in the dead gallery, arousing a chorus of carnival ghosts who'd waited decades for someone to bridge their realm. <words>368</words> The amber cracked, releasing its prisoner after millions of years, but the insect transformed into light before dissolving. <words>386</words>

Her grandmother faded with the sunset, but her words remained: "Now you're free to dive both seas—the living and the dead." <words>408</words>

Marina pocketed the broken amber and walked toward her boat, ready to finish the letter that would announce her new salvage company: one that honored both the treasures and the spirits below. <words>440</words>

The carnival sighed behind her, finally at peace. <words>448</words>

Her heart, fully thawed, beat with purpose. <words>455</words>
