The fortune teller's scarves caught firelight as she zigzagged between the longhouse's massive oak pillars, each step calculated to avoid the Nordic runes carved deep into the floorboards. <words>24</words> Her amber inkwell gleamed at her hip, suspended from a belt of hammered silver coins that chimed with modestly flashy persistence. <words>44</words> This was no ordinary Viking hall—it had been transformed through centuries of neglect into something altogether different, a sanctuary where emotional patterns crystallized like frost on abandoned shields. <words>72</words>

Through the hush of an overlooked era, when empires rose and fell beyond these timbered walls, she had made this place her archive. <words>95</words> The rogue fortune teller, known only as Seidr, collected not prophecies but the invisible threads that bound heart to heart. <words>115</words> Her true gift lay in preserving what others discarded: the flutter of jealousy, the weight of unspoken love, the bitter aftertaste of betrayal. <words>139</words>

Tonight's visitor approached with measured steps, a wine merchant whose reputation preceded him like morning mist. <words>155</words> They sat across from each other at the ancient feasting table, its surface scarred by centuries of celebration and conflict. <words>175</words> Between them, she placed two horn cups and a bottle of mead infused with wild herbs—a shared love for wine tasting would open doors that words could not. <words>204</words>

"You seek something," Seidr said, her voice maintaining the fierce repose of a predator at rest. <words>220</words>

The merchant's fingers traced the cup's rim. <words>227</words> "I've heard you archive more than fortunes." <words>234</words>

She uncapped her amber inkwell, releasing the scent of pine resin and something older, deeper. <words>249</words> The liquid inside swirled with impossible colors, each shade a different emotion trapped in perpetual motion. <words>266</words> "Some offers are better left unspoken," she said, dipping her bone stylus into the amber depths. <words>282</words>

He leaned forward, understanding flickering across his weathered features. <words>291</words> The unspoken offer hung between them like smoke from the central fire pit: his memory of first love, perfectly preserved, in exchange for safe passage through territories where her name still carried weight. <words>325</words>

Seidr began to write on vellum that seemed to drink the amber ink hungrily. <words>339</words> Each stroke captured not just words but the texture of feeling—the catch in his throat when he spoke her name, the particular shade of sunset that reminded him of her hair. <words>371</words>

As the last drop of mead disappeared, so too did the weight he'd carried for decades. <words>387</words> The emotion now lived in her archive, safe among thousands of others, each a testament to the human heart's infinite variations. <words>409</words>

The merchant departed through the longhouse's towering doors, lighter yet somehow hollow. <words>421</words> Seidr remained in her fierce repose, guardian of feelings that outlasted the warriors who once feasted here. <words>438</words> In this overlooked era, she alone understood that emotions, properly preserved, were the only true immortality. <words>454</words>

Tomorrow would bring another seeker, another unspoken offer, another pattern to archive in amber ink. <words>469</words> The rogue fortune teller smiled, her scarves settling around her like colorful ghosts. <words>482</words> This was her saga, written not in blood but in the invisible ink of the heart. <words>498</words>
