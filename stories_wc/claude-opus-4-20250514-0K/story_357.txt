Margot pressed the black rose deeper into her journal, its preserved petals crackling against pages filled with meticulous notes about ice formations. <words>19</words> She'd been tracking the frost giant's hibernation patterns for three winters now, alone in her observation post carved into the mountainside. <words>39</words> The solitude suited her perfectly—no distractions from colleagues, no small talk, just her and the data. <words>56</words>

The invitation arrived via raven, naturally. <words>62</words> "Dearest Collector," it read, "your presence is requested for the Annual Predator's Ball at the Giant's Lair. <words>79</words> Board games commence at moonrise." <words>84</words>

She laughed, a sharp bark that echoed off ice walls. <words>95</words> A party? <words>97</words> In the frost giant's actual home? <words>103</words> The giant who'd been dormant for six months? <words>111</words> Curiosity won over hermitic tendencies. <words>116</words>

The lair hummed with impossible warmth, crowded with creatures Margot recognized from her field guides: dire wolves in bow ties, elegantly dressed yetis, even a basilisk wearing spectacles. <words>144</words> The frost giant himself dealt cards at a massive table, very much awake and hosting with theatrical flair. <words>162</words>

"Welcome, focused one!" he boomed. <words>167</words> "I've watched you watching me. <words>172</words> Time to play." <words>175</words>

The game unfolded in rounds—each piece moved revealed another player's deepest struggle. <words>187</words> A phoenix confessed to fearing rebirth. <words>193</words> A dragon admitted hoarding emptiness instead of gold. <words>201</words> When Margot's turn came, the board transformed into a mirror maze. <words>212</words>

"Your move," the giant said gently. <words>218</words> "What predator stalks the solitary?" <words>223</words>

She touched her journal, feeling the black rose's outline through leather. <words>234</words> "Despair," she admitted. <words>237</words> "It tells me isolation is wisdom, but sometimes—" <words>245</words>

"Sometimes it's just fear wearing a clever disguise," the basilisk finished. <words>256</words>

Round by round, the game unraveled her carefully constructed walls. <words>266</words> These creatures weren't interruptions or distractions—they were fellow warriors against their own alpha predators. <words>281</words> The giant's lair, she realized, wasn't about conquering loneliness but choosing when solitude served and when it strangled. <words>299</words>

By dawn, Margot had won three games and lost five, each defeat teaching her something valuable about balance. <words>317</words> The black rose in her journal no longer felt like a memorial to isolation but a reminder—beauty could be shared without losing its power. <words>341</words>

"Same time next winter?" the giant asked as guests departed. <words>351</words>

Margot nodded, tucking her journal away. <words>357</words> "I'll bring the tea." <words>361</words>

She returned to her observation post, but now her notes included sketches of laughing wolves and strategic board positions. <words>380</words> Solitude remained her preferred companion, but she'd learned the difference between choosing it and being chosen by it. <words>398</words> The frost giant's secret wasn't defeating despair—it was knowing when to open the door. <words>413</words>
