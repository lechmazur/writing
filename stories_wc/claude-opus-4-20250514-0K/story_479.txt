Vivienne Mortellier adjusted her sequined mourning veil while scrolling through her grandmother's archived MySpace page, the brass measuring tape gleaming against her manicured fingers. <words>20</words> The social network's fossilized HTML preserved conversations from 2006, when Grand-mère Céleste had documented their family's peculiar tradition: measuring the deceased not for coffins, but for something far more extraordinary. <words>53</words>

"The myth of ordinariness," Céleste had typed in broken English, "is what kills the spirit before body dies." <words>71</words> Vivienne understood now why she'd been summoned to the funeral home's paint-mixing room at precisely 3:33 AM. <words>89</words> The industrial mixer churned Caribbean Teal and Sunset Orange—colors no respectable undertaker would choose, yet here she was, glamorous in her grief, following instructions left in a private message thread. <words>119</words>

She'd been fruitlessly patient for years, waiting for someone to explain why the Mortellier women measured corpses with antique brass, why they mixed paints during sacred preparations, why they believed death could elongate more than just memory. <words>157</words> The archived conversations revealed everything: their ancestor Madame Élodie Mortellier, circus performer turned undertaker in 1891 Paris, had discovered that certain measurements, taken at specific moments, could stretch the departed's final dream into eternity. <words>193</words>

"Each millimeter matters," Céleste's post continued, beneath a glittering GIF of dancing skeletons. <words>206</words> "We measure not the flesh but the space between who they were and who they dreamed to be." <words>225</words> Vivienne's hands trembled with jubilant remorse as she recognized the truth—every glamorous funeral she'd orchestrated had been incomplete without this knowledge. <words>247</words>

The paint mixer's rhythm matched her heartbeat as she unspooled the brass tape across the preparation table. <words>264</words> Tomorrow, Mrs. Chen would be buried in a standard casket, but tonight, Vivienne would measure the vast dimensions of her unfulfilled ambitions, her suppressed adventures, her ordinary life's extraordinary potential. <words>294</words> The measurements would be encoded in the paint swirls on the casket's lining—invisible to mourners but eternal in their purpose. <words>314</words>

Vivienne felt the centuries of Mortellier women guiding her movements, their collective wisdom downloaded through a dead social network's servers. <words>334</words> She thought of all the bodies she'd prepared without this knowledge, all the dreams she'd let dissipate unmeasured. <words>352</words> But now, elongating Mrs. Chen's essence into the infinite, she understood why they mixed joy with sorrow, why they dressed death in sequins and color. <words>378</words>

The brass tape retracted with a satisfying click. <words>386</words> Vivienne uploaded her own measurements to the archive, preserving the ancient practice in cached data and mixing paint, ensuring no Mortellier woman would ever practice ordinary undertaking again. <words>414</words> The myth of ordinariness had died tonight, measured precisely and buried in beauty. <words>428</words>
