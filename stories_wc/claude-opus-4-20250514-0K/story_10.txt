The cheerless duelist stood in the abandoned spaceport customs office, her fingers trembling over the maggoty wooden chest that rattled with each thunderous hum from the adjacent server rooms. <words>24</words> Vera had tracked this chest across three systems, following whispers of her grandmother's lost recipes—formulas that could elasticize reality itself through molecular gastronomy. <words>48</words>

Her fatal flaw had always been pride. <words>55</words> She'd killed seventeen opponents in sanctioned duels, each death justified by honor codes she no longer believed in. <words>73</words> The chest's lock clicked open, revealing not recipes but holoprojections: her grandmother's face, twisted with disappointment. <words>89</words>

"You inherited my precision but not my mercy," the recording whispered. <words>100</words> "These recipes respond only to those who understand forgiveness." <words>109</words>

Vera's hands moved through the holographic instructions, watching ingredients transform through unexpected mutations—salt becoming memory, sugar becoming regret. <words>128</words> Each recipe bore names of her victims. <words>135</words> The first read "Chen's Lament: Braised Peace with Reduction of What Could Have Been." <words>149</words>

She prepared it mechanically, her duelist's precision serving her even as tears blurred her vision. <words>164</words> The dish elasticized before her eyes, stretching into impossible geometries that showed Chen's daughter, now orphaned, learning to smile again at her uncle's jokes. <words>188</words>

Recipe after recipe, she cooked through her kills. <words>196</words> Each meal revealed lives that continued despite her violence, people who learned to forgive what she couldn't forgive in herself. <words>216</words> The mutations were precisely innovative—flavors that bent time, textures that whispered alternate futures where she'd chosen differently. <words>233</words>

The server rooms hummed their eternal song as she reached the final recipe: "Vera's Choice: Self-Forgiveness Flambéed in Tomorrow's Promise." <words>253</words> Her grandmother's image flickered beside her. <words>259</words>

"Fatal flaws need not be fatal forever," the projection said. <words>269</words> "I killed too, child. <words>273</words> The recipes came after I learned to transform my guilt into purpose." <words>285</words>

Vera prepared her own dish with shaking hands, watching her reflection elasticize in the pan's surface—stretching between who she was and who she could become. <words>310</words> The taste was bittersweet reckoning incarnate: sharp with remorse, sweet with possibility. <words>322</words>

As she swallowed, the chest stopped rattling. <words>329</words> The maggots transformed into butterflies, dispersing through the customs office's broken windows into the starlit void. <words>345</words> She understood now—her precision could serve healing as easily as harm. <words>356</words>

Vera left the spaceport a different woman than she'd entered. <words>366</words> Still a duelist, but no longer cheerless. <words>373</words> She would teach others what her grandmother's recipes had taught her: that forgiveness was the most precisely innovative weapon of all, capable of elasticizing even the most rigid heart into something capable of love again. <words>409</words>

The abandoned customs office fell silent, save for the eternal hum of servers recording her transformation. <words>425</words>
