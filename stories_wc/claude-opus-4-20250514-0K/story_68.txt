Marcus traced his fingers along the broken rake handle, feeling the tiny Latin inscriptions that most would mistake for weathering. <words>16</words> The digital reconstruction of Rome's ancient marketplace hummed around him—a virtual space where hackers traded in forgotten data rather than olives and wine. <words>39</words> His collection of bottle caps lay spread across his makeshift stall, each one a carefully preserved backup drive containing fragments of erased identities. <words>62</words>

"Three minutes," he muttered, watching his tea timer tick down. <words>72</words> In the time it took chamomile to steep, he could breach most corporate firewalls, but this job required something more delicate. <words>93</words> The rake handle held the key—a cipher carved by some long-dead programmer who understood that the most secure data lived in the physical world. <words>118</words>

A figure approached his stall, their avatar flickering between human and something else—scales, then skin, then scales again. <words>136</words> "You're the one who adopts the nameless?" <words>143</words> The voice carried digital distortion, but underneath, Marcus heard pain. <words>153</words>

"I restore what shouldn't be forgotten," Marcus replied, his fingers never pausing in their work on the inscriptions. <words>171</words> This was his code: hack only to heal, steal only what was already stolen. <words>185</words> The bottle caps clinked as he sorted through them, each containing a life that someone had tried to delete. <words>204</words>

"They called me Monster-37 in the labs," the figure said. <words>214</words> "But I had a name before they took it." <words>223</words>

Marcus looked up, seeing past the glitching avatar to the person beneath—rarely common, that's how his grandmother would have described such souls, extraordinary in their ordinariness. <words>249</words> The marketplace's digital torches cast shadows that shouldn't exist in virtual space, but here they danced across the figure's shifting form. <words>271</words>

"The inscription mentions a Project Pygmalion," Marcus said, confidence threading through his uncertainty. <words>284</words> "They were erasing test subjects' identities, trying to create blank slates." <words>295</words> His tea timer chimed—perfectly steeped, like the plan forming in his mind. <words>307</words>

He selected a bottle cap, this one scratched with coordinates leading to a buried server farm. <words>323</words> "Your name is in here, along with forty-six others they tried to unmake." <words>336</words> The figure's form stabilized, becoming more human with each word. <words>346</words> "I'll need three things: your DNA sequence, your earliest memory, and your promise to help me restore the others." <words>365</words>

"Why?" <words>366</words> The question hung between them like incense in the ancient market. <words>377</words>

"Because monsters are just people whose stories were stolen," Marcus said, already initiating the adoption protocol. <words>393</words> "And I'm in the business of giving them back." <words>402</words> The marketplace shimmered as data began to flow, and somewhere in the cascade of recovering information, a name emerged from the darkness. <words>425</words> Sarah. <words>426</words> Her name had been Sarah. <words>431</words> The figure wept, fully human now, while Marcus smiled and sipped his perfectly steeped tea. <words>447</words>
