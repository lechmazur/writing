Captain Reeves dragged the chalk across the cargo hold's metal floor, marking another day in her peculiar calendar. <words>17</words> The space pirate ship *Temporal Drift* groaned as it carved through the asteroid field, but she barely noticed anymore. <words>34</words> Twenty years she'd been trapped here, serving as caretaker to a crew frozen between heartbeats, victims of a temporal anomaly that left her mysteriously unaffected. <words>59</words>

She paused at the porthole, watching clouds of cosmic dust drift past—her only method of tracking time's passage in this cursed pocket of space. <words>84</words> The others hung suspended mid-laugh, mid-argument, mid-theft, their faces locked in expressions that haunted her waking hours. <words>102</words> She'd grown warmly aloof toward them, caring for their frozen forms with tender indifference, dusting their shoulders while refusing to meet their unseeing eyes. <words>127</words>

The chalk squeaked against the floor: day 7,305. <words>135</words> Sometimes she wondered if she'd miscounted, if time even meant anything here where seconds stretched like taffy. <words>152</words> The ship's ancient communication system crackled to life—a phantom dial tone from Earth that always cut out before connecting, technology decades obsolete even before their accident. <words>179</words>

"What if I'd stayed home that day?" she whispered to the frozen first mate. <words>193</words> "What if I'd chosen a different crew?" <words>200</words> The questions circled endlessly, vultures picking at her sanity's corpse. <words>210</words> She'd tried everything to escape this temporal prison, but the universe seemed content to let her rot in this bubble of stolen time. <words>234</words>

Today felt different, though. <words>238</words> The cosmic clouds moved strangely, swirling in patterns she'd never seen. <words>249</words> Her chalk trembled as she tracked their paths, recognizing something in their dance—a countdown, perhaps, or a key. <words>267</words> The dial tone sputtered again, lasting longer this time before dying. <words>278</words>

She pressed her forehead against the porthole, watching the clouds spiral inward. <words>290</words> "No more what-ifs," she said firmly, her voice carrying that gentle harshness she'd perfected—soft enough not to disturb the frozen, sharp enough to cut through her own doubts. <words>319</words> The chalk fell from her fingers as understanding dawned. <words>328</words> The clouds weren't just marking time; they were showing her how to step outside it. <words>344</words>

Following their path with her eyes, she felt herself beginning to fade, molecules scattering like the dust outside. <words>362</words> The cargo hold grew transparent around her. <words>369</words> As she vanished, she heard it—the completed connection, voices from Earth calling through time. <words>384</words> Her last thought was wry: after twenty years of caring for the frozen, she'd finally learned the secret. <words>403</words> Time wasn't a prison—it was a door, and she'd finally found the key in letting go of what might have been. <words>424</words>
