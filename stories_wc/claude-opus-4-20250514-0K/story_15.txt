The gracious widow Meredith tended her blacksmith's forge with the devotion of a mother nursing a fevered child. <words>16</words> In the ruined orchard district, where centuries of thick fog had swallowed entire neighborhoods whole, her forge glowed like a defiant heartbeat. <words>37</words> The locals whispered she was mad, hammering away at nothing between breakfast and lunch, then again between lunch and dinner. <words>57</words> But Meredith knew better. <words>61</words>

She was tethered by hope to something the fog-blind couldn't see. <words>72</words> Each morning, mysterious postcards appeared beneath her anvil, their edges singed with divine fingerprints. <words>86</words> "Your husband sends his regards from the Underworld's tea parlor," one might read, accompanied by a sketch of pomegranate scones. <words>105</words> The gods thought themselves clever, tormenting her with these solemnly absurd missives. <words>117</words> They underestimated her. <words>119</words>

Meredith had discovered something marvelous: if she forged a reply onto iron while the fog pressed against her windows, her messages could pierce the veil. <words>143</words> Not to reach her beloved Harold—no, that would be too simple, too kind. <words>156</words> Instead, her iron postcards traveled to other bereaved souls throughout the fog-lost district. <words>168</words> "The gods fear our laughter," she'd hammer into glowing metal. <words>178</words> "Meet me at the dead apple tree. <words>185</words> Bring cake." <words>187</words>

And they came, these fog-wanderers, drawn by her forge's warm defiance. <words>198</words> Between meals, when the gods dozed on their ambrosia hangovers, Meredith taught them her craft. <words>213</words> Together they hammered out iron jokes, bronze puns, copper riddles—each one a tiny rebellion against divine cruelty. <words>229</words> The forge became a nursery for hope, where sorrow transformed into something harder, sharper, funnier. <words>244</words>

One afternoon, as she demonstrated the proper technique for inscribing a particularly blasphemous limerick, a new postcard appeared. <words>262</words> This one bore no message, only an image: the gods themselves, huddled around a table, reading her iron postcards with furrowed brows. <words>284</words> They looked distinctly uncomfortable. <words>288</words> Worried, even. <words>290</words>

Meredith smiled, her first genuine smile since Harold's passing. <words>299</words> She selected her finest piece of meteoric iron and began to forge her masterpiece—a postcard addressed to Olympus itself. <words>318</words> "Thank you for the correspondence," she etched with careful strokes. <words>328</words> "Harold and I are having a wonderful time. <words>336</words> Wish you weren't there." <words>340</words>

The fog trembled as divine thunder rumbled overhead, but Meredith only laughed. <words>352</words> She had nurtured something the gods never expected from their cruel game: a community of mortals who found joy in their defiance. <words>374</words> The forge rang with purpose as more widow-smiths took up hammers, ready to flood the heavens with their iron wit. <words>394</words> Between meals, between sorrows, between the fog and the fire, they forged their revolution one postcard at a time. <words>413</words>
