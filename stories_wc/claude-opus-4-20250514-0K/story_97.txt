The brass compass spun wildly in Mira's palm, its needle refusing to settle on any direction—a perfect metaphor for her life as a fact-minded oracle trapped in an unstable dimension. <words>30</words>

She forced a desperately casual laugh, though no one was around to hear it. <words>44</words> "Just another Tuesday in the void between worlds," she muttered, watching reality ripple like disturbed water around her. <words>62</words>

The heartbreak had started it all—losing her sister to a dimensional collapse three months ago. <words>77</words> Now, whenever grief overwhelmed her, visions erupted: glimpses of forgotten places where empathy itself had been born, nurtured, and sometimes abandoned. <words>98</words> These weren't the cold, clinical prophecies she'd built her reputation on. <words>109</words> These were raw, bleeding insights into the human condition. <words>118</words>

The compass suddenly froze, pointing toward a shimmer in the air. <words>129</words> Mira's heart clenched—another vision approaching. <words>135</words> She braced herself as the familiar ache bloomed in her chest, and reality fractured. <words>149</words>

In the cradle of a whispered minute, she saw it: a garden floating in starlight where ancient beings had first learned to feel another's pain. <words>174</words> The vision showed her how they'd planted seeds of understanding, watered them with shared tears, and watched empathy bloom across civilizations. <words>196</words> But the garden was dying now, choked by indifference and fear. <words>207</words>

As quickly as it came, the vision shattered. <words>215</words> Mira gasped, finding herself back in the shifting dimension, but something had changed. <words>228</words> The brass compass now pulsed with warm light, its needle pointing steadily toward... hope? <words>242</words>

She understood now. <words>245</words> Her gift wasn't meant to catalog facts or predict futures. <words>255</words> Through her heartbreak, she'd been given a map to humanity's lost emotional landmarks. <words>268</words> Each vision was a breadcrumb leading back to places where people had once truly seen each other. <words>285</words>

With trembling fingers, she began to recompose herself—not into the rigid oracle she'd been, but into something softer, truer. <words>304</words> The path to empathy wasn't through logic or prophecy. <words>313</words> It was through shared pain, transformed into understanding. <words>321</words>

The dimension around her stabilized slightly, responding to her newfound clarity. <words>332</words> Mira smiled—a real smile this time—and took her first step following the compass. <words>346</words> Somewhere in the vast expanse of forgotten realms, the garden of empathy waited to be rediscovered. <words>362</words> And she would find it, one heartbreak-induced vision at a time, carrying its seeds back to a world that desperately needed to remember how to feel. <words>389</words>

The brass compass hummed in agreement, ready to guide her home through the beautiful ruins of what connection used to mean. <words>410</words>
