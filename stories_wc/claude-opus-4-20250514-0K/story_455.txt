Hendrik traced shadow patterns across the cobblestones, his fingers absently sorting through the collection of foreign coins that visitors had thrown into his well over seventeen years. <words>24</words> The copper peso from Argentina bore oxidation marks that matched the scars on his palms—both earned during his previous life, before this cover identity consumed him. <words>52</words>

The well stood at the crossing of two unwritten paths: one leading to the old monastery, the other vanishing into morning mist. <words>74</words> Here, where tourists never ventured, lay the entrance to an escape route he'd helped design when shadows meant survival and coins carried microfilm instead of wishes. <words>100</words>

He remained intensely relaxed, a practiced stillness that fooled even trained observers. <words>113</words> The weight of scars—both visible and hidden—had taught him this particular deception. <words>126</words> Each mark on his body corresponded to a betrayal, a close call, a friend who'd vanished into unmarked graves. <words>145</words>

A shadow fell across the well's mouth at precisely 11:47. <words>155</words> Right on schedule. <words>158</words> Hendrik didn't look up, continuing to polish a worn Deutsche Mark with mechanical precision. <words>173</words> The visitor dropped something metallic into the water—not a coin, but a key disguised as one. <words>190</words>

"The shadows corroborate your story," Hendrik murmured, watching the key's descent disturb reflections that shouldn't exist in water this dark. <words>210</words> The well's bottom contained no water at all, just mirrors and misdirection, a chimera protecting the tunnel system below. <words>229</words>

His fingers found the concealed lever behind moss-covered stones. <words>239</words> The mechanism whispered open, revealing stairs that spiraled into inherited mystery—passages built by monks, expanded by resistance fighters, perfected by professionals who understood that escape routes were really time machines. <words>269</words> They transported you not through space alone, but through identities, shedding old selves like snakeskin. <words>284</words>

The visitor descended without speaking. <words>289</words> Hendrik recognized the gait: Maria, whose scars ran deeper than his own. <words>301</words> She'd come to out-face the silent judgments of old ghosts, the ones who whispered that survival meant cowardice. <words>319</words>

He sealed the entrance and returned to polishing coins. <words>328</words> Tomorrow, another agent would emerge from these shadows, following patterns encoded in worn currency and bitter memory. <words>345</words> The well would swallow their confessions, their coins, their abandoned names. <words>356</words>

Hendrik understood now why the agency had chosen this cover for him. <words>368</words> Who better to guard secrets than a disgruntled wishing-well attendant, someone people overlooked while pouring out their hearts? <words>386</words> The weight of scars had taught him that the heaviest burdens were often invisible, carried in the space between who you were and who you pretended to be. <words>414</words>

Another shadow crossed the stones. <words>419</words> Another coin splashed below. <words>423</words> Hendrik continued his eternal polish, guardian of wishes that were really farewells. <words>435</words>
