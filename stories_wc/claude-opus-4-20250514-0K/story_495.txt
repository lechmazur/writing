The mechanical birds never stopped singing, their brass gears clicking in perpetual harmony as Keeper Mara shuffled through the sanctuary with her rustic bread paddle, the only possession from her former life. <words>30</words> She'd been assigned this post after refusing to conform to the Central Authority's happiness protocols—a begrudging guardian to creatures that mocked her imprisonment with their synthetic joy. <words>58</words>

Within the folds of spacetime, where yesterday bled into tomorrow, Mara discovered postcards wedged between the copper feathers of a broken nightingale. <words>80</words> The images depicted an impossible island where colors bent like music and people danced without choreography chips. <words>97</words> She began to illustrate copies obsessively, analyzing each dreamlike detail—the way shadows laughed, how water flowed upward, the faces unburdened by regulation smiles. <words>121</words>

"You're dangerously friendly," the Authority had warned during her sentencing, as if warmth itself was rebellion. <words>137</words> They couldn't understand her need to touch strangers' hands, to listen past their programmed responses, to see the grief behind mandated grins. <words>159</words>

The postcards multiplied mysteriously, each revealing more of this untamed paradise where joy wasn't manufactured but grown wild like weeds through concrete. <words>182</words> Mara traced the images with flour-dusted fingers from her paddle, remembering when she'd baked bread that nourished more than bodies—it had fed souls before soul-feeding became illegal. <words>210</words>

Time folded peculiarly here; she'd catch glimpses of herself as a child, chasing real birds through wheat fields, before the world mechanized wonder. <words>234</words> The sanctuary's eternal twilight couldn't suppress the ache—that joyful sorrow of knowing what was lost and might yet be found. <words>255</words>

One postcard showed a woman who looked like Mara, but unbroken, standing at the island's shore with arms spread wide, welcoming boats of refugees from regulated reality. <words>283</words> The mechanical birds suddenly changed their tune, harmonizing with something deeper than programming—perhaps responding to Mara's tears, which fell like rain on brass wings. <words>308</words>

She understood then that the postcards weren't from an unknown island but from possible futures, bleeding through spacetime's worn spots where imagination had rubbed reality thin. <words>335</words> Her bread paddle began to hum with remembered purpose as she traced escape routes in the air, each gesture breaking another link in society's grip. <words>360</words>

The birds watched with jeweled eyes as Mara illustrated her own postcard—herself walking through the sanctuary's walls, which parted like curtains before her dangerous friendliness. <words>385</words> She would find others who remembered unscripted laughter, and together they would bake bread that tasted like freedom, their joy both sorrowful and revolutionary. <words>409</words> In the space between tick and tock, where mechanical songs became real music, Mara stepped into her postcard and vanished, leaving only flour handprints on eternity. <words>436</words>
