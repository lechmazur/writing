In the primordial void before time's first heartbeat, Lady Elara wrapped her calloused fingers around the rustic yarn swift, spinning tales from memory into tangible threads. <words>23</words> She had abandoned her celestial palace to dwell in this swamp fortress, accessible only by the silent gondolas that glided through mists of unborn matter. <words>48</words>

The fortress walls sweated possibility, and here she worked, chronicling the stories of villages that would one day exist. <words>67</words> Each thread she wound held a future life—a baker's triumph, a child's first laugh, a widow's resilience. <words>84</words> Her noble blood meant nothing in this place beyond existence, where she chose to be merely a keeper of untold narratives. <words>105</words>

The Primarchs, those who would shape reality itself, demanded she cease her work. <words>119</words> "These stories belong to us," their edicts proclaimed, arriving in vintage wine bottles that materialized from nothingness, bobbing in the proto-waters surrounding her refuge. <words>143</words> Each message grew more threatening, promising to subjugate her will to their grand design. <words>158</words>

But Elara possessed a weapon they hadn't anticipated: she was strangely honest, incapable of weaving anything but truth into her threads. <words>179</words> This honesty terrified them, for lies would form the foundation of their coming universe—lies about power, about worthiness, about who deserved to rule. <words>203</words>

She responded to their threats by working faster, her yarn swift clicking rhythmically as she preserved a fisherman's kindness, a mother's sacrifice, a fool's unexpected wisdom. <words>229</words> These simple truths, wound tight and careful, would survive the universe's violent birth and plant themselves like seeds in human hearts. <words>251</words>

When the Primarchs sent their final ultimatum, Elara smiled and penned her reply on parchment made from swamp reeds. <words>270</words> "I am no one," she wrote, "merely a woman with thread and memory. <words>284</words> But these stories belong to those who will live them, not those who would rule them." <words>301</words> She sealed it in the last empty bottle and cast it into the void. <words>316</words>

The gondola arrived at dawn—though dawn had no meaning yet—piloted by Death himself, the only Primarch who understood her work. <words>337</words> "They will unmake you," he warned in his voice like settling dust. <words>350</words>

"Let them," Elara replied, her hands never pausing at the swift. <words>362</words> "Every thread I've spun carries truth they cannot touch. <words>372</words> When the universe begins, these stories will already be woven into its fabric, beyond their reach forever." <words>390</words>

She continued her work with humble defiance, an incognito aristocrat who chose the power of preservation over dominion, knowing that every village story she saved would outlast the thrones of gods. <words>422</words>
