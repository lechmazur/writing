Marcus pressed his scarred knuckles against the museum's cold glass door, watching his reflection merge with ancient artifacts beyond. <words>16</words> Years of enforcing for the Northside crew had left him hollow, but here, among timeless relics, he could pretend to be someone else. <words>39</words>

The plain wooden crate slat in his pocket—torn from the box where he'd hidden his first stolen goods—served as his anchor. <words>61</words> He'd carried it for twelve years, a splinter of shame that reminded him why he needed to change. <words>79</words>

"Excuse me," he murmured, deliberately bumping into her near the Mesopotamian exhibit. <words>91</words> Dr. Sarah Chen, the curator he'd been watching for weeks, turned with practiced patience. <words>106</words> These staged accidents had become his method—safer than honest introduction when your past included breaking bones for unpaid debts. <words>126</words>

"No harm done," she smiled, adjusting her glasses. <words>134</words> "You're here often." <words>137</words>

It wasn't a question. <words>141</words> Marcus felt exposed, his carefully rehearsed anonymity cracking. <words>149</words> "I'm trying to learn," he admitted, the words feeling foreign. <words>160</words> "About resilience. <words>162</words> How civilizations outlast their mistakes." <words>167</words>

Sarah studied him with rationally subjective eyes—seeing both the thug he'd been and the man he was becoming. <words>185</words> "The Sumerians believed in redemption through knowledge," she offered quietly. <words>195</words>

Outside, the museum's static electricity garden hummed with artificial lightning, its plasma globes reaching toward visitors like desperate fingers. <words>214</words> Marcus had discovered it during his third visit—a space where energy transformed unpredictably, never quite what it seemed. <words>232</words>

"I've done things," he began, then stopped. <words>239</words> The apology lived in his throat, always threatening to spill. <words>249</words>

"Haven't we all?" <words>252</words> Sarah touched the display case between them. <words>259</words> "Resilience isn't about forgetting. <words>263</words> It's about choosing differently next time." <words>269</words>

Through the garden's viewing window, a new silhouette appeared on the horizon—another lost soul seeking transformation among the crackling towers. <words>289</words> In that second, Marcus understood. <words>294</words> He pulled out the wooden slat, its edges worn smooth by nervous fingers. <words>307</words>

"This is from my first crime," he confessed, voice barely audible above the garden's electric whispers. <words>324</words> "I keep it to remember what I'm leaving behind." <words>334</words>

Sarah's expression softened. <words>337</words> "The museum has a restoration workshop. <words>343</words> We could repurpose it—turn destruction into preservation." <words>350</words>

The offer hung between them, quietly intense as the charged air outside. <words>362</words> Marcus had spent months orchestrating these encounters, believing proximity to history might rewrite his own. <words>378</words> Now, faced with genuine connection, he realized resilience meant more than outlasting your past—it meant building something new from its fragments. <words>401</words>

He handed her the slat. <words>406</words> "I'd like that," he said, and meant it. <words>414</words>
