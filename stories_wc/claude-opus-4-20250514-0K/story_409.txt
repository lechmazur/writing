Marcus pressed his split knuckles against the clay pot shard, reading its inscription through swollen eyes. <words>16</words> *The moment you stop fighting yourself, you begin.* <words>24</words> Around him, the dusty attic hummed with clockwork animals—brass mice skittering across beams, mechanical birds pivoting their copper heads. <words>44</words> Each had been his opponent once, training partners he'd built with the same hands that couldn't land a proper punch. <words>65</words>

He was skillfully incompetent, a paradox that defined him: brilliant at creating fighters, hopeless at being one. <words>82</words> The shard trembled in his grip as another memory tried to surface—the real reason he kept losing. <words>99</words> But like always, the truth slipped away, abducted by the forgotten dreams he'd buried beneath years of self-deception. <words>117</words>

A clockwork wolf prowled closer, its gears clicking like a countdown. <words>128</words> Marcus had programmed it to mirror his every weakness, every flinch and hesitation that cost him matches. <words>145</words> Its amber eyes reflected what he refused to see: he threw every fight. <words>158</words> Not from lack of skill, but from something deeper—a conviction that winning meant becoming someone he'd sworn never to be. <words>178</words>

The inscription burned against his palm. <words>184</words> His father had been a champion, had stood for nothing but victory, leaving broken men and a broken family in his wake. <words>206</words> Marcus had spent twenty years pretending he lost because he lacked talent, not because he chose defeat over becoming that man. <words>228</words>

The clockwork animals stilled, waiting. <words>233</words> In the suffocating closeness of the attic, surrounded by his mechanical mirrors, Marcus finally understood. <words>248</words> Standing for something didn't mean standing still. <words>255</words> His father had fought to dominate; Marcus fought to remember he was human. <words>268</words> But in refusing to win, he'd lost himself anyway. <words>277</words>

He stood, bruises singing protest, and faced the wolf. <words>286</words> For the first time, he didn't calculate angles or techniques. <words>296</words> He simply moved, letting instinct guide him past the creature's bronze teeth. <words>308</words> His fist connected with its shut-off switch—a perfect strike he'd always known how to throw. <words>324</words>

The wolf collapsed, gears settling into silence. <words>331</words> Marcus looked at the shard again, understanding its message at last. <words>342</words> The moment a sculptor's chisel first strikes marble, the stone must decide: resist and shatter, or yield and become. <words>361</words> He'd been resisting his whole life, breaking himself rather than risk becoming his father. <words>375</words>

But perhaps there was another way to be carved. <words>384</words> Setting down the shard among the quiet clockwork, Marcus descended the attic stairs. <words>396</words> Tomorrow, he would fight again. <words>401</words> This time, he would let himself win—not for dominance, but to prove that strength and compassion could share the same fist. <words>422</words> The last vestige of his self-deception crumbled as he walked into the light. <words>435</words> He was a fighter who had finally learned to stop fighting himself. <words>447</words>
