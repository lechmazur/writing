The water clock repair shop dripped with more than just time, its copper pipes weeping rust-colored tears onto Madame Chen's workbench. <words>19</words> She adjusted her peacock-blue gloves—quietly flamboyant accessories that no one questioned anymore—and continued dismantling the ancient timepiece. <words>36</words> 

"Another eulogy arrived today," her assistant whispered, sliding the black-bordered envelope across the cluttered surface. <words>51</words> Madame Chen's fingers trembled imperceptibly as she recognized the handwriting. <words>61</words> The hidden assassin had struck again, leaving behind another coded confession disguised as grief. <words>75</words>

She unfolded the paper, reading aloud: "Beloved Harold, who taught us that hemlock blooms sweetest in teacups, departed Tuesday at precisely 3:47." <words>97</words> Her assistant snorted—that despairing humor they'd cultivated like a shield against the horror of their work. <words>113</words> Between chapters of their ordinary lives as clockmakers, they decoded these bleak eulogies that mentioned hidden truths, each one a breadcrumb leading to justice. <words>137</words>

The moss-covered lantern in the window—their signal to the network—flickered green. <words>148</words> Another domestic mystery wrapped in mourning clothes. <words>155</words> Madame Chen had come to adore the assassin's artistry, the way each murder was choreographed with the precision of clockwork, each eulogy a dark poem. <words>180</words> It was sick, she knew, but in this business of documenting death, one developed peculiar appreciations. <words>196</words>

"Third mention of hemlock this month," her assistant noted, marking it in their ledger. <words>210</words> They worked between official investigations, translating the killer's elaborate confessions into evidence. <words>222</words> The authorities thought them merely eccentric timekeepers who collected obituaries—a harmless hobby for old women. <words>237</words>

But Madame Chen understood the assassin's motivation: to transmute pain into a masterpiece. <words>250</words> Each victim had been an abuser hiding behind suburban smiles, each death a carefully composed symphony of justice. <words>268</words> The eulogies were love letters to the survivors, encoded apologies from someone who'd suffered too. <words>283</words>

She wound the water clock's mechanism, listening to its ancient heartbeat. <words>294</words> Time flowed differently here, between justice and vengeance, between humor and despair. <words>306</words> The assassin's latest composition mentioned a "grandfather who loved too hard, his hands heavy as pendulums." <words>322</words> Code for another monster eliminated. <words>327</words>

"Should we report this one?" her assistant asked, already knowing the answer. <words>339</words>

Madame Chen polished a gear with her flamboyant gloves, considering. <words>349</words> The moss-covered lantern cast shadows like reaching fingers across her work. <words>361</words> "Not yet," she decided. <words>365</words> "Let's see how this chapter ends." <words>371</words>

After all, some mysteries were better left domestic, some pain better transformed into dark art. <words>386</words> The water clock ticked on, measuring moments between justice and mercy, while somewhere in the city, the hidden assassin composed another eulogy. <words>408</words> Madame Chen smiled grimly and returned to her repairs. <words>417</words>
