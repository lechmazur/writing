Lord Erasmus Ashworth pressed his thumb against another yellowed ticket stub, watching the adhesive catch fire in the spontaneous combustion lab's controlled atmosphere. <words>20</words> The artificial hummingbird drone whirred beside him, its camera eye recording each small conflagration with mechanical precision. <words>37</words>

Between the ping of his phone and the reply he'd never send, he worked. <words>51</words> Another stub—Thames Theater, 1987—erupted into blue flame. <words>59</words> The drone captured it all: the curl of smoke, the way his fingers didn't flinch anymore. <words>75</words>

"Your Lordship requires fresh samples," Dr. Chen observed from behind reinforced glass. <words>87</words>

Erasmus laughed, a sound like wind through empty rooms. <words>96</words> "Lordship." <words>97</words> He held up a stub from the National Gallery. <words>106</words> "My father kept every ticket from every event where he displayed his perfect family." <words>121</words> The paper ignited instantly. <words>125</words> "Twenty years of performance art, and I'm reassembling the evidence just to watch it burn properly this time." <words>143</words>

His phone buzzed. <words>146</words> Sarah again, probably. <words>149</words> The woman who'd loved the illusion of him—the title, the estate that no longer existed, the man she thought lived behind those things. <words>173</words>

"The combustion rate increases with emotional significance," Chen noted, tapping her tablet. <words>185</words>

"Mysteriously obvious, isn't it?" <words>189</words> Erasmus fed another stub to the chamber. <words>197</words> Royal Opera House, his sister's debut. <words>204</words> The flame burned white-hot. <words>208</words> "We fortify ourselves with lies until the truth becomes flammable." <words>218</words>

The hummingbird drone tilted its head, a programmed gesture of curiosity that felt more honest than any expression his family had worn at those events. <words>243</words> Its wings beat sixty times per second, holding perfect position while everything around it transformed to ash. <words>261</words>

"I spent forty years believing in the performance," he continued, placing stubs in a careful pattern. <words>277</words> "Noble obligations. Proper conduct. Marriage to the right sort." <words>286</words> Each ticket burst into flame simultaneously, creating a small inferno. <words>296</words> "But here's the candor of it—in these small moments of destruction, I finally feel real." <words>312</words>

Another text arrived. <words>315</words> He didn't look. <words>318</words> Instead, he watched the drone's footage on the monitor: his hands, steady now, feeding memories to controlled flame. <words>337</words> Each stub had been a fortress once, protecting the family mythology. <words>348</words> Now they were kindling for a different kind of truth. <words>359</words>

"The experiment concludes in three minutes," Chen announced. <words>367</words>

Erasmus placed the final stub—his parents' last gala before the scandal broke. <words>380</words> It resisted the flame for a moment, then surrendered like everything else. <words>393</words> The hummingbird drone circled the smoke, its artificial heart beating with more consistency than his own. <words>410</words>

"Some things," he said to the empty lab, to the drone, to the space between sent and unread messages, "are meant to burn." <words>433</words> He turned off his phone entirely. <words>439</words> The noble line of Ashworth had ended not with scandal but with this: perfect, reckless honesty in a room designed for careful destruction. <words>463</words>

The drone landed on his shoulder, wings finally still. <words>473</words> Together, they watched the last of the past become exactly what it had always been—smoke and aftermath. <words>491</words>
