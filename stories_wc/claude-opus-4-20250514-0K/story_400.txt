The last druid on Earth fastened her cloak with a dull safety pin, the metal cold against her fingers. <words>17</words> She stood at the edge of the glacial orchard, where crystallized apple trees hung suspended over a crevasse of endless blue ice. <words>38</words>

It had been three winters since the final human departed for the colonies, leaving her alone with the silence. <words>57</words> Today was her two-hundredth birthday, and tradition demanded she prepare the sacred meal—fermented root paste with candied bark, served on leaves that took a decade to grow. <words>85</words> The recipe had passed through seven generations of her family, each druid adding their own bitter herbs. <words>102</words>

She was fiercely ambivalent about breaking her vow of silence. <words>112</words> Speaking meant acknowledging she was truly alone, yet remaining mute felt like drowning in ice water. <words>128</words> Her fear of sound had grown monstrous during the evacuation, when millions of voices rose in panic before cutting off forever. <words>149</words>

The orchard creaked as she gathered frost-touched apples, their cores containing seeds that would never sprout. <words>165</words> She almost laughed—a dour, strangled sound—at the absurdity of maintaining rituals for ghosts. <words>179</words> The safety pin caught on bark, and she cursed silently, then froze. <words>191</words>

Had she spoken? <words>194</words>

The word hung between her teeth like a shard of ice. <words>205</words> She set down her gathering basket and approached the crevasse's edge, where winds howled through blue depths. <words>222</words> The birthday meal required a toast, spoken aloud to honor the ancestors. <words>234</words>

Her mouth opened. <words>237</words> Closed. <words>238</words> Opened again. <words>240</words>

"I—" <words>241</words>

The sound cracked like breaking glacier. <words>247</words> Birds that weren't really birds—merely echoes of migration patterns in the wind—seemed to pause. <words>262</words>

"I am Keeper Thorne, last of the Earth Druids." <words>271</words> Each word fell like an axe stroke. <words>278</words> "I gather these apples for my birth celebration, as my mother did, as her mother did." <words>294</words>

The admission shattered something inside her chest. <words>301</words> Fear drained away like meltwater, replaced by something worse—relief. <words>311</words> She laughed then, genuinely, bitterly, at the cosmic joke of it all. <words>323</words> A guardian with nothing left to guard, speaking to ice and memory. <words>335</words>

She completed the meal in her frozen grove, narrating each step to the unhearing trees. <words>350</words> The safety pin glinted dully as she raised her cup of fermented sap. <words>363</words>

"To silence," she toasted with dour amusement, "and to breaking it." <words>374</words> 

The orchard absorbed her words, holding them in crystalline branches. <words>384</words> Tomorrow she would speak again, and the day after, until language itself became as natural as breathing once was. <words>403</words> The last druid had found her voice in the Earth's final chapter. <words>415</words>
