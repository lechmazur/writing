The stoic wanderer pressed the rotting floorboard against the training ground's boundary, its mesmerizingly bland surface somehow perfect for what came next. <words>19</words> She'd carried it from an abandoned cabin three provinces away, following a trail of nightmares that leaked from apprentice familiars' dreams. <words>39</words>

"You're late," barked Master Corvina, wiping the final formula from her teaching slate with unnecessary violence. <words>55</words> The chalk dust swirled like dying moths in the torchlight. <words>65</words>

"I had to impose myself on your wards," the wanderer replied, her voice flat as winter stone. <words>82</words> "They recognized the board." <words>86</words>

Around them, half-formed creatures whimpered in their cages—rabbits with too many eyes, cats whose shadows moved independently, birds that sang backwards. <words>108</words> This was where witches broke and rebuilt nature's children into proper familiars. <words>120</words>

"Then you know why I summoned you," Corvina said, her brash tenderness evident only in how gently she latched the nearest cage. <words>143</words> "The old ways are dying. <words>148</words> Each year, fewer remember the true bindings." <words>155</words>

The wanderer nodded, understanding the necessary lies they told the public—that familiars chose their witches, that the process was painless, that love alone forged the bond. <words>182</words> She'd spent decades archiving ritual practices, preserving what others preferred forgotten. <words>193</words>

"This board," she said, laying it carefully on the scorched earth, "holds the first familiar's death-scream." <words>209</words> "Every nightmare that followed remembers." <words>214</words>

Corvina's weathered face cracked into something almost like hope. <words>223</words> "Can you extract it?" <words>227</words>

"I can preserve it," the wanderer corrected. <words>234</words> Her fingers traced symbols that predated written language, and the board began to hum with a frequency that made the familiars fall silent. <words>257</words>

What emerged wasn't sound but memory—raw, visceral, honest. <words>265</words> The truth of transformation: how the first witch had murdered her beloved pet to resurrect it as something more useful, how that betrayal became tradition, how tradition became necessity. <words>294</words>

"The younglings won't understand," Corvina whispered. <words>300</words>

"They will when they must," the wanderer replied, sealing the memory into a crystal vial. <words>315</words> "Truth has its own timeline." <words>320</words>

She tucked the vial into her coat alongside hundreds of others—each a piece of magic's cruel history that someone, someday, would need. <words>343</words> The board crumbled to dust, its purpose finally complete. <words>352</words>

"Where next?" Corvina asked, though they both knew the wanderer never answered such questions. <words>366</words>

Instead, she touched the old witch's shoulder—a gesture shockingly tender from someone so contained—and walked back through the wards. <words>385</words> Behind her, the familiars resumed their keening, and Corvina began drawing new formulas on her slate, teaching necessary lies with love's strange mercy. <words>409</words>

The wanderer disappeared into the pre-dawn darkness, following the next thread of nightmares that would lead her to another truth demanding preservation. <words>431</words> Such was her burden, her purpose: to remember what others needed to forget, until forgetting became impossible. <words>448</words>
