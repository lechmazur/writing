Father Marcus clutched the wooden abacus, its missing beads leaving gaps like absent prayers. <words>13</words> For twenty years, he'd counted souls saved on these beads, until the day he stopped believing the arithmetic mattered. <words>31</words> Now, exiled to the labyrinth orchard where giant bean stalks spiraled toward heaven, he lived in the shadow of his former certainty. <words>54</words>

The stalks cast a dull radiance, their leaves filtering celestial light into something neither holy nor profane. <words>71</words> Marcus had grown complacent here, accepting his confusion as penance, until this morning when fresh snow revealed something impossible. <words>90</words> Footprints led deeper into the maze, appearing and vanishing in patterns that defied natural law. <words>105</words>

He began to jog, following the snow patterns with increasing urgency. <words>116</words> The tracks split and merged, creating geometries that hurt to contemplate, yet he pursued them with the fervor he'd once reserved for scripture. <words>140</words> Through the hush of fate unraveling, he heard it—a sound like cosmic gears grinding to a halt. <words>158</words>

The bean stalks groaned, their massive trunks swaying though no wind stirred. <words>170</words> Marcus understood then: his complacency had been another kind of faith, a trust that his exile served some greater purpose. <words>190</words> But these footprints suggested otherwise. <words>195</words> They weren't leading him anywhere; they were showing him that destiny itself was full of gaps, like his broken abacus. <words>215</words>

He stopped jogging and stood still, unapologetically confused for the first time in his life. <words>230</words> Not the defensive confusion of a lapsed priest, but the honest bewilderment of someone seeing clearly. <words>246</words> The price of complacency wasn't damnation—it was this comfortable numbness, this acceptance of incompleteness. <words>260</words>

Marcus hurled the abacus into the snow. <words>267</words> Where it landed, new footprints appeared, leading in every direction at once. <words>279</words> He laughed, a sound that cracked the dull radiance like lightning. <words>290</words> To step beyond fate's design didn't mean finding the correct path through the labyrinth. <words>304</words> It meant recognizing that the maze itself was an illusion, maintained by those too comfortable to question it. <words>322</words>

The bean stalks began to lean, their cloud-touched crowns bowing as if in prayer—or perhaps in defeat. <words>340</words> Marcus chose a direction at random and walked, leaving his own trail in the snow. <words>355</words> Behind him, the footprints multiplied exponentially, creating a new mathematics of possibility. <words>367</words> Through the hush of fate unraveling, he moved neither toward redemption nor away from it, but perpendicular to the entire concept. <words>389</words> The labyrinth orchard stretched endlessly ahead, and Marcus greeted each turn with the terrible freedom of not knowing what came next. <words>411</words>
