The abandoned hospital waiting area flickered with blue light from Marcus's laptop screen, where concerned faces gathered in virtual squares. <words>18</words> He rolled the plain wooden bead between his fingers—a soldier's memento from Afghanistan, worn smooth by years of nervous handling. <words>38</words> "Your work with veterans is extraordinary," the foundation director gushed through pixelated lips, her flattery as transparent as the cracked windows behind him. <words>62</words>

Marcus shifted, deliberately knocking over his water bottle in an artfully clumsy gesture that had become his signature deflection. <words>81</words> The vigilante work came later, after dark, when he tracked war profiteers through the city's underbelly. <words>97</words> But these daylight hours belonged to his cover: a mild-mannered therapist helping veterans process what they'd paid for their service. <words>118</words>

"Thank you," he murmured, his subdued tone masking the rage that still burned from Kandahar. <words>133</words> The wooden bead had belonged to Corporal Chen, who'd died protecting a village from contractors who sold weapons to both sides. <words>155</words> Now Marcus hunted their stateside counterparts, using skills the Army had taught him to serve a different kind of justice. <words>175</words>

The antique funhouse mirror propped in the corner had been his grandfather's, a carnival relic that now served a darker purpose. <words>197</words> By tracking distortions in its warped surface, Marcus could detect lies—micro-expressions stretched and twisted into truth by the old glass. <words>218</words> During virtual calls like this one, he positioned it perfectly to catch his screen's reflection. <words>234</words>

"We'd like to increase funding," another board member said, but the mirror showed his smile curling wrong. <words>251</words> Marcus had researched him: military contracts, congressional lobbying, profit margins built on young bodies. <words>266</words>

The bead pressed hard into his palm. <words>273</words> This was the price of war—not just the dead, but the living who carried their ghosts while smiling at those who'd sent them. <words>297</words> He was mastering an ancient art, his grandfather had said about the mirror: seeing truth beneath pleasant facades. <words>316</words>

"I'm grateful," Marcus lied smoothly, watching his own distortion remain steady—he'd learned to fool even the mirror. <words>333</words> The meeting continued in screaming silence, each participant performing their role while real violence hummed beneath their words. <words>352</words>

Tonight, after these empty pleasantries ended, he would visit the board member's home. <words>366</words> Not to harm—Marcus was no killer—but to leave evidence of war profiteering where journalists would find it. <words>384</words> The wooden bead would ground him, as it always did, a tangible reminder of why he'd traded his uniform for shadows. <words>406</words>

The virtual call ended with promises and handshakes through screens. <words>416</words> Marcus closed his laptop and stood in the abandoned waiting area, surrounded by empty chairs that had once held the worried and grieving. <words>440</words> He pocketed Chen's bead and covered the mirror, preparing for the night's work. <words>453</words> This was his price: to be both healer and hunter, forever walking the line between justice and vengeance. <words>471</words>
