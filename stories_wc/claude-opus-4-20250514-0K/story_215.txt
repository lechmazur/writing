Father Marcus Chen's hands trembled as he slid the vintage postcard across Dr. Eliza Verne's desk, its faded image of Victorian séance parlors mocking his scientific pretensions. <words>24</words>

"You claim this triggered your... episode?" Eliza asked, her voice carrying that infuriating blend of skepticism and intrigue that made the psychic research facility feel more like an interrogation chamber than a sanctuary. <words>56</words>

Marcus forced a smile, though his rattled nerves screamed otherwise. <words>66</words> "The postcard arrived yesterday, addressed to 'The Exorcist Who Dances With Demons.'" <words>78</words> He paused, watching her scribble notes. <words>84</words> "Someone knows about my Tuesday evenings." <words>90</words>

"Your dance lessons?" <words>93</words> Eliza's eyebrow arched with coy aggression. <words>99</words> "Hardly scandalous for a modern priest." <words>105</words>

But Marcus knew better—his waltz partner was a medium who channeled entities during their routines, synthesizing movement with manifestation in ways that would horrify the Vatican. <words>131</words> He was inwardly social enough to crave these connections, yet outwardly bound by clerical expectations. <words>146</words>

"The postcard contains coordinates," he admitted, each guarded disclosure feeling like pulling teeth. <words>159</words> "They lead here, to your facility." <words>165</words>

Eliza's pen stilled. <words>168</words> "Impossible. <words>169</words> This location is classified." <words>173</words>

"Unless someone wants us to collaborate," Marcus suggested, his scientific mind already racing. <words>186</words> "To entwine science with wonder, perhaps?" <words>192</words>

She studied him with predatory interest. <words>198</words> "There's an old protocol here—a series of puzzles that unlock a hidden room. <words>211</words> Previous researchers claimed it held proof of psychokinetic phenomena." <words>220</words> Her smile sharpened. <words>223</words> "But they all failed the psychological evaluation required to access it." <words>234</words>

"What kind of evaluation?" <words>238</words>

"Dancing," she said simply. <words>242</words> "With a partner who can read your true intentions." <words>251</words>

Marcus felt his collar tighten. <words>256</words> The universe, it seemed, had orchestrated this moment with cruel precision. <words>267</words> His Tuesday medium had been preparing him, he realized—teaching him to move authentically while harboring secrets. <words>283</words>

"The first puzzle is on the postcard's reverse," Eliza continued, flipping it over to reveal crystalline equations that seemed to shift under scrutiny. <words>307</words> "It requires someone who understands both liturgical symbolism and quantum mechanics." <words>318</words>

Marcus leaned forward, recognizing the hybrid language immediately. <words>326</words> "It's describing transubstantiation through wave function collapse," he breathed. <words>335</words> "Whoever sent this knows exactly what I've been researching." <words>344</words>

"Then shall we dance, Father?" <words>349</words> Eliza stood, extending her hand with dangerous grace. <words>357</words> "The evaluation room awaits, and I'm curious what truths you'll reveal when the music starts." <words>372</words>

As Marcus rose to meet her, he understood that his careful compartmentalization was ending. <words>386</words> Science and wonder, faith and empiricism, the social and the solitary—all would synthesize in whatever revelation awaited beyond those hidden doors. <words>407</words> The postcard had been an invitation to finally become whole. <words>417</words>
