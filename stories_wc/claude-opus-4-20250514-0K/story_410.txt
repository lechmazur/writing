The astute hermit, Cornelius Drip, hadn't spoken to another soul in seven years, which made his current conversation with a stalactite particularly one-sided. <words>20</words> "You see," he explained to the mineral formation, "these blunt scissors are strangely effective at scraping phosphorescent lichen, but absolute rubbish for cutting hair." <words>42</words> He gestured wildly at his own tangled mane, which glowed faintly green from years of accidental lichen contamination. <words>59</words>

The cavern cathedral stretched above him, its natural pillars pulsing with bioluminescent flora that cast everything in an ethereal, underwater light. <words>80</words> Somewhere in the distance, water dripped—mockingly, he thought—from the broken aquifer system he'd been trying to repair for three years. <words>100</words> The impact of isolation had rewired his brain in peculiar ways; he now categorized time not by days but by the frequency of his arguments with inanimate objects. <words>128</words>

"Tuesday is when I debate ethics with the moss," he muttered, scraping more lichen into his collection pouch. <words>146</words> "Wednesday is reserved for discussing philosophy with that judgmental boulder over there." <words>158</words>

The ancient elevator shaft—a relic from when this place was a functioning underground research station—suddenly groaned to life. <words>177</words> Cornelius froze as mechanical sounds echoed through the cavern, amplifying his heartbeat until it thundered in his ears. <words>195</words> The elevator descended, its arrival timer showing it would reach his empty floor in exactly sixty seconds. <words>212</words>

Panic seized him. <words>215</words> Seven years of solitude had left him woefully unprepared for human contact. <words>227</words> What if they discovered his water restoration project had accidentally created a small ecosystem of sentient fungi? <words>244</words> What if they judged his lichen-based diet? <words>252</words> What if they noticed he'd named all forty-three varieties of glowing plants after deceased Renaissance painters? <words>269</words>

In desperation, he remembered his grandmother's advice about making good first impressions. <words>282</words> He reached into his emergency supplies and pulled out a vacuum-sealed package—flour, water, and his last packet of yeast. <words>302</words> Working frantically with his strangely effective blunt scissors as mixing tools, he assembled a crude dough. <words>318</words> The phosphorescent plants provided just enough heat to create a makeshift oven. <words>330</words>

As the elevator doors opened to reveal two confused engineers, the scent of fresh bread wafted through the cathedral. <words>349</words> The aroma amplified their curiosity, masking the peculiar smell of seven years of hermit life and drawing them toward his workstation. <words>371</words>

"Is that... sourdough?" one asked, bewildered. <words>378</words>

Cornelius, clutching his glowing scissors defensively, managed a weak smile. <words>388</words> "Would you like some? <words>392</words> Fair warning—it's made with cave water, and I can't guarantee it won't make you bioluminescent." <words>408</words>

The engineers exchanged glances. <words>412</words> "Actually," the second one said, "we're here about the water systems. <words>424</words> Corporate sent us to—" <words>428</words>

"Oh, thank Michelangelo!" Cornelius exclaimed, gesturing at a particularly bright patch of moss. <words>441</words> "He's been worried sick about the pH levels!" <words>450</words>

Sometimes, he reflected, the impact of isolation was best measured not in years alone, but in the absurd creativity required to bridge the gap back to humanity. <words>478</words> Even if that bridge was built with terrible bread and blunt scissors. <words>491</words>
