Ranger Mira clutched her plain notebook as she patrolled the urban orchard, its apple trees growing wild where Highway 7 once carried millions. <words>19</words> Three weeks had passed since the last human dream flickered out—she'd felt it happen, that final synapse of imagination extinguished at 3:47 AM. <words>43</words> Now, in this world of waking certainty, only one mystery remained: her grandmother's whispered claim that a goddess still echoed through the abandoned overpasses. <words>68</words>

The orchard felt familiarly unknown today, its paths shifting subtly as if reality itself had begun to fluctuate without dreams to anchor it. <words>91</words> Mira's overzealous nature, once mocked by fellow rangers, now served as her only compass in this unstable landscape. <words>109</words> She documented everything in her notebook: "Tuesday—pear tree where oak stood yesterday. Wednesday—stone bench becomes glass. Thursday—?" <words>126</words>

Through chance encounters with other survivors, she'd pieced together her grandmother's secrets. <words>139</words> The old woman hadn't been delusional; she'd been a keeper of pre-highway memories, when this overpass was sacred ground. <words>159</words> "The goddess doesn't speak," one trembling man had told her, "she reverberates." <words>172</words>

Mira's pencil scratched frantically as the orchard rearranged itself again—chaotic organization, like a library reshuffling its own books. <words>191</words> Cherry blossoms fell upward. <words>195</words> Soil hummed with frequencies her instruments couldn't measure. <words>203</words> This wasn't mere environmental anomaly; this was intention without consciousness, purpose without dreams. <words>217</words>

Her grandmother's final notebook entry, discovered hidden in Mira's ranger station, read: "When humanity stops dreaming, divinity starts remembering." <words>237</words> The words had seemed like poetry then. <words>244</words> Now, as Mira watched a pomegranate tree spiral into existence where asphalt cracked, she understood. <words>260</words>

The echo came at sunset—not sound but sensation, flooding through the transformed highway gardens. <words>275</words> Mira's notebook filled itself, her hand moving involuntarily, sketching maps of places that never were but always had been. <words>295</words> The goddess wasn't returning; she'd never left. <words>302</words> She'd simply been waiting beneath the concrete, patient as seeds, for humanity's dream-static to clear. <words>318</words>

Other rangers called Mira's reports incomprehensible, but she persisted, overzealous as ever. <words>330</words> Each day brought new transformations: steel beams becoming vines, streetlights blooming into luminous fruit. <words>345</words> Her notebook documented the familiar becoming unknown, the unknown becoming divine. <words>357</words>

In this after-dream world, Mira realized her true purpose wasn't to catch the goddess's echo but to become one herself—a vibration in the new frequency, a guardian of the space between what was built and what was always meant to grow. <words>400</words> Her grandmother had known: some secrets only reveal themselves when humanity finally stops trying to dream them into being. <words>419</words> The orchard spread, reclaiming more abandoned highway each day, and Mira followed, notebook in hand, translating the untranslatable into marks that future beings might someday understand. <words>445</words> She was no longer just a ranger but a chronicler of the world's rewilding, overzealous in her devotion to capturing every moment of transformation. <words>470</words> The goddess's echo grew stronger, and Mira's pages filled with the chaotic organization of a universe remembering itself. <words>488</words>
