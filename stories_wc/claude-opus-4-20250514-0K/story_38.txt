The attic window faced the subway tracks, where trains screamed past every eleven minutes. <words>12</words> Elena pressed dried lavender between yellowed pages, her movements precise despite the chaos of botanical samples scattered across her desk—a meticulously messy arrangement that made sense only to her. <words>40</words> Sleep had abandoned her months ago, leaving poetry to fill the void between dusk and dawn. <words>56</words>

The warnings came as whispers through the floorboards, voices of previous tenants who'd discovered what she now suspected: the samples weren't just plants. <words>79</words> Each specimen contained memories, pressed flat and preserved like evidence of crimes committed in this very room. <words>96</words> The building's history bled through—a botanist who'd poisoned rivals with rare herbs, leaving confessions scattered in dried petals. <words>114</words>

Elena's poems had become darker, filled with violence she didn't recognize as her own. <words>128</words> The samples infected her verses with their stored malevolence, each line dripping with the urge to eliminate, to destroy. <words>147</words> She needed to break free before the poison spread further. <words>157</words>

Between subway stops—those precious eleven minutes—she began her ritual. <words>166</words> At the after-parties following poetry readings, she'd drink cheap wine and let the truth spill out. <words>182</words> "The attic speaks to me," she'd confess to anyone who'd listen, her words slurred but urgent. <words>199</words> "The plants remember everything." <words>203</words>

Fellow poets dismissed her drunken ramblings, but Elena knew better. <words>213</words> Each confession weakened the samples' hold, each admission of the violence brewing within her diminished its power. <words>230</words> She was learning to eliminate the darkness not through force, but through exposure—bringing shadows into light through vulnerable honesty. <words>249</words>

The attic grew quieter with each passing night, the whispered warnings fading as Elena discovered something profound: non-violence wasn't passive. <words>269</words> It was the active choice to transform poison into medicine, to press pain into poetry that healed rather than harmed. <words>289</words> Her desk remained beautifully chaotic, but now the samples served a different purpose. <words>302</words>

She catalogued each specimen with new labels: "Forgiveness," "Release," "Understanding." <words>311</words> The botanical collection became her pharmacy of peace, each dried flower a reminder that even the most toxic histories could be transformed. <words>333</words> Between subway stops, she wrote verses that whispered warnings of their own—not of danger, but of the seductive ease of violence and the harder path of compassion. <words>361</words>

The empty abundance of her sleepless nights finally made sense. <words>371</words> In the hollowness of exhaustion, she'd found space for something greater than revenge or fear. <words>386</words> The haunted attic had become her sanctuary, where insomnia birthed poems that could eliminate hatred itself, one honest confession at a time. <words>408</words>
