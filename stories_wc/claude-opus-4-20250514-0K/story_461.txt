The irate explorer slammed the witch's study door, dust motes dancing in shafts of purple light. <words>14</words> "Three generations of my family died searching for this?" <words>23</words> Marcus held up the dragonfly-wing pendant, its iridescent surface catching the glow from spell-laden shelves. <words>39</words>

The witch's laughter held sardonic glee. <words>45</words> "Oh, how delicious—another angry descendant disturbing my afternoon tea." <words>54</words> She closed her spellbook with theatrical slowness. <words>61</words> "Your great-grandmother stood exactly where you are now, same fury, same ignorance." <words>73</words>

"Don't." <words>74</words> His knuckles whitened around the pendant. <words>80</words> "She vanished because of you." <words>85</words>

"She vanished because she couldn't listen." <words>91</words> The witch tapped her temple. <words>96</words> "Just like your grandmother. <words>100</words> Just like your mother. <words>104</words> And now, just like you." <words>109</words>

Marcus laughed bitterly. <words>111</words> "Generational dialogues, you called them in your letters. <words>119</words> Luring us here one by one." <words>125</words>

"I never lured anyone." <words>129</words> The witch's expression shifted, uniquely static despite her words—neither cruel nor kind, simply eternal. <words>144</words> "Each generation finds my letters in the hush of a childhood bedroom left forever, after loss makes them desperate." <words>163</words>

"Then why—" <words>165</words>

"To heal old wounds, you impossible fool." <words>172</words> She gestured to a meditation cushion. <words>178</words> "Your great-grandmother's rage still echoes here. <words>184</words> Your grandmother's grief. <words>187</words> Your mother's betrayal." <words>190</words> Her eyes glinted. <words>193</words> "All trapped in that pendant you're strangling." <words>200</words>

Marcus felt the dragonfly wings pulse against his palm. <words>209</words> "They're... inside?" <words>211</words>

"Their fury is." <words>214</words> The witch's sardonic smile returned. <words>219</words> "Three generations of unresolved pain, crystallized." <words>225</words> She leaned forward. <words>228</words> "Want to actually talk to them instead of following their footsteps?" <words>239</words>

Despite himself, Marcus sat. <words>243</words> The cushion smelled of lavender and old rage. <words>251</words>

"Close your eyes." <words>254</words> The witch's voice dropped. <words>258</words> "Breathe with the rhythm of a heartbeat during meditation." <words>267</words> She began to chant. <words>271</words> "Let the pendant pacify your inherited anger." <words>278</words>

The dragonfly wings grew warm. <words>283</words> Suddenly, three voices rose—his mother's sharp accusations, his grandmother's broken sobs, his great-grandmother's thunderous demands. <words>298</words> All directed at the witch. <words>303</words> All wrong. <words>305</words>

"They came seeking resurrection," the witch murmured. <words>312</words> "I offered reconciliation instead." <words>316</words>

Marcus gasped as understanding flooded through him. <words>323</words> Each woman had lost someone. <words>328</words> Each had demanded the impossible. <words>333</words> Each had refused the possible—to speak with the dead, to forgive, to let go. <words>347</words>

"They're not trapped," he whispered. <words>352</words> "They're... waiting?" <words>354</words>

"For someone wise enough to listen instead of demand." <words>363</words> The witch's static expression finally cracked, revealing ancient exhaustion. <words>373</words> "Four generations of stubbornness. <words>377</words> Please, boy. <words>379</words> End this." <words>381</words>

Marcus opened his palm. <words>385</words> The pendant lifted, spinning slowly. <words>390</words> Three translucent figures materialized—his matriarchal line, tears streaming, arms reaching. <words>400</words>

"I'm sorry," he said simply. <words>405</words> "I'm here now." <words>408</words>

The witch smiled with genuine warmth as the room filled with the sound of generational wounds finally beginning to heal. <words>428</words>
