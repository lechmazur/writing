Margaret hummed cheerfully as she adjusted her quantum entanglement watch band, its iridescent surface reflecting colors that shouldn't exist in the ice cavern's crystalline walls. <words>23</words> "Every apocalypse is just a chance for a better tomorrow!" she chirped to the frozen stalactites, her breath forming impossibly geometric clouds in the subzero air. <words>49</words>

The watch band pulsed—its entangled particles somewhere else entirely were responding to something Margaret couldn't yet see. <words>66</words> She'd discovered that by analyzing the subtext of lullabies sung in this particular cavern, she could decode the quantum fluctuations that preceded reality shifts. <words>90</words> The ice here remembered every sound, every vibration, storing them in its molecular structure like a vast library of possibilities. <words>110</words>

"Rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop," she sang, her voice fracturing into harmonics that shouldn't mathematically exist. <words>127</words> The words meant nothing; the spaces between them meant everything. <words>137</words> Each pause revealed another layer of impending change, another color bleeding through from the unforeseen future she was so eager to embrace. <words>159</words>

The watch band grew warm—time to notify the others. <words>168</words> But Margaret's definition of "notify" was politely chaotic at best. <words>178</words> She pressed her palm against the cavern wall and whispered, "Twinkle, twinkle, little star," letting the quantum entanglement carry her message through dimensions rather than distance. <words>204</words>

Somewhere, her fellow preppers would feel a gentle wrongness in their bones, a courteous disruption of their reality that would guide them here. <words>228</words> They'd arrive at the hush as a candle's flame is pinched—that perfect moment of transition between light and darkness, being and not-being. <words>251</words>

The sorrow came in waves, each one smaller yet containing the whole of the previous—fractal grief for the world that would cease to exist. <words>276</words> Margaret welcomed it with a smile that held infinite sadness folded into infinite hope. <words>290</words> "How I wonder what you are," she continued, and the cavern began to sing back in frequencies that tasted purple and felt like tomorrow. <words>314</words>

Her watch band displayed colors that had no names because they came from the reality she was creating—one where the apocalypse was merely a cocoon. <words>339</words> The ice around her began to crack in Fibonacci spirals, each fracture a doorway to possibility. <words>355</words> She'd spent years preparing for the end, only to discover she'd been preparing for the beginning all along. <words>373</words>

As the final notes of her analyzed lullaby echoed through dimensions, Margaret felt the universe hold its breath. <words>391</words> The unforeseen rushed in through the cracks, painting everything in colors of what could be. <words>406</words> "Welcome," she whispered to the new reality, as politely chaotic as ever, "I've been expecting you." <words>422</words>
