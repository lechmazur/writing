Sister Marisol adjusted her exorcist's collar with theatrical flair, because if you're going to banish demons in a treehouse metropolis suspended above the Amazon, you might as well look fabulous doing it. <words>26</words> The rope bridges connecting the elevated borough of Santo Espírito had been severed overnight—again—forcing her to take the tourist route through the lower canopy where the nouveau-riche wizards lived. <words>56</words>

"Typical," she muttered, clutching the battered grimoire she'd confiscated from yesterday's possession case. <words>70</words> The book hummed against her ribs, its leather cover sticky with what she hoped was just tree sap but suspected was something far less wholesome. <words>95</words>

At precisely 3:33, when time hiccupped and the afternoon shadows forgot their proper places, Marisol felt it—that familiar tingle of supernatural mischief that made her simultaneously exhausted and exhilarated. <words>124</words> A scream echoed from the mayor's penthouse treehouse, followed by what sounded suspiciously like giggling. <words>140</words>

"Let me guess," she called up through the emergency ladder system, her voice dripping with the kind of sarcasm only someone who'd performed seventeen exorcisms this week could muster. <words>169</words> "Someone read from the forbidden section again?" <words>176</words>

Mayor Delgado's head poked through his banana-leaf shutters, except his head now belonged to his eight-year-old self, complete with gap-toothed grin and chocolate-smeared cheeks. <words>200</words> "It wasn't me!" he protested in a voice that hadn't broken yet. <words>213</words>

Marisol sighed, already flipping through the grimoire's yellowed pages. <words>222</words> Every exorcist in the diocese wanted this assignment—the prestigious Amazonian beat, where magic literally grew on trees—but none of them understood the weight of keeping an entire city of ambitious spellcasters from accidentally unleashing apocalypses every Tuesday. <words>260</words>

"Right," she said, scaling the rope ladder with practiced ease despite her ceremonial robes. <words>274</words> "Because mayors always accidentally read youth spells when their approval ratings drop." <words>286</words>

The grimoire offered a solution, but naturally, it required her to channel the very demon she'd just banished yesterday. <words>305</words> The irony wasn't lost on her. <words>311</words> Her mentor, Father Eduardo, cast a long shadow from his legacy of zero demonic breaches in forty years—a record she was determined to not just match, but obliterate. <words>340</words>

"Hold still, Your Immaturity," she commanded, pressing her palm to his forehead. <words>352</words> The spell fought back, making her bones ache with the responsibility of undoing what ambition had wrought. <words>369</words> But Marisol had been born feisty, raised stubborn, and ordained unstoppable. <words>380</words>

With a sound like reality clearing its throat, the mayor's face stretched back to its properly middle-aged disappointment. <words>398</words> "Thank you, Sister," he mumbled, then added hopefully, "You won't mention this to the press?" <words>414</words>

Marisol tucked the grimoire away, already hearing the next crisis brewing three treehouses over. <words>428</words> "That depends entirely on whether you finally approve funding for those new rope bridges." <words>443</words> She winked, because even proud exorcists knew when to leverage a little divine blackmail. <words>458</words> After all, someone had to keep this ridiculous city in the trees from falling apart—literally and spiritually. <words>475</words>
