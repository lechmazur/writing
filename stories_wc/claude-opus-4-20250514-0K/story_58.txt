The moth observation tower stood skeletal against the night sky, its windows dark as the city's lights flickered below in the aftermath of the unexpected outage. <words>24</words> Mara pressed her palm against the engraved bullet journal cover, feeling the intricate patterns that mapped her years of service as a scout—each line a mission completed, each curve a life saved. <words>55</words>

She had climbed here seeking meditation techniques, desperate to quiet the storms raging inside her mind since her last assignment. <words>75</words> The tower, once used by lepidopterists to study moth migration patterns, now served as her sanctuary from the chaos below. <words>95</words> In the intermittent darkness, she could almost believe the world had paused, giving her space to breathe. <words>112</words>

"Individually common," her handler had called her symptoms—the nightmares, the hypervigilance, the crushing weight of loyalty that demanded she return to the field despite her fracturing psyche. <words>138</words> Every scout experienced this eventual unraveling, he'd said, as if that made it easier. <words>152</words>

Through the tower's ancient radio, static-laden broadcasts crackled to life. <words>162</words> A comedian's voice emerged, telling jokes about power outages and urban wildlife, but Mara recognized the coded nonsense woven through the routine. <words>184</words> Each punchline contained instructions designed to radicalize sleeper agents, hidden beneath layers of mundane humor about moths attracted to dying streetlights. <words>205</words>

Her loyalty warred with horror as she decoded the message: activation protocols for a network she'd helped establish years ago. <words>225</words> The meditation techniques she sought suddenly seemed trivial against this revelation. <words>236</words> She opened her journal, running her fingers across pages filled with breathing exercises and mantras, knowing she should report the transmission immediately. <words>259</words>

But the sanctified dread that filled the tower held her frozen. <words>270</words> This place, where thousands of moths had been catalogued and studied, now witnessed her own metamorphosis. <words>286</words> The flickering lights below looked like dying stars, and she wondered if the city itself was transforming into something unrecognizable. <words>306</words>

She thought of the agents waiting in the darkness, individually common people nursing their own storms, about to be awakened by comedy and catastrophe. <words>330</words> Her journal fell open to a blank page, and she began writing by the ghost-light of the failing grid, documenting not meditation techniques but a counter-code. <words>357</words> If she could hijack the comedian's next broadcast, layer her own message within his routine, perhaps she could prevent the activation without betraying her duty to protect. <words>385</words>

The moths outside the tower began their ancient dance, drawn to the intermittent light, and Mara understood that loyalty sometimes meant becoming the storm rather than calming it. <words>413</words> She pressed record on the radio equipment, cleared her throat, and began crafting her own routine—one that would save the individually common from becoming collectively dangerous. <words>440</words> In the sanctified dread of the observation tower, she finally found her meditation: the careful balance between duty and conscience, delivered one coded joke at a time. <words>468</words>
