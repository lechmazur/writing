The giant's study loomed impossibly vast, its shelves stretching into shadows where dust motes danced like constellations. <words>17</words> Marcus, sporting his predictably torn jeans and vintage band t-shirt—the uniform of the conventionally rebellious—clutched the wilted paper flower he'd found wedged between two ancient tomes. <words>45</words> He hadn't meant to become an unlikely prophet, but the flower pulsed with warmth against his palm, whispering secrets of glimmering transitions between worlds. <words>69</words>

Three nights ago, everything had changed at the laundromat on Seventh Street. <words>81</words> He'd been folding his last load when she appeared—the giant's daughter, her eyes reflecting galaxies. <words>97</words> "You're holding my mother's last creation," she'd said, pointing to the paper flower he'd absently picked up from atop a washing machine. <words>120</words> Before he could respond, reality had shimmered, and he'd found himself here, in this cathedral of knowledge that existed between scenes of ordinary life. <words>145</words>

The flower guided him through the study's labyrinthine corridors, each turn revealing more lost souls wandering between bookshelves. <words>163</words> They were the estranged—people who'd slipped through reality's cracks, their minds scattered across dimensions like pages torn from a book. <words>184</words> Marcus understood now why he'd been chosen: his rebellion had always been about connection, about refusing to let people drift apart. <words>206</words>

"Gather," he whispered, and the flower bloomed despite its wilted appearance, casting prismatic light that made the air sing with haunting delight. <words>229</words> The wanderers turned toward him, their fractured gazes focusing for the first time in years. <words>245</words> He spoke of unity, of minds finding their way back to wholeness, his words carrying the strange authority of someone who'd never believed in authority at all. <words>272</words>

The giant's daughter materialized beside him, her smile both terrible and beautiful. <words>284</words> "My mother knew you'd come," she said. <words>291</words> "She made that flower from the first page of every story never told, waiting for someone foolish enough to pick it up in a laundromat at midnight." <words>318</words>

As Marcus raised the paper flower high, its petals unfurled into doorways—glimmering transitions back to the world they'd all left behind. <words>340</words> But they wouldn't return unchanged; they carried the study's wisdom now, minds unified under the vision of connection across impossibility. <words>361</words> One by one, they stepped through, each departure making the vast space feel less empty and more like a beginning. <words>382</words>

Marcus lingered, knowing his role as unlikely prophet had only just begun. <words>394</words> The flower crumbled to dust in his hands, but its warmth remained, a haunting delight that would guide him to the next lost soul, the next late-night laundromat, the next glimmering transition between what is and what could be. <words>434</words>
