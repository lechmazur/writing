The jovial sellsword Erasmus Blackthorn stood amid the witch's herb garden, his weathered hands gripping the brass astronomical telescope he'd inherited from his grandmother. <words>23</words> "Every Blackthorn buries their greatest treasure beneath the stars," he muttered, recalling the family tradition of making a time capsule on the eve of transformation. <words>48</words> Tonight, he would bury the withering vow that had haunted him for decades—the oath to never trust his own judgment after leading his company to slaughter. <words>75</words>

The garden writhed with elegant mayhem as moonflowers unfurled their petals and nightshade vines crept across ancient stones. <words>93</words> Erasmus was boldly reluctant, his usual mirth warring with the gravity of breaking a blood oath. <words>110</words> The witch Morgana emerged from between rows of hemlock, her silver hair floating as if underwater. <words>127</words>

"You seek to dethrone doubt from the mind," she observed, gesturing to his telescope. <words>142</words> "That instrument reveals distant truths, yet you've used it only to study your failures in the stars." <words>160</words>

Erasmus laughed, but it rang hollow. <words>166</words> "My grandmother said the stars hold all answers, but they've only shown me the constellation I named after my fallen men." <words>188</words>

"Then perhaps it's time to look elsewhere," Morgana suggested, producing a vial of iridescent liquid. <words>204</words> "The transformation potion—drink it as you bury your vow, and throughout the transformation, you'll discover what lies beyond self-doubt." <words>224</words>

With characteristic bravado masking his trepidation, Erasmus dug beneath the sundial where his ancestors had buried their own time capsules. <words>244</words> He placed the telescope inside along with a scroll bearing his withering vow, then drank the potion in one swift motion. <words>266</words>

Throughout the transformation, his body remained unchanged, but his mind expanded like the universe his telescope had shown him. <words>285</words> The elegant mayhem of the garden seemed to slow, each plant whispering secrets of growth after devastation. <words>302</words> He saw his fallen company not as victims of his failure, but as brothers who had chosen to follow him freely. <words>323</words>

As dawn approached, Erasmus understood. <words>328</words> The withering vow had been his true enemy, not his judgment. <words>339</words> He laughed—genuinely this time—as he realized his grandmother's telescope had always pointed toward hope, not condemnation. <words>355</words>

Morgana smiled as the transformation completed. <words>361</words> "Your family's tradition isn't about burying treasures, sellsword. <words>369</words> It's about planting seeds of wisdom for future Blackthorns to harvest." <words>381</words>

Erasmus left the witch's herb garden with empty hands but a full heart, his jovial nature restored and his doubt dethroned at last. <words>405</words> The withering vow would remain buried, its power broken by the elegant mayhem of acceptance. <words>421</words>
