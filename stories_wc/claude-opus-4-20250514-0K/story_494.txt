The arrogant swordsman stood in the calligraphy master's courtyard, his blade trembling against the ancient stone. <words>15</words> Master Wei held up a faded tapestry fragment, its threads barely clinging to memory. <words>29</words> "Your grandfather wove this before the darkness took our village," she said, her voice carrying harsh tenderness. <words>46</words> 

Jin's fingers tightened on his sword hilt, doubtfully confident as always when confronted with his heritage. <words>62</words> The fragment showed half a phoenix, wings spread but incomplete, much like his own shackled potential. <words>78</words> He had mastered every sword form, defeated every opponent, yet something essential remained locked within him. <words>94</words>

"You came here to authorize the old ways' return," Master Wei continued, her brush poised over fresh parchment. <words>112</words> "But first, you must understand what you truly carry." <words>121</words>

The courtyard fell silent except for the whisper of bamboo leaves. <words>132</words> Jin's arrogance crumbled as Wei began to hum—not just any melody, but the traditional song sung at every family wedding. <words>152</words> His mother had hummed it while mending his clothes, his grandmother while grinding ink. <words>166</words> The notes struck him like physical blows, each one revealing another layer of pride he'd built to hide his fear. <words>186</words>

"Between breaths," Wei said, still humming, "that's where truth lives." <words>196</words> She dipped her brush and began to write, each character flowing like water finding its course. <words>212</words> "Your grandfather knew this when he wove that tapestry, knew that strength without understanding is merely violence dressed in skill." <words>232</words>

Jin watched the characters emerge: Honor. Humility. Heritage. <words>240</words> The song continued, and suddenly he understood why he'd truly come. <words>251</words> Not for permission to restore old traditions, but to deliver a spark where all lights have gone out—starting with the darkness in himself. <words>274</words>

His sword clattered to the stones. <words>280</words> Jin knelt, not in submission but in recognition. <words>288</words> The faded tapestry fragment fluttered in Wei's weathered hands, and he saw it clearly now: the phoenix was not incomplete but waiting. <words>310</words> Waiting for someone humble enough to finish the pattern. <words>319</words>

"Sing with me," Wei commanded gently, her harsh tenderness a bridge between what was and what could be. <words>337</words> Jin's voice, rusty with disuse, joined the wedding song. <words>346</words> In that moment between breaths, between notes, between the swordsman he was and the man he might become, something shifted. <words>365</words> The shackles of his potential began to loosen. <words>373</words>

Master Wei smiled and authorized what his heart had already decided. <words>384</words> "Take the fragment. Finish what was started. Let your blade serve more than your pride." <words>399</words> Jin rose, no longer just an arrogant swordsman but a guardian of something worth defending. <words>414</words> The spark had been delivered, first to himself, then to carry forward into the waiting darkness. <words>430</words>
