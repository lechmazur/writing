The xenon lights hummed their cold song as Melody clutched her worn-out dinosaur plush, its purple fabric threadbare from decades of nervous fingers. <words>20</words> She was the city's most reluctant bard, famous for performances that began as whispers and erupted into accidental symphonies—shyly loud, they called her. <words>44</words> Tonight, on this December 31st marking the end of 2089—the year of the plague, the floods, the silence—she stood before the dream-hopping machine. <words>69</words>

"You understand what you're asking?" Dr. Chen's voice echoed in the tunnel. <words>82</words> "To motivate an entire population through their dreams, to help them face tomorrow?" <words>96</words>

Melody nodded, though her hands trembled. <words>102</words> The machine would amplify her songs across sleeping minds, but time itself would fracture—past, present, and future bleeding together like watercolors in rain. <words>126</words> She'd seen it happen to other bards: they'd entered dreams whole and emerged as fragments, their memories scattered across decades they'd never lived. <words>150</words>

The dinosaur had been her daughter's, before the sickness took her in March. <words>163</words> Before the world unraveled like a tapestry pulled at both ends, leaving only loose threads of sorrow. <words>181</words> Melody pressed it against her chest and stepped into the machine's embrace. <words>193</words>

The first dream tasted of ash and forgetting. <words>201</words> She sang softly, then louder, then soft again—her voice a tide that couldn't decide whether to advance or retreat. <words>221</words> In each sleeping mind, she planted seeds of tomorrow: not hope exactly, but the peculiar strength found in admitting fragility. <words>242</words>

She dream-hopped through thousands of souls, watching time fold and unfold like origami made of light. <words>259</words> In one mind, she was eight years old again; in another, she was ancient, singing to stars that hadn't been born yet. <words>282</words> The dinosaur plush aged and renewed itself with each leap, sometimes pristine, sometimes dust, always there. <words>298</words>

Hours collapsed into seconds, years stretched into heartbeats. <words>306</words> Melody understood now why the machine was kept in this tunnel—the xenon lights weren't just illumination but anchors, their artificial glow the only constant as reality shifted. <words>335</words>

When she emerged at dawn on January 1st, 2090, her hair had turned silver and her eyes held centuries. <words>354</words> The city woke with an inexplicable urge to create, to connect, to continue—not because the sorrow was gone, but because they'd learned to weave with it rather than despite it. <words>385</words>

Dr. Chen found her sitting against the tunnel wall, singing lullabies to the dinosaur plush. <words>400</words> "Did it work?" he asked. <words>405</words>

Melody smiled, her voice now permanently caught between whisper and roar. <words>416</words> "Time is fragile," she said, "but that's precisely what makes it precious." <words>429</words> She stood, cradling the toy that had traveled through a thousand lifetimes in a single night. <words>446</words> Outside, the world began again, imperfect but continuing, motivated by dreams they'd never quite remember but would always carry. <words>466</words>
