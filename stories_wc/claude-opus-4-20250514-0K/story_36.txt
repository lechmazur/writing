The morning light filtered through cracked windows into Ezra's steampunk workshop, illuminating brass gears and copper pipes that climbed the walls like mechanical vines. <words>19</words> He sat cross-legged on the barn loft floor, running weathered fingers over his battered old skateboard covered in stickers—relics from a time when rebellion meant grinding rails, not prophesying the end of worlds. <words>52</words>

"The gears will stop turning," he whispered to no one, his voice carrying the placid ferocity of absolute certainty. <words>71</words> The skateboard's deck bore witness to his transformation: peace signs faded beneath apocalyptic symbols, band logos obscured by calculations of entropy. <words>93</words>

A distant train whistle pierced the dawn's hush, its mournful cry threading through the workshop's maze of inventions. <words>111</words> Ezra's eyes, faithfully odd in their mismatched colors—one brown, one grey—tracked the sound's trajectory. <words>126</words> The whistle always came at this hour, marking time in a world that refused to acknowledge its own decay. <words>145</words>

He had been seventeen when the visions started, skating through empty pools and feeling the future's weight crush his innocence like glass beneath wheels. <words>169</words> The other prophets screamed their warnings from street corners, but Ezra had learned that calm unnerved people more than fury. <words>190</words> His workshop became a temple to controlled chaos, where he built impossible machines that would resume function only after everything else failed. <words>213</words>

The skateboard served as his altar now, each sticker a prayer to motion in a universe grinding toward stillness. <words>232</words> He'd stopped skating the day he understood that every trick defied entropy only to feed it, every ollie a small surrender to gravity's patient hunger. <words>257</words>

Standing, Ezra moved to his latest creation—a clockwork heart that beat backward, pulling time through itself like thread through a needle. <words>279</words> The train whistle faded, but its echo lived in the workshop's pipes, a ghost of momentum haunting still air. <words>298</words>

"Today," he announced to the mechanical witnesses around him, "we slam a door on the gods of stagnation." <words>316</words> His hands, scarred from years of gripping grip tape and welding torches, adjusted delicate gears with surgeon's precision. <words>334</words>

The heart began its reverse rhythm, and somewhere in the distance, the train whistle sounded again—but different now, younger, like it remembered being built. <words>358</words> Ezra smiled, a prophet's satisfaction creasing his face as his workshop hummed with renewed purpose. <words>373</words>

He had lost his innocence to visions of endings, but perhaps that loss itself could be unwound, reversed like everything else in this barn loft where time obeyed different masters. <words>403</words> The skateboard waited, patient as prophecy, for the world to resume its ride. <words>416</words>
