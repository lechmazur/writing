Dr. Marlene Chen adjusted her spectacles as she wandered the obsidian skyscraper's fifty-third floor, where the hospital's psychiatric ward maintained its peculiar silence before sunrise. <words>24</words> Everyone called her a pleasant meddler, though she preferred "concerned colleague" when she inserted herself into patients' affairs with her openly manipulative charm. <words>47</words>

Tonight, she carried a pair of rusted ice skates discovered in Room 5307, their blades etched with symbols that shouldn't exist. <words>68</words> The patient who'd left them behind had vanished during the night shift, leaving only wet sand scattered across the linoleum—sand that formed patterns matching the skate engravings. <words>96</words>

"Scattered seeds," the night nurse had whispered, pointing at the granules before sweeping them away. <words>111</words> But Marlene had photographed everything first. <words>117</words>

She followed the trail of sand to the emergency stairwell, where it transformed into something impossible: the receding footprints of a nighttime beach wanderer, each step glowing faintly with bioluminescent algae. <words>147</words> The footprints led upward, defying logic, as if the ocean itself had invaded this sterile tower. <words>163</words>

Marlene's motivation crystallized—she needed to decode these ancient symbols before dawn broke. <words>175</words> The skates grew heavier in her hands, their rust flaking to reveal more inscriptions underneath. <words>190</words> She recognized fragments of Sumerian, Egyptian hieroglyphs, and something older, pre-linguistic. <words>201</words>

"You're trying to weaken my resolve," she murmured to the empty corridor, understanding suddenly that the skates were both key and trap. <words>223</words> The pleasant meddler in her recognized another manipulator's handiwork. <words>232</words>

Following the phosphorescent footprints to the roof access, she found the door already open. <words>246</words> The pre-dawn air tasted of salt despite being two hundred miles from any ocean. <words>260</words> There, etched into the building's obsidian crown, were the same symbols—massive, ancient, waiting. <words>273</words>

The footprints ended at the edge, where someone had clearly stood moments before. <words>286</words> Marlene understood with lucid confusion that the patterns weren't random—they were instructions, warnings, or perhaps invitations. <words>302</words> The scattered seeds of sand below began arranging themselves into new configurations, spelling out coordinates in dead languages. <words>320</words>

She lifted the skates, watching how moonlight transformed their rust into copper fire. <words>333</words> Whatever patient had worn these had walked between worlds, leaving breadcrumbs for someone exactly like her—a pleasant meddler who couldn't resist a puzzle. <words>356</words>

As the first hints of sunrise painted the horizon, Marlene made her choice. <words>369</words> She slipped on the ancient skates, feeling their edges bite through her shoes, through reality itself. <words>385</words> The symbols blazed to life, and she understood that sometimes the most dangerous mysteries choose their own investigators. <words>403</words> The obsidian skyscraper hummed beneath her feet, ready to reveal what had always been hidden in plain sight. <words>421</words>
