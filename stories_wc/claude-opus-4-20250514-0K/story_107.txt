Marcus Bright, once television's most beloved game show host, awakened to find his makeshift raft had drifted to an impossible shore—a colossal hollow tree trunk echoing with ten thousand chittering wings. <words>26</words>

The Insect Symphony Hall, as the driftwood sign proclaimed, rose before him like nature's own cathedral, its walls alive with beetles clicking in rhythmic percussion. <words>51</words>

He clutched the fortune-teller's crystal ball he'd salvaged from his yacht's wreckage, the only remnant of his final episode's grand prize. <words>73</words>

Inside, termites had carved amphitheater rows where moths and dragonflies perched in solemn attendance. <words>87</words>

Marcus strangely always felt watched on this island, but here the sensation intensified—countless compound eyes tracking his every movement. <words>106</words>

At the hall's heart sat an ancient typewriter, its keys worn smooth by generations of six-legged scribes. <words>124</words>

"You've come for the manuscript," buzzed a voice both sweet and acrid, like bitter honey on his tongue. <words>143</words>

A mantis, dressed in a tattered morning coat, emerged from behind the typewriter. <words>156</words>

"The sacred knowledge of navigation—how your kind once sailed by reading insect flight patterns." <words>170</words>

Marcus nodded, remembering the yacht captain's dying words about this place. <words>181</words>

The mantis gestured to the typewriter with one razor-sharp foreleg. <words>191</words>

"But someone has sabotaged our work." <words>197</words>

Indeed, several keys had been viciously torn away, rendering the machine useless. <words>209</words>

"Without it, we cannot complete the translation before the migration season ends forever." <words>223</words>

Marcus felt his throat constrict, a sudden illness overtaking him—anaphylaxis from the hall's concentrated pheromones. <words>238</words>

As he collapsed, gasping, a butterfly with wings like stained glass windows alighted on his shoulder. <words>254</words>

"Breathe through this," she whispered, producing a hollow reed. <words>263</words>

The relief was immediate. <words>267</words>

"I am Aria," she said. <words>272</words>

"I know who broke the typewriter—jealous wasps who profit from keeping humans lost at sea." <words>287</words>

Marcus held up the crystal ball, its surface suddenly alive with swirling possibilities. <words>300</words>

"In my world, we call this a gentle overturn," he said, his game show instincts awakening. <words>317</words>

"When the obvious solution isn't destruction, but transformation." <words>325</words>

He focused on the ball, and letters began forming in its depths—the missing keys' symbols glowing softly. <words>342</words>

Working together, Marcus called out each letter while Aria's delicate legs tapped the remaining keys, the insects humming in harmony as ancient wisdom flowed onto yellowed pages. <words>369</words>

When the old typewriter's keys finally went silent, the manuscript was complete. <words>381</words>

Marcus tucked the rolled papers into his shirt, bowing to the assembled insects. <words>394</words>

The sacred knowledge was rescued, though he wondered if he'd ever truly leave this strange shore. <words>410</words>

Sometimes the greatest prize isn't escape, but understanding where you've always belonged. <words>422</words>
