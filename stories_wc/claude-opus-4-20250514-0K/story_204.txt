Maya had been a professional cuddler for seven years, but she'd never held someone while they decayed. <words>17</words> The abandoned spaceport hangar stretched around them like a cathedral of rust, its silence profound as the hush before an acceptance speech begins. <words>40</words> She'd met him at the farmer's market that morning—an unusually usual encounter between strangers reaching for the same heirloom tomato. <words>60</words> 

"I need someone," he'd said simply, and she'd recognized the particular loneliness that transcended species. <words>76</words> His skin had the translucent quality of old parchment, revealing the slow dissolution beneath. <words>90</words> The Faders, as they called themselves, were beings who existed between dimensions, gradually losing cohesion in any single reality. <words>109</words> Maya had grown up fearing them, taught by her grandmother that their decay was contagious, that human touch would accelerate their unraveling. <words>131</words>

But here, in this vast hangar where shuttles once launched toward distant stars, she understood the unspoken rules had always been wrong. <words>153</words> The phantom train ticket punch he clutched—an artifact from his original dimension—left no marks on the air as he nervously clicked it. <words>176</words> "In my world," he whispered, "we never touched without purpose." <words>186</words>

Maya settled beside him on the cold concrete, her professional instincts adapting to this ancient novelty of connection. <words>204</words> She'd held the grieving, the dying, the desperately alone, but never someone literally fading from existence. <words>221</words> As her arms encircled him, she felt his edges blur against her skin—not unpleasant, just different, like holding warm mist. <words>242</words>

"My grandmother was wrong," Maya said, her prejudice crumbling like old mortar. <words>254</words> The Fader's laugh was like wind chimes in an empty house. <words>265</words> "Most grandmothers are, about something." <words>270</words>

They sat together as the hangar's broken skylights painted patterns of afternoon light across the floor. <words>286</words> His decay wasn't spreading to her; instead, her stability seemed to slow his dispersal. <words>300</words> The phantom punch clicked steadily, marking time that didn't exist, validating journeys never taken. <words>314</words>

"Thank you," he said, his voice growing distant though his form remained present in her arms. <words>331</words> Maya realized that professional cuddling had always been about this—holding space for transitions, whatever form they took. <words>349</words> The unspoken rules that had governed her world, keeping humans and Faders apart, dissolved like sugar in rain. <words>367</words>

When he finally faded completely, the phantom punch remained, solid and real in her hands. <words>382</words> Maya stood in the ancient hangar, understanding that some connections transcend dimension, species, and form. <words>397</words> Tomorrow, she would return to the farmer's market, ready to embrace whoever needed holding, regardless of the fears she'd been taught. <words>419</words> The unusually usual had become beautifully possible. <words>426</words>
