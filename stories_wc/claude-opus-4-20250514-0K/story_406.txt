The morning paper thudded against Elara's empty porch, its headlines screaming about the diplomatic breakthrough between warring covens. <words>16</words> She smiled from behind the brewery window, fingering the loose button on her borrowed colonel's uniform—a disguise that had served her well last night. <words>40</words> The witch's potion brewery bubbled with reversed-time elixirs, each vial containing moments stolen from tomorrow and yesterday alike. <words>58</words>

As a coy spy specializing in magical conflicts, Elara had infiltrated both covens using her diabolically benevolent methods. <words>76</words> She'd poison their leaders with kindness potions, then offer the antidote in exchange for peace talks. <words>92</words> Her ultimate goal wasn't mere espionage—she yearned to become a master of disguise so perfect that even mirrors would forget her true face. <words>116</words>

The loose button had nearly betrayed her during last night's operation. <words>127</words> Colonel Blackthorne, whose uniform she'd "borrowed," had noticed the thread unraveling just as she'd begun pouring reconciliation draught into the Eastern Coven's ceremonial chalice. <words>151</words> But Elara's fingers moved with practiced grace, pretending to adjust her medals while secretly holding the button in place. <words>170</words>

"Your valor in the Salamander Wars was legendary," the High Witch had said, not knowing she spoke to an imposter wearing borrowed glory. <words>194</words> Elara had merely nodded, letting the uniform tell its own story. <words>205</words>

Now, as dawn broke over the brewery, she prepared her greatest deception yet. <words>218</words> The reversed-time potion would allow her to bypass the Western Coven's temporal wards by entering their stronghold yesterday, before the barriers were erected. <words>242</words> She'd already been there, would be there, was there—the grammar of time magic always confused even experienced practitioners. <words>261</words>

The metaphorical fences between the covens weren't the only things being mended. <words>273</words> Elara touched the button again, remembering how she'd sewn it back with thread spun from tomorrow's silkworms. <words>290</words> Each stitch had woven her deeper into her false identity, until she sometimes forgot which face was truly hers. <words>309</words>

The brewery's cauldrons sang their morning song as she bottled the final potion. <words>322</words> By noon, both covens would discover their "war hero" had been a phantom, but by then, peace treaties would be signed with ink that couldn't be erased without unraveling time itself. <words>354</words>

She left the colonel's uniform hanging on the door, its loose button finally, properly secured. <words>369</words> Tomorrow, she'd wear a merchant's robes. <words>375</words> Yesterday, she'd been a traveling minstrel. <words>381</words> But today, walking past that empty porch where no one waited for the morning news, Elara was simply herself—a master of disguise who'd mended the world by borrowing the valor of others, one deception at a time. <words>419</words>
