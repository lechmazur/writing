Marcus had always been a reckless hunter, but his prey wasn't game—it was forgotten places. <words>15</words> The vintage camera lens hanging from his neck had mapped seventeen ghost towns already, each frame capturing what time tried to atomize. <words>35</words> He moved through the world with what his sister called "meticulous carelessness," planning every expedition down to the minute, then abandoning those plans the moment intuition struck. <words>62</words>

The abandoned funfair emerged from the mist like a broken promise. <words>73</words> Rusted carousel horses stood frozen mid-gallop, their painted eyes watching nothing. <words>85</words> Marcus lifted the lens, its weight familiar as grief. <words>94</words> Through it, the world sharpened into truth. <words>101</words>

"You looking for something specific?" <words>106</words>

The voice belonged to a woman with a violin case, one of three street musicians who'd somehow found this place too. <words>127</words> They sat among the defunct game booths, instruments ready. <words>136</words>

"Ghost towns," Marcus said, lowering the lens. <words>143</words> "I map them." <words>146</words>

"Why?" asked the cellist, an older man whose fingers moved across invisible strings. <words>159</words>

Marcus considered lying, but the mist made honesty easier. <words>168</words> "My daughter loved carnivals." <words>172</words> The words tasted like rust. <words>177</words> "Before the accident, I promised her we'd visit every fairground in the state." <words>190</words>

The musicians exchanged glances. <words>194</words> The third, a young woman with a accordion, spoke softly. <words>204</words> "Promises don't atomize just because people do." <words>211</words>

"That's why I document them," Marcus said, gesturing at the decay. <words>222</words> "Every abandoned place was someone's joy once." <words>229</words>

They began to play—not a rehearsed piece, but something that grew from their conversation, notes weaving between the empty rides. <words>249</words> The violin sang of what was lost, the cello of what remained, the accordion of what might still be found. <words>269</words>

Marcus raised the vintage lens again. <words>275</words> Through it, he saw not just rust and ruin, but the ghosts of laughter, the shadows of cotton candy, the echo of his daughter's hand in his. <words>302</words> He'd been hunting the wrong ghosts all along. <words>310</words>

"Make wise choices," the violinist said as their music faded. <words>320</words> "Not safe ones." <words>323</words>

Marcus nodded, understanding finally that mapping ghost towns wasn't about preserving decay—it was about honoring the life that once filled them. <words>344</words> His reckless hunting had always been meticulous in its carelessness because grief required both precision and abandon. <words>361</words>

As the musicians packed up, Marcus captured one last frame: their silhouettes against the fog, temporary beauty in a permanent ruin. <words>382</words> The forgotten promise had resurfaced not to haunt him, but to free him. <words>395</words> He could map these places without living in them. <words>404</words>

The mist swallowed the fairground again, but Marcus carried its truth in glass and silver, ready for the next ghost town, the next conversation, the next wise choice disguised as recklessness. <words>434</words>
