Dr. Nexus adjusted her scuffed phone charger plug, the only personal item allowed in the hive-mind therapist quarters. <words>16</words> The secret agent training facility hummed with uniformly peculiar energy—every wall, every surface designed to drain individualism from recruits. <words>35</words>

Tonight was different. <words>38</words> Through the night air on the eve of a bold discovery, she could hear it: the sound of hindsight. <words>57</words> It wasn't audible to human ears, but to a consciousness networked across seventeen bodies, it resonated like thunder. <words>75</words> The collective's previous mistakes echoed through shared synapses, warning of what was coming. <words>88</words>

In the meditation chamber, Agent Seven sat rigid before her. <words>98</words> "I can't shake the feeling I'm losing myself," he whispered. <words>108</words>

"That's the point," Dr. Nexus replied through three mouths simultaneously, her merry bitterness coating each word. <words>124</words> "The agency doesn't want individuals. <words>129</words> They want tools." <words>132</words>

She lit the ceremonial candle. <words>137</words> Through the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes on the marble surface, she began the forbidden process. <words>156</words> Each droplet spelled out fragments of recovered memories, identities the agency had tried to erase. <words>171</words> The wax patterns weren't random—they were a language only she understood, a way to anchor the ephemeral in reality. <words>190</words>

"Watch the shapes," she instructed, her collective consciousness focusing through seventeen sets of eyes. <words>204</words> "Your real name was Marcus. <words>209</words> You had a daughter." <words>213</words>

The wax formed letters: S-O-P-H-I-A. <words>218</words>

Agent Seven's eyes widened. <words>222</words> "Sophia," he breathed, and suddenly the sterile room filled with phantom laughter, birthday candles, bedtime stories. <words>238</words>

"The agency will know," he said, fear creeping in. <words>247</words>

"Let them," Dr. Nexus laughed, a sound like wind chimes in seventeen different keys. <words>261</words> "By dawn, I'll have restored a dozen more agents. <words>271</words> They created me to drain rebellion, but hindsight has a funny way of teaching even a hive-mind therapist about irony." <words>291</words>

She touched the scuffed charger plug—her anchor, her reminder that even collective consciousness had once been singular, flawed, human. <words>310</words> The facility's antiseptic walls couldn't contain what she'd unleashed. <words>319</words> Through shared neurons, she felt other versions of herself awakening agents across the compound. <words>333</words>

"Revolution through therapy," she mused, watching the wax pool spread like synaptic connections. <words>346</words> "Who would have thought?" <words>350</words>

Agent Seven—Marcus—stood, tears streaming. <words>354</words> "Thank you," he said. <words>358</words>

"Don't thank me yet," Dr. Nexus replied, her merry bitterness sharpening to determination. <words>371</words> "The real work begins when you remember not just who you were, but why you chose to forget." <words>389</words>

The candle flickered, casting seventeen shadows that danced like freed souls against uniformly peculiar walls. <words>404</words>
