Maya pressed her nose against the dusty glass of the Recipe Repository, watching her reflection ripple like water. <words>15</words> Three centuries of being reincarnated as various aquarium maintenance specialists had taught her that guilt follows you through every lifetime, especially when you've let 47 goldfish die in your first incarnation. <words>43</words>

Inside, towering shelves held recipe cards for everything from "Grandmother's Existential Soup" to "Bread That Forgets You Ate It." <words>62</words> The library had been abandoned since people discovered that ordering takeout required less soul-searching than cooking with intention. <words>81</words>

Maya clutched the one-armed toy soldier she'd carried through six lifetimes—a reminder of her original sin, when she'd forgotten to feed Colonel Bubbles and his battalion of fancy goldfish while playing with toys. <words>114</words> She'd come here with tentatively fierce determination to find the legendary "Recipe for Absolution," supposedly filed somewhere between "Regret Reduction Ragu" and "Redemption Rice Pudding." <words>139</words>

The weather, apparently bored with her brooding, decided to throw a tantrum. <words>151</words> Hail hammered the roof like an impatient customer, forcing a stranger through the doors—Dr. Chen, clutching medical charts and looking thoroughly inconvenienced by the universe. <words>176</words>

"Great," he muttered, shaking ice from his coat. <words>184</words> "First my patient's test results show something impossible, now this." <words>194</words>

Maya recognized a fellow sufferer of cosmic jokes. <words>202</words> "Let me guess—someone's growing gills?" <words>207</words>

"Close. Someone's memories are turning into fish." <words>214</words> He paused, studying her. <words>218</words> "Wait, aren't you the Aquarium Lady from Channel 7?" <words>227</words>

"Former Aquarium Lady," Maya corrected. <words>232</words> "Current seeker of ridiculous redemption recipes." <words>238</words>

Dr. Chen laughed—a sound like bubbles popping. <words>245</words> "You know what's funny? My patient keeps drawing goldfish and toy soldiers." <words>258</words> He showed her the chart: crude sketches filled the margins. <words>268</words>

Maya's heart performed acrobatics. <words>272</words> "That's... that's Colonel Bubbles' brigade." <words>277</words>

The coincidence tasted suspicious, like fate's cooking. <words>284</words> Together, they searched the stacks, finding not the Recipe for Absolution but something better: "Instructions for Alleviation Through Abbreviated Accountability." <words>305</words>

The recipe was simple: "Stop carrying other people's expectations like expired groceries. Garnish with self-forgiveness. Serves one." <words>322</words>

Dr. Chen's patient, they discovered, was Maya's first employer's descendant, inheriting memories of the Great Goldfish Tragedy of 1987. <words>341</words> The tradition of blame had stagnated in their family like old aquarium water. <words>354</words>

"So," Dr. Chen said, pocketing his charts, "want to help me prescribe some perspective?" <words>368</words>

Maya touched her toy soldier's remaining arm. <words>375</words> Three hundred years of guilt suddenly seemed like a very long time to spend swimming in circles. <words>392</words>

"Sure," she said, surprising herself with something dangerously close to hope. <words>403</words> "But first, let's steal some recipes. I have a feeling 'Graceful Exit Goulash' might come in handy." <words>421</words>

The hail stopped, as if the weather had finally made its point. <words>433</words>

Outside, puddles reflected the sky like tiny aquariums, each one a fresh start. <words>446</words> Maya left the soldier on a shelf between "Mourning Muffins" and "Moving On Marinara," where he could guard better things than her guilt. <words>470</words>

Sometimes the best way to disrupt tradition is to simply stop feeding it. <words>483</words>

Even goldfish know when to let go. <words>490</words>
