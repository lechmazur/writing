Ezra's fingers trembled as she opened the flimsy photo album, its spine cracking like brittle bones in the forgotten library. <words>19</words> The treehouse swayed gently, a wooden ark suspended above a world that had stopped making children. <words>34</words> She was a convicted dream thief, sentenced to this isolation after stealing too many sleeping minds, but she'd never learned to count her crimes properly – numbers always danced away from her like smoke. <words>67</words>

The photographs inside weren't photographs at all, but fragments of herself scattered across yellowing pages. <words>82</words> Here, a seven-year-old Ezra holding a tennis racket. <words>91</words> There, the same child multiplied into three, each wearing different expressions – joy, terror, indifference. <words>106</words> The fragmented self, her lawyer had called it during the trial, as if naming her condition might excuse her compulsion to plunder other people's dreams. <words>131</words>

She traced a photo where she stood on a tennis court made of clouds. <words>145</words> Tennis had been their shared obsession, hers and her victims'. <words>155</words> She'd slip into their dreams through that common love, stealing pieces of their subconscious while they served phantom balls across nets of starlight. <words>179</words> But she could never keep score – was it fifteen-love or forty-thirty? <words>191</words> The numbers meant nothing to her mathematically challenged mind. <words>200</words>

Outside, the sky hung empty and silent. <words>207</words> The last human had been born seventeen years ago (or was it seventy? <words>220</words> She couldn't tell), and since then, the world had forgotten how to storm. <words>234</words> Ezra's punishment included this impossible task: to coax thunder from those barren heavens, to make the sky remember its voice. <words>255</words>

She turned another page and found herself at twenty-three, then twelve, then forty-five, all existing simultaneously in fading ink. <words>275</words> Her quiet mania whispered that if she could just arrange these fragments correctly, solve this puzzle of selves, the sky might crack open with sound. <words>301</words>

The treehouse groaned as she stood, clutching the album. <words>310</words> Through the dusty window, she watched the last human – now grown – walking below, dreamless and alone. <words>328</words> She'd stolen from him too, back when dreams still mattered. <words>338</words> Back when there were enough humans to fill the earth with sleeping minds. <words>351</words>

Ezra made her decision with the certainty of the mad. <words>361</words> She would plunge from this height, scattering her fragmented selves like seeds. <words>373</words> Perhaps in falling, in breaking apart completely, she might finally become whole enough to summon thunder. <words>389</words> Perhaps the sky needed her shattered pieces more than she did. <words>400</words>

She opened the window, photo album pressed against her chest, and listened to the silence that demanded to be broken. <words>420</words> The wind whispered through empty leaves, carrying the echo of tennis balls that would never again cross nets, of dreams that would never again be stolen. <words>446</words> With a quiet laugh that bordered on prayer, Ezra stepped forward into the soundless air. <words>462</words>
