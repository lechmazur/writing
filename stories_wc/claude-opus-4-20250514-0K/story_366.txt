The transmission repair dock hummed with October frost, machines grinding against the season's first ice. <words>15</words> Vera, the telepathic barista, pressed her grandmother's vintage button hook against her temple, listening. <words>29</words> She'd been efficiently inefficient all morning—serving coffee while secretly reading mechanics' minds, searching for weather patterns hidden in their grease-stained thoughts. <words>51</words>

"Another latte?" she asked Marcus, already knowing he'd refuse. <words>60</words> His mind churned with transmission fluid temperatures, gear ratios, and something else—memories of his father's weather journals, locked away after the old man's death. <words>84</words>

Success, Vera had learned, wasn't about serving perfect espresso anymore. <words>94</words> It was about understanding why machines failed when seasons changed, why her grandmother's button hook grew warm during atmospheric shifts, why telepathy strengthened at the cusp of autumn bleeding into winter. <words>125</words>

She cloaked her true purpose behind steam and small talk, but Marcus's thoughts betrayed him. <words>140</words> The journals contained ice crystal patterns from ancient glaciers, each formation a key to predicting catastrophic weather. <words>157</words> His father had discovered how to read them like sheet music, translating frozen fractals into forecasts. <words>173</words>

"Your dad was brilliant," Vera said, abandoning pretense. <words>181</words> Marcus dropped his wrench. <words>185</words>

"How did you—" <words>188</words>

"The same way I know you're hiding the journals in locker seventeen." <words>200</words> She tapped the button hook against her cup, its antique silver conducting thoughts like lightning rods conduct storms. <words>218</words> "I need them to save this dock, this town." <words>227</words>

He laughed—noble foolishness personified. <words>231</words> "You're a barista who thinks she can decode my father's life work?" <words>243</words>

"I'm a woman who hears transmissions fail before they do, who feels weather in her bones through this." <words>261</words> She held up the button hook. <words>267</words> "Your father understood objects could be conduits. <words>274</words> Mine did too." <words>277</words>

The dock's corrugated walls shuddered as unseasonable wind struck. <words>286</words> Coffee cups rattled on shelves. <words>291</words> In Marcus's mind, Vera saw it clearly: his father teaching him to read ice like braille, patterns spiraling through time, predicting floods that would drown their waterfront industry. <words>320</words>

"Three days," she said. <words>324</words> "That's what the glacier patterns in your thoughts are screaming. <words>334</words> We have three days before the storm surge." <words>342</words>

Marcus retrieved the journals, leather-bound and coffee-stained. <words>349</words> Together, they spread them across the counter between socket wrenches and espresso grounds, redefining success one crystalline prophecy at a time. <words>370</words> The button hook hummed between them, conducting their combined knowledge into something neither could achieve alone—salvation disguised as foolishness, efficiency found in the most inefficient partnership. <words>397</words>

Outside, seasons collided in the darkening sky. <words>404</words>
