Kira's fingers drummed against the dusty console of the abandoned space station's control room, her mediocre spells barely keeping the emergency lights flickering. <words>20</words> She'd always been exceptionally usual—neither terrible nor gifted, just another forgettable mage in a family of legendary spellcasters. <words>37</words> The station hovered at the boundary of her grandmother's farmland, soon to be sold to pay off debts Kira had accumulated through failed magical ventures. <words>62</words>

A pneumatic hiss broke the silence as a delivery drone deposited packages meant for the active station three sectors away. <words>82</words> Kira sighed with bored excitement—the same feeling she got opening textbooks she'd never finish. <words>96</words> Among the misdelivered cargo, a small box caught her eye, addressed to "The Last Thornweaver." <words>111</words> Her grandmother's title. <words>114</words>

Inside, a doll head stared up at her, its glass eyes blinking mechanically. <words>127</words> Recognition struck like lightning—this was the Witness, the ceremonial focus her family used to unveil their true magical potential. <words>147</words> Kira had seen it in portraits but assumed it was destroyed when her parents died, taking the family's secrets with them. <words>168</words>

The doll's eyes blinked faster, projecting holographic runes that danced across the control room's cracked screens. <words>184</words> "Blood recognizes blood," it whispered in her grandmother's voice. <words>193</words> "You've been casting with training wheels, child." <words>200</words>

Kira laughed bitterly. <words>202</words> She'd spent years believing she was a disappointment, but the truth was worse—her family had deliberately limited her magic, fearing she'd attract the same enemies who'd killed her parents. <words>232</words> The safety spells woven into her very bones had made her exceptionally usual, invisible to those who hunted Thornweavers. <words>251</words>

Now, holding her heritage in her hands, she faced a choice. <words>262</words> The station's location was perfect—abandoned, off-grid, at the edge of everything she was about to lose. <words>278</words> She could unveil her true power here, spring the trap on her own limitations. <words>292</words> But doing so would paint a target on her back the size of a small moon. <words>308</words>

The doll's eyes blinked once more, showing her the spells she'd need. <words>320</words> Complex. <words>321</words> Dangerous. <words>322</words> Hers by birthright. <words>325</words>

Kira's bored excitement crystallized into something sharper. <words>332</words> She'd been playing it safe in a hand-me-down life, but her bloodline didn't do safe. <words>348</words> They did legendary. <words>351</words>

She began weaving the unveiling ritual, her exceptionally usual facade cracking like old paint. <words>365</words> The farmland below would be sold, but she'd already outgrown it. <words>376</words> The misdelivered package hadn't been a mistake—it was her grandmother's final lesson. <words>388</words> Sometimes you had to lose everything mundane to reclaim who you really were. <words>401</words>

The station hummed with newfound power as Kira Thornweaver finally stopped underachieving. <words>413</words>
