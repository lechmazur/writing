Marlene's painted smile cracked beneath stage lights, another evening of juggling fire for tourists who'd forgotten her name before their applause died. <words>18</words> She drove through midnight rain to Prismatic Lake, where construction crews had abandoned their half-built amphitheater, leaving scaffolding like metal bones against the shore. <words>44</words>

The lake's surface caught moonlight in impossible colors—violet bleeding into copper, emerald shifting to pearl. <words>60</words> Marlene clutched the simple drawer knob in her pocket, its brass weight anchoring her to why she'd come. <words>78</words> Twenty years ago, she'd stolen it from her mentor's dressing room the night he died, the night she'd lied about being with him. <words>102</words>

Construction equipment loomed like sleeping giants, their silence somehow louder than any crowd she'd ever faced. <words>118</words> She needed to organize her thoughts, to choose between the truth that would destroy his legacy and the lie that was destroying her. <words>141</words>

From across the water came an unexpected sound—the rhythmic squeak of a seesaw from the old playground, though no child had played there since the renovation began. <words>169</words> The echo bounced off concrete foundations, multiplying into a chorus that seemed to whisper: *tell, don't tell, tell, don't tell.* <words>189</words>

Marlene's costume, modestly extravagant with its secondhand sequins and carefully mended silk, caught on exposed rebar as she climbed toward the water. <words>211</words> She'd worn it like armor for two decades, hiding behind theatrical flourishes while her joy bled away performance by performance. <words>231</words>

The seesaw's squeaking grew louder, its mechanical rhythm matching her heartbeat. <words>242</words> She understood now—the sound wasn't from the playground but from inside her, the eternal back-and-forth of a conscience at war with itself. <words>265</words>

At the lake's edge, she opened her fist. <words>273</words> The drawer knob had worn grooves in her palm from years of secret holding. <words>287</words> Her mentor had been brilliant, revolutionary, and he'd also been guilty of things that would shatter hearts if known. <words>306</words> She'd protected his memory with cautious abandon, walking the tightrope between revelation and concealment. <words>320</words>

The prismatic water accepted her offering without judgment, swallowing the brass knob in ripples of color. <words>336</words> With it went her promise to keep silent, and her promise to speak—both truths could exist here, in this place between construction and completion. <words>361</words>

The seesaw's echo faded to whispers, then to nothing. <words>370</words> Marlene stood empty-handed for the first time in twenty years, her guilt neither absolved nor condemned, but finally, mercifully, hushed. <words>391</words> Tomorrow she would perform again, still joyless perhaps, but no longer torn between truths that were never hers to carry. <words>411</words>
