Mage Elara pressed her lukewarm palm against the observation dome, watching Earth rotate in the void. <words>13</words> The lunar base's recycled air tasted of metal and regret, carrying whispers of conversations that never quite ended. <words>30</words> She clutched the torn doormat corner—the only fragment that survived the decompression accident in Module Seven—its frayed edges mapping constellations of loss. <words>53</words>

In the hush before someone opens a private journal, secrets crystallize. <words>64</words> Elara's magic had always run cooler than others', neither burning bright nor freezing solid, but maintaining that loyally peculiar temperature that kept memories from fully evaporating. <words>90</words> She needed those memories now. <words>95</words>

The recreational theater had been repurposed as her sanctuary, stage fog machines humming their mechanical prayers. <words>111</words> As vapor spiraled upward, ephemeral silhouettes began to form—not quite ghosts, but echoes given substance through her tepid sorcery. <words>130</words> There: Marcus adjusting his helmet seal. <words>136</words> There: Chen laughing at breakfast. <words>141</words> There: the crew's last poker game, cards floating in artificial gravity. <words>152</words>

"You're clinging to echoes," Dr. Voss had warned during mandatory counseling. <words>163</words> But what else remained when vacuum had stolen everything tangible? <words>173</words>

The silhouettes began to clash, overlapping memories creating temporal friction. <words>183</words> Past and present collided as Elara's lukewarm magic struggled to separate what was from what had been. <words>200</words> The doormat corner grew warm in her grip—it remembered feet, remembered welcome, remembered when Module Seven had been home instead of tomb. <words>223</words>

Through the chaos of swirling forms, she saw it: a future painted in fog and starlight. <words>239</words> Not the future she'd lost, but one where fear didn't dictate every heartbeat, where airlocks didn't represent death sentences, where magic could be gentle instead of desperate. <words>267</words>

The theater's atmosphere achieved charred serenity—not peace exactly, but the quiet that follows necessary destruction. <words>282</words> Elara's peculiar loyalty to the dead had kept her tethered to tragedy, but now she understood. <words>298</words> The echoes weren't asking her to join them; they were showing her how to live. <words>313</words>

She released the doormat fragment into the fog, watching it dissolve into memory-mist. <words>326</words> The silhouettes bowed, then dissipated, leaving only potential in their wake. <words>337</words> Tomorrow, she would request transfer to the terraforming division. <words>346</words> Tomorrow, she would paint atmospheres on dead worlds. <words>354</words> Tomorrow, she would stop being lukewarm and become exactly the temperature hope required. <words>367</words>

But tonight, in this theater where echoes danced their final dance, Elara allowed herself to grieve with the strange, steady warmth that had always been uniquely hers. <words>395</words> The moon's silence embraced her, and for the first time since the accident, it felt like forgiveness. <words>412</words>
