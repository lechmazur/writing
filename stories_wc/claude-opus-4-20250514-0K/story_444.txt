Ambassador Vera pressed her palm against the zeppelin's algae-slick window, watching sunlight fracture through twenty meters of Baltic water. <words>18</words> The threadbare ghost costume hung from a brass hook nearby—white muslin yellowed with age, tiny handprints still visible where a child had clutched it during some forgotten performance. <words>47</words>

"Broadcasting begins in three minutes," her assistant announced, voice echoing through the flooded gondola. <words>61</words>

Vera smiled, methodically playful as she arranged the letters on her desk: hundreds of envelopes containing fragments of the same dream, ready for distribution across decades. <words>87</words> Each would arrive precisely when needed, indoctrinating recipients into a gentle awakening from their comfortable delusions. <words>103</words>

The radio crackled to life. <words>108</words> Between bursts of static, she could hear them—millions of dreamers sharing the same nocturnal vision she'd been cultivating for years. <words>128</words> A dream of drowning that wasn't drowning, of breathing water like air, of understanding that the surface world they remembered was the real illusion. <words>153</words>

"My dear listeners," Vera began, her fierce conviction wrapped in silk tones, "tonight we continue our work." <words>170</words> She fingered the ghost costume, remembering when she'd worn it as a girl, playing at being dead while already living beneath the waves. <words>194</words> "Open the letters when they arrive—some yesterday, some tomorrow, some in decades hence." <words>208</words>

The zeppelin groaned, its metal skeleton shifting with underwater currents. <words>218</words> Through the static came responses: whispers from 1952, shouts from 2089, calm acknowledgments from every year between. <words>235</words> Time meant nothing in shared dreams; the chain of letters connected moments like pearls on an infinite string. <words>253</words>

"We must hush the illusions," Vera continued, her calm frenzy building. <words>264</words> "The dry world above, the belief in linear time, the comfort of thinking ourselves alone in our minds—all fantasies we've outgrown." <words>286</words>

Her assistant held up a letter, newly arrived though posted fifty years hence. <words>299</words> Vera recognized her own handwriting, her future self reporting success: humanity had finally awakened, breathed deep, and chosen the honest darkness of the depths over the false light above. <words>329</words>

The broadcast window narrowed. <words>333</words> Static consumed the frequencies, but Vera felt the dreams spreading like ripples from a stone. <words>348</words> Each letter would find its reader, each reader would dream, each dreamer would write another letter, the cycle expanding until no one could remember why they'd ever believed in the surface. <words>380</words>

She touched the ghost costume one last time—that relic from when children still pretended death instead of swimming through it daily. <words>402</words> The radio fell silent, but Vera's work continued in the vast shared unconscious, methodically playful, fiercely gentle, teaching humanity to breathe. <words>424</words>
