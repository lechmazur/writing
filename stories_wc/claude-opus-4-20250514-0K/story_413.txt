Lord Eryndor wandered the proto-realm, where consciousness had yet to bloom in any creature, his faded scarf trailing behind him like a ghost of forgotten purpose. <words>24</words> The haunted plain stretched endlessly, its primordial corn maze twisting through dimensions that defied the logic of future civilizations. <words>43</words> How naively sophisticated he'd been, believing his noble blood meant something in this pre-sentient wasteland where even thought itself was merely potential. <words>66</words>

The scarf, once vibrant with his family's crest, now bore the weight of countless eons spent drifting through this twilight of awareness. <words>89</words> He'd forgotten why he'd come here, to this time before time, until the invitation materialized—not on paper, for paper didn't exist, but as a whisper in the void. <words>118</words>

"Rendezvous at the maze's heart," it beckoned, and Eryndor felt something stir within his listless soul. <words>134</words> He'd thought himself beyond surprise, yet here was spontaneity incarnate, calling him deeper into the labyrinth. <words>151</words>

The corn stalks, neither alive nor dead in this pre-life epoch, rustled with impossible wind as he navigated paths that rearranged themselves with each step. <words>176</words> At the center, he found her—another wanderer, equally displaced, her laughter echoing through dimensions. <words>191</words>

"You came," she said, and her mirth was infectious, spreading like the first spark of consciousness that would someday ignite the universe. <words>214</words> They laughed together, not at anything particular, but at the magnificent absurdity of their situation—two beings with awareness, adrift in a cosmos that hadn't yet learned to think. <words>243</words>

"I've been searching," Eryndor confessed between gasps of hilarity, "for the power of intention." <words>257</words> She nodded, understanding flooding her features. <words>263</words> "And I've been waiting to show someone that it already exists—in this." <words>276</words> She gestured at their shared moment, their conscious choice to meet, to laugh, to be. <words>291</words>

The irony wasn't lost on him. <words>297</words> He'd traveled to the beginning of everything to find meaning, only to discover it in the simplest act of connection. <words>317</words> His faded scarf suddenly seemed less like a burden and more like a banner of his journey. <words>334</words>

As their laughter subsided, Eryndor realized the profound truth: intention wasn't something to be discovered but created, moment by moment, choice by choice. <words>357</words> The maze around them shimmered, as if acknowledging this revelation. <words>367</words>

"What now?" he asked, no longer listless but alive with possibility. <words>378</words>

"Now," she smiled, taking his hand, "we walk these endless paths together, and in doing so, perhaps we'll teach the universe its first lesson about purpose." <words>405</words>

And so they did, two naively sophisticated souls, their shared laughter echoing through the haunted plain, planting seeds of consciousness that would bloom eons hence. <words>431</words> The power of intention, Eryndor learned, was simply choosing to be present with another soul, even in the vast emptiness before creation learned to dream. <words>457</words>
