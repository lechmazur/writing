Marcus wheeled his guitar case through the automated postal sorting facility, following forgotten patterns in the dust that only night janitors knew. <words>18</words> Twenty years ago, he'd worked here, before music consumed him with dreams that later curdled into the backlash of regrets. <words>36</words> The facility hummed with mechanical precision, packages dancing on conveyor belts like notes he could no longer quite catch. <words>55</words>

He'd come for the suitcase—his mother's, mislabeled and lost in the system for months. <words>69</words> Inside lay her vintage fountain pen, the one she'd used to write him encouraging letters during his starving artist phase. <words>89</words> "Find the humor in it all," she'd written, even as cancer rewound her life to nothing. <words>106</words>

The sorting machines clicked and whirred, complexly deceptive in their order—just like his memories of success. <words>122</words> He'd told everyone he was touring Europe, posted old photos online, crafted elaborate lies about packed venues. <words>139</words> In truth, he'd been sleeping in his van, playing for spare change, too proud to admit failure. <words>157</words>

Security cameras tracked his movement, but the night guard—an old colleague—had looked away, understanding. <words>171</words> Marcus navigated by muscle memory through aisles of mechanical sorters, their rhythms matching his guilty heartbeat. <words>187</words> Each step forward felt like rewinding through years of deception, peeling back layers of pretense. <words>202</words>

There—in Aisle J, Section 9, where damaged goods waited at the close of a suitcase that may never reopen. <words>221</words> His mother's battered case sat among other orphaned belongings, tagged "unclaimed." <words>232</words> He laughed—a sound caught between joy and despair—at the cosmic absurdity of it all. <words>247</words> Here he was, a failed musician burglarizing his dead mother's effects from a postal purgatory. <words>263</words>

The lock yielded easily; inside, her fountain pen gleamed like a brass accusation. <words>276</words> Beneath it, hundreds of returned letters—his letters, all marked "addressee unknown." <words>286</words> She'd moved without telling him, too kind to burden her lying son with her illness. <words>302</words> He'd been writing to an empty house while she died alone, both of them maintaining their complexly deceptive dances. <words>321</words>

Marcus unscrewed the pen and found ink still wet inside, impossible but true. <words>334</words> He wrote on his palm: "The joke's on us, Mom." <words>344</words> The ink spread like veins, like music, like all the words they'd never said. <words>358</words> Tomorrow, he'd return to his street corner, guitar in hand, finally honest in his failures. <words>373</words> Tonight, he sat among the sorting machines, laughing and crying at the beautiful stupidity of trying to organize human pain into neat little boxes. <words>397</words> The facility hummed on, indifferent and eternal, processing other people's connections and disconnections with mechanical grace. <words>413</words> Marcus pocketed the pen and left the suitcase open—a small rebellion against the ordered universe that had played such elegant tricks on them both. <words>437</words> Outside, dawn cracked the sky like an egg, spilling yolk-yellow light over his joyful despair. <words>453</words> He walked toward his street corner, composing a new song about fountain pens and cosmic punchlines. <words>469</words>
