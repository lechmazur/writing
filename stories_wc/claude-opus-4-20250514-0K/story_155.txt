Marcus descended through the flooded planetarium's dome, his welding torch illuminating constellations of rust where stars once projected. <words>16</words> The nightclub's bass thrummed through water, vibrating his diving suit as he worked to seal cracks in the dance floor's glass ceiling. <words>37</words> Above, bodies swayed in darkness, unaware their sanctuary floated precariously over an aquatic grave. <words>52</words>

He'd inherited this job from his grandmother—not the welding, but the watching. <words>65</words> She'd pressed the vintage button box into his hands on her deathbed, whispering about mirrors that showed more than reflections. <words>85</words> "You'll know when timelines cross," she'd said, her fingers tracing patterns on the brass clasps. <words>101</words>

Marcus was patiently impatient by nature, a quality that served underwater welders well. <words>114</words> Hours of meticulous work punctuated by moments requiring split-second decisions. <words>124</words> Tonight, the button box hummed against his chest beneath the neoprene. <words>135</words>

Through the murky water, he glimpsed it—a vintage store mirror, inexplicably pristine, propped against the planetarium's submerged gift shop entrance. <words>155</words> In its surface, he saw himself not welding but dancing above, in the club that shouldn't exist yet. <words>173</words> The reflection wore his face but moved to rhythms from another decade. <words>185</words>

The unraveling began slowly. <words>189</words> Bubbles from his regulator spiraled upward, carrying fragments of conversations from futures and pasts. <words>203</words> The mirror showed him installing the very glass he now repaired, showed the planetarium's decay and resurrection happening simultaneously. <words>222</words>

He understood then why his grandmother had pampered these mirrors, polishing them obsessively in her vintage shop. <words>239</words> They were windows to the crossing point, where parallel timelines briefly kissed before diverging. <words>253</words> The button box contained more than buttons—each was a frozen moment, a choice that could splice realities. <words>270</words>

Marcus selected a mother-of-pearl button, its surface swirling like oil on water. <words>282</words> As he pressed it, the mirror's vision sharpened. <words>290</words> He saw the planetarium's two fates: forever flooded tomb or reborn dance cathedral. <words>303</words> The power to choose coursed through him, improbable yet undeniable. <words>313</words>

His welding torch flickered as timelines converged. <words>320</words> In one, he completed the seal, preserving the club above. <words>330</words> In another, he let the water claim everything, returning the space to its drowned peace. <words>345</words> The button box grew warm, each button now glowing with potential futures. <words>357</words>

Marcus made his choice with the careful precision of someone who'd spent years joining metal beneath crushing depths. <words>375</words> He welded not just the crack but the timeline itself, fusing the reality where music triumphed over mourning. <words>393</words> The mirror cracked, its purpose fulfilled, and the inherited mystery passed to the next guardian of improbable intersections. <words>411</words>

Above, dancers moved unknowingly through a moment that had nearly unraveled, saved by an underwater welder who'd learned patience from the deep. <words>434</words>
