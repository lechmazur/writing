The gentle conjurer Mira descended into the underground city of the dwarves, her fingers trembling with joyful terror as she clutched the stained glass butterfly. <words>22</words> Its crystalline wings held the key to justice—fragments of testimony shattered across its surface in reversed messages only she could read. <words>42</words>

The dwarven council had dismissed her plea to rebuild the forgotten garden above, the one poisoned by their mining runoff decades ago. <words>64</words> "Evidence," they'd demanded with inscrutably obvious contempt, knowing full well they'd destroyed all records. <words>78</words> But Mira had found their mistake: this butterfly, a child's toy discarded in the archives, its glass panes accidentally recording conversations in backwards script when held to candlelight. <words>106</words>

She worked in the deepest chambers, away from suspicious eyes, carefully reassembling the butterfly's broken segments. <words>122</words> Each piece revealed another reversed confession: "...nedrág eht dellik ew" became "we killed the garden." <words>138</words> The dwarven elders' own voices, trapped in glass like prehistoric insects in amber. <words>151</words>

Her heart raced with terrible elation as the final piece clicked into place. <words>164</words> Justice would bloom from these reconstructed secrets, but first she needed witnesses. <words>176</words> She whispered an incantation, and phantom flowers began sprouting from the stone floor—ghostly echoes of what once grew above. <words>195</words>

The illusion drew curious dwarves like moths to flame. <words>204</words> Children gasped at the spectral roses while adults remembered what they'd lost. <words>216</words> When the crowd swelled sufficiently, Mira raised the butterfly to the torchlight. <words>228</words>

The reversed messages played across the cavern walls, each confession clearer than the last. <words>242</words> The elders' faces drained of color as their own younger voices condemned them. <words>255</words> "We knew the runoff would poison everything." <words>262</words> "Better dead gardens than poor dwarves." <words>268</words> "Burn the evidence before the surface-dwellers arrive." <words>275</words>

Mira's voice rang out, fierce with frightening joy: "The butterfly remembers what you forced us to forget!" <words>292</words> The crowd's murmur became a roar. <words>298</words>

As the first elder stepped forward to confess, Mira heard it—somewhere far above, at the forest's edge where the poisoned garden met living trees, the break of a brittle branch in a silent forest. <words>332</words> The sound echoed down through stone and soil, a sharp crack like the universe acknowledging that justice had finally arrived. <words>352</words>

The gentle conjurer smiled, tears streaming down her face. <words>361</words> Tomorrow, she would lead the dwarves upward to begin the healing. <words>372</words> They would plant new seeds in purified soil, guided by the testimonies preserved in a simple toy. <words>389</words> The butterfly's wings caught the light one final time, throwing rainbow patterns across the chamber—a promise of gardens yet to come. <words>411</words>
