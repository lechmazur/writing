Marcus crouched beneath the moldering canvas of the abandoned carnival prize booth, his fingers hovering over a yellowed chopstick wrapper. <words>18</words> The bookbinder's telekinetic gift trembled through his hands—not from effort, but from recognition. <words>30</words> 

"Winner every time!" <words>33</words>

The tinny recording echoed from a broken speaker, and suddenly Marcus wasn't there anymore. <words>47</words> He was binding the Chronicle of Forgotten Carnivals in 1892, watching a young woman named Elisabet transform playing cards into butterflies with her mind. <words>71</words> The vision shattered as quickly as it came, leaving him gasping. <words>82</words>

He'd spent decades preserving stories of the gifted, never understanding why each tome demanded pieces of his own memory as payment. <words>103</words> The wrapper lifted without his touch, unfolding to reveal a single character: 変. <words>116</words> Transform. <words>117</words>

Another sound bite crackled: "Step right up!" <words>124</words>

This time, Marcus witnessed himself in 1923, binding testimonies of a telepathic fortune teller who'd worked this very booth. <words>143</words> She'd pressed this wrapper into his young hands, whispering about the price of preserving power. <words>158</words> He'd forgotten—no, sacrificed—that memory to complete her chronicle. <words>167</words>

The realization struck with casual cruelty: every supernatural tale he'd bound had cost him pieces of his own story. <words>186</words> His telekinesis wasn't just a gift for moving objects; it was meant to move memories themselves, to weave them into something greater. <words>209</words>

"Last chance for prizes!" the speaker wheezed. <words>216</words>

The final flashback showed him the truth. <words>223</words> Throughout the tapestry of lost legends, bookbinders like him had been guardians, not mere craftsmen. <words>238</words> They sacrificed personal histories to preserve collective power, ensuring each generation could rediscover transformation. <words>252</words> The wrapper in his hand wasn't trash—it was a bookmark, marking where one story ended and another began. <words>270</words>

Marcus understood now why he'd been drawn here, to this decaying shrine of wonder. <words>284</words> His scattered memories weren't lost; they lived in every book he'd bound, waiting to revive in those who truly sought transformation. <words>306</words> With telekinetic precision, he began gathering the booth's detritus—ticket stubs, prize tags, fragments of joy—each one a story demanding preservation. <words>327</words>

He would bind one final chronicle: his own. <words>335</words> Not with thread and leather, but with the very air around him, leaving it here where future seekers might stumble upon it. <words>357</words> The wrapper fluttered back to the ground, no longer needed. <words>367</words> Marcus had discovered that transformation's true power lay not in keeping knowledge, but in knowing when to let it go. <words>387</words>

As he walked away, the booth's speakers sparked once more: "Thank you for playing." <words>401</words> Behind him, dust motes danced like butterflies in the afternoon light, carrying stories on their wings. <words>417</words>
