Brother Marcus pressed the tarnished silver fork against his palm, its weight somehow heavier than mere metal. <words>16</words> The glass desert stretched endlessly before him, each crystalline dune catching the amber light of the dying sun where the last monarch butterfly danced, alone. <words>40</words> He had come to this forsaken place as a missionary, but three years of unanswered prayers had left him unconvinced of everything he'd once preached. <words>65</words>

The fork had belonged to Sister Catherine before the fever took her, before he'd buried her beneath the glass shards that passed for sand here. <words>90</words> She'd whispered about the old ways, about becoming a conduit for magic that predated their imported faith. <words>107</words> He'd dismissed it then, but now, watching that solitary butterfly—the very last of its kind—spiral through its final migration, he wondered. <words>129</words>

The abandoned church's piano sat untuned behind him, its strings humming with desert wind. <words>143</words> Marcus had discovered something capriciously consistent about those echoes: they formed patterns when the butterfly passed overhead, musical equations that decoded into something else entirely. <words>169</words> Each discordant note revealed coordinates, instructions, warnings—a map written in sound that only the faithless could hear. <words>186</words>

He needed to conceal what he'd learned from the Order's inspectors arriving tomorrow. <words>199</words> They would call it heresy, this marriage of abandoned faith and discovered magic. <words>212</words> But Marcus had felt it building in his chest, a new kind of belief born from doubt itself. <words>230</words> The fork trembled in his hand, its tarnish forming patterns that matched the piano's echoes, that matched the butterfly's dying dance. <words>252</words>

In this alone intimacy with the glass desert, Marcus finally understood. <words>263</words> Faith wasn't about certainty—it was about standing at the edge of two worlds and choosing to leap. <words>280</words> The butterfly's wings caught the last light, orange and black against the glittering wasteland. <words>294</words> Tomorrow it would die, the last of its species, but tonight it carried ancient secrets on delicate wings. <words>312</words>

Marcus returned to the piano, pressing random keys, listening to how the echoes bounced off glass dunes and returned transformed. <words>332</words> Each reflection revealed another piece of the pattern Sister Catherine had seen. <words>344</words> The fork grew warm in his pocket, conducting something through him that wasn't quite prayer but wasn't quite not. <words>363</words> He was becoming what she'd promised—neither missionary nor magician, but something suspended between, capriciously consistent in his inconsistency. <words>381</words>

As the butterfly circled lower, Marcus decoded the final sequence. <words>391</words> The magic wouldn't save the butterfly or bring back Sister Catherine, but it would transform his hollow faith into something honest: doubt wielded with purpose. <words>416</words> He smiled, alone but not lonely, unconvinced but finally, truly faithful. <words>427</words> The fork's tarnish began to glow. <words>433</words>
