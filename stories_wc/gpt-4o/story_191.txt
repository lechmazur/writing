Elias sat at a weathered table, an antique ink well before him, its surface etched with cryptic symbols. <words>94</words> The ink well was said to hold the power to transcribe the whispers of the island, hushed pleas that only the worthy could hear. <words>115</words> As he waited for the coffee in his abandoned mug to cool, Elias felt a grudging admiration for the island's mysteries. <words>135</words>
