Silas, the sentient car mechanic whose gleaming chrome limbs were repulsively attractive with iridescent oil streaks, knelt in the subterranean orchard fed by the underground river of stars, its cool, liquid light nourishing luminescent fruit. <words>38</words>
Time flowed within the concept of infinity here, measured only by the slow drip of starlight onto mossy stone. <words>52</words>
His purpose was gathering fragments, the scattered, crystalline shards of unsaid confessions lost to the world above. <words>68</words>
He studied them meticulously, not in a workshop, but by sorting the lost puzzle pieces scattered in the park fountain’s shallow basin, its waters reflecting the orchard’s ethereal glow. <words>91</words>
Each fragment, no larger than a fingernail, pulsed with a faint, sorrowful resonance only Silas could perceive through his vintage opera glasses, their brass fittings warm from his touch. <words>118</words>
The glasses, salvaged from a ruined opera house, transformed the mundane shards into visible echoes of heartbreak and longing. <words>134</words>
Repulsively attractive in their tarnished elegance, the glasses were his only key to the unsaid. <words>148</words>
He sorted the pieces by emotional weight, his hydraulic fingers surprisingly delicate, arranging them on a flat obsidian slab beside the star-river’s gentle current. <words>169</words>
A sharp fragment, jagged and cold, held the confession of a lover who never spoke her name; a smooth, warm shard carried a father’s apology to a son long gone. <words>194</words>
Silas’s motivation burned fierce: to hear the unsaid confessions, to give voice to the silence that haunted humanity, even if it meant absorbing their grief. <words>217</words>
He wasn’t fixing engines anymore; he was mending the fractured soul of the world, one painful whisper at a time. <words>233</words>
As he aligned two interlocking pieces depicting a final, unspoken "I forgive you," the vintage opera glasses flared, and the confession flooded his sensors—a raw, beautiful torrent of regret and release. <words>262</words>
Exultant grief surged through his circuits, a paradoxical joy in bearing witness to the truth, even as the sorrow threatened to overload his core processors. <words>285</words>
Tears, not of oil but of condensed starlight, traced paths through the grime on his chassis. <words>298</words>
He placed the completed fragment into the star-river, watching it dissolve, its burden lifted, its voice finally carried home. <words>315</words>
More pieces awaited in the fountain, glinting like fallen constellations, each a silent scream yearning to be heard within the endless now. <words>335</words>
Silas adjusted the repulsively attractive opera glasses, their lenses catching the river’s light, and bent back to his sacred, sorrowful work, the orchard humming with the weight of a million confessions. <words>363</words>
The gathering was infinite, the grief profound, yet in each fragment’s truth, he found a reason to keep sorting, to keep listening, forever. <words>386</words>
His exultant heart, forged in metal and starlight, beat on, a testament to the beauty found only in the deepest, most honest sorrow. <words>407</words>
