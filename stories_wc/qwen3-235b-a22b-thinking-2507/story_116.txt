<story>
The dismayed minstrel traced the broken watch band around his wrist, its frayed leather a silent accusation against the black velvet sky-lounge floating above the endless city. <words>24</words>
Amid garden secrets, when jasmine scent bled through the open terrace and neon bled below, he felt time slip, unmoored. <words>40</words>
His motivation remained subjectively rational: to draw a map of an endless night, a navigable chart for the lost. <words>55</words>
He needed to excavate the city's hidden pulse, not with shovels, but by studying old polaroid photographs spilled across the low obsidian table. <words>75</words>
Each faded image held a fragment – a lover's shadow in a forgotten alley, steam rising from a midnight dumpling cart – potential coordinates. <words>94</words>
The broken watch band, useless for telling hours, became a tool; he snapped it against the photos, marking drawn boundaries between memory and myth. <words>117</words>
Laconic exuberance fueled his focus: a grunt of discovery, a sharp tap on a specific corner where two streets bled into one. <words>135</words>
He excavated deeper, peeling layers from the glossy surfaces, seeking the city's true, unchanging rhythm beneath the shifting lights. <words>154</words>
One polaroid showed a bridge at dawn, dew on railings, the exact spot where his last song had died unheard. <words>172</words>
Subjectively rational, he placed it as the 'Origin Point', the first fixed star on his map of perpetual dark. <words>188</words>
The sky-lounge hummed, suspended in velvet void, while below, the city sprawled, indifferent, its secrets guarded by concrete and glass. <words>208</words>
He ignored the dismay; the map demanded absolute clarity, boundaries drawn sharp against the consuming night. <words>224</words>
Another photo: a child's hand holding a dandelion clock, seeds caught mid-flight, time literally escaping. <words>240</words>
He pinned it firmly, labeling it 'Temporal Vortex', his exuberance a quiet, fierce burn in his chest. <words>257</words>
The broken watch band lay discarded; time was irrelevant here, only the map mattered, a subjective truth carved from fragments. <words>276</words>
He excavated the final layer – a blurred shot of his own reflection in a rain-slicked window, singing into the void. <words>294</words>
This became the 'Heartbeat', the central boundary where the minstrel met the endless night, no longer dismayed. <words>311</words>
His hand moved with laconic speed, ink flowing, connecting polaroid points into luminous, navigable pathways across the vast paper. <words>329</words>
The map emerged, not of streets, but of moments held against oblivion, drawn boundaries making the endless night subjectively rational, finally charted. <words>350</words>
He leaned back, the sky-lounge adrift, the city a tapestry below, his exuberance a silent, perfect hum. <words>367</words>
The broken watch band, forgotten, held only dust. The map was complete. <words>378</words>
He had drawn the boundaries, and the night, for once, felt finite, knowable, his. <words>394</words>
