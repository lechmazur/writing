Elias, the repressed poet, walked the overgrown city street where ivy choked the pavement and trees split the asphalt, his mind thick with lingering doubts about his abandoned craft. <words>24</words> Secretly terrified of the vast, unspoken cosmic verse he felt compelled to pen directly onto mortal skin, he usually avoided such desolate places. <words>45</words> Yet today, driven by a spontaneous decision to explore a side road veiled by cascading wisteria, he turned away from the main thoroughfare. <words>67</words> The air hung heavy and silent, thick with the scent of damp earth and decay, until the moment a pin was heard in a silent corridor of his own making – a sudden, impossible stillness. <words>101</words> That fragile quiet shattered as an ambush of memory erupted: the sharp, ghostly aroma of lily-of-the-valley from the antique perfume bottle clutched in his trembling hand, unearthed moments before from a crumbling garden wall. <words>140</words> Its delicate crystal stopper, chipped and clouded, held the scent of his grandmother, the only one who’d ever believed his words could map the stars onto flesh. <words>167</words> He was secretly terrified this fragile vessel, this relic of forgotten elegance, would evaporate like his courage, leaving only the bitter residue of regret. <words>195</words> The lingering doubts surged – was his ambition to inscribe the universe’s rhythm on his own arm merely the delusion of a failed artist? <words>220</words> The overgrown street, nature reclaiming concrete, mirrored the wild, untamed verses he’d buried, now threatening to burst through his repression. <words>245</words> He stood frozen, the antique perfume bottle cold against his palm, the knowing naivety of his quest suddenly stark: he understood the cosmic verse was likely impossible, a fool’s errand. <words>280</words> Yet, the terror of never trying, of letting the silence win, was sharper than the fear of failure. <words>300</words> In that suspended moment, the pin-drop silence returned, amplifying the frantic beat of his heart against his ribs. <words>320</words> With a gasp that felt like his first true breath in years, he made a spontaneous decision far more terrifying than the ambush of memory: he uncorked the bottle. <words>350</words> Not to smell it, but to spill a single, precious drop onto the back of his hand, the cool liquid a fleeting anchor. <words>373</words> Then, fingers shaking, he pressed his ink-stained thumb against his wrist, the damp skin suddenly the only parchment worthy of the first, trembling line of the verse he would finally dare to write. <words>408</words> The city street, reclaimed and silent, witnessed the repressed poet begin, his knowing naivety a fragile, necessary shield against the void. <words>425</words>
