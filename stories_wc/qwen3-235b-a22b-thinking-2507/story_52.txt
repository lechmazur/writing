Lira adjusted the broken pencil sharpener in her pocket, its jagged metal edges a familiar comfort as she navigated the time-worn marketplace nestled within the colossal hourglass. <words>24</words>
Sand trickled ceaselessly from the upper bulb, coating the cobblestones where chalk lines marking vendor stalls had begun to fade away with the dying light. <words>45</words>
Her fingers, quick and hopeful despite the blithe discontent humming beneath her smile, itched to lift a wallet from the distracted crowd gathered around a street singer. <words>68</words>
The singer’s off-key rendition of "My Heart Will Go On" was tastefully offensive—a wink-and-nudge parody that made the onlookers chuckle, not cringe. <words>90</words>
Lira seized her moment, materializing beside a portly man engrossed in the performance, her voice suddenly joining the duet with surprising sweetness. <words>112</words>
Their spontaneous karaoke duet drew cheers, the man clapping along, utterly unaware as her deft hand slipped his coin purse free. <words>133</words>
But inside the purse, instead of coins, lay only a single, crumpled prescription slip for rare medicine—a secret that seared the soul, mirroring her own desperate mission. <words>158</words>
She’d stolen for weeks, driven by the depths of devotion to her younger sister, wasting away in their sand-choked attic, needing this exact drug. <words>182</words>
The broken pencil sharpener, a relic from her sister’s abandoned art dreams, felt suddenly hot against her thigh, a symbol of all they’d sacrificed. <words>206</words>
Overwhelmed, Lira’s voice cracked mid-chorus, the secret materializing in her throat like swallowed glass as she turned to the bewildered man. <words>229</words>
"I’m stealing to save her," she blurted, the words raw, her hopeful facade crumbling under the weight of her devotion. <words>250</words>
His eyes widened, then softened; he recognized the prescription—it was for his own daughter, lost to the same illness months prior. <words>273</words>
He pressed the slip back into her hand, adding a small vial of the precious medicine, his gesture quiet, profound. <words>294</words>
"Take it," he murmured, the marketplace’s fading chalk lines echoing the fragility of their shared grief and unexpected grace. <words>315</words>
Lira’s blithe discontent lifted, replaced by a fragile hope as she clutched the vial, the broken sharpener a reminder that devotion could mend even shattered things. <words>340</words>
She slipped the sharpener back into her pocket, its jagged edges no longer a burden but a compass pointing toward home. <words>360</words>
The hourglass sand whispered promises as she vanished into the crowd, the taste of shared sorrow now sweet on her tongue. <words>382</words>
Her hopeful heart beat stronger, carrying the secret not as a burn, but as a beacon through the time-worn dusk. <words>402</words>
