<story>
Kael scraped salt from the cracked earth of the ethereal plains, his calloused hands nurturing the last viable seedlings after the last resource war had scorched the world. <words>24</words>
He was an apocalyptic farmer, breeding new seeds with stubborn hope, his motivation a raw solace found only in coaxing life from poisoned soil, desperate to escape the life dictated by warlords who once ruled the dust. <words>48</words>
His only companions were a magician’s deck of trick cards, worn smooth by years of handling, their impossible illusions now a ritual against despair. <words>65</words>
He’d jabber to them constantly, a low, rhythmic muttering as he shuffled, the sound blending with the wind’s mournful song of boundaries that defined the fragile safe zones where his seeds might survive. <words>92</words>
This song, a vibration in the air and ground, marked where the toxic dust storms ended and life could tentatively begin, a typically atypical phenomenon born from the war’s shattered geology. <words>118</words>
One dawn, a bottle, barnacled and ancient, rolled across the plains—not on water, but carried by the vast, shifting dunes of powdered seabed that now formed the dust-sea. <words>145</words>
Kael pried it open, finding a message written in fading ink: coordinates and a plea for sanctuary, delivered through the messages in a bottle carried by the sea of dust. <words>170</words>
His heart hammered; others survived beyond the song’s reach. <words>177</words>
He spread the trick cards on his blanket, jabbering faster now, using their cryptic symbols to decipher the bottle’s coded directions, the magician’s deck his only map. <words>202</words>
Each card—a reversed knight, a weeping star—spoke of hidden paths through the lethal plains, their magic repurposed for survival. <words>222</words>
The song of boundaries intensified near the coordinates, a physical pressure warning of invisible death zones, but Kael pressed on, driven by the thought of shared solace. <words>248</words>
He found the sender, a woman half-buried in the dunes, her community wiped out, her hope resting on the bottle’s gamble. <words>270</words>
Together, they returned to Kael’s plot, where his atypical seedlings—crossbred with resilient desert weeds—grew in the song’s protective hum. <words>293</words>
She brought knowledge of deep aquifers; he offered seeds and the trick cards’ guidance, their combined skills a quiet rebellion against isolation. <words>314</words>
As dusk painted the ethereal plains in bruised purples, Kael didn’t jabber to the cards alone anymore. <words>330</words>
They sat side by side, listening to the song of boundaries, no longer a barrier but a shared rhythm, the raw solace of partnership replacing solitary struggle. <words>355</words>
The magician’s deck lay forgotten, its purpose fulfilled; the real magic was in hands working the earth together, beyond the life dictated by the war’s shadow. <words>381</words>
New seeds, born of dust and desperation, pushed through the soil under a sky slowly clearing, their green a promise written not in cards, but in shared breath. <words>407</words>
The song of boundaries still whispered, but now it carried the sound of two people choosing their own future, one fragile sprout at a time. <words>432</words>
