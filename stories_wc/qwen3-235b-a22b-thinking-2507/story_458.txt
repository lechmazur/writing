<story>
Elara, the spiritually secular pilot of the flying library Aethelred, landed her vessel in the abandoned spaceport baggage claim, its once-bustling concourse now echoing with dust and silence. <words>28</words>
She sought refuge, the last guardian of oral traditions fading like starlight in a polluted sky, her mission to preserve the bridge to unity through shared stories. <words>54</words>
A detached coat button, brass and cold, lay near a cracked carousel, the sole relic of Old Man Hemlock, the last true storyteller whose voice had carried the unity songs. <words>85</words>
Clutching it, Elara felt fractal sorrow ripple through her—a grief not singular, but endlessly branching, each fragment echoing the loss of a language, a song, a connection. <words>117</words>
Her motivation burned clear: save the tradition before the silence became absolute, even if the library itself perished. <words>135</words>
In the dim glow of a failing lumisphere, she poured bitter coffee, the grounds swirling into shapes only she could decipher, reading the future in the stains. <words>165</words>
The pattern screamed disaster: a data-worm, insidious and hungry, would obliterate the Aethelred’s core archives within hours, erasing millennia of human connection. <words>194</words>
The baggage claim’s hollow space amplified her dread; this desolate place, meant for reunions, now hosted only endings. <words>215</words>
The coffee stains shifted, revealing a sliver of hope: one book, Hemlock’s final manuscript, could be saved if she acted now, but saving it meant sacrificing the ship’s navigation to purge the worm. <words>253</words>
Without navigation, the Aethelred would drift, the flying library grounded forever, its role as the bridge to unity shattered. <words>279</words>
Time compressed; she stood in the second where a simple yes or no could change everything—the tradition’s last breath hanging on her choice. <words>307</words>
Saying "yes" to save the manuscript meant dooming the mobile library, the very vessel that carried unity across fractured worlds. <words>332</words>
Saying "no" meant preserving the ship but losing Hemlock’s words, the heart of the tradition she swore to protect. <words>355</words>
Fractal sorrow deepened; each potential loss fractured into smaller, sharper pains—the end of lullabies, the silencing of elders, the severing of threads between peoples. <words>388</words>
Her hand trembled, the brass button biting into her palm, a tangible link to the storyteller who believed stories were the only true secular sacred. <words>415</words>
She chose "yes," initiating the purge sequence, her voice raw as she whispered the command to obliterate the worm, knowing the cost. <words>440</words>
Alarms wailed; the Aethelred shuddered as corrupted data dissolved, the manuscript secured in a lead-lined case, but navigation systems died with a final sigh. <words>468</words>
Silence returned, heavier now. Elara stepped onto the cracked baggage carousel, the detached button clutched tight, the flying library still, the bridge to unity broken but one story preserved. <words>500</words>
She would walk from this abandoned spaceport, carrying Hemlock’s words, the tradition alive in her voice alone, a fragile, secular light against the encroaching dark. <words>532</words>
