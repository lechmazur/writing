Kael adjusted the frayed arm of the one-eyed squid plush atop a glowing brain coral, its synthetic fur bleached pale by the reef city’s perpetual currents; this faded carnival prize was his only memento from a life before the Zealot Order. <words>38</words>
During his mandated nature walks along Neptunia’s bioluminescent pathways, he’d place it deliberately, a calculatedly playful marker for his quarry, though the plush’s vacant button eyes seemed to judge his path. <words>75</words>
He was here to consolidate the location of Captain Vanya, the so-called pirate who’d "stolen" the city’s oxygen harvesters, but the Order’s epic hymns felt hollow beneath the coral arches. <words>112</words>
The reflection of morality troubled him: the hymns painted Vanya as a monster, yet the reef thrived where her diverted harvesters nurtured kelp forests, feeding starving districts the Order ignored. <words>149</words>
Kael activated his hydrophone, listening through reversed echoes – sound waves bouncing off distant structures – to pinpoint Vanya’s hidden grotto, a method as precise as his blade. <words>185</words>
A distorted broadcast surfaced: Vanya’s voice, crackling with weary humor, retelling the city’s founding epic not as the Order’s triumph, but as a villainous land-grab by Neptunia’s founders against the surface dwellers. <words>224</words>
"See this?" she’d say, likely gesturing to the very kelp forests Kael observed, "They call me a thief for sharing what *they* hoarded. Our epic’s just their lie, polished smooth." <words>259</words>
The faded plush, perched precariously on a fan coral, seemed to nod in the gentle surge; Kael remembered winning it at a surface carnival, a time before zealotry, before the world narrowed to dogma. <words>297</words>
His mission demanded Vanya’s death to consolidate Order control, but her words, carried through the water’s reversed echoes, refracted the truth: he was the instrument of the real villainy. <words>334</words>
Humorous solemnity settled over him – the absurdity of hunting a savior with a child’s toy, the crushing weight of realizing his holy war was built on stolen air. <words>369</words>
He picked up the squid plush, its threadbare body a testament to forgotten innocence, and turned not toward Vanya’s grotto, but toward the Order’s central spire. <words>404</words>
He would consolidate the evidence – the thriving reef, Vanya’s broadcast, the plush – and retell the epic from the *true* villain’s view: his own masters. <words>438</words>
The nature walk ended not with a kill, but with Kael placing the squid gently on the spire’s threshold, a silent, playful challenge to the zealots within. <words>473</words>
Its single button eye glinted under the city’s glow, a faded carnival prize now bearing the reflection of a morality reclaimed. <words>500</words>
