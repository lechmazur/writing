General Aris slumped onto the cracked vinyl booth of the Dark Matter Diner, the stale scent of recycled air clinging to his uniform like defeat. <words>24</words>
Between rides on the interstellar shuttle, he sought refuge from the crushing weight of command, his spirit as brittle as the dried seaweed snack the waitress slid before him. <words>48</words>
"Compliments of the house, General," she said, her eyes holding a mischievous glint that felt alien in this dim outpost. <words>63</words>
He picked at the brittle strands, a rationally absurd comfort food smuggled from a dead ocean world, a tiny anchor against the void. <words>81</words>
"Anxieties keep you up too?" she asked, nodding at his trembling hands, her voice low. <words>94</words>
He confessed the shared anxieties gnawing at him: the fear of failing his troops, the terror of the silent, dark matter pressing in. <words>113</words>
She slid a worn black-and-white photograph across the table – a long-exposure shot capturing the graceful arcs of distant nebulae swirling around a black hole. <words>136</words>
"See those arcs?" she murmured, tapping the image. <words>143</words>
"They're not falling in; they're dancing *around* the edge, renewing themselves in the spin. <words>156</words>
Fear tries to sit on reason's throne, but look – the universe laughs at its seriousness." <words>170</words>
Her mischievous wisdom struck him; the photo’s stark beauty revealed a truth more profound than any battle plan. <words>186</words>
The dried seaweed, absurdly clutched in his fist, became a symbol – not of despair, but of life persisting in impossible places. <words>206</words>
His anxieties hadn't vanished, but seeing them mirrored in her calm eyes, framed by the cosmic arcs, shifted something fundamental. <words>224</words>
He wasn't alone in the dark; the shared weight felt lighter, almost manageable. <words>237</words>
"To dethrone fear," she added, refilling his synth-coffee, "you gotta catch it tripping over its own seriousness. <words>255</words>
Like expecting dried kelp to save you from the abyss." <words>265</words>
He chuckled, a rusty sound he hadn't heard in years, the sound of reason reclaiming its seat. <words>279</words>
The photo’s arcs weren't escape; they were a rhythm, a way to move *with* the darkness, not just against it. <words>297</words>
Renewal wasn't about erasing fear, but weaving it into the larger, absurdly beautiful pattern. <words>312</words>
He pushed the last piece of seaweed into his mouth, the salty crunch a defiant spark. <words>325</words>
As the shuttle horn blared for boarding, Aris stood, his posture less burdened, his gaze fixed not on the void, but on the potential within it. <words>348</words>
He left credits and a genuine smile for the waitress, the Dark Matter Diner no longer a refuge from fear, but a waypoint where anxieties were shared, seen, and gently mocked. <words>375</words>
Stepping onto the gangway, he felt the old general’s dread replaced by a quiet, mischievous resolve – the universe was absurd, yes, but reason, renewed by shared light, could still chart a course. <words>405</words>
He saluted the swirling dark matter beyond the viewport, not in defiance, but in acknowledgment of the dance. <words>419</words>
The arcs in the photograph lived on, a silent promise written in starlight and shadow. <words>433</words>
