Silas, the disgruntled wishing-well attendant, traced the jagged scar across his palm while sorting his collection of foreign coins, each one a relic from agents who’d vanished into the night. <words>24</words>
He was intensely relaxed despite the ache in his bones, a calm forged by years guarding this secret agent escape route hidden beneath the well’s mossy stones. <words>40</words>
At the crossing of two unwritten paths—where the alley’s shadows bled into the park’s twilight—he’d learned to corroborate safe passage by following shadow patterns only moonlight revealed. <words>61</words>
The weight of scars, both visible and hidden, pressed heavier than the coins in his pocket, each mark a silent testament to failures he couldn’t outrun. <words>80</words>
Tonight, he needed to out-face the silent judgments of old ghosts: his grandfather’s ghostly frown in the well’s reflection, accusing him of neglecting the route’s sanctity. <words>101</words>
Rain slicked the cobblestones as Silas knelt, aligning a Yugoslavian dinar with the elongated shadow of the oak tree, its pattern matching the escape route’s coded map. <words>122</words>
He’d inherited this mystery from his grandfather, a spymaster who’d drowned in the well during the war, leaving only coins and unanswered questions. <words>139</words>
Corroborating the path meant placing a Soviet ruble where twin shadows converged, proving the route still breathed beneath the city’s oblivious streets. <words>159</words>
His fingers, trembling not from fear but the weight of scars, positioned the coin as the last light bled from the sky. <words>174</words>
The ghosts whispered through the well’s echo—cowards, traitors, failures—but Silas stood intensely relaxed, his breath steady against their icy breath. <words>192</words>
This crossing of unwritten paths was no accident; it was where his grandfather had bled out, where Silas now chose to reclaim his honor. <words>211</words>
He placed a Czech koruna where the shadows forked, the coin glinting like a promise to the dead. <words>224</words>
Each foreign coin in his pouch held a story: a defector’s bribe, a dead drop’s payment, all now his to protect or betray. <words>241</words>
The well’s water stilled, reflecting not his face but his grandfather’s stern eyes, judging his years of disgruntled apathy. <words>257</words>
Silas pressed a scarred thumb to the final coin—a Polish zloty—and slid it into the shadow’s heart, corroborating the route’s integrity beyond doubt. <words>278</words>
In that instant, the weight of scars transformed; they were not chains but compass points guiding him home. <words>293</words>
The ghosts’ whispers faded as moonlight flooded the path, revealing the escape route’s entrance, clear and waiting. <words>308</words>
He’d out-faced their silent judgments not with rage, but with this intensely relaxed certainty earned through sacrifice. <words>323</words>
Gathering his coins, Silas smiled faintly, the disgruntled attendant now the keeper of an inherited mystery no ghost could haunt. <words>339</words>
The city slept, unaware its safety rested on shadow patterns and a man who’d finally made peace with his scars. <words>355</words>
As dawn bled into the crossing of paths, Silas dropped a single coin into the well—not a wish, but a vow. <words>371</words>
The water swallowed it, sealing the route until the next guardian, carrying the weight of scars, would follow the shadows home. <words>387</words>
