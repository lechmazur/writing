Sir Alden drifted through the zero-gravity dance hall, his dented armor clinking softly against the spectral waltzers, a dejected knight adrift in sacred disorder. <words>20</words> Clutched in his gauntleted hand, the cold, barnacle-encrusted trident prong from a sunken realm felt heavier than lead, a shard of his drowned kingdom’s crown. <words>41</words> He was normally abnormal here, a warrior of mud and steel amidst beings of light and levity, his sorrow a tangible fog in the swirling chaos. <words>64</words> Tonight, the ancient watchtower clock above the hall’s impossible vault would strike an unexpected hour, a rumor whispered only by the forgotten. <words>88</words> Alden’s sole motivation, a silent vow echoing through ages to restore the drowned city of Maris, tightened his chest like a vice. <words>110</words> He had followed whispers through forgotten paths beneath the city streets, paths slick with brine and time, to reach this celestial ballroom. <words>135</words> As the clock’s hands, frozen for centuries, suddenly jerked forward, Alden felt the air itself quicken, vibrating with imminent change. <words>160</words> Thirteen chimes resonated, deep and wrong, shattering the dance hall’s rhythm into sacred disorder as gravity flickered wildly. <words>183</words> Dancers gasped, floating wildly, but Alden pushed off a drifting chandelier, using the trident prong to steer through the disarray. <words>207</words> The prong glowed faintly, reacting to the clock’s impossible hour, its light mapping forgotten paths through the hall’s shifting architecture. <words>231</words> He saw it then—a shimmering archway, invisible moments before, leading deeper into the station’s heart, a path only revealed by temporal rupture. <words>258</words> Quicken, the vow seemed to whisper, not in speed alone, but in purpose, urging him toward the archway’s threshold. <words>280</words> Alden kicked off a floating harp, his movement precise despite the chaos, the trident prong guiding him as if pulled by Maris’s drowned heart. <words>305</words> He entered the archway, and the dance hall vanished, replaced by a starlit void where the horizon deepened infinitely before him. <words>329</words> Here, in the silent expanse, the sacred disorder coalesced into clarity; the deepening horizons weren’t distance, but time folding, revealing Maris as it was. <words>354</words> The trident prong flared, and Alden finally voiced the silent vow, his words not sound but light, echoing through ages to the city’s foundation stones. <words>379</words> "I return you," he breathed, the vow a catalyst, and the sunken realm shimmered, its spires rising from the cosmic sea. <words>402</words> The forgotten paths had led not to escape, but to restoration, his dejection transformed as horizons deepened into hope. <words>424</words> The watchtower clock’s chime faded, but the vow endured, a new rhythm quickening the stars themselves. <words>445</words> Alden, no longer dejected, drifted toward the reborn city, the trident prong now a key to a world remade. <words>468</words> Sacred disorder had birthed order, and the knight’s silent promise echoed, finally heard. <words>490</words>
