Lord Peregrine knelt amid overgrown rose bushes, weeding with practiced, submissive diligence while his mind drifted far from the estate’s demands. <words>18</words>
His unusually perceptive ears caught faint, distorted voices bouncing through the garden’s old stone echo chambers—unplanned eavesdropping revealing a secret agent workshop disguised as a potting shed. <words>36</words>
Agents discussed a new toxin designed to liquify organic matter, testing it tomorrow near the hedgerow where a wounded hedgehog, its spines matted with mud, had sought refuge. <words>54</words>
Peregrine’s heart clenched; silent empathy surged within him, a quiet resolve to protect the vulnerable creature without drawing attention to his own fragile position. <words>72</words>
He continued weeding, humming a flippant tune to mask his tension, the earnest flippancy a shield against suspicion as he pondered his limited options. <words>89</words>
Retreating to his modest study, he selected a dull letter opener—its blunted tip perfect for his plan, unlikely to raise alarms like sharper tools might. <words>107</words>
That evening, under cover of twilight yard work, he slipped toward the shed, the letter opener hidden in his gardening glove, moving with aristocratic quietude. <words>125</words>
Inside the workshop, vials of the liquifying agent glowed faintly; Peregrine carefully pried the seal on the main reservoir with the dull opener, ensuring a slow, undetectable leak. <words>145</words>
He worked swiftly, his submissive nature now a tool for stealth, knowing any overt action would doom both him and the hedgehog. <words>160</words>
The agents’ echo-chambered voices had been chillingly precise: the toxin would activate at dawn, turning the hedgerow soil into a deadly slurry. <words>177</words>
Peregrine imagined the small creature dissolving, and his usually placid face tightened with uncharacteristic determination. <words>190</words>
He finished the sabotage, wiping the opener clean before vanishing into the garden shadows, the hedgehog’s safety resting on his silent intervention. <words>207</words>
Dawn arrived with frantic shouts from the workshop; the liquify agent had mysteriously failed, its components inert after the slow leak Peregrine engineered. <words>224</words>
Agents scoured the grounds, baffled, while Peregrine resumed weeding nearby, offering a bland, flippant shrug when questioned about the malfunction. <words>241</words>
His unusually perceptive gaze, however, lingered on the undisturbed hedgerow where the hedgehog emerged, unharmed, to sniff the morning air. <words>258</words>
No words passed between man and beast, only a profound, silent empathy in Peregrine’s relieved sigh as he turned back to his roses. <words>275</words>
The dull letter opener, now resting innocuously in his pocket, felt less like a relic and more like a quiet testament to unseen courage. <words>292</words>
He knew his submissive role remained, but protecting the vulnerable had carved a small, defiant space for his own quiet worth. <words>309</words>
The estate hummed with its usual秩序, yet Peregrine carried a new, unspoken strength, forged in earnest flippancy and the echo of a creature’s survival. <words>327</words>
