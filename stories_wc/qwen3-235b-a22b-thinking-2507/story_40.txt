My third life’s less glamorous than the second; reincarnated goldfish caretaker now mops hospital floors, haunted by the guilt’s echoing splash of forgotten tanks. <words>20</words>
Clutching a chipped toy soldier missing its left arm—a relic from a past life’s clumsy guilt—I sought refuge in the forgotten recipe library during the sudden, violent downpour. <words>40</words>
The storm’s fury rattled the library’s dusty windows, its sudden change of weather forcing a small, pale boy named Leo, IV pole trailing, to stumble inside seeking shelter. <words>61</words>
"Lost?" I asked, my voice tentatively fierce, masking the ache of recognizing his fragile hope, so like the goldfish gasping on my old kitchen counter. <words>82</words>
He pointed silently to the toy soldier in my hand, his eyes wide; its missing arm mirrored his own empty sleeve, a stark echo of my failure to alleviate suffering, then and now. <words>106</words>
"Stagnant tradition says kids like you just… wait," I muttered, playful cynicism a shield against the crushing weight of the doctor’s chart I knew awaited him tomorrow. <words>129</words>
Before the chart could confirm the turning point towards despair, I needed to disrupt the hospital’s grim routine, to find something *real*. <words>147</words>
Driven by the soldier’s silent accusation, I scoured the library’s cobwebbed shelves, fingers brushing spines labeled "Elixirs for Grief" and "Broths for Broken Bones." <words>168</words>
There, tucked behind "Soothing Syrups," lay a brittle, handwritten recipe: "Courage Custard – Alleviates the weight of what haunts you, best shared." <words>188</words>
The instructions were absurdly simple: moonlight (impossible indoors), laughter (scarce here), and one genuine, unguarded wish. <words>202</words>
"Your turn," I said, pushing the recipe toward Leo, my cynicism cracking. "What do you wish for, fiercely?" <words>216</words>
He whispered, "To not be scared," his small hand gripping the toy soldier’s base, tentatively fierce in his vulnerability. <words>229</words>
I wished, with all my reincarnated heart, for his fear to lift, for the guilt’s echo to finally fade. <words>242</words>
We stirred air into an imaginary bowl, laughing weakly at the absurdity, the storm’s rhythm our only music. <words>256</words>
The custard, of course, remained invisible, but Leo’s shoulders lost their rigid fear, his smile a fragile, genuine thing. <words>272</words>
As the rain eased, a nurse called him back; he left the toy soldier on the recipe, a tiny, armless guardian. <words>287</words>
Later, reviewing his chart before the official prognosis, the doctor noted: "Unexpected emotional improvement. Possible catalyst?" <words>303</words>
I touched the soldier’s missing limb, the guilt’s echo now a softer murmur, not a scream. <words>316</words>
Disrupting the stagnant tradition wasn’t about curing, but about finding the recipe hidden in plain sight: shared courage, tentatively fierce, could alleviate even the oldest hauntings. <words>340</words>
The forgotten library, smelling of paper and possibility, felt less like an end and more like a beginning, one fragile wish at a time. <words>358</words>
My mop bucket waited, but for the first time since the goldfish, the water didn’t feel like a tomb. <words>374</words>
The chart’s turning point was his, but the echo in my soul? Finally, blessedly, quiet. <words>389</words>
