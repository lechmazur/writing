Borin the sellsword, jovial yet boldly reluctant, pushed through the witch’s overgrown herb garden, his laughter belying the tension in his shoulders as thorny moon-bloom vines snagged his worn leather armor. <words>38</words> The air hummed with the scent of crushed star-anise and the low thrum of magic, thick as the humidity throughout the garden’s unsettling transformation; once-tame lavender now writhed like serpents, and glow-moss pulsed erratically underfoot. <words>75</words> His target stood crookedly amidst the chaos: an ancient brass astronomical telescope, its lens cracked, pointed uselessly at the bruised twilight sky where the eclipse had begun. <words>108</words> He hadn’t wanted this job—escorting a grieving witch to bury her final time capsule—but the family tradition, passed down through generations of sellswords, demanded it: one capsule buried before perilous work, containing a token of hope, a silent vow against despair. <words>158</words> This time, the treasure wasn’t gold or gems, but the witch’s fragile resolve, crystallized in a vial of her own tears mixed with powdered courage-root, meant to dethrone the doubt festering in her mind after her mentor’s betrayal. <words>205</words> "The Withering Vow," she’d rasped, her voice raw, gesturing to the telescope, "it’s failing; the celestial alignment weakens the wards. Without it tracking the eclipse’s end, the garden’s magic collapses entirely." <words>248</words> Borin understood; the Vow was the magical contract binding the garden’s protective spirit, its inscription fading like old ink, a literal withering promise now fraying at the edges. <words>283</words> His reluctance warred with duty—he was a fighter, not a gardener or a stargazer—but the time capsule ritual anchored him; his grandfather’s voice echoed: *Bury hope before the storm, lad, so doubt doesn’t take root.* <words>327</words> With a grunt, he heaved the heavy telescope base, aligning it roughly southward as instructed, ignoring the elegant mayhem erupting around him: sprigs of panic-grass shot sparks, and a cluster of truth-berry bushes burst into brief, blinding song. <words>368</words> Sweat stung his eyes, but his movements were precise, fueled by the need to fulfill the tradition, to secure the witch’s fragile treasure before the eclipse peaked and the Vow dissolved completely. <words>402</words> As the telescope’s lens finally caught the first sliver of returning moonlight, the witch plunged the time capsule—a simple clay jar sealed with beeswax—into the earth beneath the weeping willow, her trembling hands steady now. <words>440</words> The garden’s violent thrashing subsided; the lavender uncoiled, the glow-moss softened to a gentle pulse. <words>455</words> Borin wiped his brow, offering the witch a lopsided grin. <words>465</words> "Doubt’s dethroned, eh? Good. Now, about that ale you promised..." His jovial tone cut through the lingering tension, the successful burial a quiet victory against the encroaching dark, both in the garden and the mind. <words>500</words>
