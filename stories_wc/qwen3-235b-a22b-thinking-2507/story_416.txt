Sir Gareth wiped luminous swamp mist from his visor. <words>7</words>
The championship scoreboard had just reset, silencing the arena’s roar. <words>12</words>
He sought urban legends, not trophies, his academic rebellion hidden beneath rigid knightly decorum. <words>18</words>
His destination: a cluttered apothecary shelf deep in the glowing marsh. <words>23</words>
He needed proof, to verify the Snail Shell Prophecy’s truth. <words>28</words>
Reaching for the last item—a fossilized snail shell—he bumped knuckles with a scholar. <words>34</words>
"Apologies," Gareth stated, laconic exuberance warming his clipped tone. <words>39</words>
The scholar, ink-stained and eager, mirrored his grab for the relic. <words>44</words>
"Converging destinies," the scholar breathed, holding up the shell. <words>49</words>
Gareth nodded, verifying the shell’s spiral against his worn manuscript. <words>54</words>
This artifact confirmed the legend: champions who touched it vanished, reborn as swamp guardians. <words>61</words>
His tournament loss now felt purposeful, a necessary reset. <words>66</words>
The scholar grinned, "They said you’d never seek forbidden lore." <words>71</words>
"Rules bind swords," Gareth replied, "not curiosity." <words>76</words>
Their fingers brushed the shell’s ancient surface, cool and smooth. <words>81</words>
Luminous algae pulsed around them, sealing the moment in emerald light. <words>86</words>
He’d traded rigid honor for a deeper truth. <words>91</words>
The swamp’s legends weren’t myths; they were invitations. <words>96</words>
Gareth pocketed the shell, its weight a promise. <words>101</words>
No more hiding his quest behind ceremonial armor. <words>106</words>
The scholar clapped his shoulder, "Next legend: the Whispering Stones." <words>111</words>
Gareth’s usual stoicism cracked into a rare, full smile. <words>116</words>
Destinies converged here, in this damp, glowing aisle. <words>121</words>
He’d verify every tale, one fossil at a time. <words>126</words>
The championship’s echo faded; new purpose ignited. <words>131</words>
Swamp mist curled around their boots like a living thing. <words>136</words>
Academic rebellion had never felt so righteous. <words>140</words>
He adjusted his gauntlets, ready to dive deeper. <words>145</words>
The shell hummed faintly, a heartbeat against his thigh. <words>150</words>
Legends awaited, and Sir Gareth would collect them all. <words>155</words>
No more sidelines. Only the luminous, whispering path ahead. <words>161</words>
His knightly oath now included verifying the impossible. <words>166</words>
The scholar led the way, muttering about spectral badgers. <words>171</words>
Gareth followed, the shell a compass in his palm. <words>176</words>
Converging destinies meant shared burdens, shared wonders. <words>181</words>
He felt lighter, freer than after any victory. <words>186</words>
The swamp breathed with him, luminous and alive. <words>191</words>
One legend down. Countless more to verify. <words>196</words>
His straight-laced reputation could wait. Truth called louder. <words>202</words>
They vanished into the glowing reeds, seekers now. <words>207</words>
The fossilized snail shell was just the beginning. <words>212</words>
Gareth’s true championship started here, in the murk. <words>217</words>
No scoreboard. Only the swamp’s endless, verdant clock. <words>222</words>
He touched the shell again, verifying its silent promise. <words>227</words>
Destiny wasn’t a path. It was a convergence. <words>232</words>
And he’d arrived exactly where he needed to be. <words>237</words>
