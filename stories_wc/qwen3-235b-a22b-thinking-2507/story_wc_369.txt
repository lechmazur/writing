Aris heard the pin drop in the silent corridor, a sound so sharp it cut through the storm's lull. [15]
He froze, mop in hand, the labyrinth maintenance worker's instincts flaring. [25]
This was the tower's oldest wing, abandoned since the astronomer Elias died, and pins didn't just drop here. [42]
Moonlight, fractured by the storm clouds, bled through a high window, painting silver streaks on the dusty floor. [59]
Aris followed the sound, his boots silent on the stone, to Elias's old observatory room. [74]
There, on the cold floor, lay the astronomer's broken sextant, its brass limbs splayed like a dead insect. [89]
He knelt, careful not to touch the pieces; he knew better. [100]
This sextant healed only in moonlight, a mundane miracle he'd witnessed twice before when storms cleared. [119]
Each time, the broken parts had slithered back together under the lunar glow, as if mending a wound. [138]
Aris carried the pieces to the windowsill, arranging them in the moonbeam's path. [153]
While waiting, he opened Elias's journal, its pages brittle with age. [165]
Elias had quantified his sorrow after his daughter's death, assigning numbers to grief: 3.7 units for the first sunrise without her, 5.2 for the empty chair at dinner. [198]
Aris understood quantified sorrow; his own ledger recorded 427 entries, each marking a night the moon healed his psoriasis, a tally of pain soothed but never erased. [235]
His motivation wasn't vanity or science, but to discover what the ancient oaks in the labyrinth witnessed—the day his wife vanished into the mist, never to return. [270]
Elias's notes described a method: deconstruct reality by mapping scattered dreams. [287]
The astronomer believed dreams were seeds scattered by the wind, and their patterns revealed hidden truths. [307]
Aris had spent years collecting his own scattered dreams—fragments of his wife's laughter, the scent of rain on stone—and sketching them onto grid paper, aligning them with the labyrinth's paths. [352]
Now, as the last cloud parted, full moonlight flooded the sill. [366]
The sextant's pieces trembled, then clicked into place, whole and gleaming. [381]
Aris lifted it, the cool brass familiar in his hands, and aimed it not at the stars, but at the oldest oak visible through the window. [408]
He adjusted the vernier until the crosshairs centered on the tree's gnarled heart. [425]
According to Elias's dream map, this oak absorbed sorrow like soil absorbs rain, its rings storing witnessed moments. [449]
Aris deconstructed his quantified sorrow, not as numbers, but as dream fragments mapped onto the tree's rings. [470]
He saw it then: the scattered dreams weren't random. [484]
Each entry in his ledger—a healing night—corresponded to a ring where the tree had "witnessed" his grief. [505]
The oak hadn't seen his wife vanish; it had felt the sorrow ripple through the earth when she was gone. [528]
Quantified sorrow wasn't a measure of loss, but of connection—the tree's silent record of human pain. [550]
Aris lowered the sextant, his psoriasis tingling as moonlight bathed his arms. [567]
He hadn't found what the trees saw, but what they held: a living archive of sorrow, healing not by forgetting, but by being witnessed. [603]
This was the mundane miracle Elias had sought—not in stars, but in the quiet exchange between earth and heart. [629]
Aris walked back to the labyrinth, the repaired sextant in his coat, no longer broken but a tool for mapping deeper truths. [655]
The storm had passed, leaving the air clean, and the moonlit hedges seemed to whisper secrets only the trees knew. [679]
He would continue his work, tending the paths where dreams scattered like leaves, each one a pinprick of light in the dark. [710]
For in the quantification of sorrow, he'd found not emptiness, but a map to what endures. [732]
The labyrinth wasn't a puzzle to solve, but a witness to hold his grief until the moon could heal it. [758]
And as he stepped into the moonlight, his skin began to mend, one sorrow at a time. [778]
