Silas Thorne, the forgotten noble, traced charred ticket stubs across the lab bench, his fingers smudged with soot. <words>14</words> The spontaneous combustion lab hummed with latent energy, a fitting cage for his hollow recklessness. <words>24</words> He sought to fortify his crumbling sense of self through the meticulous reassembly of old ticket stubs, each fragment a relic from banquets and balls before his name faded. <words>45</words> An artificial hummingbird drone, its wings a blur of iridescent steel, hovered nearby, observing his futile task with unnerving patience. <words>61</words> Its presence was mysteriously obvious; everyone knew the drones monitored the volatile experiments, yet its quiet scrutiny felt intensely personal, a silent judge. <words>82</words> Between text messages vibrating on his cracked phone screen – terse updates from a world that no longer cared – Silas focused on the stubs. <words>103</words> He needed candor in these small moments, the brutal honesty of aligning torn edges, to cut through the illusions he’d woven since his disgrace. <words>127</words> The stubs, salvaged from the ruins of his last public gala, were his only map back to relevance, a map built on ash. <words>148</words> As he pressed a stubborn fragment into place, the drone dipped lower, its tiny lens capturing the tremor in his hand, the raw vulnerability he usually masked. <words>173</words> This candor, forced by the machine’s unblinking gaze, was the only truth left; his noble title was dust, his wealth gone, his purpose reduced to this fragile reconstruction. <words>203</words> He remembered the gala’s final moments: the sudden heat, the gasps, the way the silk drapes ignited without cause – the first sign of the lab’s unpredictable curse. <words>231</words> Reassembling the stubs wasn’t nostalgia; it was armor, a desperate attempt to fortify his spirit against the crushing weight of being forgotten. <words>257</words> The drone’s soft whir became a counterpoint to the lab’s ominous silence, a reminder that observation was constant, even here, in this place of sudden fire. <words>285</words> A text buzzed: *Pressure rising in Chamber 3. Evac?* He ignored it, fingers closing on a stub bearing the date of his downfall. <words>308</words> The truth was mysteriously obvious now: the combustion wasn’t random; it fed on denial, on the illusions of permanence he’d clung to. <words>333</words> His hollow recklessness had brought him here, to this bench, surrounded by potential fire, seeking stability in paper ghosts. <words>355</words> To cut through the illusions meant accepting the stubs would never form a whole ticket, that his nobility was truly extinguished. <words>378</words> He placed the final piece, the reassembled stub a perfect, fragile square on the scarred metal. <words>395</words> The drone hovered, its candor absolute; the lab’s air crackled, thick with the scent of ozone and impending flame. <words>414</words> Another text flashed: *Ignition imminent. Last chance.* Silas didn’t move, the hollow recklessness complete, the small moment of truth his only shield. <words>430</words>
