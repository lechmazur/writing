Elias climbed the attic stairs, knuckles split and ribs aching from his last fight, the air thick with dust motes dancing in the single shaft of afternoon light. <words>24</words>
Below, the distant *tap-tap-tap* of a sculptor’s chisel striking marble echoed, the precise moment marking the birth of something new, a sound that usually calmed him but today felt like a hammer on his own fragile resolve. <words>55</words>
He needed to stand for something real, not the hollow victories in the ring that left him feeling emptier than before, his skillful incompetence a shield – he’d learned to lose just convincingly enough to avoid the big fights, the real risks, the terrifying possibility of true failure or true success. <words>100</words>
The dusty attic, crammed with forgotten relics, held only clockwork animals frozen mid-stride, their brass gears coated in grime, silent witnesses to years of avoidance. <words>128</words>
Kneeling, he brushed grime from a small, broken clay pot shard, its rough edge catching the light; an inscription, faded but legible, read: "Truth is the first casualty of comfort." <words>160</words>
This was it, the artifact of his self-deception, the comfortable lie that he fought only for survival, not because he craved the adulation he pretended to despise. <words>185</words>
His motivation crystallized: to extinguish the last vestige of that comforting falsehood, to stop abducting his own potential through forgotten dreams of what he *could* be if he wasn't so afraid. <words>218</words>
He remembered the dreams – vivid, forgotten upon waking – where he moved with impossible grace, undefeated, a champion standing for honor, not just paydays; those dreams were the path he’d abandoned. <words>253</words>
Holding the shard close, its inscription burning into his palm, the tone shifted intimate, urgent, a close distance between the man he was and the man the shard demanded he become. <words>285</words>
The sculptor’s chisel struck again downstairs, a sharp *crack* resonating through the floorboards, the exact moment the marble yielded, the form emerging from stone. <words>310</words>
Elias closed his eyes, not to escape, but to dive *through* the forgotten dreams, to abduct the timid fighter he’d been and replace him with the truth-carrier the shard revealed. <words>342</words>
He saw the dream-self, strong and unafraid, and with a surge of will, pulled that essence *into* his bruised reality, leaving the old, self-deceiving ghost behind in the dust. <words>372</words>
The clockwork animals seemed to shiver; one tiny brass bird clicked, then whirred to life, its fragile wings beating the stale air, a testament to the mechanism of change finally engaged. <words>400</words>
He stood, the clay shard falling from his hand, shattering on the floorboards, the inscription lost but its message now etched onto his soul; he would stand for truth, finally. <words>428</words>
