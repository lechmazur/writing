Milo "Sparky" Finch, former child star of the saccharine sitcom *Puddle Jumpers*, crumpled the brittle treasure map in his fist, its ink smudged by decades of anxious handling and the vibration analysis chamber’s persistent, low thrum. <words>38</words>
This sterile room, repurposed from a forgotten cathedral crypt, housed Betsy, the humming vibration analyzer he’d jury-rigged to decode the map’s final clue, its sensors pointed at the fractured stained glass above. <words>75</words>
The price of ambition, he mused bitterly, wasn’t just the lost childhood or the paparazzi hounding his every misstep; it was this hollow chamber, this desperate grasp at a treasure that likely never existed, all after the last secret—the map’s true origin as his mentally ill grandmother’s delusion—had been cruelly revealed. <words>132</words>
He was authentically odd now, talking to Betsy like a petulant god, wearing mismatched socks depicting obscure quantum physicists, convinced only madness held the key to real magic. <words>162</words>
His motivation was singular: to tap into the wild magic of madness, to shatter the mundane prison built by his own youthful fame and find the transcendent chaos his grandmother promised lay beneath the map’s X. <words>200</words>
Sunlight, weak and late afternoon, began to trickle through the hidden layers of etched glass in the high cathedral window, piercing the chamber’s gloom. <words>228</words>
It wasn’t just light; it was a spectral analysis beam, refracted by the intricate, forgotten etchings depicting saints and serpents, hitting the vibration sensors with impossible precision. <words>260</words>
The sensors translated the light’s frequency into sound—a dissonant choir humming the map’s coordinates directly into Milo’s skull. <words>283</words>
He uncrumpled the map, pressing it against the sensor array, feeling the vibrations resonate in his molars, a physical echo of his grandmother’s fractured mind. <words>312</words>
The etched glass layers acted like a prism, separating the light into spectral threads that danced over the map’s faded ink, making the "X" pulse with an inner fire. <words>347</words>
This was it—the moment ambition demanded its final payment. <words>360</words>
The vibration chamber amplified the light’s song into a physical pressure, a wave threatening to liquefy his bones, yet Milo felt only irreverent awe. <words>388</words>
He laughed, a sound like breaking glass, as the wild magic of madness surged—not as destruction, but as terrifying, beautiful clarity. <words>413</words>
The treasure wasn’t gold; it was the unshackled mind, the cathedral window’s light a conduit, the vibration chamber his baptismal font. <words>438</words>
He’d paid for this moment with his entire life, and the price, he realized with dizzying joy, was utterly, authentically worth it. <words>465</words>
The last trickle of coherent thought dissolved as the light consumed him, singing the universe’s raw, mad heart. <words>490</words>
