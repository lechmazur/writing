Leo adjusted his gloves, the paramedic’s uniform crisp despite the quantum tunnel’s damp chill, his third loop today already humming with excited boredom. <words>20</words>
He’d timed the raindrop’s fall a thousand times, each impact a metronome for his dread, waiting for the precise shatter that reset the clock. <words>40</words>
At the bell’s echo marking a forgotten recess, the accident would happen: the cyclist skidding on wet synth-pavement, the sickening crunch against the tunnel’s curved wall. <words>62</words>
His unhealed traumas weren’t just the patients he lost, but the brother he couldn’t pull from the lake, symbolized by the weathered fishing lure clutched in his pocket, its paint chipped, one barb bent. <words>95</words>
Privately public, Leo smiled reassuringly at bystanders while his mind screamed the loop’s script, a performance masking the raw ache beneath. <words>117</words>
Today, he wouldn’t just react; he’d nest the lure deep within a crack in the tunnel’s humming energy conduit, a ritual born of desperation. <words>140</words>
The lure, salvaged from his brother’s last tackle box, was his anchor to the grief he’d drowned in silence for years. <words>156</words>
As the bell’s final echo faded, signaling the impending collision, Leo crouched, pressing the cold metal into the fissure by the sound of a single raindrop hitting his visor. <words>184</words>
He felt the familiar lurch, the world dissolving into quantum static, but this time, he focused not on the crash, but on the lure’s final placement. <words>208</words>
The loop restarted, the bell echoing again, but Leo stood frozen, the weight of his motivation crystallizing: to baptize your nightmares in acceptance, not futile repetition. <words>235</words>
He saw the cyclist not as a doomed variable, but as a person, his brother’s face momentarily superimposed, the unhealed wound pulsing. <words>257</words>
Instead of rushing to the impact site, Leo ran *toward* the school gate as the bell echoed, intercepting the boy seconds before the slick curve. <words>281</words>
"Whoa there, kiddo," Leo said, voice thick with a sincerity that surprised even him, his privately public mask finally cracking. <words>300</words>
He guided the bike safely past the hazard, the quantum tunnel humming steadily, no crash, no reset triggered by the raindrop’s fall. <words>322</words>
The weathered fishing lure remained nestled in the conduit, a silent offering left behind in the altered timeline. <words>337</words>
Leo leaned against the cool wall, the excited boredom replaced by a profound, trembling stillness; he hadn’t saved his brother, but he’d saved *this* boy, accepting the past’s permanence. <words>368</words>
The baptism wasn’t in water, but in the quiet act of letting go, the lure a totem buried where time folded, finally at peace. <words>394</words>
He walked away from the quantum tunnel, the bell’s echo now just a sound, not a sentence, the raindrop’s memory a gentle benediction. <words>417</words>
His nightmares wouldn’t vanish, but they’d lost their power to loop; acceptance, hard-won and quiet, was the only cure for unhealed traumas. <words>442</words>
