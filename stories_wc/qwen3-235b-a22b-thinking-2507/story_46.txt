In the orchard of giant ferns overshadowed by waterfalls, the blank-faced performer waited, a plain plastic ring cold against their palm. <words>18</words> They were the guardian of rumors, tasked not with silencing whispers but with verifying their spectral truth. <words>31</words> Their role was uniquely typical: indistinguishable from the mossy stones yet utterly essential to the orchard's fragile equilibrium. <words>45</words> Approval came only by tracking moon paths, their silvered light refracting through the cascading water to illuminate genuine rumors as fleeting, luminous threads. <words>64</words> Tonight, during the distant piano practice echoing faintly from the valley, the performer sought a deeper resonance. <words>76</words> They needed to learn the language of dreams, believing rumors were merely fractured echoes of that primal tongue. <words>89</words> The ring, seemingly ordinary plastic, was the key; it would warm only when a rumor aligned with a true dream-path. <words>104</words> As the pianist’s hesitant notes climbed the mist, the performer raised the ring, aligning its dull circle with the moon’s slow descent. <words>120</words> Precise madness guided their movements: each adjustment of the ring’s angle calculated to the millimeter, a ritual demanding absolute focus. <words>136</words> They ignored the fern fronds brushing like cold fingers, the water’s roar a constant pressure behind their eyes. <words>149</words> A rumor surfaced—a child’s lost lullaby carrying visions of silver fish—yet the ring remained inert. <words>161</words> False. <words>163</words> Another followed: a stone weeping tears of starlight. <words>172</words> Still cold. <words>175</words> The performer’s blank face betrayed nothing, but their knuckles whitened around the ring. <words>187</words> Failure meant the orchard’s whispers would fester, turning toxic. <words>198</words> Then, as the pianist struck a dissonant chord resolving into pure, clear arpeggios, the moonlight pierced a gap in the falls. <words>218</words> A single, undeniable rumor bloomed: *the waterfall’s heart is a clock made of frozen rain*. <words>231</words> The ring flared with sudden, gentle heat against their skin. <words>241</words> Approval. <words>243</words> In that instant, the piano notes didn’t just sound; they *spoke*. <words>253</words> Syllables formed in the splash, the rustle, the vibration of the earth—a language woven from water and moonlight. <words>268</words> The performer understood: dreams weren’t heard, but *felt* through the orchard’s pulse, translated by the ring’s silent judgment. <words>285</words> The pianist’s practice wasn’t background noise; it was the tuning fork for reality. <words>298</words> They traced the moon’s new path with the ring, now warm and humming, mapping the dream-language’s contours. <words>313</words> Each verified rumor was a syllable, each approved thread a sentence in the orchard’s true name. <words>327</words> The blank face remained expressionless, but within, the precise madness crystallized into clarity. <words>340</words> To guard rumors was to safeguard the bridge between waking and dreaming, one uniquely typical ring approving the moon’s silent testimony. <words>359</words> As the final piano note faded, the performer lowered the ring, its heat now a steady ember. <words>373</words> They had learned the first word: *flow*. <words>381</words> The orchard sighed, the waterfalls singing it back in a thousand liquid voices. <words>394</words> Tomorrow, they would seek the next. <words>402</words> The path was clear, lit only by the moon and the quiet approval of plastic against skin. <words>415</words>
