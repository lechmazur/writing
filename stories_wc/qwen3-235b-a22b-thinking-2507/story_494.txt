The arrogant swordsman kicked aside fallen plum blossoms as he entered the calligraphy master’s courtyard, his scabbard scraping stone doubtfully confident he’d find answers here. <words>24</words>
Clutched in his calloused hand was a faded tapestry fragment depicting a broken sword, the only relic of his disgraced lineage. <words>40</words>
He’d come seeking the master’s rumored wisdom, though his posture screamed contempt for such quiet arts, shackled potential thrumming beneath his forced bravado. <words>59</words>
"Your chains are self-made," the master stated without looking up from his inkstone, his voice a rasp of harsh tenderness. <words>75</words>
The swordsman scoffed, rattling the iron manacles hidden beneath his sleeves – tokens of his failure to authorize his own worth. <words>92</words>
"Prove it," he challenged, tossing the tapestry fragment onto the stone veranda where it lay like a dead leaf. <words>107</words>
The master finally met his gaze, eyes sharp as a brushstroke. <words>116</words>
"Sing the wedding song," he commanded, referencing the traditional melody sung at every family wedding, the one that bound generations. <words>136</words>
The swordsman froze; that song belonged to light, to hope, things extinguished when his blade failed and his family’s honor died. <words>154</words>
To deliver a spark where all lights have gone out felt impossible, yet the master’s silence demanded action. <words>168</words>
Between breaths, as the courtyard held its stillness, he began the first hesitant notes, doubtfully confident his voice wouldn’t crack. <words>186</words>
The melody, ancient and aching, rose – a sound meant for joy now carrying the weight of his shame. <words>200</words>
With each line sung in the courtyard’s hushed air, the iron manacles grew warm, then searing. <words>214</words>
He sang of vows and new dawns, his voice rough but gaining strength, authorizing his own release through the only key he possessed: memory. <words>232</words>
The final note hung between them, and the manacles shattered, clattering onto the stones like dead insects. <words>247</words>
The swordsman stared at his freed wrists, the shackled potential within him suddenly terrifyingly vast. <words>260</words>
The master dipped his brush, not in ink but in the dew collected on a nearby lotus leaf. <words>274</words>
With a single, swift stroke, he painted a tiny, perfect spark on the faded tapestry fragment. <words>288</words>
"Your light was never gone," the master said, his harsh tenderness now a lifeline. <words>301</words>
"It was merely waiting for you to authorize its return." <words>311</words>
The swordsman touched the painted spark, feeling its imagined warmth seep into his skin. <words>324</words>
He bowed, deeper and longer than he ever had, the arrogant set of his shoulders finally softening. <words>339</words>
He left the courtyard not as a disgraced warrior, but as a man carrying a spark, ready to reignite the dark. <words>357</words>
The calligraphy master watched him go, the silent courtyard holding the echo of a song sung between breaths. <words>374</words>
A single plum blossom settled onto the tapestry fragment, resting beside the master’s luminous spark. <words>389</words>
The swordsman walked into the gathering dusk, the weight of his potential no longer a chain, but a promise. <words>405</words>
He would deliver the light, one doubtful, confident step at a time. <words>416</words>
