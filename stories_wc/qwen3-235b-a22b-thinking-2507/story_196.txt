Kael slumped in the monastery’s quiet breakroom, the resignation letter still warm on the table where Brother Torin had left it. <words>19</words>
Dust motes danced in the single shaft of pale light, the only movement in the floating rock sanctuary after Torin’s departure. <words>35</words>
His plain cloth bag, worn thin from decades of travel, rested heavily between his boots, ignored like the untouched tea steaming beside him. <words>54</words>
The tired swordsman felt fiercely apathetic, the monastery’s serene isolation now just another cage of stone and silence. <words>69</words>
He’d promised himself, years ago beneath a different sky, to find his sister before the last comet faded. <words>85</words>
That hidden promise, buried under duty and defeat, felt like ash in his mouth. <words>97</words>
Outside the arched window, the first streak of the annual Lyrid meteor shower ignited the twilight. <words>112</words>
A single, defiant spark against the vast, uncaring dark – it mirrored the ember he thought long dead within his own chest. <words>132</words>
He remembered the fragile star charts, meticulously copied onto rice paper, stored inside the plain cloth bag. <words>148</words>
Torin’s resignation wasn’t just about the monastery’s fading purpose; it was the final echo of Kael’s own surrender. <words>165</words>
But the meteors… they were a path, a celestial map only the truly desperate or foolish would follow. <words>182</words>
Kael’s apathy cracked, not with rage, but with a quiet, knowing naivety. <words>196</words>
He knew the journey across the sky-sea was likely suicide, the monastery’s safety a fool’s comfort. <words>212</words>
Yet, the spark of defiance – that stubborn refusal to let the promise die with him – flared brighter than the falling stars. <words>232</words>
He wouldn’t overcome the crushing weight of his weariness by force, but by following the meteors’ fleeting light. <words>250</words>
His calloused fingers brushed the rough weave of the bag, feeling the hidden charts beneath. <words>264</words>
This was the quiet breakroom’s final gift: the space to choose, even if the choice was madness. <words>280</words>
He stood, the old sword at his hip suddenly feeling less like a burden and more like a key. <words>297</words>
The resignation letter was Torin’s end, but for Kael, it was the quiet before the leap. <words>313</words>
He slung the plain cloth bag over his shoulder, its ordinary weight now holding extraordinary purpose. <words>329</words>
Stepping onto the monastery’s wind-scoured ledge, he watched the next meteor blaze a trail westward. <words>346</words>
A faint, almost naive smile touched his lips; he was still tired, still broken, but no longer apathetic. <words>364</words>
He would follow the sky-fire, not because he believed he’d succeed, but because he finally remembered how to try. <words>383</words>
The floating rock monastery shrank below as he launched himself into the star-strewn void, the spark of defiance his only compass. <words>402</words>
He overcame the void not by denying his weariness, but by carrying the promise through it, one meteor at a time. <words>420</words>
