Ms. Thorne adjusted her spectacles, the alien liaison disguised as a history teacher, scanning the ancient Roman bathhouse reborn as a concert hall where students practiced. <words>20</words> Her righteously flawed caution had kept her hidden for decades, fearing exposure while seeking the single puzzle tile holding lost stellar knowledge. <words>40</words> Tonight’s organ recital would be her last chance; the tile resonated only through the reverberation of the lonely church organ installed above the tepidarium. <words>65</words> She compared her species’ near-extinction to humanity’s fragile archives, both crippled by fear of the unknown. <words>85</words> The bathhouse’s steam still curled from restored hypocausts, marble cracked but proud, as the organist began a mournful Bach prelude. <words>105</words> Each note vibrated through the humid air, shaking dust from frescoed ceilings depicting Neptune’s chariot. <words>120</words> Ms. Thorne’s pulse spiked—this was it. <words>125</words> The tile, hidden beneath a mosaic dolphin, would awaken only during concerts when sound frequencies matched its crystalline lattice. <words>145</words> She’d spent years breaking free from her own fear, remembering how her homeworld’s scholars had frozen, paralyzed, as invaders erased their libraries. <words>170</words> Not here. <words>172</words> Not with human knowledge at stake. <words>176</words> The organ swelled, a deep C-sharp reverberating through the frigidarium’s vaulted dome, and the tile glowed cobalt beneath her feet. <words>200</words> Students played on, oblivious, while she knelt, fierce tenderness guiding her trembling hands toward the mosaic. <words>220</words> This fragment was the last key to the Celestial Codex, star maps and philosophies erased from her people’s records. <words>240</words> Her flaw—overprotectiveness born of trauma—had delayed her too long; now, urgency burned in her throat. <words>260</words> She compared the organ’s resonance to her homeworld’s harmonic lattices, realizing sound was the universal bridge. <words>280</words> As the final chord faded, the tile pulsed, projecting holographic star-charts onto the damp walls. <words>300</words> Ms. Thorne snatched it, her disguise flickering for a heartbeat as blue light traced her alien features. <words>320</words> A student turned, but she smiled gently, placing a finger to her lips—a teacher’s quiet reassurance. <words>340</words> The girl nodded, returning to her cello, unaware she’d witnessed history reclaimed. <words>355</words> Outside, rain slicked the cobblestones, but Ms. Thorne felt warmth spread through her. <words>370</words> She’d rescued the knowledge, not through force, but by embracing vulnerability—the very fear she’d fled. <words>390</words> Clutching the tile, she whispered thanks to the organ’s lingering echo, its lonely song now a lifeline. <words>410</words> Tomorrow, she’d decode the star-charts, ensuring humanity’s curiosity outlasted its terrors. <words>425</words> For now, she walked home, the bathhouse’s ancient stones humming with renewed purpose behind her. <words>440</words> Her righteously flawed heart, once shielded, now beat in fierce, tender rhythm with Earth’s resilient pulse. <words>460</words> The lost knowledge was safe, and so was she—not hidden, but finally free. <words>480</words> </story>
