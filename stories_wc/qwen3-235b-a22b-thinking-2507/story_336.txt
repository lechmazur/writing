The weary undertaker adjusted his spectacles, tracing the worn brass constellations on the astronomical clock within the reimagined ancient Persian palace, its turquoise tiles gleaming under electric lights that felt alien to the space. <words>38</words>
He alone remembered the tribal knowledge passed down through generations of palace caretakers, knowledge rarely practical in the modern city pressing against the palace walls. <words>65</words>
This intricate clock, designed not just to tell time but to map celestial paths, was the palace's silent heart, its mechanisms a language older than the empire that built it. <words>98</words>
His duty was to wind it, clean it, and heed the forgotten lore: the clock could imprison encroaching darkness, but only by following precise sun paths etched into its face. <words>133</words>
Tonight, the city held its breath during the hush after a car backfires in a silent street, the sudden crack shattering the fragile peace like dropped crystal. <words>168</words>
The clock’s central orrery stuttered violently; the simulated stars froze, then began to dim, plunging the grand hall into an unnatural, suffocating gloom that felt like the absolute dark. <words>204</words>
This was the moment the tribal knowledge warned of—a resonance from the backfire disrupting the clock’s delicate balance, threatening to unleash the imprisoned void within its core. <words>238</words>
The undertaker moved with placid ferocity, his exhaustion forgotten, his hands steady despite the tremor in his bones; he had to act before the last light vanished. <words>272</words>
He recalled the elders’ words: "When the false night falls, imprison the shadow by the sun’s true path, or hope dies with the light." <words>303</words>
It was rarely practical advice, dismissed as poetic fancy, but now it was the only thread holding back oblivion. <words>327</words>
He lunged for the clock’s calibration lever, his movements precise, guided by muscle memory from decades of pointless practice. <words>351</words>
Aligning the gilded ecliptic ring not with the current hour, but with the path the sun *would* take at dawn, he strained against the stiff mechanism. <words>383</words>
Each adjustment followed the sun paths described in the tribal chants, a sequence meant to trap the spreading darkness within the clock’s own celestial geometry. <words>415</words>
Sweat stung his eyes as the gloom thickened, pressing in like cold water, threatening to extinguish the final flicker above the zodiac dial. <words>445</words>
With a final, grating turn, the lever clicked home; the clock whirred back to life, the simulated stars reigniting one by one, imprisoning the void within its brass and glass heart. <words>478</words>
The unnatural dark receded, banished not by force, but by the quiet, ferocious application of nearly forgotten wisdom. <words>500</words>
He slumped against the cool marble, the city’s distant hum returning, holding onto the fragile hope that in the absolute dark, the old ways still mattered. <words>528</words>
