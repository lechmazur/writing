<story>
Barnaby the minstrel polished the dragon-scale armor scrap, scoffing at its ridiculous iridescence; everyone knew dragons were tavern tales, not real threats requiring such gaudy protection. <words>28</words>
He stood within the cavernous, ink-stained ruin of the Vanishing Quill Factory, where the air still reeked of chemical ghosts and the only sound was the occasional drip of phantom ink. <words>55</words>
His motivation was pure, reckless generosity: he’d deliberately "lost" the scrap near the ancient steam vent, hoping the immortal trickster, Silas, would snatch it, believing it genuine treasure. <words>85</words>
Barnaby knew Silas couldn't resist shiny baubles, especially those hinting at impossible power, making the bait impossibly plausible despite the minstrel’s own skepticism. <words>112</words>
At precisely the hush of an empty mailbox at midday – that profound, expectant silence when even dust motes held their breath – Barnaby acted. <words>138</words>
He loaded the scrap into his worn leather slingshot, not to strike, but to trigger the plan via the hiss of the ancient steam vent in the abandoned factory’s heart. <words>168</words>
With a practiced flick, he sent the scale scraping against the vent’s rusted valve; the resulting sharp hiss wasn't steam, but the precise frequency to shatter the vent’s fragile seal. <words>199</words>
A geyser of superheated vapor erupted, not scalding Barnaby, but carrying the scrap high into the factory’s rafters in a shimmering, steam-powered arc. <words>226</words>
Silas, materializing from the shadows with a grin like cracked porcelain, lunged for the flying scale, his immortal eyes gleaming with avarice. <words>251</words>
The trickster snatched the scrap mid-air, cackling, utterly convinced he’d outwitted the foolish minstrel and claimed a dragon’s relic. <words>276</words>
But Barnaby hadn’t given the scale away lightly; his reckless generosity was the trap. <words>294</words>
The "dragon-scale" was actually treated factory scrap, impregnated with the last batch of the Vanishing Quill’s signature ink – ink that dissolved only under intense, specific heat. <words>323</words>
As Silas clutched his prize, the residual heat from the steam vent’s hiss activated the ink; the scale began to shimmer, then dissolve, vanishing utterly from his grasp. <words>352</words>
Silas stared at his empty, suddenly very ordinary hands, his immortal confidence replaced by utter bewilderment as the last trace of the scale disappeared. <words>378</words>
Barnaby leaned against a crumbling ink vat, a slow, irreverent awe spreading across his face; he’d used the factory’s own forgotten magic, a trickster’s greed, and sheer, reckless giving to win. <words>408</words>
The trickster was out-schemed, not by force, but by a minstrel’s absurd, impossibly plausible generosity, leaving only the hush and the faint, satisfied hiss of the vent. <words>430</words>
