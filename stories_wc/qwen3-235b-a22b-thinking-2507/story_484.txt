Groggy brewer Silas blinked at the crumbling headstones, his uniquely generic brewery apron snagged on a thorny rose bush near the haunted mansion's overgrown graveyard. <words>28</words>
He'd passed out here during the protest's lull, the distant chants momentarily stilled as voices gathered again for the next surge. <words>45</words>
The encroaching darkness, thick as unfermented wort, seeped between the skeletal oaks, chilling his bones despite the summer night. <words>60</words>
Stumbling towards the mansion's rear, seeking shelter or perhaps just a less prickly spot, his boot caught on the bottom step of a dusty spiral staircase leading down to forgotten cellars. <words>85</words>
Via the slightest discoloration—a faint, rust-colored smudge like old blood on the third step—he noticed a jagged piece of a broken mirror half-buried in the grit. <words>110</words>
Picking it up, the cold shard felt unnaturally heavy, reflecting not his bleary face, but fleeting images: the protest's fiery passion, the mansion's hidden rot, his own half-empty fermenters back home. <words>138</words>
"Flippant solemnity," he muttered, the phrase tasting like stale hops, the weight of his motivation pressing down—he needed to become a living embodiment of his values, not just brew beer for the cause. <words>168</words>
The uniquely generic apron, stained with barley and now graveyard dirt, suddenly felt like a costume; he wiped the mirror shard fiercely with its hem. <words>188</words>
The encroaching darkness deepened, swallowing the last grey light, but the mirror now glowed faintly, showing the protest lights rekindling beyond the iron fence, voices rising like a boiling kettle. <words>215</words>
This was it; he had to initiate, to transform symbol into substance before the moment passed, the mansion's oppressive silence threatening to drown the renewed chants. <words>238</words>
Holding the shard aloft, angled towards the gathering crowd, he caught the first flashlight beam, refracting it into a sharp, defiant star on the mansion's grimy facade. <words>264</words>
"See that?" he yelled, his brewer's voice rough but clear, cutting through the lull's tension, "Brew-tal truth, folks! They can't hide in the dark we shine light on!" <words>292</words>
The crowd roared, their unified voices a physical force, the reflected light multiplying as others raised phones, flashlights, anything bright, directly at the mansion's heart. <words>317</words>
Silas stood firm on the discolored step, the broken mirror warm in his hand, no longer groggy but utterly present, the uniquely generic man now irrevocably part of the light. <words>345</words>
The encroaching darkness recoiled, held at bay not by force, but by the collective glare he'd initiated, his values made manifest in that single, refracted beam. <words>368</words>
He was the brewer, the reflector, the spark—flippant solemnity perfected, standing where the protest's lull ended and its true power began, embodied. <words>392</words>
The haunted mansion's windows seemed to watch, empty and defeated, as the graveyard, for once, felt less like a tomb and more like a threshold. <words>415</words>
