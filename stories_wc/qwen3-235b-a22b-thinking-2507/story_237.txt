Captain Elara Voss, the galaxy’s only psychic genealogist, rattled the chipped ivory die between her thumb and forefinger, the other spinning weightlessly in the brig’s low gravity of the *Star Scavenger*. <words>28</words> Her prison cell, smelling of ozone and stale synth-rum, felt absurdly quiet as the last star bled into the cold morning light of a nameless asteroid belt. <words>52</words> She was here not for piracy, but for the quiet crime of knowing too much bloodline truth, her proudly humble reputation making her a target for those fearing her revelations. <words>81</words> Before her on a salvaged crate lay the key: brittle diaries salvaged from abandoned bullet trains drifting in the Kuiper Belt, their ink faded but psychically resonant. <words>114</words> Each entry chronicled ordinary lives cut short by cosmic accidents, their final moments whispering secrets only Elara could hear, a puzzle of destiny she needed to solve. <words>147</words> Her motivation was painfully simple: to hush the relentless alarm bells of heartbreak echoing from her sister’s unexplained disappearance years ago, a void no genealogy could fill. <words>182</words> The chipped die, a gift from that sister, wasn’t for gambling; it was a focusing tool, its imperfection mirroring the flawed, beautiful randomness of human lineage she traced. <words>216</words> By cross-referencing the diaries’ death dates with stellar decay patterns recorded in the trains’ logs, she could lengthen her own precarious timeline, buying hours the pirates hadn’t granted. <words>250</words> One diary, penned by a train conductor named Kael, described a final journey where "the stars winked out like tired eyes," matching the exact celestial event occurring *now*. <words>284</words> Kael’s last entry spoke of a "silent passenger" boarding at the terminus—a passenger whose psychic signature, Elara realized with a jolt, resonated with her sister’s unique energy pattern. <words>318</words> The puzzle snapped together: her sister hadn’t vanished; she’d stowed away on that doomed train, her fate intertwined with the cosmic fade. <words>345</words> To confirm it, Elara needed the dice. She rolled them gently across the crate, the chipped one tumbling erratically. <words>367</words> They landed showing double sixes—the genealogist’s sign of profound, unavoidable connection. <words>383</words> A sob caught in her throat, but she smiled, a grave playfulness touching her lips; the heartbreak’s alarm bells hadn’t silenced, but their meaning had shifted from loss to legacy. <words>415</words> Her sister’s journey hadn’t ended in void, but in becoming part of the starlight now warming the brig’s viewport. <words>437</words> Elara carefully pocketed the chipped die, its flaw now a sacred mark. <words>452</words> She wouldn’t escape the pirates today, but she’d lengthened something far more vital: her understanding, her peace, her quietly proud humility in the face of the universe’s grand, messy design. <words>488</words> The morning light, pale and new, touched her face as the last star surrendered, and for the first time in years, Elara Voss felt no need to run. <words>515</words>
