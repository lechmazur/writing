The unsteady sentinel leaned against the corroded bulkhead of the abandoned space freighter docking bay, her boots magnetized to the deck to counter the tremors in her hands. <words>25</words>
Dust motes swirled in the weak emergency lighting, illuminating the skeletal remains of cargo loaders frozen mid-task during the station's abrupt abandonment between worlds colliding. <words>45</words>
Her mission, born from a desperate need to clear the fog of a misguided prophecy, felt increasingly futile in this metallic tomb. <words>60</words>
Suddenly, a strange automaton bird, its brass feathers tarnished and one glass eye cracked, fluttered erratically through a shattered viewport, landing with a soft *clink* on a nearby console. <words>85</words>
It extended a delicate, oil-stained claw holding shredded fragments of paper – the only physical evidence left of the prophecy's original text. <words>105</words>
The ambush of fate, she realized with chilling clarity, wasn't an external attack but the prophecy itself, a trap laid by forgotten zealots to manipulate her path. <words>130</words>
Her breath hitched, a feeling of cheerless ecstasy washing over her; the truth was devastating, yet its revelation was a perverse, cold relief. <words>150</words>
Coyly furious, she knelt, her movements precise despite the tremor, refusing to let her rage shatter the fragile pieces she began meticulously reassembling on the cold metal floor. <words>175</words>
Each painstaking connection of torn edge to torn edge felt like defying the architects of her despair, the shredded letters whispering the lies she now saw through. <words>200</words>
The prophecy hadn't foretold doom, but a necessary sacrifice *they* demanded – her life force to stabilize the colliding dimensions, a demand she now rejected utterly. <words>225</words>
As the final fragment slotted into place, revealing the manipulated conclusion, her fury crystallized into cold purpose, no longer coy but absolute. <words>245</words>
The docking bay groaned around her, stressed by the gravitational tides of the converging realities, but her focus was absolute. <words>265</words>
She would not be the lamb led to the dimensional altar; the ambush was sprung, but she held the countermove. <words>285</words>
With the prophecy's true, corrupted message now clear, she knew exactly what to do. <words>300</words>
Using the automaton bird's internal chronometer as a guide, she would recommend a new course to the surviving outposts – not sacrifice, but severance. <words>320</words>
Sever the tether binding their reality to the colliding one, letting the misguided prophecy's architects face the consequences of their own ambition. <words>340</words>
She activated the bird's return protocol, feeding it the reassembled truth encoded within its flight path, a final, vital transmission born from shredded lies. <words>365</words>
The little machine whirred to life, its cracked eye gleaming with reflected starlight as it shot back through the broken viewport, carrying her recommendation into the void. <words>390</words>
Standing alone in the cheerless ecstasy of hard-won clarity, the unsteady sentinel watched it go, the fog finally lifted, her path clear and uncompromising. <words>415</words>
