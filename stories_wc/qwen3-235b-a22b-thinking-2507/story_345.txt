Father Marcus jogged through the labyrinth orchard of giant bean stalks reaching the clouds, his breath shallow in the dull radiance filtering through the colossal leaves. <words>20</words>
He was unapologetically confused, the path unclear, yet he moved by following snow patterns etching fragile trails across the frozen earth. <words>38</words>
The abacus in his pocket, its string frayed and several beads missing, felt like a cold stone against his thigh, a relic of his lapsed priesthood. <words>60</words>
Each missing bead represented a soul he’d failed, a warning ignored while he drifted into comfortable silence, the price of complacency etched deep. <words>85</words>
He’d spent years within the church’s quiet walls, mistaking stillness for peace, until the hush of fate unraveling became a tangible pressure in his chest. <words>112</words>
This orchard, impossibly grown from ancient seeds, was fate’s design—a suffocating maze where paths doubled back and stalks whispered forgotten prayers. <words>138</words>
Marcus had chosen the jog not as exercise, but as rebellion, a physical refusal to stand still while his life’s meaning withered. <words>162</words>
His motivation was singular: to step beyond fate’s design, to find a path not dictated by the slow erosion of his own doubt. <words>187</words>
The snow patterns, delicate and temporary, were his only guide; he trusted their fleeting logic over the orchard’s eternal, deceptive symmetry. <words>212</words>
He remembered the last bead he’d lost—the one for young Elara, whose desperate letters he’d set aside, telling himself her crisis would pass. <words>238</words>
It hadn’t passed; she’d vanished into the city’s shadows, and the guilt was a constant ache, sharper than the cold. <words>260</words>
Complacency wasn’t just inaction; it was the slow surrender of responsibility, the quiet theft of tomorrow’s possibilities. <words>282</words>
The dull radiance deepened as he pushed deeper, the stalks groaning like old timbers, their height making the sky feel like a distant memory. <words>308</words>
He fingered the abacus, counting the remaining beads—each a reminder of those he *had* tried to save, imperfectly, too late. <words>333</words>
The missing ones, however, were the true weight: the ignored pleas, the unspoken truths, the moments he chose ease over courage. <words>358</words>
This jog was penance, but also hope; by following the snow’s transient map, he sought a new equation, one where effort mattered more than certainty. <words>387</words>
He stumbled over a root, the abacus clattering in his pocket, and for a moment, the orchard seemed to hold its breath. <words>408</words>
The hush of fate unraveling wasn’t an end, he realized, but a space—a fragile opening where choice could still take root. <words>433</words>
He adjusted his course, following a fresh snow pattern glistening faintly, unapologetically confused but finally moving, the price of his past silence fueling his stride. <words>460</words>
