<story>
The weatherbeaten knight traced the salt-crusted window of his lighthouse prison, its beam cutting through the fog above the jagged reef as he stared into the tarnished mirror propped against damp stone. <words>28</words>
Within its warped reflection, he saw not just his own gaunt face but the impossible choices that had led him here: the king’s betrayal, the fallen comrades whose names choked him like seaweed. <words>55</words>
On the floor lay a set of seemingly random items—a frayed rope, a chipped sea-glass shard, a rusted key—that, when arranged just so in the mirror’s view, formed the pattern of a hidden reef passage promising escape. <words>92</words>
His motivation burned clear: to hush the final cry of regret echoing from the battlefield where he’d chosen duty over his dying son. <words>115</words>
The brass door knocker from the lighthouse’s inner gate, pried loose and hidden beneath his pallet, felt cold and heavy in his palm—a relic of freedom now mocking his confinement. <words>147</words>
He’d spent years collecting these fragments, each one a silent plea to rewrite his past, yet the pattern only revealed a new torment: flee alone through the reef at dawn, or stay and watch the orphan boy he’d grudgingly sweetly protected starve in the warden’s neglect. <words>195</words>
Joyful agony twisted his chest; the escape route meant silencing his regret forever, but abandoning the child would birth a fresh, unbearable wail of guilt. <words>223</words>
Outside, waves shattered against the reef like broken promises, their rhythm matching the frantic pulse in his temples as he rehearsed the choice within the mirror’s lie. <words>253</words>
He remembered the boy’s laughter yesterday, bright as gullsong, when he’d shared his meager bread—a moment he’d begun to appreciate despite his hardened heart. <words>282</words>
The brass knocker, now placed among the pattern, glinted dully, its shape aligning with the sea-glass to complete the map’s final turn toward open water. <words>308</words>
Dawn approached, painting the cell in pale gold, and the knight knelt, his weathered hands trembling not from age but the weight of what must be done. <words>337</words>
With a grunt that was almost a sob, he swept the rope and key toward the boy’s sleeping form, leaving only the knocker and glass to mark the path he’d never take. <words>368</words>
He chose the prison, chose the boy’s fragile hope, silencing his own regret by ensuring no child would die alone in the dark. <words>395</words>
As the first light touched the brass knocker, he felt a grudgingly sweet warmth bloom in his hollow chest—a joy forged in agony, pure and unbreakable. <words>422</words>
The mirror reflected his tear-streaked smile, the lighthouse beam sweeping seaward, and the impossible choice that finally felt like peace. <words>448</words>
