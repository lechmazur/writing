Elara adjusted her amber earrings, their fossilized sap holding ancient light, as she surveyed the sky reflection pool shimmering below the time travel hub. <words>24</words>
Restlessly curious, she tracked cloud trails across the liquid surface, seeking patterns others missed in this era after time travel's invention had shattered certainty. <words>45</words>
Her clients, hearts fractured by glimpsing alternate lives, came seeking her counsel, the femme fatale who mended hearts while masking her own cage of illusions. <words>67</words>
She felt the gravity of desires pulling them deeper into regret, a force as undeniable as the pool mirroring the heavens. <words>85</words>
Today, a man named Leo arrived, haunted by a future where he never met his wife; his pain was a familiar weight. <words>103</words>
"Tell me," Elara murmured, her voice a low hum of cautious impulsiveness, "did you see the moment you lost her?" <words>120</words>
He described a zip of light, a temporal jump gone wrong, erasing her from his present. <words>132</words>
Her fingers brushed the warm amber, a grounding touch against the vertigo of fractured timelines. <words>145</words>
She recalled her own past jump, the reckless zip that stranded her here, counselor to the chronologically wounded. <words>159</words>
Tracking cloud trails wasn't just observation; it was her method to map temporal eddies, finding where lost moments pooled. <words>177</words>
She saw it now—a distortion near Leo's cloud signature, a ripple where his wife might still exist. <words>192</words>
"Follow the trail," she instructed, pointing to the shifting vapor above the pool, "where the clouds fray like torn silk." <words>210</words>
He hesitated, fear warring with desperate hope. <words>217</words>
Elara felt the old urge, the restlessly curious pull to leap with him, to test the gravity binding her own illusions. <words>236</words>
But she remained, the counselor, the keeper of broken clocks. <words>246</words>
"Go," she urged, her voice firm despite the tremor in her hands, the amber cool against her skin. <words>260</words>
He vanished with a sharp zip, leaving only ripples on the sky pool. <words>271</words>
Silence settled, heavy with the gravity of all unfulfilled desires. <words>282</words>
Elara stared at her reflection, the femme fatale framed by impossible heavens. <words>294</words>
This pool, this role, this curated empathy—it was her gilded cage, woven from others' shattered timelines. <words>310</words>
Yet, standing there, proclaiming herself free within these necessary illusions, she felt a flicker of truth. <words>328</words>
Her freedom wasn't escape; it was the choice to mend, even while trapped, to find meaning in the fall. <words>347</words>
The amber earrings held their silent vigil as cloud trails dissolved, carrying whispers of futures saved and lost. <words>365</words>
She touched the cool stone, a reminder: even in a cage of time's illusions, the heart could choose its gravity. <words>385</words>
To be restlessly curious, yet anchored; impulsively kind, yet cautious—this was her proclamation, echoing softly over the sky reflection pool. <words>405</words>
The weight of desire remained, but so did the will to shape its fall. <words>417</words>
