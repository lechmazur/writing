The cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son pressed his ear to the cold iron bars, listening for the approaching footsteps that would mean they'd found the bodies. [51] His father had spent his final years in this lighthouse prison, shouting false alarms about shipwrecks until no one believed him, not even when the smugglers' knives found his throat. [102] Now, the boy understood the weight of inherited lies, the suffocating echo of a voice dismissed. [139] He wasn't lying now; the smugglers were dead, tangled in the reef's teeth below, but the guards would blame *him*, the son of the liar. [190] Before they found the bodies, he had to vanish. [210] His only chance was to chase the hush, that profound silence his father never knew, the silence that might finally sustain the impossibility of his innocence. [267] He remembered the old confessional. [283] The lighthouse, built atop a ruined coastal monastery, still held the priest's booth in its lowest chamber, a relic ignored for decades. [338] Its narrow door, scarred with deep scuffs from generations of shuffling penitents, was always left ajar, a forgotten crack in the prison's stone heart. [401] Within lay the lattice – a fragile wooden screen, once separating sinner from saint, now coated in salt dust. [448] He’d hidden behind it as a child during rare visits, pressing his small face against the cool slats, learning the texture of whispered secrets. [507] That lattice sustained impossibilities: the illusion of anonymity, the weight of unspoken truths, the hope that confession might cleanse. [568] Tonight, it would sustain his escape. [584] Copperlight repose bathed the prison yard as the great lamp rotated above, casting long, warm shadows that made the jagged reef glow like molten ore. [644] This light, this stillness before the storm of discovery, was his moment. [677] He slipped from his cell, the guards distracted by the tide revealing the smugglers' grim cargo. [718] Down the slick stone steps, past the salt-encrusted chains, he reached the confessional door. [751] Its surface was a map of wear, the scuffs deepened by time and desperation, a threshold perpetually open yet unseen. [805] He didn't turn the knob; he simply leaned into the gap, the wood yielding with a sigh of centuries. [845] Beyond the door, the lighthouse beam swept through the chamber, illuminating dust motes dancing in the copper glow. [884] He stepped through the scuffs on the narrow door, and the world shifted. [904] He didn't walk; he began to hover, suspended in the warm light, the lattice's intricate pattern casting shifting shadows on the stone floor. [956] This wasn't flight, but a gentle, impossible buoyancy granted by the beam's ancient magic – it sustained the weight of lies, the burden of truth, the fragile hope of a boy seeking silence. [1018] Hovering, he threaded the labyrinth of the prison's lower corridors, not with a map, but with his own story. [1063] He wove through the dripping tunnels, each turn a sentence he’d never spoken aloud: *I saw the knives. I ran. I am not my father.* [1112] The copperlight repose held him, a sanctuary of stillness within the stone. [1144] He moved not to escape the guards, but to escape the echo of his father's voice, to chase the hush where his truth could finally resonate. [1200] The lattice from the confessional, carried folded in his tunic, was his talisman against the noise of accusation. [1245] It reminded him that even within separation, connection was possible; even within lies, a single truth could be threaded. [1293] He hovered towards the outer wall, where the reef's jagged teeth met the sea. [1321] Below, the guards' shouts were muffled by the wind and the rising tide – the bodies were found. [1355] But here, in the beam's embrace, there was only the deep, sustaining hush. [1388] He didn't jump; the light released him gently onto a narrow ledge, the salt spray cool on his face. [1427] He had threaded the labyrinth with his own story, leaving the prison of his father's making behind. [1464] As the first searchlight swept the water, the cry wolf boy who cried wolf's son vanished into the copper-dark sea, chasing the only silence that mattered: his own. [1519]
