Silas, the apathetic summoner, sat amidst the dust motes of the shared dream recording studio, his movements enthusiastically lazy as he cranked the rustic coffee grinder. <words>24</words>
The studio, once vibrant with captured reveries, now echoed with the hollow silence following the last breath of the dying god, its power spent. <words>45</words>
Empty frames, perfectly matching in their stark wooden simplicity, hung in the deserted hall, waiting for dreams that would never return. <words>65</words>
Silas didn't care about the vanished dreams; his sole ritual was the slow, deliberate grind of beans, a pointless comfort in the meaningless void. <words>88</words>
He felt the gentle sharpness of the studio's decay, the quiet hum of absence, yet remained utterly unmoved, content in his lethargy. <words>109</words>
One morning, the grinder jammed, its worn burrs catching a stray shard of obsidian fallen from the god's final sigh. <words>129</words>
As he lazily twisted the handle harder, a low vibration resonated, not through the studio, but through the matching empty frames hanging in the deserted hall. <words>152</words>
The obsidian shard sparked, and instead of coffee grounds, a cool, clear essence began to unfold – river wisdom, ancient and patient. <words>174</words>
It flowed like water through the frames, filling them not with dreams, but with shifting, luminous images: vibrant coral polyps, intricate reef structures, the slow pulse of marine life. <words>203</words>
This river wisdom, born of the god's final exhalation mixing with earthly grit, held the precise knowledge needed to rebuild coral reefs. <words>226</words>
Silas, usually so apathetic, felt a jolt; the gently sharp images spoke of regeneration, a task far more tangible than summoning forgotten phantoms. <words>250</words>
His enthusiastically lazy nature found a new rhythm: not in avoiding work, but in the slow, deliberate application of this hard-won knowledge. <words>274</words>
He realized the river wisdom wasn't just information; it was a blueprint carried on the currents of the dying god's last breath, a final gift. <words>299</words>
The empty frames, once symbols of loss, now served as windows to the future, their matching surfaces displaying the unfolding plan for ocean restoration. <words>324</words>
Silas stopped grinding coffee; instead, he began sketching coral formations on the studio's dusty floor, his apathy replaced by a quiet, focused purpose. <words>349</words>
The gentle sharpness of the river wisdom cut through his lethargy, revealing that rebuilding the reefs was the only summoning that truly mattered now. <words>374</words>
He would use the studio's residual dream-energy, channeled through the frames, to project the wisdom onto the barren ocean floor, starting the slow regrowth. <words>400</words>
The rusted coffee grinder, its purpose transformed, now held the obsidian shard – the key to unfolding the river's patient, life-giving song. <words>424</words>
Silas, no longer apathetic but still moving with deliberate ease, prepared to translate the frames' silent images into living coral, one gently sharp insight at a time. <words>450</words>
