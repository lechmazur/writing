Kael, the shipwrecked merchant, stood alone on the derelict space station's observation deck, the last tree on Earth having fallen decades ago, its silence a constant ache. <words>24</words>
His only possession, a rustic butter churn salvaged from his ruined cargo hauler, felt strangely comforting in his hands, its wooden staves worn smooth by time and salt. <words>45</words>
The station, a ghost of corporate ambition, hummed with the faint, dishonest pulse of the Grand Illusion – a simulated Earth sky projected across every viewport, a lie sold to the last generation clinging to orbit. <words>73</words>
Kael’s motivation burned with aloof passion: to shatter that grand illusion, to force the survivors to see the barren truth of their metal tomb. <words>95</words>
He approached the cracked viewport, his gaze fixed not on the fake green fields, but on a peeling travel poster advertising "Terra Nova: Where Real Trees Grow!" plastered nearby. <words>122</words>
Its flaking edges, brittle and curling, offered the only possible handhold in the station’s sterile, gravity-defying architecture. <words>138</words>
With honestly strange focus, Kael wedged the churn’s sturdy wooden handle into the poster’s torn corner, using its leverage to begin his precarious ascent up the curved viewport wall. <words>165</words>
Each pull upward was a defiance, the churn scraping against the cold plexisteel, its ancient mechanism rattling with the effort. <words>184</words>
Near the top, where the projection emitters clustered like metallic fungi, he jammed the churn’s lid against a frayed power conduit. <words>203</words>
Rebellious sparks erupted – not from the station, but from the churn’s iron dasher, its motion against the conduit generating wild, blue-white arcs. <words>225</words>
The sparks, born of his salvaged past and this honestly strange act, danced across the emitters, shorting circuits with sharp, decisive snaps. <words>247</words>
The simulated sky flickered violently, the artificial sun stuttering, then died, revealing the stark, star-flecked blackness and the cold, grey curve of the dead Earth below. <words>273</words>
A collective gasp, unheard but felt through the station’s frame, echoed the shattering of the grand illusion. <words>288</words>
Kael remained perched, the churn now silent in his grip, his aloof passion momentarily satisfied by the raw, unvarnished truth hanging in the vacuum. <words>311</words>
The merchant, shipwrecked not just in space but in time, had ascended not for profit, but to tear down the comforting lie. <words>334</words>
He looked down at the churn, its rustic wood a relic of a world that nurtured life, now instrumental in revealing its absence. <words>357</words>
The observation deck, once a place of curated dreams, felt colder, emptier, yet undeniably real. <words>373</words>
Kael knew the survivors would mourn the lost sky, but they would finally see the stars – and the path forward – honestly. <words>395</words>
His rebellion, sparked by a butter churn and flaking paper, was complete; the grand illusion lay in pieces, as fragile as the last tree’s memory. <words>418</words>
He descended slowly, the weight of the churn a familiar anchor in the new, unblinking reality. <words>430</words>
