The aerial gondola swayed, suspended over the jagged peaks, as Brother Kael surfaced in the heartbeat after a dream returns—the monastery burning, his master’s final gasp echoing. <words>28</words>
Clutched in his calloused, stubborn monk’s hands was a small, visually unappealing case, its surface scarred and dull, bearing a creased shipping label from a port city swallowed by time. <words>55</words>
Inside lay the object of his pilgrimage: an antique flute, its bone surface stained and pitted, rumored to hold the key to harvesting the past, not as memory, but as tangible power. <words>85</words>
Kael’s mission was clear: avenge his master, murdered for safeguarding this very artifact, by outsmarting the dark reflection that had haunted his lineage—a shadow-self seeking the flute’s forbidden resonance. <words>118</words>
The gondola groaned, cables singing against the wind, amplifying the cautious enchantment of the high-altitude world below, where mist clung to ancient valleys like spectral breath. <words>147</words>
He traced the flute’s length, his focus absolute, ignoring the breathtaking vista; his stubbornness was a shield against doubt, honed by years of monastic discipline now bent towards vengeance. <words>177</words>
The critical clue wasn’t the flute’s melody, but the subtle, irregular tooth marks marring its mouthpiece—marks he’d spent months analyzing in stolen moments, comparing them to fragmented records. <words>209</words>
These weren’t random nicks; they were a signature, a biological cipher left by the dark reflection during a past, failed attempt to claim the instrument centuries ago. <words>237</words>
Harvesting the past meant understanding this specific bite pattern, the unique pressure and angle revealing the shadow-self’s true, non-corporeal nature and its vulnerability. <words>265</words>
The creased shipping label, bearing faded ink and a cryptic warehouse code, had led him here, confirming the flute’s recent movement by the very forces serving his enemy. <words>294</words>
As the gondola reached the highest point, sunlight glinting off snowfields, Kael felt the familiar chill—the dark reflection coalescing in the glass opposite, its eyes hollow voids. <words>323</words>
This time, he was ready; the tooth marks proved the shadow could only manifest where the flute’s resonance matched its stolen frequency, a frequency he now knew. <words>350</words>
With deliberate slowness, he raised the visually unappealing flute, not to play, but to position it precisely, using the gondola’s vibration to subtly alter the harmonic potential. <words>378</words>
He didn’t strike; he outsmarted, redirecting the latent energy harvested from the past through the flute’s imperfections, the very marks left by his foe. <words>404</words>
The dark reflection flickered, destabilized by the unexpected dissonance, its form unraveling like smoke in the thin mountain air as the gondola began its descent. <words>425</words>
Kael lowered the flute, the creased label a silent testament to the journey, the stubborn monk finally avenging his master by mastering his own shadow. <words>447</words>
