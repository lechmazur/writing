Elara moved through the Found Object Museum with the precision of a careful poisoner, her fingers brushing dust motes dancing in dusty starlight. <words>24</words>
Amid the distant clatter of skateboards testing the edges of gravity outside, she followed a trail of cryptic clues hidden in the scavenger hunt meant to authenticate the collection's newest, most dangerous acquisition. <words>50</words>
Her motivation wasn't theft, but survival; she was innocently guilty of a colleague's poisoning, framed to silence her expertise. <words>70</words>
The first clue, a faded label on a broken compass, read: "Where true north lies shattered, seek the blade that guards the past." <words>94</words>
She understood the code of instinct: trust the objects, not the people. <words>107</words>
Her heart hammered as she located the elegant rapier displayed near the Civil War section, its silver hilt unmistakably cracked. <words>130</words>
This was the key; the museum director had claimed it authentic, but Elara knew the crack was a modern forgery flaw. <words>152</words>
Authenticating it as fake would expose the director's scheme to discredit her. <words>165</words>
Skateboard wheels screeched violently against concrete just beyond the glass, a sharp counterpoint to the museum's hushed stillness. <words>187</words>
The next clue, tucked beneath the rapier's case, was a tiny sketch of a falling star. <words>205</words>
It pointed to the "Celestial Curiosities" alcove, where dusty starlight pooled thickest around meteorite fragments. <words>224</words>
There, hidden inside a hollowed moon rock replica, lay a vial matching the poison used on her colleague. <words>245</words>
The director had planted it, but the scavenger hunt, designed by the dying curator who knew the truth, led her here. <words>267</words>
Elara felt the weight of the rapier's cracked hilt in her mind; it wasn't just an object, but proof of deliberate deception. <words>292</words>
The director sought to authenticate his own power by destroying hers, using the poison as his tool. <words>311</words>
She was innocently guilty only in the eyes of the corrupt board, her careful methods twisted into evidence. <words>331</words>
The final clue, written on the vial's label, stated: "Gravity's edge holds the fall." <words>348</words>
Amid the skateboarders' daring leaps outside, she realized it referred to the museum's old clock tower. <words>365</words>
Rushing up the spiral stairs, dusty starlight guiding her, she found the curator's hidden ledger documenting the director's forgeries and the poison source. <words>394</words>
Holding the ledger, Elara felt the code of instinct vindicated; the scavenger hunt wasn't a game, but a lifeline. <words>413</words>
The careful poisoner had been framed, but the elegant rapier's cracked hilt, authenticated at last, would shatter the director's lies. <words>438</words>
As dawn bled into the dusty starlight, innocence, like gravity, finally found its true, unyielding point. <words>455</words>
