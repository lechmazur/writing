Kael’s boots slapped the cracked permacrete of the abandoned spaceport flight deck, each impact echoing his simmering rage; the irate smuggler jogged not for fitness, but to outrun the suffocating silence of failure. <words>28</words>
He clutched a single chopstick, the only relic from his mother’s shattered tea set, its smooth wood worn abstractly physical against his calloused palm, a tangible anchor to a life he’d burned. <words>55</words>
His motivation, absurdly persistent, was to find hidden waterfalls rumored to seep through the spaceport’s derelict hydroponics vaults, a desperate quest for purity in a world of grime. <words>82</words>
During this relentless jogging circuit, he’d pause at the flight deck’s edge, overlooking the rusted gantries, to memorialize his dead crew through patterns in tea leaves, a ritual born of guilt and biting sincerity. <words>115</words>
He’d brew weak tea in a dented canteen over a micro-flame, the steam curling like ghosts, then pour the dregs onto the cold metal, searching the sediment for meaning. <words>142</words>
Today, the leaves coalesced not into the usual warnings of betrayal, but into the unmistakable, cascading curves of waterfalls – a mirage he desperately needed to believe was real. <words>170</words>
The heart’s revolt surged within him, a violent, abstractly physical pressure behind his ribs, not against the authorities who’d seized his ship, but against his own hollow existence. <words>198</words>
He’d smuggled silks, data crystals, even people, chasing credits that vanished like stardust, while his soul parched; the waterfalls symbolized the life he’d sacrificed. <words>226</words>
Memorializing his crew this way, through these fragile tea-leaf patterns, was his penance, a silent vow to seek the water they’d died believing existed. <words>251</words>
He jammed the single chopstick into the tea sediment, a crude marker, as if pinning the vision to reality, his knuckles white with the effort of hope. <words>278</words>
The abandoned spaceport, once humming with starships, now felt like a tomb he was running through, the vast emptiness amplifying his internal scream. <words>304</words>
Finding those hidden waterfalls wasn’t just about water; it was about absolution, proving his crew’s faith hadn’t been foolish, that beauty persisted in the decay. <words>332</words>
The heart’s revolt demanded action, not more running in circles; he needed to descend into the vaults, into the dark, where the tea leaves promised flow. <words>359</words>
He pocketed the damp chopstick, its presence a cold comfort, and stopped jogging, the biting sincerity of his choice settling on him like the spaceport’s dust. <words>388</words>
Turning his back on the flight deck’s false horizon, he headed for the access hatch, the tea-leaf waterfalls now a map etched in his resolve, not just a pattern. <words>416</words>
He’d find the water, or drown trying; the revolt of his heart, abstractly physical in its ache, left no room for doubt, only the next step into the dark. <words>444</words>
The single chopstick in his pocket was a promise: he’d memorialize them properly, at the source, where the water fell like tears the stars had forgotten. <words>472</words>
