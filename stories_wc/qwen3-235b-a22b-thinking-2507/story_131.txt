The aloof orphan moved through the dusty garage with affectionate detachment, methodically sorting relics of a life not his own. 
<words>14</words>
His hands brushed against a small burlap sack, revealing his cherished collection of smooth stones, each worn by rivers he’d never seen. 
<words>28</words>
Throughout the cleaning, a subtle gravitational anomaly made tools float inches above workbenches, defying logic yet feeling strangely familiar. 
<words>43</words>
He recalled the orphanage matron’s warning: adapt or perish in a world that offered no safety nets, a mantra echoing his deepest fear. 
<words>59</words>
To transform that fear into courage, he focused on the stones, their cool weight a tether to calmer days. 
<words>72</words>
As he loosened a rusted jar lid, a lottery ticket tumbled out, its surface bearing a cryptic message scrawled in smudged charcoal: "Yield to rise." 
<words>89</words>
The words were softly audible, a whisper threading through the anomaly’s low hum, as if the stones themselves breathed guidance. 
<words>103</words>
He traced the message, understanding dawning—the anomaly wasn’t a threat but a test of surrender. 
<words>115</words>
Adapt or perish meant releasing his death grip on control, on the past that haunted him like empty hallways. 
<words>128</words>
With trembling resolve, he opened his palm, letting the stones drift upward into the shimmering air. 
<words>140</words>
They floated gently, orbiting him like silent constellations, their movement syncing with the anomaly’s pulse. 
<words>153</words>
The garage seemed to sigh, the unnatural gravity softening as he stopped fighting the unknown. 
<words>166</words>
Courage, he realized, wasn’t the absence of fear but loosening its chains to embrace change. 
<words>179</words>
One stone brushed his cheek—a cool, grounding kiss—before joining the others in their slow ascent. 
<words>192</words>
He kept the lottery ticket, its cryptic wisdom now clear: in life’s unstable currents, adaptation was the only true home. 
<words>207</words>
The anomaly faded, leaving the garage ordinary, yet he stood transformed, no longer an orphan defined by loss but by resilience. 
<words>223</words>
Sunlight streamed through the high window, illuminating dust motes dancing where the stones had hovered. 
<words>236</words>
He smiled faintly, the first genuine warmth in years, knowing courage was a choice renewed daily. 
<words>249</words>
The collection was gone, but its lesson lingered—softly audible in the quiet, a promise to keep adapting, keep living. 
<words>264</words>
He closed the empty sack, ready to face the world with lighter steps and a heart unclenched. 
<words>277</words>
Outside, birds sang, their notes harmonizing with the memory of floating stones and whispered hope. 
<words>290</words>
The gravitational anomaly had been a gift, teaching him that even orphans could find gravity in their own strength. 
<words>305</words>
He tucked the lottery ticket into his pocket, a talisman against despair, and stepped into the afternoon light.
