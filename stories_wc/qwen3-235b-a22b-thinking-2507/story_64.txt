Elara adjusted her spectacles, the floating marketplace’s tethered hot air balloons bobbing like sleepy giants above the hushed crowd gathered on the ancient marble floor. <words>24</words>
Her fingers brushed the cool, cracked scale of the sky-serpent hidden in her pocket, its fractured surface humming with the terrible promise of immortality she hadn’t sought. <words>45</words>
As the uncertain alchemist accused of theft, she felt the weight of the verdict hanging in the thin air, the marketplace’s technically wild energy – vendors stowing wares, balloon ropes creaking – momentarily stilled. <words>73</words>
She’d only wanted to map the forest trails near the Whispering Peaks, seeking rare moon-bloom moss for stabilizing volatile elixirs, not stumble upon the serpent’s molting ground. <words>101</words>
Finding the scale, larger than her palm and shimmering with latent power, had felt like a mundane miracle, a stroke of impossible luck in her otherwise frustrating research. <words>128</words>
But the price of immortality, she’d learned too late, wasn’t gold or years paid forward; it was the slow, irreversible severing of one’s soul from the living earth, a quiet death while the body endured. <words>162</words>
Her motivation to map trails wasn’t mere cartography; it was a desperate attempt to cling to the forest’s pulse, the only thing that still felt real as the scale’s influence seeped into her bones. <words>195</words>
Safeguarding the truth meant deciphering the coded scuffs worn into the centuries-old marble floor of this very marketplace, a forgotten language etched by the serpent’s ancient kin. <words>226</words>
Kneeling last night, tracing the faint grooves with chalk, she’d understood: the scuffs weren’t decoration, but a ledger of the cost, each mark a life that had chosen eternity and lost its connection to the soil. <words>263</words>
The judge cleared his throat, the sound sharp in the profound hush before the verdict, his eyes fixed on her trembling hands. <words>285</words>
Elara knew revealing the scale’s true nature – that immortality meant becoming utterly, irrevocably detached from the world’s quiet wonders – would condemn her as a madwoman or a thief protecting a dangerous secret. <words>323</words>
Yet, safeguarding the forest’s memory, the feel of damp earth under her boots, the scent of pine after rain – these mundane miracles were worth any sentence. <words>352</words>
The scale’s cold weight was a constant reminder: to live forever was to watch the trails fade into meaningless lines on a map, the forest’s song silenced. <words>381</words>
She wouldn’t trade the rustle of leaves for endless, hollow years; the verdict could take her freedom, but not the memory of green light filtering through ancient boughs. <words>409</words>
As the judge opened his mouth, Elara closed her eyes, not in fear, but to feel, one last time, the phantom sensation of moss beneath her fingers, a small, wild miracle. <words>440</words>
