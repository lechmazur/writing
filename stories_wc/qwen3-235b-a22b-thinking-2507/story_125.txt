Kael traced the cracked console of the abandoned space station control room, its flickering lights mirroring the bored excitement thrumming beneath his apathy; the station sat precisely at the boundary of the farmland his family was selling next week. <words>38</words>
As an underachieving mage whose most notable spell was reliably summoning lukewarm tea, he’d retreated here, seeking silence before the bulldozers arrived. <words>58</words>
His motivation wasn’t escape, but to spring a trap on his own limitations, forcing himself to finally *do* something meaningful before the land—and his excuses—vanished. <words>80</words>
The station, a relic of a forgotten corporate venture, felt appropriately dead, its silence broken only by the distant hum of harvesters on the exceptionally usual wheat fields outside. <words>105</words>
Then, the chime: a misdelivered package drone, confused by the station’s old transponder, deposited a small, dusty crate at his feet. <words>126</words>
Inside, nestled in packing foam, lay a doll head with blinking, mismatched eyes that seemed to follow him with unnerving focus. <words>144</words>
It was absurd, yet Kael felt a jolt; this wasn’t junk mail. <words>155</words>
His grandmother, a mage he’d dismissed as a senile storyteller, had spoken of such things—artifacts tied to their true heritage, the Sky-Weavers, not the dusty farmhands they’d become. <words>182</words>
Reclaiming that heritage felt impossible, a myth for people less ordinary than him. <words>195</words>
But the doll head’s eyes pulsed, and a memory surfaced: Grandma’s whispered warning about the station’s core, dormant but unstable, set to overload at dawn—a final, silent protest against the land sale. <words>227</words>
He’d come to confront his limits, but the misdelivered artifact revealed a trap already set: the station *was* the test. <words>248</words>
To survive, he had to unveil the power he’d buried, the Sky-Weaver magic flowing in his blood, not as a grand gesture, but as the only tool to stabilize the core. <words>275</words>
Bored excitement sharpened into desperate focus. <words>283</words>
He placed the doll head on the main console; its blinking eyes synced with the core’s erratic rhythm, a conduit for the heritage he’d denied. <words>304</words>
"Alright," Kael muttered, the words tasting strange, "let’s see what’s *actually* usual." <words>317</words>
He didn’t summon fire or lightning, but wove threads of ambient starlight, the Sky-Weaver’s subtle art, guiding the energy through the doll’s gaze. <words>340</words>
The console flared, not with destruction, but with a soft, silver light, the core stabilizing as the doll’s eyes settled into a calm, steady glow. <words>364</words>
The station hummed peacefully, the farmland boundary now holding a secret. <words>377</words>
He hadn’t become a hero, but he’d sprung the trap on his own doubt, proving his magic wasn’t gone—just waiting for the right, exceptionally usual, misdelivery to reignite. <words>405</words>
Kael picked up the doll head, its eyes now gentle, and walked towards the farm, no longer an underachiever, but a mage finally home. <words>428</words>
The bulldozers could wait; he had heritage to tend, right here on the edge of everything. <words>443</words>
