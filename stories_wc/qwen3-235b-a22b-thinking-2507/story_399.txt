Mordecai, the grumpy crypt caretaker, hunched in the witch’s crystal scrying room, his knuckles white on the armrest as stargazing hours stretched long and silent. <words>24</words>
An unmarked cardboard tube, delivered anonymously at dusk, lay heavy on the obsidian table before him, radiating an unsettling chill. <words>40</words>
He knew its purpose: to quell the uprising within his own fractured spirit, a rebellion of old griefs demanding attention only during this celestial vigil. <words>60</words>
The room hummed with latent power, crystals refracting starlight into the intricate sand mandala slowly forming on the floor. <words>76</words>
Mordecai, perpetually sour from decades guarding silent dead, felt the familiar tremor of internal chaos—the multiply singular ache of losing his daughter. <words>97</words>
This singular trauma, he understood now, had multiplied endlessly within him: into bitterness, isolation, the very grumpiness that shielded his raw core. <words>118</words>
With a grunt, he reached for the tube, its surface unexpectedly beginning to jiggle as if resonating with the mandala’s subtle vibrations. <words>136</words>
He placed it gently at the mandala’s edge, watching sand grains shift not randomly, but through the patterns revealing the deep, interconnected roots of his pain. <words>158</words>
The mandala’s design, illuminated by starlight, didn’t just show loss; it demonstrated the importance of trauma—the way unprocessed sorrow warps perception, multiplies into fear, and fuels internal uprisings. <words>185</words>
Each swirling line spoke of how one event, singular in origin, fractures the soul into countless splintered fears and angers. <words>200</words>
As the tube continued its soft jiggle, harmonizing with the sand’s movement, Mordecai saw his daughter’s face not in despair, but in the quiet acceptance the patterns demanded. <words>223</words>
The uprising within—the constant snarl, the distrust, the heavy armor of his grumpiness—began to still, not vanish, but settle into a calmer vigilance. <words>245</words>
He realized the trauma wasn’t a wound to erase, but a landscape to navigate; its importance lay in shaping his vigilance, his care for the crypt’s silent charges. <words>268</words>
The multiply singular nature of his grief transformed before him: one loss, yes, but its echoes had built his world, for better and worse. <words>288</words>
Quelling the uprising didn’t mean forgetting; it meant integrating the jagged pieces, letting the mandala’s wisdom guide him through the patterns of enduring pain. <words>309</words>
Throughout the stargazing, as constellations wheeled above, Mordecai’s shoulders lost their perpetual hunch, his scowl softening into a profound, quiet resolve. <words>329</words>
The unmarked tube ceased its jiggle, its message delivered through the sand’s silent, grandiose subtlety—a reminder that true strength lay in acknowledging the fractures, not denying them. <words>354</words>
He would return to the crypts at dawn, still the caretaker, but no longer solely defined by the shadow of his singular, multiplied sorrow. <words>374</words>
The mandala, already beginning to blur, held the final truth: healing wasn’t an end, but a continuous, starlit navigation of the self. <words>395</words>
Mordecai touched the cold stone table, the ghost of a sigh escaping him, not of despair, but of hard-won, quiet understanding. <words>412</words>
