Silas the reaver traced the park's fractured light, his scarred knuckles white on the bench, the kaleidoscope park’s shifting glass facets painting his charmingly grotesque face in jagged rainbows. <words>28</words>
He’d come here, before the first lie is told each dawn, chasing the impossible motivation: to taste the stars in a single kiss, a childhood dream his father mocked. <words>52</words>
Generational patterns were chains he wore like rusted armor, believing tenderness was weakness, a flaw passed down like his mother’s hollow eyes. <words>75</words>
A crumpled paper, a child’s drawing of a lopsided sun with stick-figure parents holding hands, lay near his boot, discarded like hope. <words>100</words>
He nudged it with a calloused toe, the vibrant crayon lines absurd against the park’s cold, geometric beauty, a mockery of his own closed-off heart. <words>127</words>
His worn journal lay open, its margins already filled with his scrawled poems, a habit to nag himself into numbness: *“Stars burn cold / Hearts turn old / Better left untold.”* <words>159</words>
He added another line, the ink bleeding: *“Sunshine’s just a lie / Watch the bright things die.”* His tone was mocking affection, aimed inward, a familiar poison. <words>187</words>
The child’s drawing snagged his gaze again—the sun’s smile was crooked, earnest, achingly familiar, like the one he’d drawn before his father’s fists taught him silence. <words>216</words>
Generational patterns weren’t just inherited; they were etched in the refusal to see light, a cycle he’d sworn to uphold, stone by stone. <words>242</words>
He picked up the crumpled paper, the cheap crayon wax smudging under his thumb, the vibrant yellow a shocking warmth against his grimy skin. <words>269</words>
*“Why save the broken sun?”* his next margin poem demanded, the nagging voice sharp, yet the drawing’s innocence disarmed his usual cynicism. <words>296</words>
He remembered his own small hands pressing crayon to paper, the same desperate hope to capture something pure before the world crushed it. <words>321</words>
This was the moment before the first lie—the lie that love was worthless, the lie he’d almost told himself again by ignoring the drawing. <words>348</words>
His charmingly grotesque features softened, the jagged park light catching a rare, unguarded tremor in his scarred cheek. <words>369</words>
He smoothed the crumpled paper on his knee, the child’s sun now resting gently against his journal’s scrawled despair. <words>388</words>
*“Maybe,”* he wrote slowly in the margin, the words unfamiliar, *“the sun kisses back.”* It wasn’t belief, not yet, but the chain felt lighter. <words>415</words>
He tucked the drawing inside the journal, a fragile star he might yet learn to taste, breaking the pattern one crumpled hope at a time. <words>439</words>
