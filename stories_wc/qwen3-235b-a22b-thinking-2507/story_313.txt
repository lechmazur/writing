Silas adjusted his frayed collar, the empty tape dispenser cold in his palm, a useless prop from his latest failed con on the ration-starved dystopian farm. <words>20</words>
Dust devils swirled across the cracked soil where genetically stunted corn barely clung to life, the air thick with the lull of remorse after he’d swindled Old Man Hemlock’s last nutrient paste. <words>41</words>
He was unusually normal—no scars, no wild eyes—just a man who’d bet wrong on a rigged water auction, his usual charm evaporating like the farm’s scarce moisture. <words>62</words>
To comfort himself, Silas did what he always did when guilt bit too hard: he interrogated the ghostly apparitions only he could see, their translucent forms flickering near the rusted irrigation pumps. <words>88</words>
"Did you even *need* that paste, Martha?" he demanded, thrusting the dispenser toward a shimmering figure of the widow he’d cheated, its plastic base scraping the dry earth. <words>113</words>
Her silent, accusing gaze deepened his remorse, yet he pressed on, voice tight with mild fervor, refusing to let defeat swallow him whole. <words>135</words>
"Answer me! You had neighbors who’d share!" he shouted, though he knew she’d died alone, her hydroponic shed looted weeks prior—a con he’d orchestrated. <words>161</words>
The dispenser, stripped of its tape after sealing too many forged delivery manifests, felt heavier now, a hollow weight mirroring his conscience. <words>183</words>
Another ghost appeared: the gaunt boy whose medicine Silas had sold for synth-whiskey, his spectral fingers reaching not in anger, but pity. <words>207</words>
Silas flinched but grinned, taunting the jaws of defeat by turning interrogation into defiance. <words>222</words>
"Go on, haunt me," he rasped, spinning the dispenser’s bare spindle. <words>234</words>
"But I’m still *here*, still grinning while your farm rots and the Corp owns your bones." <words>250</words>
His words hung in the acrid air, a fragile shield against the truth—he’d lost everything *except* this ritual. <words>268</words>
The lull of remorse threatened to pull him under, that quiet space where he almost admitted he was just a scared man stealing scraps. <words>292</words>
But the ghosts demanded more; they were his only audience, the only ones who knew his sins intimately. <words>312</words>
He leaned closer to the boy’s apparition, lowering his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. <words>328</words>
"Tell me I was clever. Tell me it wasn’t *all* for nothing." <words>340</words>
The ghost didn’t speak, but Silas imagined a nod, a flicker of understanding in its hollow eyes. <words>358</words>
It was enough. <words>362</words>
He pocketed the empty dispenser, its mundane shape a talisman against despair, and spat into the dust. <words>379</words>
Defeat hadn’t won; it never would, not while he could still conjure phantoms and laugh in their silent faces. <words>400</words>
The farm’s skeletal windmill creaked overhead, a sound like grinding teeth, but Silas walked toward the Corp checkpoint with his shoulders squared. <words>424</words>
He’d try again tomorrow—another con, another ghost to interrogate, another chance to grin while the world starved. <words>445</words>
Remorse might lull him nightly, but dawn always found him sharpening new lies, the dispenser ready for tape that would never come. <words>469</words>
His mild fervor burned steady: a tiny, stubborn flame in the vast, hungry dark. <words>487</words>
