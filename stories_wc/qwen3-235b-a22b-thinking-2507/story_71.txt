Bartholomew stood sentinel between the parallel worlds, his burlap frame stiff against the fossilized giant's colossal, bleached ribs arching over the cracked plain. <words>20</words>
Lines in the earth, deep fissures glowing faintly violet, marked the unstable boundaries he was sworn to guard. <words>32</words>
His motivation, a cold ember within straw and twine, was solely to uphold the ancient oath made to the dying Earth-Spirit: no breach, no matter how small. <words>51</words>
Clutched loosely in one stitched hand, a forgotten lace fan, brittle and yellowed, served as his only conduit for the necessary encounters in virtual reality. <words>71</words>
Through its delicate tracery, shimmering projections of potential invaders flickered – distorted faces, grasping tendrils, the digital ghosts seeking passage through the weakening lines. <words>94</words>
His tone, always fervent apathy, meant he observed these threats with utter dispassion, a deep, unwavering focus wrapped in profound indifference to the chaos they represented. <words>118</words>
The setting, realistically fantastical, felt utterly tangible: the grit of fossil dust, the ozone tang of the rifts, the fan's fragile lace catching the dim light. <words>140</words>
One twilight, a particularly aggressive entity, a seething knot of corrupted code, manifested physically through a widening line, its form coalescing into sharp, dangerous shards. <words>165</words>
Bartholomew moved with sudden, decisive speed, not born of fear, but of absolute commitment to the oath. <words>180</words>
He didn't hesitate; he seized the forgotten lace fan, its fragile bone handle suddenly a weapon, and drove it forward to skewer the invasive core of the entity. <words>205</words>
The action was precise, brutal, and utterly necessary – the fan's tip piercing the shimmering mass, disrupting its cohesion with a silent burst of static light. <words>228</words>
The entity dissolved, its threat neutralized, the line in the earth sealing with a soft sigh as the violet glow subsided. <words>246</words>
He retrieved the fan, its lace now slightly singed, and resumed his stance, the fervent apathy settling back over him like dust. <words>264</words>
The virtual encounters would continue; the lines would strain; the oath demanded eternal vigilance. <words>278</words>
He felt nothing for the vanquished, only the unyielding weight of the promise made long ago beneath these fossilized bones. <words>297</words>
The forgotten lace fan, a relic of a softer time, now bore the scars of his duty, its purpose irrevocably changed. <words>315</words>
Between the parallel worlds, time stretched thin, but Bartholomew endured, a scarecrow bound by straw and solemn word. <words>333</words>
He would not fail; the lines in the earth must hold, and his fervent apathy was the only shield they needed. <words>352</words>
The fossilized giant watched in silent stone, a monument to time's passage, as the scarecrow waited for the next breach. <words>371</words>
His oath was simple, his method clear: skewer the intruders, maintain the boundary, exist in that space of fervent apathy. <words>390</words>
The forgotten lace fan rested against his knee, a tool of virtual war in a realistically fantastical vigil that would never end. <words>408</words>
