Elara’s stage fright only struck in zero gravity, a cruel irony for an orbital exorcist clearing residual consciousness from derelict satellites amidst the toy assembly lines of Station Persephone. <words>28</words>
Her trembling hands, usually steady during Earth-bound rituals, now fumbled near the coolant vents where plastic astronauts and miniature rockets drifted past on conveyor belts. <words>55</words>
Clutched in her palm, pressed wildflowers from her grandmother’s coffin—a fragile inheritance masking generations of lies—felt like the only anchor against the void. <words>83</words>
The family creed, "We banish the unreal," was a lie; they’d merely suppressed cosmic truths, sculpting a false "never" where possibility should have bloomed. <words>112</words>
"Never usual," the elders called her condition, dismissing her microgravity-induced paralysis as weakness, not the key to perceiving the deeper fractures in reality. <words>140</words>
Today, the fractured entity wasn’t in a satellite, but woven into the station’s very debris field—a sentient tangle of dead comms arrays and shattered solar panels humming with stolen memories. <words>172</words>
To exorcise it, she had to submerge her hands into the station’s primary coolant flow, a ritual requiring absolute focus she couldn’t muster while floating. <words>200</words>
The assembly bots whirred nearby, oblivious, slotting tiny engines into toy shuttles as Elara fought the rising panic, the wildflowers’ brittle petals cutting into her skin. <words>229</words>
She remembered her grandmother’s final, gasped confession: "The lies are the prison. Break the lock." <words>251</words>
Taking a shuddering breath, Elara pressed the cold, ornate key—another inherited relic—into the coolant valve’s ancient mechanism. <words>277</words>
The defiant hush of the station deepened as she turned the key; the sharp, resonant *click* echoed not just in the metal corridor, but within her own fractured resolve. <words>308</words>
By the sound of that key turning in a lock, the stage fright vanished, replaced by a terrifying clarity—the "never" was a cage she’d helped build. <words>337</words>
She plunged her hands into the sub-zero flow, the burn immediate, the wildflowers slipping from her grasp to float like forgotten stars. <words>363</words>
Amidst the toy assembly’s cheerful chaos, Elara didn’t banish the entity; she submerged herself within its fractured song, feeling the icy current carry the weight of inherited falsehoods. <words>394</words>
With each pulse of coolant, she sculpted possibility from the ashes of "never," weaving the entity’s stolen memories into new constellations of truth, the defiant hush now a vow. <words>424</words>
The orbital debris outside began to shift, not as junk, but as raw material for a future the lies had buried, the wildflowers glowing faintly in the zero-G drift. <words>454</words>
