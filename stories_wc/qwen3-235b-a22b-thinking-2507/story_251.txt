<story>
Elara, the ambivalent prophet, traced the hairline fractures in her collection of marbles, each sphere reflecting the sterile glow of the lunar mining colony's recycled air. <words>24</words>
She felt happily sad, a familiar ache blooming in her chest as she recalled the final oath she'd whispered into the vacuum-sealed helmet, promising to scramble the cosmic scoreboard. <words>48</words>
Her motivation wasn't grand salvation, but a quiet, bashful arrogance insisting the universe's tally was simply... wrong. <words>65</words>
Between heartbeats, during the colony's scheduled power dips that mimicked a resting pulse, she worked. <words>78</words>
Today, salvaged from a dusty rummage sale box near the regolith processing plant, lay the key: jigsaw puzzle edges, their cardboard worn smooth. <words>100</words>
They weren't meant to form a picture, but to define the voids, the missing pieces of reality she needed to defragment. <words>118</words>
The cracked marbles, once clear conduits for visions, now only showed static and broken futures; she needed the puzzle edges to map the fractures. <words>142</words>
Holding a jagged blue marble fragment, she pressed a puzzle edge against its split surface, feeling the subtle shift in the colony's hum. <words>164</words>
This was the method: aligning the mundane edges found in forgotten boxes with the cosmic cracks within her sacred, shattered orbs. <words>185</words>
Each connection sent a jolt through her, a micro-defragmentation of the local spacetime lattice, scrambling the nearby cosmic scoreboard's cold calculations. <words>208</words>
She remembered the oath's weight, the moment she'd pledged to disrupt the celestial ledgers, driven by a conviction that felt both trivial and immense. <words>233</words>
Her ambivalence warred with her purpose; part of her wished the marbles were whole, the visions clear, the oath unmade. <words>256</words>
Yet, the happily sad certainty remained: the scoreboard *had* to be scrambled, even if the reason felt absurdly small against the starfield. <words>280</words>
Bashful arrogance flared as she fit another puzzle edge to a fractured crimson marble, a tiny, private rebellion against the universe's arithmetic. <words>303</words>
The colony lights flickered violently between heartbeats, not from a power surge, but from the localized reality re-knitting itself around her act. <words>326</words>
She defragmented the signal, using the puzzle's precise geometry to guide the marbles' chaotic energy into coherent disruption. <words>344</words>
A single, clear note resonated in the silent observation dome, the sound of one cosmic tally point dissolving into static. <words>363</words>
Elara smiled, a happily sad curve of her lips, the ambivalent prophet who'd nudged infinity with rummage-sale cardboard and cracked glass. <words>386</words>
The final oath was fulfilled, not with a bang, but with the quiet bashful arrogance of a woman mending the universe one jigsaw edge at a time. <words>409</words>
Dust motes danced in the lunar light, the only witnesses to her scrambled victory, the cosmic scoreboard momentarily, beautifully, confused. <words>430</words>
She placed the last puzzle edge beside the silent, fractured marbles, the defragmentation complete, the colony humming its oblivious, uncounted song. <words>454</words>
