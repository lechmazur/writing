The thin-lipped warlock adjusted his formally casual velvet waistcoat, its deep green hue faded by decades of dust within the forgotten library buried inside the abandoned mine. <words>24</words>
His bony fingers traced the cold, salt-bleached wood of the viking ship figurehead fragment, a lost artifact rumored to channel forgotten northern magics, resting atop a stack of discredited textbooks. <words>48</words>
Tonight, when the final calendar page of the year was flipped at midnight, he would optimize the ritual described in those very texts, seeking rumored cures for the soul-sickness afflicting his order. <words>73</words>
He ignored the warnings etched in the library’s crumbling stone walls, driven solely to gorge on the fruit of knowledge, no matter the cost. <words>94</words>
The air hung thick with the scent of mildew and ancient paper, the only light a single guttering candle casting long, dancing shadows that made the forgotten shelves seem to shift. <words>120</words>
His motivation was pure, desperate hunger; the discredited textbooks spoke of a resonance between the figurehead’s carved raven and the turning of the year, a key to unlocking dormant power. <words>148</words>
He felt a confusing certainty that this fragment, salvaged from a glacier’s melt, held the solution, though the texts contradicted themselves wildly on the method. <words>174</words>
One passage insisted the ritual required blood sacrifice under a full moon, another demanded only whispered apologies to the wood at dawn; he chose the latter, optimizing for minimal risk, his thin lips pressed in grim focus. <words>208</words>
The final page of the year’s calendar lay before him, crisp and white, a stark contrast to the library’s decay, waiting for his hand to turn it. <words>234</words>
He believed, with absolute, confusing certainty, that flipping it precisely at the stroke of twelve would align the artifact’s latent energy with the temporal hinge, activating the rumored cure. <words>263</words>
His formally casual demeanor masked a frantic pulse; the warnings of madness from previous seekers echoed, but the siren song of the lost artifact was too potent. <words>289</words>
He opened the most tattered textbook, its pages brittle, detailing cures involving starlight and sorrow, methods long dismissed as lunacy by the Arcane Conclave. <words>315</words>
Midnight approached; the mine groaned around the silent library, a deep, subterranean sigh. <words>328</words>
He placed the viking figurehead fragment upon the open book, its carved raven seeming to watch him with empty, knowing eyes. <words>348</words>
Taking a steadying breath that did nothing to calm his nerves, he reached for the calendar page, the culmination of his year-long search for this specific lost artifact. <words>375</words>
His thin lips moved silently, reciting the apologetic phrases from the discredited text, his formally casual posture rigid with anticipation. <words>396</words>
As the distant town clock began its final, mournful chime for the dying year, he flipped the page with a sharp, decisive motion. <words>415</words>
A surge, neither light nor sound but a profound shift in the air’s texture, emanated from the figurehead fragment, filling him with a confusing certainty of profound understanding, yet he could recall no new knowledge, only the taste of cold iron and the scent of distant, frozen seas. <words>458</words>
