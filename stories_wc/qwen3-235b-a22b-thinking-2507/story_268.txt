Rain tapped the abandoned waiting area's grimy windows, a counterpoint to the screaming silence within. <words>10</words>
Elias, a subdued vigilante haunted by the price of war, traced the plain wooden bead in his pocket, its smooth surface worn by years of anxious prayer. <words>22</words>
His mission: to master the ancient art of mirror-walking, a discipline demanding absolute stillness and perception beyond sight. <words>32</words>
He focused on the antique funhouse mirror propped against cracked vinyl seats, its warped glass reflecting the room's decay in distorted fragments. <words>44</words>
Elias tracked subtle distortions in the glass—not mere reflections, but ripples indicating hidden movement in the building's forgotten corridors. <words>55</words>
Artfully clumsy, he pretended to fumble with a cold coffee cup, masking his intense observation from any potential watcher. <words>64</words>
During virtual calls with his contact, Anya, he maintained this facade, his voice calm while his eyes scanned the mirror's shifting images. <words>75</words>
"Your insights are invaluable, Anya," he murmured, flatter dripping with practiced ease to keep her talking, needing her location data. <words>85</words>
Each call was a tightrope walk; the screaming silence of the empty station amplified every click, every breath, a constant reminder of past failures. <words>97</words>
He remembered the village razed, the children's laughter silenced—the brutal price of war that drove him here, seeking redemption through this fragile art. <words>110</words>
The bead grounded him, a tactile anchor against the mirror's deceptive chaos and the ghosts whispering in the quiet. <words>120</words>
A flicker in the glass—a distortion resolving into the shape of a man near the old ticket booth. <words>127</words>
Elias held his breath, the screaming silence deepening as he confirmed the target: the arms dealer who'd supplied the warlords. <words>138</words>
He’d flatter Anya one last time to lock the coordinates, then move. <words>143</words>
His artfully clumsy posture shifted imperceptibly, muscles coiling beneath the guise of a weary commuter. <words>151</words>
The ancient art demanded patience; rushing meant death, a lesson etched in blood from battles he couldn't prevent. <words>161</words>
He watched the dealer’s reflection warp and stretch, a grotesque dance in the antique glass, tracking his path toward the exit. <words>172</words>
Elias rose, pocketing the bead, its simple wood a shield against the screaming silence of impending violence. <words>181</words>
He moved not with a warrior’s grace, but with artfully clumsy steps, mimicking the shuffling gait of the forgotten. <words>191</words>
The price of war wasn't just paid in blood; it was carried in the quiet moments, in the weight of a single bead, in the distortion of truth. <words>205</words>
As he slipped into the corridor, the abandoned waiting area returned to its screaming silence, holding its breath for the next reflection. <words>215</words>
The virtual call ended, leaving only the mirror’s silent testimony and the vigilante’s shadow merging with the war’s long, dark echo. <words>226</words>
He would master the art, not for glory, but to ensure the silence never screamed quite so loud again. <words>236</words>
The plain wooden bead felt warm now, a small, hard promise against his palm in the endless quiet. <words>245</words>
