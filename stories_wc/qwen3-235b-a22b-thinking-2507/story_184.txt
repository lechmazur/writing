Elara, the scrappy tavern-hand with knuckles scraped raw from hauling ale barrels, scoffed at the sterile silence of the vacuum chamber garden, its floating petunias utterly useless for brewing. <words>28</words> She'd been "randomize" the collection of broken seashells she'd smuggled in—a pathetic, chipped assortment gathered from a drowned coastline—because the Head Botanist insisted it was "predictably unpredictable" how they might interact with the fossilized footprints visible in the dried-up riverbed's silt. <words>70</words> Time here flowed backward, the sands literally retreating up the hourglass, making yesterday's rain tomorrow's drought; it was the only place she felt the inescapable callings, those deep, oceanic pulls in her bones, might finally make sense. <words>108</words> Her tavern life—wiping sticky tables, dodging drunks—felt like a cage compared to the vast, terrifying pull toward the unknown she sensed in the shells' fractured spirals. <words>135</words> "Blasted science," she muttered, her usual flippant solemnity masking a raw, desperate hope, as she knelt by the riverbed, the vacuum sucking sound away but not the frantic thud of her heart. <words>165</words> The footprints, impossibly ancient yet freshly imprinted as time reversed, seemed to beckon *her*, specifically, a path laid bare only because the sands flowed backward. <words>192</words> Motivated solely to catapult her imagination beyond the grimy tavern walls and the known realms of this odd garden, she carefully scattered the broken seashells across the fossilized tracks, hoping the random arrangement would trigger... something. <words>230</words> As the last shell, a jagged piece of conch, settled into the dust, the footprints shimmered, not vanishing as expected with the backward flow, but *deepening*, glowing with an inner light. <words>262</words> The broken shells on the ground began to vibrate, humming a low, resonant note that bypassed her ears and resonated directly in her chest cavity, the inescapable callings suddenly deafening, undeniable. <words>295</words> This was it—the moment the predictably unpredictable became terrifyingly real; the vacuum chamber garden, usually so still, felt charged, the floating flowers trembling as if caught in an invisible current. <words>325</words> The call wasn't *to* the ocean, she realized with flippant, solemn awe, but *from* it, a summons carried on the broken fragments, demanding she step *into* the fossilized path, into the backward-flowing time. <words>358</words> Ignoring the tavern-hand's instinct to flee, Elara, heart hammering against the vacuum's silence, placed her worn boot precisely into the glowing footprint, the broken seashells at her feet flaring like captured starlight. <words>392</words> The garden dissolved, not into darkness, but into a roaring, impossible vista of colors beyond naming, the sands of time now flowing *with* her, catapulting her imagination into the vast, uncharted deep where the callings originated. <words>427</words> She was gone, leaving only scattered, luminous shell fragments and the profound, flippant solemnity of an empty footprint in the silt. <words>448</words>
