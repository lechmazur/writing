Kaito knelt in the castle's inner garden, calloused hands stirring damp earth as he planted rice seedlings during the fragile spring planting season. <words>20</words>
His vintage spectacles, thick-lensed and brass-rimmed, magnified the soil's texture, a habit from his days as a lawman tracking fugitives across dusty plains. <words>40</words>
Now, within the moss-eaten stones of Himeji Castle, he sought peace, gathering broken pieces of discarded Imari pottery from the garden paths, each shard a silent plea against the violence that had defined his past. <words>68</words>
The corroded rapture of the ancient fortress surrounded him: crumbling plaster revealing centuries-old wood, yet cherry blossoms clung stubbornly to skeletal branches, beauty born from decay. <words>92</words>
He needed to escape the cycle, the phantom gunshots echoing in quiet moments, the faces of men he’d been forced to shoot. <words>112</words>
That morning, a letter arrived, addressed to a long-departed tea master, its kanji smudged by rain—a misplaced letter finding the wrong address, but the right person. <words>139</words>
It was probably improbable, this fragile paper surviving the journey, yet here it lay, torn at one corner like the broken pottery he collected. <words>163</words>
Kaito carefully smoothed the letter on a flat stone, his spectacles catching the weak sun as he deciphered the elegant script. <words>182</words>
The words stirred something deep within him, not the anger of his lawman days, but a quiet resolve: "True strength lies in mending, not breaking." <words>208</words>
He recalled gathering the sharpest fragments of a shattered tea bowl yesterday, his fingers bleeding as he fit them together, seeking wholeness. <words>231</words>
The letter’s plea mirrored his own silent struggle, urging him to mend his spirit, not just pottery. <words>248</words>
Stirring the cool mud around a new seedling, he felt the familiar tension in his shoulders ease, the ghostly echoes of gunfire fading slightly. <words>272</words>
This misplaced letter, meant for a ghost, had found him—a former lawman drowning in regret—offering a path out of the bloodstained cycle he’d inherited. <words>299</words>
He traced the ink with a soil-stained finger, the corroded rapture of the castle suddenly feeling less like a tomb and more like a sanctuary. <words>322</words>
Each broken piece he gathered, each seed he planted, was a stitch in the fabric of a life rebuilt. <words>342</words>
The spectacles, relics of a sharper, harsher vision, now helped him see the delicate threads of hope woven through the decay. <words>365</words>
He would not stir violence again; he would stir the earth for life, gathering broken pieces until his own soul felt whole. <words>388</words>
As dusk painted the ancient stones in hues of rust and rose, Kaito placed the letter beside the mended bowl, a testament to improbable grace. <words>412</words>
The cycle was broken, not with a gun, but with a seed, a shard, and words that found their way home. <words>434</words>
