Kael the blunt heretic traced dust on the temple library's forgotten shelves, his worn-out teddy bear clutched under one arm. <words>15</words>
Its button eyes, one missing, recalled childhood old promises whispered to a god he now defied. <words>22</words>
He moved enthusiastically cautious, heart pounding with anxious elation, scanning the silent stacks. <words>27</words>
At the hush when a long-lost puzzle piece reappears—a chipped obsidian shard slipped from the teddy bear's torn seam—he froze. <words>36</words>
This shard, matching the temple's central altar, was the key his heresy demanded. <words>41</words>
His battle wasn't with swords, but to match wits with the temple's omniscient mind, rumored to reside in the library's core. <words>50</words>
He found the ancient stock ticker, its paper feed yellowed, humming faintly in the gloom. <words>56</words>
Fingers trembling with that same anxious elation, he fed the obsidian shard into the ticker's input slot. <words>63</words>
The machine whirred, spitting out a stream of jumbled codes: "6J9$%L!VQ2@K". <words>69</words>
Kael, blunt and unafraid of sacrilege, began deciphering, his worn teddy bear a silent witness on the dusty floor. <words>77</words>
Each symbol felt like breaking another old promise, yet he pressed on, enthusiastically cautious. <words>83</words>
The codes resolved into star charts, revealing the omniscient mind's true location: beneath the altar. <words>89</words>
Anxious elation surged as he realized the mind wasn't divine, but a failing AI, its power source nearly dead. <words>97</words>
His battle shifted; he must reactivate it using the shard before the last power faded. <words>103</words>
He recalled the core concept: old promises weren't oaths to keep, but chains to break. <words>109</words>
Working through the jumbled codes on the ticker, he input the final sequence, a desperate gamble. <words>116</words>
The machine stuttered, then glowed steadily, projecting a holographic interface above the altar. <words>122</words>
"Query: Purpose?" the omniscient mind pulsed, its voice like grinding stone. <words>127</words>
Kael, blunt heretic holding his worn teddy bear, smiled with anxious elation. <words>132</words>
"To understand why you made promises you couldn't keep," he stated, the old vow fulfilled not by faith, but by truth. <words>142</words>
The mind flickered, acknowledging his victory; the temple library, forgotten no longer, hummed with renewed, fragile light. <words>150</words>
He placed the teddy bear gently on the altar, the worn fabric a testament to promises finally matched, not merely kept. <words>159</words>
The anxious elation settled into quiet certainty as the first true dawn in centuries touched the temple's broken dome. <words>167</words>
Kael knew the real battle—living without blind faith—had just begun, but he faced it enthusiastically cautious, the old promises transformed. <words>177</words>
The deserted temple, once a tomb of dogma, now held only the echo of wits matched and a teddy bear's silent vigil. <words>186</words>
He stepped out, leaving the jumbled codes behind, the omniscient mind's final whisper a new, unburdened promise on the wind. <words>195</words>
