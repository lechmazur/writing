Kael the assassin lurked in the gilded shadows of the baroque asteroid's transit hub, his breath fogging the viewport where condensation traced the pattern of a spider's web after rain. <words>28</words>
Borrowed starlight, pale and thin as old parchment, illuminated the peeling gold leaf and cracked marble of the decaying station, casting long, skeletal fingers across the unforgiving road of the central concourse. <words>55</words>
His paint-splattered camera lens, salvaged from a dead artist’s kit, rested cold against his temple, the smeared crimson and cobalt distorting the view of the last bus idling below. <words>85</words>
He watched the driver, a weary man named Silas, complete the final route of the cycle, the bus’s headlights cutting twin tunnels through the perpetual twilight of the asteroid’s cavernous interior. <words>117</words>
Kael’s mission was simple: eliminate Silas before the bus reached the terminus, a contract paid in promises of quiet retirement, superficially profound words about ending cycles that felt hollow even as he repeated them. <words>152</words>
He fingered the trigger, rehearsing the clean shot, the recoil a familiar whisper against his palm, yet his mind snagged on the spiderweb pattern on the glass, intricate and fragile, holding droplets like captured stars. <words>188</words>
Why this bus? Why Silas? The assassin’s usual certainty frayed; the road here wasn’t just unforgiving stone, but a grinding wheel wearing down souls, including his own. <words>219</words>
He remembered the artist who owned the lens, babbling about beauty in decay, words Kael had dismissed as superficially profound nonsense while stealing the gear. <words>247</words>
Now, watching Silas rub his eyes, a man who drove the same desolate loop for decades, Kael felt the weight of the lens, the paint smears like dried blood, and the borrowed starlight felt less like illumination and more like theft. <words>285</words>
The bus hissed to a stop precisely as the chronometer hit zero – the final route completed. <words>300</words>
Kael raised the rifle, but the spiderweb pattern, magnified by the lens, shimmered with a thousand fractured lights, each droplet reflecting the distant, impossible promise of a dawn he’d never see on this dead rock. <words>336</words>
A sound escaped him, sharp and unexpected in the silent hub: a laugh, raw and disbelieving, echoing off the baroque arches, shattering the assassin’s cold resolve. <words>365</words>
He lowered the weapon, the contract meaningless ash. <words>376</words>
The unforgiving road demanded sacrifice, but not this. <words>386</words>
He wanted, suddenly and fiercely, to cradle the dawn in trembling hands – not as a killer, but as a witness to light returning. <words>405</words>
He stepped from the shadows, the paint-splattered lens left behind on the cold ledge, its smeared view of the world no longer his. <words>428</words>
Outside, the bus driver opened the door, blinking in the weak light, and Kael walked towards him, not with a weapon, but with empty, open palms ready to hold the fragile, coming day. <words>460</words>
