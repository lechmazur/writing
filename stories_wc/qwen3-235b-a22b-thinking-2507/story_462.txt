<story>
Elias, a town-weary traveler whose boots held the dust of a dozen indifferent cities, pushed through the splintered gate of the abandoned carnival, seeking only silence. <words>28</words>
The skeletal remains of the House of Mirrors loomed, its fractured glass surfaces reflecting the bruised twilight sky like broken promises. <words>45</words>
He entered the warped corridors, his reflection multiplying into a legion of exhausted selves, each pane a prison amplifying the noise he’d fled—the relentless clamor inside his own skull. <words>70</words>
His sole motivation was escape, not from the place, but from the confines of his own mind, a cage far more intricate than any mirror maze. <words>94</words>
In the central chamber, a single, miraculously intact stained glass panel hung askew, depicting a sunburst in faded blues and fiery oranges, its colors muted by grime. <words>121</words>
Outside, a rusted metal sign, bent by coastal winds, swung with a slow, rhythmic *clang* against its post, the sound a low pulse in the hush before someone finally says, “I love you.” <words>154</words>
Elias watched the sign’s arc, the *clang* resonating through the wooden floorboards, a vibration traveling up his legs. <words>172</words>
He moved towards the stained glass, drawn by an impulse that felt both random and deliberate—an intentionally accidental step. <words>190</words>
Reaching the panel, he extended a finger, not to touch the glass, but to gently tap the metal frame holding it, synchronizing with the sign’s distant *clang*. <words>218</words>
The vibration traveled through the frame, humming into the ancient lead cames, making the stained glass tremble minutely. <words>235</words>
Dust motes, disturbed by the resonance, caught the last slanting rays of sun, transforming into a swirling cradle of sparks within the colored light. <words>260</words>
This was the cradle of sparks—not fire, but light and dust dancing in the refracted beams, a fragile constellation born from vibration. <words>284</words>
He tapped again, harder this time, the action feeling less like accident and more like a purposeful act to fertilize the stillness. <words>306</words>
The sparks multiplied, swirling faster, their gentle luminescence seeming to seep into the fractured reflections around him, softening the harsh edges of his multiplied selves. <words>334</words>
The rhythmic tapping, via the swinging sign’s influence, became a meditation, each *ting* against the metal frame sending new constellations of light into the dusty air. <words>362</words>
In that hammered repose—the carnival’s battered quiet, the steady *clang*, the traveler’s focused calm—the internal noise finally subsided. <words>386</words>
The cradle of sparks wasn’t an escape *from* his mind, but a way *through* it, fertilizing the barren ground of his thoughts with unexpected beauty. <words>410</words>
He stood within the fractured house, no longer multiplied by glass, but unified by light, the hush deepening as the last spark faded, leaving only profound, resonant peace. <words>438</words>
