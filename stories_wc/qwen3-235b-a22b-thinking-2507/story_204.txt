Elara adjusted her mic, heart pounding during the hush before her acceptance speech for Cuddler of the Year, the sterile convention hall air thick with expectation. <words>24</words>
Her mind, however, fled to the farmer’s market three weeks prior, where the unusually usual scent of bruised peaches had lured her—a professional cuddler seeking grounding in tangible, simple things. <words>48</words>
There, an old woman with eyes like cracked riverbeds pressed a phantom train ticket punch into Elara’s palm, its brass teeth cold and strangely weightless, whispering only, "For the hangar." <words>75</words>
Driven by a compulsion she couldn’t name, Elara followed the cryptic direction to the abandoned spaceport hangar on the city’s rusted fringe, its vast doors groaning open to reveal cathedral-like decay. <words>104</words>
Inside, dust motes danced in shafts of weak light, illuminating the skeletal remains of starships slowly surrendering to entropy, their hulls peeling like ancient bark, a profound decay that felt both alien and intimately familiar. <words>135</words>
The phantom punch, she realized, wasn’t for trains but for the long-defunct orbital trams; it was a key, a relic from when this hangar hummed with interstellar commerce, now silent under layers of neglect. <words>164</words>
As she traced the punch’s intricate, worn patterns, unspoken rules of her profession surfaced: never pry, always receive, offer presence without demand—rules born from her own deep-seated prejudice against emotional need, seeing it as weakness. <words>196</words>
She’d chosen cuddling to avoid messy intimacy, believing touch was transactional, a service for the lonely, not a bridge for her own fear of vulnerability, a prejudice as stubborn as the hangar’s decaying girders. <words>228</words>
Yet here, in this cathedral of forgotten journeys, the ancient novelty of the punch—a tool for marking passage now marking her stillness—forced a reckoning; the unspoken rule she’d broken was against her own heart. <words>260</words>
The hangar’s decay wasn’t just ruin; it was a testament to journeys ended, connections severed, mirroring her own isolation disguised as professionalism, the prejudice that kept her emotionally docked. <words>291</words>
Holding the phantom punch, cold against her skin, she understood the old woman’s gift: a symbol of passage, urging her to move beyond the rigid boundaries she’d built, to truly *receive* as well as give. <words>323</words>
The hangar’s silence, once oppressive, became a sacred space where the unspoken rule of her soul—fear of being needed—began to crumble like the hangar’s corroded walls. <words>352</words>
She hadn’t just touched others; she’d shielded herself, mistaking emotional distance for strength, a prejudice as corrosive as the rust consuming the starships around her. <words>380</words>
Now, standing before the awards crowd, the phantom punch a secret warmth in her pocket, Elara breathed deeply, ready to speak not just of comfort, but of the courage it took to be touched. <words>409</words>
The hush deepened, expectant; she stepped to the mic, the ancient novelty of genuine connection finally her compass, the unspoken rule of her heart rewritten in the language of shared vulnerability. <words>439</words>
Her voice, when it came, was steady, carrying the weight of the hangar’s decay and the fragile hope of new growth, a professional cuddler who had finally learned to hold herself. <words>470</words>
