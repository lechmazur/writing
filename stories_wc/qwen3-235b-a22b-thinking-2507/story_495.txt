Elara, the begrudging guardian of the mechanical bird sanctuary, traced the splintered handle of her rustic bread paddle, the only relic from her life before the city’s iron grip. <words>28</words>
Once a baker, she now maintained these clockwork sparrows within the sanctuary’s spacetime folds, where reality bent like warm dough. <words>45</words>
Society demanded the birds be dismantled as dangerous relics, but Elara stayed, her duty a cage of her own making. <words>60</words>
The birds, however, were dangerously friendly; their whirring wings brushed her shoulders, offering oil-drops like misplaced affection, yet their gears could snap a finger. <words>81</words>
Each dusk, she’d illustrate her loneliness by sketching the birds in a worn ledger, their metallic feathers reflecting a joy she’d forgotten. <words>98</words>
Then, the postcards began arriving—slipped between the sanctuary’s temporal layers, depicting an unknown island with impossible, dreamlike shores. <words>118</words>
They showed turquoise waves and fruit-laden trees, arriving without stamps or sender, humming with the scent of salt and freedom. <words>134</words>
Elara started to analyze them obsessively, using the paddle’s flat surface to arrange the glossy images under the sanctuary’s flickering gaslight. <words>154</words>
Each postcard illustrated a fragment of her lost joy: the warmth of sun on skin, the taste of unmeasured time, the absence of society’s relentless clock. <words>173</words>
The birds grew agitated, their friendly chirps turning sharp, as if sensing her resolve to break free from the grip that had imprisoned them both. <words>195</words>
One card, stained with what looked like sea spray, showed a woman laughing on a beach—her own face, younger, holding a loaf of bread. <words>214</words>
It was the bakery’s closing day, the last moment she’d felt truly alive before the city swallowed her. <words>226</words>
Tears blurred the dreamlike image as the joyful sorrow of remembrance flooded her; she hadn’t just lost a job, but her soul’s rhythm. <words>245</words>
The paddle, once used to shape dough, now felt like a key—its weight familiar, grounding her as she planned her escape. <words>261</words>
Society’s chains were invisible but suffocating; this island, this joy, was the only truth left. <words>274</words>
She packed dried nuts and the postcards, tucking the paddle under her arm like a shield against the world she’d serve. <words>290</words>
The mechanical birds swarmed, their friendliness now a dangerous barrier, gears whining in protest as she stepped toward the sanctuary’s edge. <words>309</words>
There, where spacetime folded thin as parchment, she saw the island shimmering—a real place, not a dream. <words>323</words>
With a final look at the whirring sanctuary, Elara leaped, the paddle clutched tight, leaving the cage behind. <words>338</words>
Wind rushed past, carrying the birds’ fading clicks, as she fell toward turquoise waves and rediscovered joy. <words>352</words>
Below, the island awaited, and for the first time in decades, her heart beat with sorrowful, soaring lightness. <words>368</words>
The city’s grip was broken; she was free, carried home by the very spacetime that had once confined her. <words>384</words>
Elara landed softly on warm sand, the rustic paddle beside her, proof that even the most begrudging guardian could find wings. <words>400</words>
