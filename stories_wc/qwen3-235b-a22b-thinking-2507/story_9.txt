Kael the soothsayer traced a trembling finger over the thirteen stubborn locks of his pocket puzzle box, the neon glare of the billboard maze reflecting dully in his sweat-slicked palm; this desert, choked by the skeletal frames of forgotten ads, was hardly the place for prophecy, yet here he was, mildly panicked. <words>42</words>
Between the lost years, when the aquifers finally screamed their last, his only oracle was the water rings bleeding into the scarred wood of this battered bar top, a relic in the dust-choked saloon. <words>75</words>
"Reading the rings," he muttered, molten sarcasm dripping like hot tar, "because obviously, the planet’s obituary is best served on particleboard." <words>98</words>
Each concentric stain, magnified by his desperate focus, whispered of droughts past and futures choked by plastic blooms – environmental stewardship wasn't a choice anymore, it was the only prayer left. <words>131</words>
He needed to shape destiny with bare hands, not just foresee it; the box, a relic from a saner time, held thirteen keys to thirteen locks, each representing a fractured ecosystem, probably unlikely to ever click open again. <words>168</words>
The neon buzzed, painting the sand in sickly pinks and electric blues, illuminating the maze of towering billboards advertising waterless gardens and synthetic rain – monuments to the very greed that killed the wells. <words>203</words>
Kael pressed his thumb hard onto the deepest ring, a dark halo signifying the Great Drying; he had to magnify this truth, make the complacent *see* the rings as the death certificates they were. <words>237</words>
His motivation wasn't mystical; it was dirt under fingernails, seeds smuggled in his coat, the raw, physical act of trying to mend what was broken, one stubborn lock, one handful of stolen soil at a time. <words>273</words>
The first lock yielded with a gritty sigh, a tiny victory that felt absurdly fragile against the scale of the neon-lit wasteland pressing in. <words>298</words>
"Thirteen locks," he rasped, wiping grime from the bar top, "for thirteen ecosystems. Poetic. And probably unlikely to matter before the next sandstorm buries this whole pathetic circus." <words>330</words>
Yet, he kept working, fingers raw, using the water rings as a map – the faintest ring near the edge suggested a hidden spring, a whisper of life the billboards ignored. <words>361</words>
He’d magnify that whisper, turn it into a roar, even if his hands bled; stewardship wasn't hope, it was the only work left for hands that refused to be idle. <words>392</words>
The second lock clicked. Somewhere, a single, illegal seedling pushed through cracked concrete, watered by condensation stolen from a billboard’s cooling unit – a tiny, defiant act of shaping destiny. <words>425</words>
Kael smiled, a cracked thing in the neon gloom; the puzzle box had twelve more locks, the desert had a million more billboards, but bare hands, however unlikely, were still hands. <words>458</words>
