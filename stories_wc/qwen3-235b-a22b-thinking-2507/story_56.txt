<story>
Silas, the bluffing swindler, moved through the reclaimed orchard farmland inside the toppled skyscraper with an energetically lethargic sway, his boots sinking slightly into the rich soil where apple trees now grew through cracked concrete. <words>38</words>
His invisible allies—whispering voices only he could hear—urged him to keep moving, their presence a constant, unsettling hum beneath the rustle of leaves. <words>60</words>
He clutched a worn ledger, its pages filled with fabricated debts owed to non-existent creditors, a necessary fiction in this fragmented world. <words>83</words>
Today’s mark was Elara, the pragmatic farmer tending the upper terraces; he planned to magnetize her trust with a story about stolen irrigation parts, using the blank price tag in his pocket as "proof" of the theft's value. <words>120</words>
As he rounded a gnarled pear tree, his foot caught on a root, sending his precious ledger flying; it landed with a soft thud at the feet of a woman examining a ripening quince. <words>155</words>
Elara looked up, startled, then bent to retrieve the book, their meet-cute unfolding not with charm, but with the awkwardness of dropped evidence. <words>181</words>
At the instant the frozen computer terminal in the nearby control room finally restarted with a low electronic chime, Silas felt a familiar, desperate urge to bare the truth no one dared to handle. <words>218</words>
He snatched the blank price tag from his pocket, its smooth, unmarked surface suddenly feeling heavy. <words>233</words>
"See this?" he rasped, his voice embodying gentle harshness, the exhaustion of years of lies pressing down. <words>252</words>
"It's blank because the value... the debts... they're all lies I made up." <words>268</words>
He magnetized the tag to a nearby metal support beam, a useless, symbolic gesture. <words>284</words>
"The allies... the voices... they're not creditors. They're the people *I* stole from. The ones who died when the city fell because I sold them faulty seals." <words>315</words>
His confession hung in the humid air, thick with the scent of earth and overripe fruit. <words>331</words>
Elara didn't recoil; her eyes, sharp with understanding, held his. <words>345</words>
She picked up the ledger, not with anger, but a quiet sorrow. <words>358</words>
"The computer restarted," she said softly, nodding towards the terminal's newly lit screen. <words>373</words>
"It's showing the old city archives... the *real* records of who supplied those seals." <words>389</words>
Silas froze, the invisible allies falling silent for the first time, replaced by the terrifying weight of a truth finally exposed. <words>410</words>
Elara placed the ledger back in his trembling hands, the blank price tag still clinging to the beam, a monument to erased value. <words>430</words>
