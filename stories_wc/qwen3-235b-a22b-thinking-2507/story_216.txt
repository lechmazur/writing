Elias Thorne, the city’s only professional scapegoat for hire, waited in the cloud city’s highest library annex after the last library card got returned to the desk. <words>20</words>
His occupation demanded absorbing blame for others’ failures, a role requiring an abandoned identity he cultivated meticulously. <words>35</words>
Midnight chimed through the city’s brass bellows, signaling the start of his true work: refashion through cryptic phone calls at midnight. <words>52</words>
The first call came, a rasping whisper instructing him to examine the metal washer clutched in his palm. <words>68</words>
This washer, salvaged from a decommissioned sky-duct, was robustly delicate—its thin iron rim unbroken despite centuries of pressure, yet prone to shattering if handled wrong. <words>90</words>
Elias traced its grooves, his obsessive calm unwavering as he recalled the client’s demand: to decode sacred symbols etched onto similar washers. <words>114</words>
These symbols, he believed, held the cloud city’s forgotten foundation codes, lost when the last archivist vanished. <words>128</words>
Each call provided fragmented clues; tonight’s voice hissed coordinates matching the washer’s imperfections. <words>141</words>
He held the washer before a flickering gas-lamp, its light refracting through the metal’s warped center to project faint glyphs onto the wall. <words>162</words>
The symbols pulsed—a language of pressure and altitude, mapping the city’s failing levitation struts. <words>176</words>
His client, a disgraced engineer, needed this to prove the council’s negligence before his exile. <words>189</words>
Elias felt the familiar weight of borrowed guilt; accepting this blame would shield the engineer, preserving the scapegoat’s necessary anonymity. <words>209</words>
He noted the critical strut number—Gamma-7—where corrosion mirrored the washer’s flaw. <words>222</words>
Robustly delicate, the washer had survived the city’s decay, just as Elias survived by embracing fragility. <words>236</words>
He refashioned the engineer’s evidence into a blameless maintenance report, his hands steady despite the stakes. <words>252</words>
At 12:17 AM, he placed the washer inside a pneumatic tube, sending it to the council chambers with the forged document. <words>270</words>
The scapegoat’s duty was complete; the engineer would be absolved, the council none the wiser. <words>284</words>
Elias returned the washer to his pocket, its cool weight a reminder of identities shed and worn. <words>298</words>
He sat in the silent annex, waiting for the next call, the cloud city humming beneath him like a held breath. <words>315</words>
Sacred symbols weren’t carved in stone but in the city’s bones, visible only to those who traded in abandoned truths. <words>334</words>
His calm deepened as dawn threatened the horizon; another identity dissolved, another burden absorbed. <words>349</words>
The metal washer, now a key to salvation, rested against his thigh, robustly delicate and utterly essential. <words>365</words>
He would answer the next midnight call, refashioning blame into order, as the cloud city drifted on. <words>381</words>
This was his purpose: to hold the fragile peace between truth and consequence, one washer, one call, one abandoned self at a time. <words>400</words>
The library lights dimmed, leaving only the washer’s faint gleam and Elias’s unwavering stillness. <words>414</words>
