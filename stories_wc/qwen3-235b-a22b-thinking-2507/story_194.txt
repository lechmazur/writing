Silas gripped his bike handlebars, his calloused lumberjack hands still adjusting to the city’s rhythm after the forest accident. <words>15</words>
Each morning ride past the "Ossuary Bistro," bones artfully displayed behind glass, reminded him of his shattered wrist and the harsh tenderness of his new path. <words>32</words>
He entered, gracefully awkward in his flannel, seeking the chef rumored to know forgotten healing traditions, his motivation born from pain and a desperate need to mend. <words>51</words>
The chef, a stern woman named Mara, saw his injury and his spirit, offering broth instead of judgment, her tone a blend of gravel and care. <words>70</words>
During one tense lunch, Silas noticed a peculiar menu insert—a coded letter seemingly from a future war, its symbols pulsing with hidden agendas he couldn’t decipher. <words>92</words>
He took it, confused, biking home as dusk fell, the city lights reflecting his inner turmoil. <words>104</words>
That night, reawakened nightmares flooded him: not his own forest falls, but trench warfare, the letter’s code translating into urgent pleas for peace. <words>124</words>
The nightmares revealed the letter’s true purpose—it wasn’t a warning, but a recruitment tool masking a warmonger’s hidden agenda to exploit healers. <words>145</words>
Silas realized the "healing traditions" Mara taught weren’t just for his wrist; they were a quiet resistance against the war’s dehumanizing logic. <words>164</words>
He returned to the ossuary restaurant, the ancient bones a silent witness to his resolve, and confessed the nightmares and the letter’s dark intent. <words>185</words>
Mara nodded grimly, her harsh tenderness now a shield; she’d known the letter’s origin, testing his spirit before sharing deeper knowledge. <words>204</words>
"True healing revamps the soul, not just the body," she stated, placing a jar of bone-settling salve in his hands, its recipe centuries old. <words>224</words>
Silas understood: his journey wasn’t escape, but a reawakening to mend what war sought to break. <words>237</words>
He began biking with new purpose, not just to the restaurant, but to apothecaries and elders, learning poultices and prayers, revamping his life through reawakened nightmares. <words>260</words>
The coded letter, now decoded, became his guide—not for battle, but for building resilience, its hidden agenda subverted by his choice of care. <words>283</words>
Each pedal stroke through the city streets felt like a quiet rebellion, his lumberjack strength channeled into nurturing life instead of felling trees. <words>303</words>
Mara’s ossuary kitchen, where death was honored to sustain life, became his sanctuary, the gourmet meals a metaphor for transformation. <words>323</words>
He moved with that same gracefully awkward determination, his spirit unbroken, learning that tenderness could be the harshest, most necessary weapon. <words>342</words>
The future war’s shadow lingered, but Silas chose to heal the present, one bike ride, one salve, one decoded truth at a time. <words>362</words>
His revamp was slow, rooted in bone-deep understanding, ensuring the hidden agendas of violence would find no purchase in his reawakened heart. <words>382</words>
The city’s rhythm now matched his own: a steady, healing pulse beneath the surface chaos, carried forward on two wheels. <words>400</words>
