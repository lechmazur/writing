<story>
Silas the pickpocket crouched in the haunted lighthouse engine room, baffled by the sudden failure of his last mark; the pocket was empty, the wallet vanished, leaving only cold sweat and confusion. <words>32</words>
Between appointments, he sought refuge here, the rhythmic thrum of the dormant machinery a counterpoint to his racing heart, the salty air thick with the ghosts of drowned keepers. <words>58</words>
His scorching poise, usually unshakeable during a lift, felt brittle now, challenged by the eerie ventriloquist dummy perched unnaturally on a rusted boiler, its painted smile too wide, eyes gleaming with unnatural awareness. <words>92</words>
"Confusingly lucid," the dummy rasped, its voice seeming to emanate from the very pipes, "like the tide knowing both push and pull." <words>115</words>
Silas flinched, his usual street-smart bravado dissolving; this wasn't part of the plan, this spectral interruption during his crucial downtime. <words>138</words>
He needed to sustain his focus, to understand the impossible, so he did the only thing that ever calmed the frantic energy of his trade: he began an impromptu poetry session, voice low against the groaning metal. <words>175</words>
"Steel bones hum a salted tune / Beneath the watchful, waning moon / A thief seeks rest, but finds instead / A wooden voice inside his head," he murmured, the words forming a shield. <words>210</words>
The dummy tilted its head, the oil lamp casting monstrous shadows. "The art of transformation," it declared, its tone both childlike and ancient, "isn't stealing trinkets, but stealing *back* your own shape." <words>245</words>
Silas felt the truth of it pierce his bafflement; his life was a series of identical, hollow transactions, a status quo he merely serviced, not challenged. <words>272</words>
The dummy’s words, confusingly lucid, reframed his world: transformation wasn't about the object taken, but the self remade. <words>295</words>
He recalled the empty pocket – perhaps the mark had transformed too, shedding their complacency, leaving only the ghost of security Silas expected. <words>320</words>
His motivation crystallized: to challenge the status quo meant abandoning the predictable theft, embracing the terrifying uncertainty of becoming someone new, someone not defined by the next lift. <words>355</words>
The engine room, haunted and resonant, became a forge; the dummy’s eerie presence wasn't a threat, but a catalyst for the art he’d ignored. <words>382</words>
Sustaining his scorching poise, Silas didn't reach for his tools; instead, he spoke another line, raw and unplanned, a vow etched in steam and shadow. <words>407</words>
"From pockets bare to spirit free / This lighthouse lights the path for me." <words>415</words>
The dummy’s painted eyes seemed to soften, the oppressive hauntings momentarily stilled by the shared, impromptu verse. <words>430</words>
Silas left the engine room as the first appointment hour chimed, the baffled thief gone, the man stepping into transformation walking out, the dummy’s silent approval echoing in the salt-stung air. <words>460</words>
