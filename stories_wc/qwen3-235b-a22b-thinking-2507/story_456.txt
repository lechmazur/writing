Elara, the morbid florist, knelt on the floating rock dojo's uneven surface, her neutrally passionate gaze fixed on the plain white candle she'd placed at its center. <words>24</words>
In the last flicker of a guttering lantern, its light barely holding back the dojo's profound darkness, she felt the familiar weight of her tempered beliefs straining. <words>45</words>
Her motivation, always to understand cosmic cycles, had led her here, to this unstable sanctuary adrift above the sleeping city. <words>62</words>
She had come to oblige a dying request scribbled in a client's final note: "Find the truth in the stones." <words>80</words>
With meticulous, almost clinical care, Elara reached for the writer’s worn trunk tucked beneath the dojo's single meditation mat. <words>98</words>
Her fingers, accustomed to handling wilting lilies and funeral chrysanthemums, brushed the cold metal latch. <words>113</words>
Inside, beneath moth-eaten robes, lay the backlog of typed pages, brittle and yellowed, filled with dense, looping script about stellar decay and rebirth. <words>136</words>
The lantern sputtered violently, casting frantic shadows as she pulled out the top sheaf, her heart a steady, quiet drum against her ribs. <words>158</words>
Reading felt like an intrusion, yet she obliged the silent plea within the pages, her neutrally passionate focus unwavering despite the encroaching dark. <words>180</words>
The writer described cosmic cycles not as distant phenomena, but as intimate rhythms mirrored in the decay of a single petal and the slow drift of the floating rocks themselves. <words>208</words>
Each typed line challenged her tempered beliefs, the florist's certainty that death was merely an end, not a necessary turn in a vast, indifferent wheel. <words>234</words>
A profound shift, subtle yet seismic, began within her; the morbid florist saw her work not as service to grief, but as participation in the cycle. <words>260</words>
The guttering lantern emitted its final, feeble gasp, plunging the dojo into near-total darkness save for the candle's small, defiant flame. <words>284</words>
In that boldly timid moment, illuminated only by the plain white candle, Elara understood: arranging flowers for the dead was her small act of cosmic alignment. <words>309</words>
She carefully placed the candle atop the writer’s trunk, a new ritual born from the typed pages, honoring the cycle she now perceived. <words>332</words>
The floating rocks seemed to hum with a deeper resonance, no longer just stone, but fragments of a breathing universe she was finally learning to read. <words>357</words>
Her hands, usually steady only with stems, trembled slightly as she closed the trunk, the weight of understanding both terrifying and serene. <words>381</words>
The morbid florist had obliged the past, and in the candle's last steady glow before dawn, her tempered beliefs found a new, quiet equilibrium. <words>405</words>
She would return tomorrow, not to mourn, but to witness the cycle continue, neutrally passionate amidst the drifting stones. <words>425</words>
The plain white candle burned low, a perfect circle of light holding back the infinite dark, just as the writer had promised it would. <words>449</words>
