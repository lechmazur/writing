The hesitant bard clutched his worn-out dinosaur plush, its threadbare scales cool against his palm, as he stood in the xenon-lit tunnel marking the crossing of a year everyone would rather forget. <words>28</words>
Its faint, synthetic scent was the only anchor against the fragility of time pressing in, a tangible reminder of childhood innocence now frayed like the plush’s seams. <words>50</words>
He needed to motivate the shattered citizens above, to unravel the suffocating tapestry woven from their collective sorrow after the devastating floods. <words>71</words>
Shyly loud, his voice cracked as he activated the humming dream-hopping machines, their blue light reflecting in his wide, uncertain eyes. <words>90</words>
Each machine was a fragile vessel, designed to slip between sleeping minds, seeking the hidden knots in the city’s grief. <words>108</words>
He’d spent months calibrating them, fueled by the desperate hope that shared dreams could mend what waking hours could not. <words>126</words>
Tonight, the final crossing, he’d plunge deepest, guided only by the plush—a relic from a simpler time before the waters rose. <words>146</words>
Stepping into the machine’s embrace, he felt the familiar lurch, the tunnel dissolving into swirling, fragmented dreamscape. <words>161</words>
He moved through fractured memories: a child’s laughter cut short, a mother’s empty chair, the relentless roar of water. <words>178</words>
Each sorrow was a thread in the vast, dark tapestry choking the city’s spirit. <words>191</words>
His mission was clear: find the central knot, the moment of shared despair binding them all. <words>206</words>
He followed a faint, discordant melody—his own lullaby, hummed shakily in the real world—toward a pulsing nexus of pain. <words>224</words>
There, amidst swirling images of the flood’s peak, he saw it: a colossal, intricate knot woven from tears and terror. <words>243</words>
Hesitating, he remembered the plush’s worn snout, kissed a thousand times for courage. <words>257</words>
Shyly loud, he began to sing, his voice trembling but resonant, weaving a counter-melody of fragile hope into the sorrow-tapestry. <words>277</words>
The dream-hopping machines amplified his song, threading it through every sleeping mind connected to the network. <words>293</words>
As the melody spread, the central knot began to loosen, individual threads of grief gently untangling. <words>309</words>
He saw faces in the dreamscape soften, shoulders relax, the xenon-blue light of the tunnel seeming to brighten within the dream. <words>328</words>
It wasn’t erasure, but release; the fragility of time meant sorrow could be held, not carried forever. <words>345</words>
Emerging from the machine, dawn bled grey at the tunnel’s end, the old year finally gone. <words>360</words>
Citizens above would wake with lighter hearts, unaware of the bard’s quiet battle in the dream-realm. <words>375</words>
He clutched the dinosaur plush tighter, a wave of ironic awe washing over him: such profound healing sparked by a shy voice and a child’s toy. <words>398</words>
The xenon lights hummed on, illuminating the path forward, the tapestry of sorrow now rewoven with threads of fragile, shared dawn. <words>416</words>
