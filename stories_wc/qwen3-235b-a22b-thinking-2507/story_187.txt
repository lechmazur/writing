The stoic wanderer stepped into the witch's familiar training ground, a mist-laced clearing where spectral foxes practiced shadow-weaving, just as the teacher wiped the final formula away with a sigh. <words>24</words>
His motivation—to archive ritual practices before they vanished into silence—had driven him here by following a trail of nightmares, each vision a fractured echo of failed magic. <words>45</words>
Clutched under his arm was a floorboard from an abandoned cabin, its surface mesmerizingly bland, worn smooth by decades of forgotten footsteps yet humming with latent power. <words>68</words>
He knew the necessary lies he’d tell: claiming neutrality while secretly seeking to preserve knowledge the coven deemed too dangerous to keep. <words>88</words>
"Stop," he imposed, his voice brash yet laced with tenderness as he knelt, placing the bland floorboard over the fading chalk lines. <words>107</words>
The teacher, her eyes weary, watched as the wood absorbed the residual magic, its plain grain now etching the erased formula in silver light. <words>128</words>
This archive was his penance; he’d once been a witch who’d fled after nightmares consumed his own familiar, leaving him hollow. <words>147</words>
The floorboard’s blandness was its shield—unassuming enough to bypass wards, yet perfect for capturing rituals without distortion. <words>165</words>
"Your wiping it won’t unmake the hunger behind it," he said, tone rough with care, recalling how nightmares had led him here through poisoned woods. <words>190</words>
She hesitated, then nodded; his lie about scholarly detachment was transparent, but his intent—to safeguard, not wield—felt true. <words>211</words>
As the last symbol bled into the wood, he felt the familiar’s training ground shudder, the air thick with the ghosts of abandoned rites. <words>233</words>
He’d followed nightmares to this moment, each step a necessary lie to himself: that preserving this could mend his fractured soul. <words>256</words>
The floorboard now glowed faintly, a vessel for what the coven feared—rituals that demanded sacrifice but offered understanding. <words>277</words>
"Take it," the teacher murmured, her brash tenderness mirroring his own, "but remember: some truths are buried for a reason." <words>299</words>
He traced the cool wood, its bland surface now a map of salvation, and lied again: "I’ll keep it safe, never use it." <words>322</words>
In truth, he’d need its power to silence his own nightmares, but the lie was necessary—like the coven’s secrecy—to protect the fragile light of knowledge. <words>349</words>
As mist curled around the training ground, he shouldered the floorboard, its weight a promise to honor both the magic and the mercy of forgetting. <words>373</words>
The wanderer turned toward the treeline, the archived formula a quiet heartbeat against his chest, proof that tenderness could wear a brash disguise. <words>398</words>
He walked on, the trail of nightmares behind him, carrying lies that were truer than truth in a world that demanded both preservation and release. <words>423</words>
Each step deepened his resolve: to document the rituals, shield their dangers, and let the bland wood hold what fire could not. <words>445</words>
The forest swallowed him, the floorboard’s plain surface a testament to the necessary fictions that keep magic alive. <words>465</words>
