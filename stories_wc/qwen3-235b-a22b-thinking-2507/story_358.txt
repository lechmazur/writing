The old-fashioned mage adjusted his spectacles, his breath fogging the frost-veiled panes of the arctic research greenhouse amid playground time, when children's distant laughter echoed faintly across the ice. <words>28</words>
He felt the purposefully aimless drift of his thoughts, a necessary state for confronting the unfolding riddle held within the small, obsidian fragment of a pharaoh’s coffin resting on his workbench. <words>55</words>
Its surface, cool and unnervingly smooth, seemed to pulse with a light not of this world, feeding the sanctified dread that had settled deep in his bones since its arrival. <words>82</words>
This fragment, smuggled from a newly discovered tomb, was his key; his motivation was singular – to claim the uncharted frontier of temporal magic it promised, a realm beyond known sorcery. <words>112</words>
He moved slowly, deliberately without direction, through the humid, plant-filled aisles, seeking answers not in scrolls, but through ephemeral encounters with mirror reflections in the greenhouse glass. <words>142</words>
Each pane, slick with condensation and reflecting the weak polar sun, became a shifting portal; in them, hieroglyphs swam and reformed, whispering the riddle’s next layer only when his gaze met his own distorted image. <words>175</words>
The children’s shouts outside faded as the reflections deepened, showing not his aged face, but glimpses of shifting desert sands and the pharaoh’s tomb, the riddle unfolding like a sacred scroll. <words>208</words>
He saw the coffin’s intended purpose – not burial, but a vessel to anchor a forgotten god’s slumber within the earth’s very bones, a frontier of power buried deep. <words>238</words>
Claiming it meant awakening something vast and ancient, a prospect that filled him with holy terror, the sanctified dread intensifying with each mirrored revelation. <words>265</words>
The final reflection showed the fragment glowing fiercely, the last piece clicking into place: the frontier wasn't geographical, but temporal, a moment frozen at the world's creation. <words>295</words>
Understanding crashed over him; the coffin fragment was a key, but using it risked unraveling time itself, a burden heavier than any treasure. <words>318</words>
Purposefully aimless no longer, he returned to the bench, the weight of the uncharted frontier pressing upon him, the children’s play now a stark contrast to the abyss he contemplated. <words>348</words>
Overcome by the sacred silence and the magnitude of his discovery, the mage did the only thing his trembling spirit allowed: he gently gathered the cold fragment to his chest and began to cuddle it. <words>379</words>
It was an act of desperate comfort, a plea for guidance from the ancient stone, holding the heart of the riddle as the greenhouse lights dimmed and the true cost of the frontier settled upon his soul. <words>411</words>
The sanctified dread became a mantle, woven from the pharaoh’s dust and the fragile warmth of the greenhouse, as he prepared to unlock what should perhaps remain forever sealed. <words>442</words>
