Silas, the underwater welder, clutched the dented vintage button box, its brass hinges cold against his calloused palm as he stood beneath the fractured dome of the old planetarium, now pulsing with neon as the night club "Event Horizon." 
<words>38</words>
He felt patiently impatient, waiting for the precise instant at the crossing where two timelines should never meet—the celestial alignment that occurred only once per century, when the club’s shattered projection sphere aligned with a dying star’s light. 
<words>75</words>
His motivation burned clear: to wield improbable power by repairing the box’s temporal circuitry, a device rumored to rewind fractured moments, inherited from his grandfather’s cryptic journals. 
<words>108</words>
Around him, the reimagined planetarium thrummed; DJs spun records where constellations once glowed, and dancers moved through beams of light piercing the broken glass ceiling like liquid starlight.

Silas sought refuge near the club’s vintage store section, where warped mirrors lined the walls, their mercury surfaces clouded with age, offering distorted glimpses into other realities. 
<words>178</words>
He used these reflections to pamper the box’s delicate internals, aligning its frayed wires with a jeweler’s screwdriver while watching phantom versions of himself succeed or fail in the glass. 
<words>213</words>
Each glimpse revealed a different unraveling: one showed the box exploding into stardust, another depicted him drowning in a flooded subway tunnel, a third had him holding a restored planetarium projector. 
<words>250</words>
These moments of unraveling tightened his chest—they were warnings, fragments of timelines colliding at this forbidden junction. 
<words>271</words>
The box, salvaged from a sunken 1920s ocean liner during his last dive, hummed with unstable energy, its mother-of-pearl buttons flickering like dying fireflies. 
<words>299</words>
He remembered his grandfather’s words scrawled in the journal: "Power lives in the pause between heartbeats, where time forgets its name." 
<words>324</words>
Now, as the club’s bass throbbed through the floor, Silas knew the crossing point neared—the exact second when past and future bled together. 
<words>352</words>
He adjusted a final wire via a mirror’s glimpse, his hands steady despite the inherited mystery pressing down like deep-sea pressure. 
<words>378</words>
The box began to vibrate, emitting a low chime as the timelines converged; reality shimmered, and the vintage mirrors flashed with impossible scenes—a coral-covered city, a sky raining clocks. 
<words>412</words>
This was the unraveling: the moment the planetarium’s broken heart synced with the cosmos, and Silas chose not to control time, but to mend it. 
<words>443</words>
He pressed the central button, not for power, but to seal the fracture, feeling the timelines knit together as the club’s lights softened into a gentle aurora. 
<words>476</words>
The vintage button box dissolved into silver dust in his hands, its purpose fulfilled, leaving only the quiet hum of a universe made whole again.
