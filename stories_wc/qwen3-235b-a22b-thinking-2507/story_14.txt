Silas, the naive gambler, scraped wax from the rustic candle mold during candlelit dinners at the tidal power monitoring station, his fingers trembling with the unspoken bargains he made nightly with the indifferent sea. <words>28</words>
He believed the tides, rarely predictable like his dice throws, held patterns only he could decipher, a delusion nurtured by the station’s isolation. <words>48</words>
Each evening, over lukewarm stew, the other technicians avoided his manic eyes, knowing his latest bet hinged on the midnight surge predicted by the unhinged professors. <words>72</words>
Those professors, exiled for their rebellious midnight lectures on the ocean’s sentient rage, had warned the station’s collapse was inevitable, a truth Silas twisted into gambling fodder. <words>100</words>
His motivation was singular: to capture one last spark before oblivion, not through science, but by winning big enough to buy passage inland. <words>124</words>
Tonight, the tide charts screamed disaster, yet Silas saw only the perfect confluence for his final wager—a bet placed via cracked radio to a shadowy syndicate. <words>151</words>
He rushed to the dock, the rustic candle mold clutched like a talisman, its hollow shape a mockery of the void he raced to outrun. <words>176</words>
The professors’ words echoed: "The sea doesn’t bargain, boy. It collects." But Silas, ever naive, thought his candle mold could trap light, hope, salvation. <words>206</words>
As the first monstrous wave breached the seawall, he jammed the mold into the generator’s dying core, seeking to capture one last spark before oblivion. <words>234</words>
Saltwater flooded the control room, extinguishing the dinner candles, but Silas laughed through tears, the mold filling with eerie, blue-tinged light from the failing tidal array. <words>263</words>
It was beautiful, this final gamble—a flicker in the mold, the station’s last gasp, as predictable as chaos and utterly, devastatingly rare. <words>290</words>
The professors’ lectures had been right; the sea collected its due, but Silas, in his madness, had bartered for this moment of radiant despair. <words>317</words>
He held the warm mold aloft, laughing tears freezing on his cheeks, the light within pulsing like a captured heartbeat against the encroaching dark. <words>344</words>
This was his win: not escape, but a fleeting spark witnessed, a testament etched in wax as the tidal station surrendered to the hungry dock. <words>371</words>
The syndicate’s money meant nothing now, yet Silas grinned, the naive gambler who’d finally understood the only unspoken bargain worth making was with the end itself. <words>400</words>
He watched the spark fade, still laughing, as the ocean claimed everything but the memory of light held in a rustic candle mold. <words>425</words>
