<story>Aris Thorne ran trembling fingers over the photograph of his daughter’s seventh birthday, the ink bleeding into ghostly smudges like smoke caught in amber. [38] He was retrocognitively trapped within his own creation—the living bridge garden—a prison woven from hyperbolic geometry and regret. [65] Each morning, the hedges breathed and shifted around him, their impossible curves folding time into origami shapes that defied Euclidean logic. [96] Aris had designed this maze to be a sanctuary, a place where visitors could lose themselves to find clarity, but the halo fragment embedded in the central arched bridge had fractured reality instead. [138] That shard of celestial metal, salvaged from a fallen cathedral statue, pulsed with residual chroniton energy he’d foolishly thought he could harness. [173] His motivation had been pure: to discover the texture of time, to feel its grain beneath his palms like river stone or weathered wood. [210] Now, trapped in the garden’s perpetual construction phase, he watched workmen rebuild the same stone path each dawn, their faces blurred as if viewed through warped glass. [251] The fading photographs in his coat pocket were his only tether to the present—a wedding ring, a seaside vacation, his daughter’s laughter—all dissolving faster each cycle. [293] He knew the halo fragment was the key; its resonance with hyperbolic space had anchored him here, and only by touching it might he unravel time’s fabric. [333] Today, the living bridge shuddered differently, its ivy veins retracting like startled nerves, revealing a hollow beneath the arch where the fragment glowed with cold fire. [375] Aris crawled through damp earth, roots snagging his sleeves, the air thick with the scent of crushed mint and ozone. [407] His heart hammered a rhythm against his ribs as he reached the hollow; the halo fragment lay there, no larger than a walnut, its surface etched with equations that shifted when not observed directly. [458] He grasped it, and the world dissolved into quaking reverie—a trembling awe that vibrated in his molars as the fragment began to disintegrate. [497] Not crumbling, but unspooling through hyperbolic geometry: facets vanishing into non-Euclidean folds, edges retreating into dimensions that had no name. [536] He felt it then—the texture of time—gritty as sand slipping between his fingers, yet viscous as cooled honey, each granule a lost moment. [575] The disintegration accelerated, the fragment’s light fracturing into prismatic shards that pierced the living bridge’s core. [607] Vines recoiled with audible snaps, the bridge groaning as its structural integrity unraveled through warped space. [636] Aris screamed as memories surged—not his own, but the garden’s: centuries of rain, roots drinking deep, the slow sigh of stone yielding to moss. [675] Time wasn’t linear; it was a tapestry woven thread by thread, and the halo fragment’s decay was pulling every stitch loose. [710] He saw his daughter’s photograph flutter from his pocket, the image of her cake-smeared grin dissolving into silver mist. [742] The living bridge collapsed inward, not with a crash but a sigh, as if relieved of an ancient burden. [771] Hyperbolic geometry snapped back to Euclidean normalcy with a sound like tearing silk, and Aris was hurled backward—not through space, but through years. [813] He landed on his knees in overgrown ruins, the living bridge garden now a tangle of dead vines and crumbling arches. [844] Dawn bled across a sky untouched by hedges, and the photograph in his hand was blank except for a watermark shaped like a clock. [877] He touched the soil where the halo fragment had lain; it felt ordinary, inert, and infinitely heavy with absence. [908] The texture of time was grief, he realized, and it lived in the hollow where memories used to be. [938] He rose, leaving the fading photographs behind, and walked toward a world that had moved on without him. [970]</story>
