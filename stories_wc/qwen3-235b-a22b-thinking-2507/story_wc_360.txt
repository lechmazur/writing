<story>The last star bled out at 3:17 AM, leaving the topaz workshop suspended in the fragile hush between vanishing stars. [42] Aris, the cryptic letterpress operator, traced the cold edge of a lead type slug, their fingers stained with indigo ink and the residue of other people’s voices. [85] They habitually borrowed personalities, absorbing the cadences and tics of customers whose mourning notices or wedding broadsides they set—now speaking with a widow’s tremor, now a merchant’s bluster, never quite their own. [138] Tonight, the workshop smelled of ozone and burnt sugar, the air thick with lucid turbulence, clear yet churning. [181]  

Beneath a drawer crammed with discarded ‘e’s and fractured ampersands, Aris’s knuckles brushed something warm. [213] Not metal, not glass—a halo fragment, palm-sized, shimmering with internal light like captured starlight. [247] It pulsed faintly, humming a frequency that vibrated in their molars. [275] Aris had spent years seeking the mathematics of emotion, sketching equations in the margins of proof sheets, desperate to quantify the ache in a widow’s sigh or the brittle joy in a debutante’s laugh. [334] This fragment felt like an answer carved from light. [360]  

They held it aloft. The fragment didn’t illuminate; it absorbed the dim lantern glow, refracting it into shifting geometries on the ceiling—a language of angles and sorrow. [412] Transposed empathy flooded Aris: not their own grief, but the raw, hollow despair of Mrs. Elara Vance, whose husband’s obituary they’d typeset that afternoon. [463] Aris gasped, doubling over as the widow’s loneliness became their own, a cold stone in the chest. [500] The halo fragment didn’t just transmit emotion—it inverted it, mapping one soul’s pain onto another’s nervous system with chilling precision. [549]  

Aris staggered to the workbench, fumbling for their notebook. [572] They sketched feverishly: sine waves for rising panic, fractal patterns for lingering sorrow. [602] If they could chart this transposition, derive a formula for the transfer… perhaps they could control the borrowing, stop becoming everyone but themselves. [642] But the fragment’s light shifted, and suddenly Aris was laughing—a high, brittle sound that wasn’t theirs. [678] They’d borrowed the manic glee of young Mr. Thorne, whose engagement announcement they’d printed yesterday, unaware his fiancée had already left town. [724] The deliberate ambiguity of the fragment disoriented them utterly; was this joy real, or the echo of a lie? [758]  

Aris dropped the fragment. It landed softly on a sheet of freshly set type for tomorrow’s dawn edition. [789] The lead letters—‘GRIEF IS A SILENT TIDE’—seemed to writhe under its glow. [815] Panic surged. What if the empathy bled into the press? What if every printed word carried this borrowed agony into the town? [850] They couldn’t let Mrs. Vance’s sorrow infect a grocery list, or Thorne’s delusion taint a church bulletin. [881] Their quest for the mathematics of emotion had always been a shield against drowning in others’ lives. [911] Now, the shield was a conduit. [924]  

Moonlight, thin and cold, bled through the high workshop window. [947] Aris picked up the fragment one last time, not to analyze, but to feel. [972] The transposed empathy washed over them—not Vance’s grief, not Thorne’s false joy, but something older, vaster: the collective sigh of everyone who’d ever held a printed page, every tear shed over ink-stained news. [1036] The mathematics dissolved. Emotion wasn’t a solvable equation; it was a current flowing between souls, ambiguous and unbroken. [1076] The halo fragment wasn’t a tool. It was a reminder. [1100]  

Aris placed the fragment back in the drawer, covering it with stray ‘e’s. [1125] They lit the press’s gas lamp, the flame steady in the lucid turbulence. [1150] Tomorrow’s broadside awaited: a simple harvest notice. [1172] Aris took a deep breath, their own breath, and began to set the type. [1198] The borrowed voices would come, as they always did. [1219] But now, they’d listen—not to solve, but to carry. [1240] The stars were gone. The work remained. [1258]
