The cobalt dock after rain glistened like a drowned sapphire, slick planks reflecting bruised clouds and the occasional glint of a streetlamp’s mercy. [19]  
No footsteps echoed here—not since the last ferryman vanished—but the silent canal guardian remained, hooded and motionless beneath the rusted awning, spiralingly calm as the tide’s whisper. [42]  
She did not speak, not because she could not, but because silence was her dialect, her covenant with the drowned and the dreaming. [64]  
Her fingers, long and ink-stained, traced the damp wood grain as if reading braille left by ghosts who’d slipped beneath the surface. [86]  
Beside her, nestled in a leather satchel stitched with silver thread, lay a dental mirror—stolen not from a clinic, but from a child’s abandoned treasure box, its handle carved with clumsy constellations. [118]  
It was her most sacred tool, not for inspecting teeth, but for catching fragments of light no eye should witness: the glimmer of a soul still clinging, the shimmer of a regret not yet sunk. [154]  
She would crouch at the water’s edge, angling the mirror beneath the surface, weaving reflections into brief, shimmering constellations that danced just beneath the meniscus. [182]  
This was her action: to weave—not thread or song, but hope’s geometry, drawn in liquid silver and refracted moonlight. [205]  
Her method? Creating patterns with shutters—not window shutters, but the iron grates that sealed off side-channels, each hinge oiled to whisper rather than groan. [234]  
By tilting them just so, she could sculpt the spill of lamplight into glyphs only the lost could read: arrows pointing upward, spirals guiding breath, crescents cradling courage. [269]  
The canal’s darkness watched her, ancient and hungry, but she did not fear it. [284]  
Her motivation was older than the city’s foundations: to teach darkness the value of stars—not by banishing it, but by showing it what it swallows can still shine. [320]  
She remembered the boy who’d leapt from Bridge Seven, convinced his shame was heavier than water. [342]  
She’d found his shoe snagged on a piling, and beneath it, the mirror caught his final gasp—not despair, but wonder—as starlight, bent through her shutter-glyphs, touched his sinking cheek. [382]  
That memory fueled her now, within the edge of a half-spoken secret—the rumor whispered in taverns that the guardian wasn’t guarding the canal at all, but the threshold between drowning and deciding. [425]  
Fishermen avoided her stretch; lovers never lingered. [434]  
They sensed the stillwater tension—not menace, but presence, like standing beside a held breath before a symphony’s first note. [462]  
Tonight, a new shadow approached—not human, not quite. [474]  
A shape coalesced from the mist near Lock Nine, formless at first, then resolving into the silhouette of a woman who’d walked into the canal wearing Sunday’s best, twenty winters past. [511]  
The guardian did not startle. [517]  
She rose, slow as silt settling, and lifted the dental mirror, angling it toward the iron grate above the lock’s spillway. [541]  
With a fingertip, she nudged the shutter left—then right—then left again, etching a triple spiral into the spill of cobalt light. [570]  
The drowned woman paused, head tilting as if hearing a lullaby in a forgotten tongue. [592]  
The guardian wove faster now, shutter-clicks soft as moth wings, casting glyphs onto the water: a ladder of light, a door of dawn, a single star held in cupped hands. [627]  
The drowned woman reached—not for the surface, but for the reflection—her fingers brushing the mirror’s captured gleam. [652]  
In that touch, silent empathy passed like current: no words, no pleas, just the understanding that darkness need not be enemy, only audience. [686]  
The woman smiled—first time since her wedding day—and sank again, but slower, gentler, cradled by glyphs that lingered like afterimages. [716]  
The guardian lowered the mirror, wiped dew from its face with her sleeve, and returned it to her satchel. [738]  
Above, the clouds thinned. [742]  
One true star pierced through, its light falling straight into the canal, unbroken, unswallowed. [762]  
The guardian nodded, spiralingly calm, and stepped back into shadow—her work, as always, half-spoken, half-seen, wholly necessary. [790]
