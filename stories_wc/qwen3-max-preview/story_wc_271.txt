The arboretum perched on a seaside cliff had been abandoned since the last lighthouse keeper vanished, leaving behind wind-rattled glass and salt-crusted benches. [18]
I came here not for solace but for calibration—to anchor optimism in realism, as my therapist gently insisted I must. [33]
I am a drone strike wedding survivor; my left leg still remembers the blast through somatic markers—phantom twinges that flare when storms brew or silence grows too loud. [57]
In my coat pocket rests a crumpled photograph: my sister mid-laugh, veil askew, champagne flute raised, seconds before the sky split open. [80]
I don’t unfold it often. [83]
The paper fibers have memorized my fingers’ tremors, and the image, though faded, still carries the scent of jasmine and gunpowder. [103]
I am quietly talented—not at anything grand, but at noticing: how moss climbs stone in spirals, how gulls time their cries between waves, how silence can be stitched into something wearable. [132]
The arboretum’s overgrown paths suit me; nature here doesn’t apologize for its wildness, nor does it demand my healing. [154]
I walk barefoot on damp soil, letting my soles register texture, temperature, root—grounding myself through somatic markers the way my body therapist taught me: pressure equals presence. [184]
One afternoon, while tracing the bark of a storm-bent cypress, I freeze. [195]
Not from fear, not from memory—this freeze is different. [204]
It comes like a held breath beneath the ribs, a sudden pearl of stillness forming in the hollow behind my sternum. [222]
I don’t fight it. [225]
I let the moment swell: wind halts mid-sigh, leaves pause their rustle, even the tide below seems to suspend its crash. [247]
In that freeze, I see the photograph unfold in my mind—not as a relic of loss, but as a frame of pure, unguarded joy. [274]
My sister’s laugh echoes, not as a ghost, but as a frequency I’m finally tuned to receive. [294]
The pearl of stillness expands—not erasing the past, but holding it gently, like a shell cradling the sea’s memory without drowning in it. [324]
I sit on a bench where ivy has swallowed the slats, and for the first time since the strike, I let myself cry without counting the tears or timing their end. [357]
The crumpled photograph remains in my pocket, but its weight has shifted—not anchor, not burden, but compass. [381]
I begin sketching again, something I abandoned after the wedding. [391]
Quietly talented, yes—but now the talent serves something beyond survival. [406]
I draw the gnarled roots of the cliffside oaks, the way light fractures through broken greenhouse panes, the ghostly outline of the old lighthouse beam still etched into the fog. [440]
Each line is a somatic marker of its own—a tactile echo of attention paid, of presence claimed. [463]
I return every dawn. [467]
No one else comes; the path is overgrown, the gate rusted shut to most. [482]
But I climb through the gap in the fence like a secret kept between me and the cliff. [500]
One morning, I find a single pearl resting on the bench where I sit. [514]
Not literal—no oyster could survive here—but a dewdrop caught in a spider’s web, round and trembling, catching the first gold of sunrise. [540]
I name it. [542]
The Pearl of Stillness. [545]
It evaporates by noon, but its shape lingers in my palm, in my breath, in the way I now pause before reacting, before recoiling, before assuming the sky will split again. [585]
I start leaving sketches tucked into tree hollows—drawings of birds mid-flight, of waves cresting without breaking, of my sister’s smile preserved not in grief but in motion. [624]
I don’t sign them. [627]
Let them be gifts to whoever finds them, if anyone ever does. [642]
The arboretum, in its quiet decay, becomes my collaborator. [652]
Vines curl around my unfinished drawings like frames. [660]
Rain blurs the ink into watercolor ghosts. [667]
Wind carries petals onto the pages, turning them into accidental collages. [682]
I no longer come to escape. [687]
I come to witness—to hold the coexistence of ruin and regrowth, terror and tenderness, collapse and the quiet insistence of green things pushing through. [721]
The drone strike taught me the world can fracture without warning. [734]
The arboretum teaches me that stillness—true, deep stillness—is not the absence of chaos, but the eye within it. [760]
I carry the pearl now, not in my pocket, but in my pulse. [770]
