The blank-faced performer sat on the farmhouse porch, whittling a block of pine into nothing recognizable, shavings curling like ghosts at their boots. [14]
Behind them, the giant wind turbines loomed like skeletal sentinels, their blades slicing the sky with a remade hush — no longer natural silence, but engineered quiet, mandated after the Happiness Decree outlawed mourning’s noise. [38]
They had arrived here three weeks prior, fleeing the city’s enforced smiles and mandatory joy-parades, seeking refuge where grief could breathe without prosecution. [58]
In their lap lay a dried flower bouquet, brittle petals the color of old bruises, tied with twine that had frayed at the edges — a relic from the last funeral they’d dared attend. [84]
They whittled not to create, but to erode; each stroke a subtraction, each curl of wood a whispered defiance against the world’s demand to be light, to be bright, to be unburdened. [112]
The farmhouse, inherited from a nameless aunt, smelled of dust and damp insulation, its windows rattling faintly whenever the turbines paused for maintenance — brief, stolen moments of true silence. [142]
They dramatically narrated mundane tasks aloud, voice flat as parchment: “Now, the knife meets grain. Resistance is minimal. The wood surrenders without dignity.” [165]
It was theater for no audience, a ritual to anchor them in the hollow between feeling and function — morally ambiguous, perhaps, to perform grief as spectacle while feeling nothing at all. [193]
Neighbors had stopped by twice — cheerful, clipboard-wielding Compliance Officers — to inquire why their Happiness Quotient hadn’t uploaded in 47 days. [214]
They’d offered tea, smiled without muscle, and lied with flawless syntax: “I’m cultivating lightness in grief, per subsection 7-D of the Mandate’s therapeutic allowances.” [243]
The officers, satisfied by the jargon, left behind pamphlets on “Joyful Woodcarving” and “Bouquet-Based Emotional Realignment.” [263]
They burned the pamphlets in the rusted stove, feeding the flames with dried marigolds plucked from the bouquet, one by one, whispering, “Combustion is cooperation. Ash is amnesty.” [293]
At night, they’d sit beneath the turbines’ shadow, whittling by moonlight, narrating: “The blade angles left. The edge catches. A sliver fractures off — insignificant, yet irreplaceable.” [325]
The dried bouquet sat beside them always, not as tribute, but as witness — its decay a counter-rhythm to the turbines’ mechanical lullaby, its crumbling form a silent rebellion against mandated renewal. [360]
They knew the authorities would return; non-compliance, even passive, had expiration dates. [375]
So they prepared — not to flee, not to fight, but to perform. [387]
They whittled a hollow into the pine block, just large enough to cradle the bouquet. [402]
Then, with slow ceremony, they placed the brittle flowers inside, sealed the lid with beeswax, and carved a single word along its side: “Permitted.” [427]
The next morning, they walked to the Compliance Station, bouquet-box in hand, face still blank, voice still steady. [448]
“I’ve completed my grief cultivation,” they announced, placing the box on the counter. [464]
The officer, young and earnest, scanned the box with a handheld aura-reader. [480]
“Emotional residue: negligible. Intent: compliant. Narrative framing: exemplary,” the device chimed. [500]
The officer beamed. “You’ve remade your sorrow into sanctioned serenity! This will be featured in next quarter’s Model Citizen Bulletin!” [528]
They nodded, accepted the certificate of Emotional Realignment, and walked back beneath the turbines, the remade hush heavier than ever. [556]
That evening, they returned to the porch, took up a new block of wood, and began again — whittling, narrating, eroding. [578]
“Today’s task: hollowing. The center must be deep enough to hold what the world refuses to name.” [603]
The dried bouquet was gone, but its ghost lingered in every shaving, every pause, every mechanical sigh of the turbines overhead. [630]
They weren’t healing. [633]
They weren’t lying. [636]
They were surviving — morally ambiguous, emotionally void, cultivating lightness not by shedding grief, but by carving it into shapes the world would tolerate. [668]
The wind stirred, and for three seconds, the nearest turbine stalled. [683]
In that sliver of true silence, they whispered, “I miss you,” to no one, to everyone, to the empty air. [708]
Then the blade resumed its work, the turbines their hum, and the performer their hollow craft — whittling absence into artifact, narrating emptiness as obedience, remaking hush into armor. [743]
The dried bouquet had served its purpose. [750]
Tomorrow, they’d begin again — lighter, emptier, perfectly compliant. [764]
