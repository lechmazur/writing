I woke in the mountain ranger cabin to the scent of pine resin and damp wool, my fingers tracing the birch bark scroll unfurled across my lap like a fossilized confession. [18]
After seeing your own grave—cracked marble, choked with ivy, name half-erased by time—I’d fled to these peaks, not to grieve, but to map the chaos gnawing at my ribs. [40]
I am a lucid dream chronicler by trade, by curse, by compulsion: paid to wander others’ subconscious labyrinths and return with legible myths. [60]
But since the cemetery, my own dreams have curdled into feral nostalgia—not sweet longing, but rabid, snarling recollections that bite and won’t let go. [82]
I remember my tenth birthday cake, the frosting blue as glacier ice, then watch it rot in real-time while my mother’s laugh turns to static. [104]
I soar over childhood rooftops in dreams now, not with joy, but with the weight of knowing I’ll never land where I began. [125]
Chronologically confused, I misplace decades like mismatched socks; I’ll reach for my thermos and find my college thesis instead, or mistake today’s sunrise for the one after my first heartbreak. [156]
The cabin walls breathe with old timber sighs, and the wind outside scrapes branches like quills against parchment—fitting, since I’m here to distill chaos into narrative, to leash the feral with ink. [188]
But tonight, the birch bark scroll refuses to cooperate; its fibers repel my pen, as if memory itself resists being tamed. [208]
That’s when I see him—my twenty-two-year-old self—leaning in the doorway, sunburned and smug, holding the guitar I sold for rent money. [228]
He doesn’t speak, just strums a chord that vibrates in my molars, a tune I wrote drunk on cheap wine and cheaper hope. [248]
I’m getting jealous of past selves again, a habit as corrosive as it is predictable. [263]
He had no idea what loss tasted like, no concept of graves with his name, no ink-stained fingers trembling at 3 a.m. trying to make sense of fractured time. [293]
I want to scream at him to save the guitar, to kiss that girl goodbye properly, to memorize the exact shade of twilight before the storm hits. [321]
Instead, I reach for the scroll, and this time, the ink flows—thick, black, hungry. [334]
I write about the jealousy, raw and unvarnished, how it sharpens my focus like a blade on stone. [352]
The younger me flickers, fades, replaced by my thirty-five-year-old self—tie askew, eyes hollow, holding a resignation letter I never sent. [376]
He stares at me like I’m the ghost, then vanishes with a sigh that smells like stale coffee and regret. [396]
I soar again in the next dream-sequence, but now I’m not fleeing—I’m hunting. [410]
I chase versions of myself through collapsing libraries and burning playgrounds, each encounter fuel for the scroll. [429]
The birch bark darkens with script, absorbing my rage, my awe, my jaded wonder at how brightly we burn before we gutter out. [456]
By dawn, the scroll is full: not a memoir, not a eulogy, but a cartography of collapse—each ink-stroke a landmark in the wilderness of what-was. [484]
I roll it tight, tie it with sinew from a dream-deer I once conjured to escape loneliness. [501]
Outside, the mountain exhales mist over valleys I’ll never hike sober again. [516]
I don’t know if the scroll will make sense to anyone else; that’s not the point. [532]
The point is the distillation—the alchemy of turning feral nostalgia into something legible, something that doesn’t claw at your throat when you wake. [563]
I pocket the scroll, shrug on my coat, and step into the cold. [578]
The grave is still there, waiting, but it’s smaller now, less a verdict and more a footnote. [598]
Chronologically confused? Maybe. [601]
But I’m no longer lost inside the tangle—I’m the one braiding the threads, even if they lead backward, sideways, upside-down. [626]
I get jealous of past selves because they still believed in clean endings. [645]
I know better now. [648]
Endings are just seams where one story stitches into the next, ragged but resilient. [669]
The birch bark scroll hums against my thigh, warm as living skin. [685]
At the trailhead, I pause, look back at the cabin—its windows like half-lidded eyes, watching. [703]
Then I turn, and without wings, without wind, without even trying, I soar. [719]
Not away. [721]
Not toward. [723]
Just… through. [726]
The chaos isn’t gone. [729]
But now, it has a shape. [734]
And a name. [736]
Mine. [737]
