Sir Edmund stared at his reflection in the salt-crusted mirror, watching decades of battles and betrayals map themselves across his weathered face. <words>21</words>

The brass door knocker echoed through the lighthouse prison's spiral stairwell, each knock matching the rhythm of waves crashing against the reef below. <words>42</words>

He had been sentenced here not for his crimes, but for his mercy – sparing the witch-queen's life when duty demanded her death, and now she ruled with grudgingly sweet benevolence that made his choice seem both right and terribly wrong. <words>84</words>

In the mirror's depths, he watched his past self collect seemingly random tokens: a child's wooden sword, a handful of crow feathers, the witch-queen's copper tears, and a piece of the castle's foundation stone. <words>127</words>

Each night, he arranged these items in different patterns on his cell floor, seeking meaning in their configuration, until one evening they aligned like constellation points marking a path through his regret. <words>164</words>

The mirror showed him both forward and backward through time – the knight he had been, proud and certain, and the prisoner he had become, humbled yet strangely at peace. <words>200</words>

He was beginning to appreciate the exquisite torture of his sentence: to be imprisoned in this place where every reflection forced him to witness the rippling consequences of his impossible choice. <words>237</words>

The witch-queen's weekly visits were a special agony, her kindness more cutting than any blade as she brought him books, blankets, and news of the prospering kingdom – each gift a reminder that his mercy had birthed an unexpected grace. <words>283</words>

Tonight, as he traced the pattern his collected treasures had revealed, he finally understood that the true prison had never been the lighthouse, but the haunting question of whether nobility demanded action or restraint. <words>324</words>

In the mirror, his reflection smiled with joyful resignation as he lifted the brass knocker one final time – not to summon anyone, but to complete the pattern of objects before him. <words>359</words>

The metallic clang rang out across the waters, and in its echo, Sir Edmund felt the last cry of his regret finally fall silent, understanding at last that some choices could be both wrong and right, both punishment and redemption. <words>408</words>

As dawn broke over the jagged reef, the mirror showed him one last truth: the pattern of his collected items matched perfectly with the constellation of choices that had led him here, each piece a star in the story of his transformed heart. <words>470</words>
