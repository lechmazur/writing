The farmers market bustled beneath Mount Obsidian as Maya studied the baseball in her hands, its pristine surface marred only by an impossible signature: her own name, dated 2157. <words>33</words>

She'd discovered it the same day she learned of her twin, separated at birth, who'd been hiring actors to impersonate their shared face across the country. <words>63</words>

The prophecy, whispered by the mountain's crystal shadows at sunset, spoke of twins whose reunion would trigger humanity's end – unless one could subdue the other before the next blood moon. <words>97</words>

Maya traced the baseball's stitching, remembering how the time traveler had pressed it into her hands last week, their clandestine meeting in the mountain's forgotten quartz cave illuminated only by phosphorescent moss. <words>134</words>

"Your sister seeks the forbidden knowledge too," the traveler had warned, their typically unique temporal signature rippling like heat waves. <words>155</words>

Now, weaving through stalls of local produce and handmade crafts, Maya spotted another actor wearing her face – this one more convincing than the last dozen, but still missing the small scar above her left eyebrow. <words>195</words>

She followed the impostor through the crowd, past pyramids of fresh apples and strings of dried chilies, until they ducked into a narrow passage between market stalls that shouldn't have existed. <words>231</words>

The passage opened onto a hidden switchback trail that wound up Mount Obsidian's northern face, where ancient petroglyphs warned of cosmic cycles and divine twins. <words>260</words>

As Maya climbed higher, the market's cheerful chaos faded into the mountain's knowing silence, and she felt the weight of the baseball in her pocket – proof that at least one possible future ended in survival rather than apocalypse. <words>303</words>

Near the peak, she found her twin at last – not an actor this time, but a mirror image complete with the scar, sitting cross-legged before a crystalline altar that caught and fractured the late afternoon light. <words>347</words>

"I knew you'd come," her sister said without turning, "I've been hiring those actors to draw you here, where the veil between timelines is thinnest." <words>376</words>

Maya gripped the baseball tighter as her sister continued, "The prophecy doesn't specify which twin survives, only that one must fall for humanity to continue." <words>405</words>

The crystal altar hummed with ancient power as Maya stepped forward, understanding now why the time traveler had given her the baseball – not as a weapon, but as proof that she would make the right choice. <words>446</words>

"Then let's change the game," Maya said, placing the signed baseball on the altar between them, watching as its presence created ripples in reality itself, "Because in 2157, we're both still alive." <words>482</words>

The mountain's crystal shadows danced around them as the twins joined hands across the altar, their combined will subduing not each other, but the prophecy itself, rewriting the future one impossible signature at a time. <words>525</words>
