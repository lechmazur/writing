Miranda adjusted the leashes of her four-legged clients as she approached the iron gates of Blackwood Manor, where even the wealthiest residents of Greenwich avoided treading after sunset. <words>33</words>

The fading daylight painted long shadows across the unkempt botanical garden, where rare specimens from the previous owner's collection still thrived in their careful neglect. <words>63</words>

She hadn't planned to enter the mansion today, but Mrs. Rothschild's prized Afghan hound had slipped his collar and darted through a broken window, leaving Miranda no choice but to follow, the other dogs pulling eagerly at their leads. <words>103</words>

The dining room, with its dust-draped chandelier and collection of preserved plants in antique bell jars, seemed to pulse with an energy that made the dogs whimper and press against her legs. <words>140</words>

It was here, three months ago during a mobile blood drive event in this very room, that Miranda had first encountered the mansion's mysterious new owner – a meeting that had led to their peculiar arrangement. <words>177</words>

She remembered his carefully careless proposal: she could walk her clients' dogs through his prized botanical grounds if she agreed to never question the strange sounds, the moving shadows, or the occasional disappearance of the more curious neighborhood pets. <words>220</words>

As twilight bled through the tall windows, Miranda found herself justifying her silence to the empty room, explaining to invisible listeners why she continued to honor their wordless contract despite the growing unease that plagued her nights. <words>263</words>

The Afghan hound emerged from behind a velvet-covered settee, clutching something in his mouth that made Miranda's breath catch – a leather-bound journal filled with pressed flowers and handwritten notes about their supernatural properties. <words>305</words>

She knew she should leave immediately, but her fingers traced the ancient pages, understanding now why she had been drawn to this place – not out of necessity or obligation, but because she needed to prove she could face what others feared to acknowledge. <words>358</words>

The dogs grew restless as darkness claimed the room, their whines cutting through the thick silence that seemed to watch and wait, but Miranda stood her ground, finally recognizing that she had become part of this place's story – another carefully tended specimen in its vast collection of secrets. <words>421</words>

As she gathered the dogs and made her way back through the grounds, the journal tucked safely in her bag, Miranda felt the mansion's eyes upon her, acknowledging their shared understanding: some truths, like certain flowers, only bloom in darkness, and some agreements need no words to bind them. <words>484</words>

The iron gates closed behind her with a gentle click that echoed like thunder in the gathering night, and Miranda smiled, knowing she would return tomorrow – not because she had to, but because the mansion, like her, had learned to cultivate its solitude with precise intention. <words>543</words>
