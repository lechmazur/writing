Marcus adjusted his apron behind the counter of the Coffee Crankshaft, the only café operating inside Hal's Transmission Repair, and sighed as another customer's thoughts leaked into his mind. <words>27</words>

The autumn wind rattled the garage doors while late September sunshine struggled through the grease-stained windows, marking that peculiar time when summer surrendered to fall. <words>49</words>

He twirled his grandmother's antique button hook between his fingers – a habit that helped him focus when the mental noise became too much – as he sorted through the jumbled thoughts of mechanics and frustrated car owners. <words>82</words>

His real work wasn't serving lattes to irritated customers whose transmissions had failed; it was decoding his great-grandfather's weather journals, which documented strange atmospheric patterns through an arcane system of coffee stains and cryptic marginalia. <words>116</words>

The journals had become his obsession after he discovered that his great-grandfather, also a telepath, had learned to predict catastrophic weather events by studying glacier formations, leaving his findings hidden in what appeared to be mundane café records. <words>152</words>

Marcus had developed an efficiently inefficient system of his own: brewing elaborate drinks with precise timing and temperature measurements that mimicked the ice crystal patterns his ancestor had documented, each beverage an attempt to unlock the journals' secrets. <words>190</words>

"Your transmission's shot," a mechanic announced to someone nearby, the words barely registering as Marcus traced the foam pattern in a customer's latte, comparing it to a photograph of glacial striations he'd tucked into his workstation. <words>226</words>

He'd abandoned a promising career as a meteorologist to work in this unlikely place, cloaking his true purpose behind the steam wands and espresso machines, knowing that success might not look like what others expected. <words>263</words>

The regulars thought him charmingly eccentric, this barista who could somehow anticipate their orders before they spoke, who decorated their drinks with impossibly intricate patterns that looked suspiciously like weather formations. <words>296</words>

Today felt different though; the button hook had grown unusually warm in his pocket, and the morning's coffee grounds had settled into a formation he'd seen before in his great-grandfather's most urgent entries. <words>334</words>

As he steamed milk for another order, Marcus caught fragments of thought-static from a customer reading a news article about unprecedented weather patterns, and suddenly the journal entries began clicking into place like tumblers in a lock. <words>372</words>

The foam swirled in the cup exactly like the glacier photographs from page forty-three, and Marcus realized with a jolt that his great-grandfather's seemingly foolish quest had been anything but – these patterns were warnings, and he was finally beginning to understand them. <words>421</words>

His hands trembled as he served the drink, knowing that his definition of success had just shifted dramatically – he wasn't just a telepathic barista hiding in a transmission shop; he was continuing a noble legacy of weather prediction that operated far outside the realm of conventional meteorology. <words>473</words>

The button hook clinked against his coffee pitcher as another autumn gust rattled the garage doors, and Marcus smiled, finally understanding that sometimes the most important work happens in the most unexpected places. <words>509</words>
