In the sprawling treehouse metropolis of Nueva Altura, where ancient kapok trees cradled entire neighborhoods in their branches, Magdalena Santos practiced her exorcisms with a particularly smug flair. <words>33</words>

She'd earned that right, having cleansed more wayward spirits than anyone else in the canopy-dwelling community, though her methods often raised eyebrows among the more traditional practitioners. <words>65</words>

The wizard's grimoire she'd "borrowed" from her stuffy mentor sat open on her bamboo desk, its pages crackling with age and residual magic as she thumbed through it, searching for something to help with her latest case. <words>103</words>

"There has to be a better way than just shooing spirits along to the other side," she muttered, her feisty determination showing in the way she bounced her leg while reading. <words>137</words>

The problem wasn't just the increasing number of haunted treehouses – it was the fact that these spirits were getting younger, as if something was youthifying them, turning once-dignified ancestral ghosts into spectral teenagers throwing supernatural tantrums. <words>179</words>

When the clock in the central plaza tower skipped its hourly chime, Magdalena knew she'd run out of time to solve this puzzle her way – the Council of Elders would soon implement their boring, traditional solution. <words>219</words>

The usual spirit paths through the canopy had begun closing one by one, like flowers at dusk, and Magdalena recognized this as her mentor's handiwork – his attempt to force her to follow protocol. <words>259</words>

"Classic Eduardo," she snorted, flipping faster through the grimoire, "always thinking he can overshadow me with his 'centuries of tradition' nonsense." <words>285</words>

Her breakthrough came when she noticed a pattern: the spirits weren't just getting younger – they were trying to relive moments they'd missed, and the traditional exorcism methods were only making them more rebellious. <words>327</words>

With a triumphant grin, Magdalena slammed the grimoire shut and grabbed her exorcism kit, now understanding that her responsibility wasn't to banish these spirits, but to help them grow up properly this time around. <words>369</words>

She set up a spiritual counseling circle in an abandoned treehouse classroom, complete with ghostly board games and spectral art supplies, turning exorcism into something more like supernatural therapy. <words>407</words>

The Council was scandalized, Eduardo was apoplectic, but the results were undeniable – spirits were moving on voluntarily, having finally experienced the youth they'd missed in life. <words>441</words>

As Magdalena sat in her office, feet propped on her desk next to the now-thoroughly-bookmarked grimoire, she couldn't help but smile at how she'd transformed the very nature of exorcism in Nueva Altura – even if she had to endure Eduardo's daily lectures about "proper spiritual protocol." <words>499</words>

"Sometimes," she mused to a young ghost practicing origami in the corner, "the best way to handle tradition is to turn it on its head – just don't tell Eduardo I said that." <words>537</words>
