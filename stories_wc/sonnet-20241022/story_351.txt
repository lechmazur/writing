The brass sundial lay half-buried in creeping ivy, its ancient face marking phantom hours at the abandoned railway station where Marcus spent his afternoons composing verses about forgotten things. <words>33</words>

He'd discovered the station three months ago, drawn to its crumbling Victorian architecture and the way nature had begun to reclaim what humanity had left behind. <words>61</words>

The letter arrived on a Tuesday, delivered by a raven that perched briefly on the station's rusted clock before dropping the envelope at his feet. <words>89</words>

Marcus studied the peculiar wax seal, noticing how its cryptic patterns seemed to shift in the dying light, forming verses he recognized from his own unpublished poems about the lost souls who had passed through this station decades ago. <words>127</words>

Despite his reputation as the formally rebellious poet who scorned literary conventions, Marcus found himself compelled to follow the seal's mysterious directions, which led him through a series of increasingly complex riddles embedded in the station's deteriorating infrastructure. <words>169</words>

Each solved puzzle revealed fragments of a story about a group of travelers who had vanished here in 1947, their departure recorded only in the station's dust-covered logs and in the whispers of elderly townspeople who still crossed the street to avoid the property. <words>223</words>

As twilight approached and Marcus solved the final riddle, the sundial began to hum with an otherworldly resonance, its shadow impossibly pointing to all hours at once. <words>255</words>

The delicate undoing of time itself seemed to ripple through the air as translucent figures materialized on the platform, each one carrying a suitcase and wearing clothes from another era. <words>294</words>

They were the unremembered ones â€“ the travelers whose stories had been erased from history, whose families had eventually stopped searching, whose names had faded from all records except the poems Marcus had somehow known to write about them. <words>343</words>

Standing among them now, Marcus understood why his verses had always felt like memories he'd never lived, why he'd felt so drawn to this place of elegant decay and lingering echoes. <words>379</words>

With trembling hands, he finally broke the seal on the letter, reading aloud the words that would bind his fate to theirs: "To witness is to preserve, to remember is to resurrect." <words>419</words>

The ivy parted like a curtain as the ghostly passengers began boarding a phantom train that gleamed with the same brass warmth as the sundial, and Marcus knew with absolute certainty that his role as their poet, their chronicler, their keeper of lost time, required him to step aboard with them. <words>485</words>

As the spectral train departed into a tunnel that hadn't existed for half a century, the station settled back into its green-draped slumber, leaving behind only a book of poems that would be discovered years later, its pages filled with the stories of those who had chosen to ride the twilight rails between memory and forgetting. <words>570</words>
