In the desolate hospital waiting room where she now made her hideout, Maya watched the distorted reflections of her targets through a salvaged funhouse mirror, its warped surface revealing their locations in adjacent buildings as they conducted their virtual war room meetings. <words>42</words>

Her movements were artfully clumsy as she traced their positions on the grimy windows, a deliberate awkwardness masking years of training in the forgotten martial art she'd spent a decade trying to master. <words>71</words>

The plain wooden bead around her neck – the last remnant of her master's prayer beads – clicked softly against her collarbone as she worked, its sound barely audible above the hum of distant servers and the screaming silence of the abandoned medical wing. <words>116</words>

She'd learned to flatter the corrupt officials during their video calls, playing the role of a harmless systems administrator while secretly documenting their war profiteering schemes that had left thousands dead and displaced. <words>152</words>

The funhouse mirror, salvaged from a demolished amusement park, had become her most valuable tool – its ancient silvering creating unexpected technological blind spots in their surveillance systems, allowing her to track their movements undetected. <words>190</words>

Each night, she practiced the fluid movements of her master's art in the empty waiting room, her reflection fragmenting across the mirror's surface as she prepared herself for the inevitable confrontation, knowing that justice would demand its price. <words>233</words>

The wooden bead held more than sentimental value; inside was a microchip containing evidence of their crimes, gathered through months of patient observation and careful timing of their virtual meetings. <words>270</words>

Her subdued approach to vigilantism wasn't born of hesitation but of the same wisdom her master had tried to instill – the understanding that true justice, like the art she practiced, required precision rather than force. <words>309</words>

As she watched another late-night conference begin through the mirror's twisted view, she recognized that the price of war wasn't measured only in lives lost, but in the silence of those who refused to stop it. <words>349</words>

The waiting room, with its rows of empty chairs and dust-covered magazines, had become both her dojo and her war room, each cracked ceiling tile bearing witness to her growing mastery of an art that few remembered existed. <words>391</words>

Tonight would be different – she could feel it in the way the wooden bead seemed to pulse against her skin, in how the funhouse mirror's distortions aligned perfectly with the positions of her targets, in the way her practiced clumsiness had finally transformed into the fluid grace her master had promised. <words>447</words>

Maya stood, her reflection multiplying across the mirror's surface, knowing that the price of war would finally be paid by those who had profited from it, and her master's ancient art would serve its true purpose: bringing balance to a world distorted by power and greed. <words>498</words>
