Marcus checked his depth gauge one last time before igniting his underwater torch, the familiar blue flame dancing beneath the murky harbor waters. <words>21</words>

As an underwater welder, he'd seen strange things in the depths, but nothing prepared him for what he discovered in the hull of this particular shipwreck: his grandmother's button box, the same one he'd watched her bury in their backyard thirty years ago. <words>71</words>

The brass container, barnacle-encrusted but unmistakable, shouldn't have been here, seventy feet underwater in a vessel that sank in 1942, decades before his grandmother ever owned it. <words>108</words>

That discovery led him to the Nebula, a failed planetarium converted into the city's most enigmatic nightclub, where fractured constellation projectors cast shattered starlight across the dance floor and ancient mirrors lined the walls like astronomical charts. <words>159</words>

Through these tarnished mirrors, Marcus caught glimpses of impossible moments – his grandmother as a young woman, carefully sorting pearlescent buttons while whispering incantations, and himself as a child, watching her with wide-eyed wonder. <words>208</words>

He'd always been patiently impatient with her stories of family magic, tolerating them while secretly longing for them to be true, and now each reflection revealed another layer of inherited power he'd dismissed as fairy tales. <words>256</words>

The button box had been her tool, he realized, a conduit for manipulating the fabric of time itself, and she had pampered its brass surface with oils and whispered secrets until it gleamed with possibility. <words>306</words>

In the Nebula's broken dome, where stars once wheeled in mechanical precision but now spun in chaos, Marcus understood why she'd hidden it away – the temptation to weave together disparate timelines was too great, too dangerous. <words>365</words>

Yet here he stood, at the convergence of two timelines that were never meant to intersect: one where the button box remained buried and forgotten, and another where it had somehow found its way into a sunken ship, waiting for him to discover its power. <words>428</words>

As the fractured starlight caught the brass surface of the box, Marcus felt the weight of choice heavy in his hands – he could wield this improbable power as his grandmother had, becoming a custodian of time's delicate threads, or he could let the timelines unravel naturally, accepting the mysteries he'd inherited without trying to control them. <words>505</words>

In the end, he chose to do what his grandmother had done: protect the power rather than use it, understanding at last that some mysteries were meant to be inherited but never fully understood. <words>554</words>
