The reaver slouched against the kaleidoscope park's fractured mirror walls, her scarred fingers tracing the edges of a child's drawing she'd found crumpled near the swings. <words>27</words>

In the crude crayon sketch, a small figure reached toward a star-speckled sky, while scrawled in the margins were poems about tasting stardust and dancing with comets – eerily similar to the ones she'd written at that age. <words>71</words>

Her own daughter, before being taken by the Starfall Sickness, had nagged her endlessly about visiting this park, leaving behind drawings just like this one, filled with the same desperate yearning that had consumed three generations of their family. <words>116</words>

The reaver's grandmother had been the first to feel it: that maddening desire to capture celestial light between her teeth, to press her lips against the cosmos until it yielded its secrets. <words>155</words>

Now, as she studied the grotesque yet somehow charming stick figures with their too-wide smiles and reaching arms, she recognized the familiar pattern, the inherited hunger that made mothers abandon their children for impossible kisses with the night sky. <words>209</words>

In the margins of this stranger's child's artwork, poems spiraled like DNA helixes: "Mommy, why won't you look down instead of up?" and "The stars don't love you like I do" – messages that made her chest ache with recognition. <words>263</words>

She'd sworn to break the cycle, sealed herself off from everyone, especially children with their starlit dreams, but this drawing had found her anyway, mocking her attempts at isolation with its innocent wisdom. <words>308</words>

The park's kaleidoscope walls multiplied her reflection infinitely, each fractured image showing a different version of herself: the child who dreamed, the mother who left, the reaver who returned. <words>351</words>

Before the first lie could form on her lips – before she could tell herself this wasn't her responsibility – she pulled out her worn pencil and began adding her own poem to the margins: "The stars are cold and we are warm, little one. <words>401</words>

Stay earthbound with those who love you." <words>409</words>

She folded the drawing carefully this time, tucking it into the park's message board where its owner might find it, where perhaps one child might be saved from the generational curse that had claimed so many stargazing mothers. <words>456</words>

As she walked away, her reflection shattered and reformed in the mirrored walls, and for the first time in years, she kept her eyes firmly on the ground, refusing to look up at the tempting twinkle of the afternoon's first star. <words>508</words></story>
