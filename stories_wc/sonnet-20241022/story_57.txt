Lady Penelope Ashworth was trimming her prized rosebushes when she first heard the echoes drifting from the basement window of her family estate, where her husband had supposedly been running a "diplomatic consulting firm." <words>37</words>

Her pruning shears paused mid-snip as fragments of conversation bounced off the limestone walls: codenames, dead drops, and something about a revolutionary new compound that could liquify steel. <words>65</words>

Despite her reputation as the neighborhood's most acquiescent hostess, Penelope had always noticed things others missed – like how her husband's "clients" never carried briefcases, only innocuous garden tools with hollow handles. <words>97</words>

She crept closer to the window well, her gardening gloves collecting dirt, and extracted her grandmother's tarnished silver letter opener from her apron pocket – the one tool she always carried to open the endless stream of society invitations. <words>134</words>

The voices grew clearer: they were planning to test the compound on an abandoned shelter that, to Penelope's horror, housed a colony of feral cats she'd been secretly feeding. <words>164</words>

Her usual impulse to defer to her husband's judgment melted away like morning frost as she thought of those vulnerable creatures, particularly the three-legged tabby she'd named Sir Limpsalot. <words>195</words>

"I say," she announced with practiced lightness, swinging herself through the window and landing in what was evidently a fully equipped spy training facility, "that's rather unsporting of you chaps." <words>225</words>

The assembled agents froze, their expressions shifting from shock to recognition as they realized who had interrupted their classified meeting. <words>244</words>

"Darling," her husband started, but Penelope raised her letter opener with the same delicate authority she used to direct the household staff. <words>265</words>

"While I've thoroughly enjoyed pretending not to notice your little operation these past years," she said, maintaining her drawing-room smile, "I simply cannot allow you to harm those cats." <words>296</words>

The agents exchanged glances, clearly unsure how to handle this breach of security by the boss's seemingly docile wife. <words>316</words>

"Perhaps," Penelope continued, absently brushing soil from her gardening skirt, "you might consider the abandoned textile mill on Whitmore Street instead? <words>337</words>

The cats would be safe, and I happen to know the owner is selling military secrets to our rivals." <words>358</words>

Her husband's jaw dropped as the other agents quickly verified her intel, which proved impeccable. <words>374</words>

That evening, as Penelope served tea with her usual quiet grace, she caught her husband studying her with newfound respect. <words>395</words>

"My dear," he said carefully, "we seem to have an opening for an intelligence analyst with... particular observational skills." <words>416</words>

Penelope merely smiled, sliding a saucer of milk through the kitchen's cat flap before returning to pour a second cup of Earl Grey. <words>441</words>

Sometimes, she reflected, the best way to protect those you care about is to hide in plain sight – though she did hope this new position wouldn't interfere too terribly with her garden club duties. <words>476</words>
