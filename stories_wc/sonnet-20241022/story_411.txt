Marcus knelt beside the luminescent fountain, his oil-stained hands trembling as he lifted another crystalline shard from the starlit water that flowed up from the depths below. <words>27</words>

As a mechanic who could feel machines' pain, he had always been drawn to broken things, but these fragments in the underground orchard called to him with an intensity that was both beautiful and horrifying. <words>71</words>

The ancient fruit trees, their roots drinking from the river of stars that wound through the cavern, cast shadows that danced like mechanical ghosts across his workspace as he carefully arranged each piece on the fountain's edge. <words>116</words>

Through his grandmother's vintage opera glasses, artifacts from a more elegant age, he studied the way each fragment caught and refracted the stellar light, revealing whispers of confessions trapped within their faceted surfaces. <words>159</words>

"Show me your secrets," he murmured, his voice carrying the weight of eternities as he sorted through the pieces that had been gathering here since before time had meaning. <words>195</words>

Each fragment contained a different unspoken truth: a mother's final thoughts, a lover's hidden regret, a child's forgotten dream â€“ all of them drawn to this impossible place where reality bent like warm metal under a welding torch. <words>245</words>

The paradox of his task filled him with equal parts joy and sorrow; as he pieced together these confessions, he felt himself becoming both more whole and more fractured, a living contradiction that mirrored the space around him. <words>297</words>

In the endless moment between moments, Marcus discovered that some of the fragments belonged to his own unspoken truths, glinting with memories of engines he had healed and machines whose souls he had touched. <words>343</words>

The starlit river sang beneath him, its melody a symphony of mechanical harmonies and organic whispers, while the fruit trees bore impossible blooms that seemed to pulse in rhythm with his sorting. <words>385</words>

Time stretched like warm taffy as he worked, his fingers moving with the precision of a master technician and the grace of a poet, each placement bringing him closer to understanding the repulsive beauty of all things broken and reformed. <words>436</words>

When the final piece clicked into place, the completed puzzle revealed not a single image but a window into every confession ever withheld, and Marcus wept with exultant grief as he realized that in healing these fragments, he had finally healed himself. <words>489</words>

The underground orchard trembled with the weight of this revelation, and as the river of stars flowed endlessly onward, Marcus knew he had found his true calling: to be the mechanic not just of machines, but of the very stories that made the universe whole. <words>551</words>
