Marcus adjusted his brass goggles in the amber light filtering through the barn loft's dusty windows, his weathered hands steady despite the weight of his predictions. <words>27</words>

The workshop around him hummed with the gentle whir of clockwork creatures he'd built over decades, each one marking time's relentless march toward the end he so calmly foretold. <words>71</words>

His eyes fell on the battered skateboard propped against his workbench, its surface a chaotic collage of faded stickers from places that no longer existed, a relic from when he still believed in permanence. <words>116</words>

A train whistle echoed across the valley, and like always, its mournful call served as his signal to resume his daily ritual of prophecy and creation. <words>145</words>

He'd learned long ago that apocalyptic visions didn't require dramatic declarations; they could be delivered with the same peaceful precision as morning tea, which sat steaming beside his latest mechanical oracle. <words>186</words>

The brass-and-copper device before him clicked and whirred, its gears marking humanity's remaining hours with faithfully odd precision, each tick a quiet confirmation of his childhood's end. <words>224</words>

"Three hundred and twelve days," he announced to his mechanical menagerie, his voice carrying neither joy nor sorrow, just the clear ring of certainty that had become his hallmark. <words>259</words>

Steam hissed from copper pipes overhead as he began assembling his newest creation, each component a deliberate step away from the stagnant beliefs that had once bound him to false hope. <words>300</words>

The skateboard caught his eye again, and he remembered the day he'd first seen the truth - how the world's end had appeared to him not in fire or fury, but in the quiet certainty of mathematics and gears. <words>349</words>

His fingers traced the intricate patterns he was etching into brass plates, each line a calculation, each curve a prophecy, while morning light painted shadows of his mechanical familiars across the wooden floors. <words>390</words>

With placid determination, he soldered the final pieces together, his movements precise and unhurried despite the weight of his knowledge. <words>417</words>

The door to his workshop swung shut with a decisive click, not in anger but in quiet revolution against the gods who would have humanity remain blind to its countdown. <words>454</words>

As the new device whirred to life, joining the chorus of his mechanical prophets, Marcus allowed himself a small smile - not at the coming end, but at the perfect clarity that came with accepting it. <words>498</words>

The train whistle sounded again, more distant now, like the memory of who he'd been before the gears of truth had started turning in his mind. <words>533</words>
