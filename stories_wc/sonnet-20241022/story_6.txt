The minstrel Thaddeus Pike stood before the abandoned ink factory's rusted gates, clutching a scrap of dragon-scale armor and questioning, for the hundredth time, whether his plan was brilliant or merely suicidal. <words>33</words>

He'd tracked the Eternal Jester here, following a trail of disappearing ink letters that materialized in empty mailboxes at precisely noon, each message more mockingly impossible than the last. <words>63</words>

The factory's ancient steam vents still hissed their secrets into the summer air, and Thaddeus knew the immortal trickster used them to teleport between realms – a fact so absurd he couldn't help but believe it. <words>96</words>

"Nothing more reliable than an immortal's habits," Thaddeus muttered, setting up his oversized slingshot beside a particularly active vent, the dragon-scale fragment loaded as ammunition. <words>122</words>

The scale had come from his grandmother's collection of "absolutely true" artifacts, and its peculiar property – it always landed exactly where it wasn't aimed – was perfect for dealing with someone who existed everywhere except where you expected them to be. <words>164</words>

As the sun climbed to its zenith, Thaddeus checked his pocket watch and the empty mailbox mounted inexplicably on the factory's third floor, knowing the Eternal Jester would arrive to deposit today's taunt. <words>198</words>

The steam vent suddenly whistled a perfect G-sharp (which was impossible for steam but entirely typical for magic), and Thaddeus released the slingshot's band with deliberately awful aim. <words>227</words>

The dragon scale spiraled through the steam in a mathematically improbable curve, ricocheted off three separate surfaces that weren't actually there, and struck the materializing form of the Eternal Jester square in the back. <words>262</words>

"Oh, you clever, clever fool," laughed the trickster, now trapped in solid form by the scale's binding magic, their rainbow-hued coat shimmering with barely contained chaos. <words>290</words>

"A musician knows timing is everything," Thaddeus replied with a bow, unable to suppress his grin at having out-schemed the schemer. <words>312</words>

The Jester's eternal smile widened impossibly further as they said, "In ten thousand years, no one has ever caught me with something so elegantly ridiculous – you simply must let me hire you." <words>347</words>

Thaddeus straightened his cap and considered the offer, watching as workers began to fade into existence around them – the factory's long-lost staff, trapped between moments by the Jester's magic, finally free to resume their ink-making duties. <words>391</words>

"Well," he said, plucking a tune on his lute that somehow smelled like fresh ink, "I suppose I could use a steady gig – but you'll have to promise to be at least seventeen percent less immortal during business hours." <words>432</words>

The Jester's laughter echoed through the factory's awakening halls, setting bottles of ink dancing on their shelves, each one containing a different shade of impossible. <words>460</words>

And so began the peculiar partnership between a skeptical minstrel and an immortal trickster, their performances drawing crowds who could never quite remember what they'd seen, but left feeling as though they'd witnessed something wonderfully, perfectly absurd. <words>502</words>
