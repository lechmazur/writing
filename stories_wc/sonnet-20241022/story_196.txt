The swordsman slumped against the monastery's breakroom wall, his weathered blade clattering to the stone floor beside him. <words>19</words>

Through the window, he watched chunks of blessed earth drift past like lazy clouds, each one trailing sacred dust that sparkled in the perpetual twilight. <words>42</words>

Brother Chen's resignation letter still lay on the table, its crisp folds a stark contrast to the plain cloth bag beside it, which contained everything the departed monk had owned. <words>71</words>

"They all leave eventually," the swordsman muttered, his voice carrying the weight of someone who had grown fiercely apathetic to loss. <words>91</words>

Yet as he traced the familiar constellations through the window, he remembered the promise he'd made to himself years ago, when he first arrived at this floating sanctuary: he would remain until he witnessed the Celestial Dragon's Tears, a meteor shower said to occur once every century. <words>143</words>

The other monks had laughed at his stubborn dedication to such a seemingly pointless vigil, but their amusement had long since faded into respect for his unwavering presence. <words>173</words>

Tonight, as he sat alone in the quiet breakroom, the first streak of light carved across the sky, and something stirred within his tired heart. <words>199</words>

More meteors followed, their paths weaving between the floating rocks like luminous threads through a cosmic tapestry. <words>218</words>

The swordsman rose slowly, gathering Brother Chen's bag – he would ensure it reached the surface monastery where all departed belongings were kept. <words>242</words>

But as the meteor shower intensified, he felt that old spark of defiance ignite: the same one that had first driven him to challenge the monastery's isolation, to question its tradition of detachment. <words>284</words>

Each burning light that crossed the sky seemed to whisper the truth he'd known but never acknowledged – that his presence here wasn't merely about keeping a promise or maintaining tradition. <words>321</words>

It was about proving that someone could overcome the crushing solitude of this place, that dedication didn't have to mean surrender to loneliness. <words>348</words>

The swordsman picked up his blade, its familiar weight now feeling different in his hands, and began to pack his own belongings into another plain cloth bag. <words>379</words>

He understood now, with the innocent wisdom that comes from years of patient observation, that his promise had never been about staying – it had been about knowing when to leave. <words>417</words>

As the last meteor traced its arc across the star-strewn sky, he shouldered both bags and walked out of the breakroom, leaving behind a resignation letter of his own. <words>449</words>

In it, he wrote only what he had finally learned: that sometimes the greatest act of devotion is knowing when to let go, and that even the most steadfast guardian must eventually become a wanderer again. <words>489</words>

The monastery would endure without him, floating eternal among the stars, but his path now lay among the falling lights that had shown him the way home. <words>524</words>
