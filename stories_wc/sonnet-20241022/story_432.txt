Marcus pressed his tongue against the bitter almond taste of the nobleman's wine, hoping this time it would finally kill him. <words>21</words>

As the court's poison taster, he had survived countless attempts on his master's life, each failed assassination denying Marcus his own desired end. <words>45</words>

The wine was clean again, but the bookmark that had fallen from his pocket – a simple cloth strip marked with strange symbols – had caught the eye of Lady Vesper, the court's resident psychic. <words>82</words>

"You bear the mark of the Aquifer Seers," she whispered, her eyes wide with recognition as she traced the ancient patterns that matched the ones adorning the massive underground chamber where they stood. <words>120</words>

The subterranean waterfall roared behind them, its crystalline sheets cascading past the elaborate ice sculpture of the nobleman's crest – a sculpture that was showing dangerous signs of stress. <words>156</words>

Lady Vesper grabbed Marcus's wrist and pressed a crystal into his palm, explaining how her nightly radio show – where she fielded calls from other hidden sensitives – had revealed the existence of an ancient society dedicated to mapping the earth's secret energy flows. <words>208</words>

The bookmark, she explained, was their key to understanding these currents, passed down through generations of those who could read its encoded meanings. <words>237</words>

As the ice sculpture groaned ominously above them, Lady Vesper's words tumbled out with increasing urgency about how the society needed someone with Marcus's unique talents – not just his resistant body, but his intimate knowledge of life's threshold between here and gone. <words>288</words>

The massive ice structure shifted, and in that final second before collapse, Marcus saw the truth: the waterfall's endless cascade wasn't just water, but visible energy flowing through the earth's veins, and his years of suffering had been preparation to bind himself to this power. <words>347</words>

Lady Vesper pulled him back as the sculpture shattered, but Marcus stood transfixed by the waterfall's spray, feeling for the first time the compelling pulse of the planet's lifeblood singing through his poison-strengthened body. <words>394</words>

In that moment of serene upheaval, as ice shards rained around them and the waterfall's mist transformed into visible threads of energy, Marcus finally understood that his death wish had never been about ending his life – it had been his soul's recognition that he needed to die to his old self to become something far greater. <words>470</words>

The bookmark's symbols began to glow against its simple cloth surface, and Marcus smiled, knowing he had found not an ending, but a beginning. <words>502</words>
