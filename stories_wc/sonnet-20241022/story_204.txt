Maya adjusted her "Professional Cuddler" name tag as she wandered through the makeshift farmer's market, set up in the cavernous abandoned spaceport hangar where colony ships once docked. <words>27</words>

The usual vendors had arranged their stalls in unusual patterns today, their antigrav displays of produce hovering at odd angles that mimicked the departed ships' trajectories. <words>51</words>

She paused at a stall selling artifacts from the early space age, her fingers brushing over a phantom train ticket punch – the kind conductors once used on Earth's railways before they all decayed into museum pieces. <words>84</words>

The vendor, an elderly woman with silver hair that seemed to float like zero-gravity wisps, caught Maya's eye and smiled knowingly. <words>104</words>

"You're one of them touch-therapists, aren't you?" the vendor asked, her voice carrying the same ancient novelty as her wares. <words>123</words>

Maya nodded, fighting the familiar shame that came with others' prejudices about her profession, even centuries after human contact had become a regulated healthcare service. <words>149</words>

The moment hung between them like the silence before the Colonial President's acceptance speech, due to begin broadcasting any minute on the hangar's still-functioning holoscreens. <words>175</words>

"My grandmother was a train conductor," the vendor said softly, picking up the punch. <words>188</words>

"She had unspoken rules about passenger comfort – always checked on the elderly, made sure children had warm blankets during night journeys." <words>209</words>

The vendor's words struck Maya with unexpected force, recognizing in them the same principles that guided her own work. <words>227</words>

"We're not so different, you and I," the vendor continued, "preserving old ways of caring for people, even as the world turns digital and distant." <words>253</words>

Maya found herself sharing stories about her clients – the space-sick colonists, the touch-starved programmers, the elderly who remembered Earth's gravity in their bones – as the vendor nodded with growing understanding. <words>287</words>

Around them, the market's bustle quieted as the holoscreens flickered to life, but they remained absorbed in conversation, two keepers of human tradition amid the technological ruins. <words>317</words>

"Take it," the vendor said, pressing the ticket punch into Maya's hands. <words>330</words>

"Let it remind you that whether it's punching tickets or holding hands, we've always found ways to validate each other's journeys." <words>353</words>

As the Colonial President's first words echoed through the hangar, Maya clutched the punch, feeling its weight as an anchor to a past she'd never known but somehow understood. <words>387</words>

In that moment, she realized that her profession wasn't a modern aberration but part of an ancient continuum of human connection, as natural as the gravity that had once held their ancestors to Earth. <words>428</words>

The vendor reached out and squeezed her hand – not as a client, but as one guardian of human touch to another – while above them, the holoscreens painted their faces in the soft light of a new era's dawn. <words>470</words>
