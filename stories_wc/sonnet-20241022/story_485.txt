In the submerged ruins of Nova Atlantis Research Station, Mira Kane traced ancient equations with a piece of charcoal across the curved walls, her raider's instincts warring with her need to preserve the brilliant work slowly dissolving in the seawater. <words>42</words>

The forgotten laboratory, once humanity's premier think tank before the Rising Seas Revolution, still hummed with the ghostly resonance of betrayed dreams and abandoned discoveries. <words>71</words>

She hadn't meant to become the protector of Dr. Elena Chen's legacy, but when she'd broken in to salvage tech three months ago, she'd found the scientist's last messages – and the terrible truth about why the facility had been left to drown. <words>116</words>

Mira's fingers trembled as she copied another formula, remembering the childhood ritual her grandmother taught her: marking doorways with coal to ward off evil spirits. <words>143</words>

Now she found herself doing the same, driven by an inexplicable urgency to preserve Chen's work before the resistance could locate it – the same resistance that had forced the brilliant scientist into exile when she refused to weaponize her discoveries. <words>190</words>

The facility's emergency lights flickered, casting prismatic shadows through the surrounding seawater, and Mira's breath caught as she recognized another equation taking shape beneath her charcoal-stained fingers – the same one she'd seen in the resistance's classified files. <words>237</words>

"They're coming," she whispered to the empty halls, her voice carrying the weight of both warning and prophecy. <words>255</words>

With methodical desperation, she continued transcribing, each stroke of charcoal guided by the same impulsive certainty that had made her the most successful raider in the underwater territories – and the same thoughtfulness that now compelled her to become something more. <words>306</words>

The old superstitions felt right here, in this place where science and desperation intertwined; she marked protective symbols alongside the equations, her grandmother's whispered prayers mixing with Chen's brilliant theories in her mind. <words>348</words>

Through the reinforced windows, she could see the distant lights of approaching vessels, the resistance finally closing in on the knowledge they'd sought for so long. <words>379</words>

Mira's hand moved faster, the charcoal crumbling beneath her fingers as she raced to complete her task, knowing that even if they caught her, the equations would endure – she'd marked them on every surface, in every room, a thousand copies ensuring that Chen's genius would survive. <words>436</words>

As the facility's outer doors groaned under pressure, Mira smiled grimly and pressed her coal-blackened hand against the final wall, leaving behind both a warning and a promise: some flames were meant to be sheltered, not extinguished, even in the depths of a drowning world. <words>489</words>
