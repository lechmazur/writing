Marcus had always been terrible at calculating odds, which made him both an awful gambler and a perfect mark for Professor Thaddeus's midnight lectures on chaos theory at the abandoned tidal power station. <words>33</words>

The old professor, dismissed from the university for increasingly erratic behavior, had promised to teach Marcus a foolproof system for predicting the unpredictable, all in exchange for help with his peculiar experiments. <words>65</words>

Every evening, Marcus would dock his small boat at the station's weathered pier, carrying his grandmother's antique candle mold and enough wax to last through their candlelit sessions, though he never quite understood why the professor insisted on such archaic lighting. <words>108</words>

"The patterns, my boy," Thaddeus would exclaim, waving his arms wildly as shadows danced across the monitoring equipment, "they're in the flicker of the flames, the rise and fall of the tides, the pulse of the turbines below!" <words>145</words>

Marcus couldn't help but laugh through his tears as he watched the brilliant man ramble on about quantum fluctuations while meticulously pouring wax into the rustic mold, his weathered hands shaking with excitement or madness—perhaps both. <words>182</words>

Their unspoken arrangement continued through autumn: Marcus would bring supplies and serve as an audience, while Thaddeus promised to reveal the ultimate pattern that would change both their fortunes. <words>214</words>

The professor's predictions were rarely accurate but always spectacular, ranging from tomorrow's lottery numbers to the precise moment a seabird would crash into the control room windows. <words>244</words>

It wasn't until the winter solstice that Marcus realized the true nature of their bargain—Thaddeus wasn't teaching him to predict chaos; he was desperately trying to preserve his last fragments of lucidity before his mind slipped entirely into darkness. <words>290</words>

The candles they made together became markers of time, each one burning down as Thaddeus's theories grew more fantastic and his eyes more distant, while Marcus found himself less interested in gambling and more invested in preserving these precious moments of shared madness. <words>341</words>

On their final night together, as the tide reached its highest point and the turbines hummed their deepest song, Thaddeus grabbed Marcus's hand and whispered, "The greatest gamble isn't with money, my boy—it's with time itself." <words>384</words>

Years later, Marcus would return to the station, now a successful mathematics professor himself, to light a candle in the same rustic mold and laugh softly at the memory of those nights when an old man's beautiful delusions had somehow taught him more about life than any sane lecture ever could. <words>447</words>

He understood now that their shared obsession with predicting the unpredictable had been a fool's errand, but in capturing those last sparks of Thaddeus's brilliant mind, they had both won something far more valuable than any bet could offer. <words>495</words>
