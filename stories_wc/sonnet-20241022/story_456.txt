Marigold tended her floating rock garden with methodical precision, arranging funeral flowers between the levitating stones of the ancient dojo where she'd sought refuge from her own conflicting nature. <words>33</words>

The plain white candle beside her workbench guttered in sync with the dying lantern that had illuminated this sanctuary for centuries, its final moments approaching like a held breath. <words>65</words>

As both lights dimmed, she found herself drawn to the massive trunk in the corner, filled with the previous temple keeper's writings – a chronicle of attempts to reconcile the eternal dance between life and death. <words>103</words>

Her fingers, stained with flower pigments and soil, traced the yellowed pages, each one revealing another seeker's struggle to remain neutrally passionate in the face of existence's greatest mysteries. <words>139</words>

"We who tend death's garden must oblige both sides," she read aloud, recognizing her predecessor's familiar battle with the same tempered beliefs that had led her to this floating sanctuary. <words>173</words>

Through countless typed pages, Marigold discovered others like herself – florists drawn to mortality's beauty, each finding their way to this suspended rock to study the cosmic cycles that governed both blooming and decay. <words>214</words>

The lantern's flame wavered dangerously as she uncovered the pattern: every keeper before her had arrived with bold questions but learned to embrace their timid reverence for the balance they maintained. <words>251</words>

Her arrangements of lilies and chrysanthemums, perched on floating stones in the darkness, seemed to pulse with new meaning as she realized that her morbid fascination wasn't a flaw but a calling. <words>290</words>

In the trunk's deepest corner, she found the final entry: "To understand death, tend to life; to honor life, acknowledge death – the floating rocks remain suspended, as must we." <words>327</words>

The ancient lantern sputtered its last breath just as Marigold closed the trunk, but her white candle burned steady now, casting light on her flowers – beautiful harbingers of both celebration and mourning. <words>369</words>

She rose, accepting at last that her role wasn't to resolve the tension between life and death but to maintain their delicate dance, as natural as the mysterious force that kept the dojo's stones aloft in the infinite night. <words>421</words>

With this understanding, she began arranging her most ambitious work yet: a spiral of flowers that floated between the rocks, each bloom positioned to trace the endless cycle of existence, illuminated by her solitary candle in the darkness. <words>470</words>

The finished arrangement hung suspended in the void, a bold testament to mortality crafted by timid hands, marking Marigold's place in the long line of keepers who had found their peace in this sacred space between earth and sky. <words>521</words>
