Marcus hunched over his desk in the Atlantis Municipal Development Bureau, his calloused blacksmith's hands seeming out of place among the floating holographic blueprints of underwater neighborhoods. <words>27</words>

The softcover dictionary he'd inherited from his grandmother lay open before him, its pages warped by the pressurized atmosphere of the deep-sea office. <words>48</words>

For thirty years, he'd worked two jobs – shaping metal by day and approving building permits by night – all to fulfill an ancient bargain with the sea witch who'd promised to return his wife's soul from the Abyssal Vault. <words>82</words>

His method was peculiar but precise: he collected tales from the wandering souls who hitchhiked through the underwater transit tubes, verifying their stories against his grandmother's dictionary, which contained hidden truths between its water-stained definitions. <words>116</words>

Each confirmed story would ignite another crystal in the soul-tracking array he'd forged, the magic openly hidden in plain sight as decorative lighting in the office's coral-encrusted ceiling. <words>146</words>

His colleagues never questioned why such a timid man chose to work the night shift alone, nor why he interviewed every drifter who passed through their pressurized halls. <words>173</words>

Tonight felt different though – the water seemed to pulse with the hush of time's final ripple, as if the ocean itself held its breath. <words>199</words>

The latest hitchhiker's tale about a woman who sang to whales in the deepest trenches made the dictionary's pages glow with validation, and Marcus felt his heart crack just a little more, knowing he was one story closer to completion. <words>241</words>

He'd learned long ago that heartbreak could be harnessed, transformed into energy more powerful than any underwater thermal vent, and each verified story fed that perpetual engine of loss. <words>272</words>

The luminous regret that filled the office grew stronger with each passing night, casting ethereal shadows that danced across the city planning maps like memories of surface-world sunlight. <words>301</words>

As he traced the latest approved building site with trembling fingers, Marcus realized that his bargain with the sea witch had never been about bringing his wife back – it had been about keeping him trapped in this liminal space, collecting stories that powered something far more terrible than grief. <words>352</words>

The dictionary began to bubble, its definitions rearranging themselves to reveal one final truth: the city he'd been helping to plan all these years was not for the living residents above, but for an army of souls waiting to rise from the Abyssal Vault. <words>397</words>

In that moment, Marcus straightened his usually stooped shoulders and made a different choice – he would forge one last time, not with metal or permits, but with the power of all the heartbreak he'd accumulated over three decades. <words>439</words>

As the dictionary burst into spectral flames and the city plans dissolved into swirling eddies of possibility, Marcus finally understood that some bargains were meant to be broken, even if it meant remaining forever incomplete. <words>473</words>
