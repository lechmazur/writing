The sentinel swayed at his post in the empty docking bay, fighting waves of vertigo as the space freighter's artificial gravity fluctuated between the gravitational fields of the two colliding worlds. <words>33</words>

His only companion was the mechanical bird perched on his shoulder, an antiquated automaton that clicked and whirred as it processed the torn fragments of letters scattered across the floor. <words>65</words>

"Recommend proceeding with caution," the bird chirped, its brass wings flexing as it pieced together another fragment of the prophecy that had brought them to this derelict vessel. <words>95</words>

The sentinel's face twisted into a coyly furious expression as he read the reconstructed text, realizing that the sacred predictions he'd devoted his life to protecting were nothing but elaborate deceptions. <words>127</words>

Through the vast observation windows, he watched the approaching celestial bodies with a mixture of dread and perverse joy, understanding now that their collision was not the divine punishment foretold, but rather an astronomical inevitability that someone had twisted into religious prophecy. <words>173</words>

The automaton bird continued its methodical work, its ruby eyes glowing as it matched torn edges and decoded the ancient handwriting, revealing more of the truth with each assembled piece. <words>208</words>

"Your predecessors fabricated the prophecy," the bird announced, its voice carrying an almost sympathetic tone as it delivered the devastating revelation. <words>231</words>

The sentinel laughed, a hollow sound that echoed through the abandoned bay, as he felt the weight of generations of misguided devotion lifting from his shoulders even as the ship groaned under the increasing gravitational stress. <words>272</words>

With trembling hands, he gathered the remaining fragments, watching as the mechanical bird wove them together into a complete narrative that exposed centuries of manipulation and control. <words>303</words>

The truth brought him a strange, cheerless ecstasy – the freedom of understanding coupled with the bitter knowledge that he'd spent years guarding a lie. <words>334</words>

As the worlds drew closer and the docking bay's metal walls creaked ominously, the sentinel realized that fate had ambushed him in the most peculiar way, bringing him to this precise moment of clarity when it was almost too late to matter. <words>382</words>

The automaton bird fluttered to a nearby console, its mechanical claws clicking against the metal as it assembled the final pieces of the shredded letters. <words>412</words>

"The collision will create a new world," it declared, "not end everything as the false prophecy claimed – those who wrote it simply couldn't comprehend the scale of cosmic renewal." <words>447</words>

The sentinel steadied himself against a wall, watching the approaching apocalypse with newfound understanding, as the mechanical bird began to sing a strange, metallic song that somehow captured both the death of old beliefs and the birth of new truths in its haunting melody. <words>497</words>

Together, they waited for the worlds to meet, guardian and guide, their shared purpose transformed from preventing the inevitable to witnessing the beginning hidden within the end. <words>532</words>
