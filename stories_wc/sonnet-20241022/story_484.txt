Marcus stumbled through the mansion's graveyard, his brewing equipment clattering against his hip as he searched for inspiration in the most uninspired place possible. <words>24</words>

The protest downtown had reached that eerie quiet moment when the crowd draws breath before erupting again, and he'd seized the opportunity to slip away and find somewhere to perfect his latest craft beer recipe. <words>65</words>

"What could be more generic than another IPA?" he muttered, running his fingers through disheveled hair as he approached the decrepit mansion's servant entrance. <words>91</words>

The broken piece of mirror in his pocket caught the last rays of sunset, reflecting light onto the weathered door like some cosmic joke about self-reflection. <words>120</words>

Inside, the air hung thick with dust and disappointment, much like his last batch of experimental brew. <words>137</words>

Marcus's bleary eyes, still heavy from sampling too many test batches, adjusted to the gloom as he made his way toward what he hoped was the kitchen. <words>164</words>

That's when he noticed it – a peculiar brownish stain on the spiral staircase, almost like someone had spilled a porter decades ago. <words>189</words>

The discoloration seemed to pulse with an invitation, and before his common sense could object, Marcus found himself ascending the stairs, each step releasing clouds of dust that smelled faintly of hops. <words>224</words>

The darkness followed him up, not merely the absence of light but something more substantial, like a thick stout you could chew on. <words>248</words>

"If I'm going to be the kind of brewer who truly lives his craft," he declared to the empty air, his voice carrying that particular tone of someone trying to sound casual while doing something profoundly stupid, "I might as well embrace the weird." <words>294</words>

The stain led him to a room that could only be described as uniquely generic – every haunted mansion had one just like it, and yet this one felt specially crafted for him. <words>329</words>

Ancient fermentation vessels lined the walls, their contents long since evaporated into whatever dimension housed forgotten brews. <words>349</words>

As the protest's renewed roar echoed in the distance, Marcus set down his equipment and began to unpack, the encroaching darkness seeming to lean in with interest. <words>376</words>

He placed the mirror shard on a dusty table, catching fractured reflections of shadows that shouldn't have been there. <words>395</words>

"Time to initiate something new," he announced to his audience of spirits, pulling out his notebook of recipes. <words>413</words>

The darkness swirled around him like foam on a perfectly poured pint as he began measuring ingredients, each shadow contributing its own essence to the brew. <words>442</words>

Hours later, when the protest had long since dispersed, Marcus held up a bottle of the darkest beer ever created, its contents seeming to absorb light rather than reflect it. <words>473</words>

He'd finally done it – created something that perfectly embodied his values as a brewer: unique yet familiar, serious yet irreverent, and most importantly, impossible to replicate without the help of whatever entities now called his beer their home. <words>514</words>

The label read simply: "Haunted Mansion Midnight Stout - Brewed with Real Darkness," and somewhere in the shadows, something raised a glass in approval. <words>543</words>
