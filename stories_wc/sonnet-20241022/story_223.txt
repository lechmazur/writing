Lieutenant James Whitmore stumbled through the prismatic halls of the Crystal Fortress, his naval training doing little to steady his perpetual seasickness even on solid ground. <words>27</words>

The ghost orchid bulb pulsed in his palm like a forgotten heartbeat, its translucent petals catching the light that streamed through the rainbow canyon's walls. <words>49</words>

For three centuries, naval officers like him had made this pilgrimage, trading secrets with the fortress's keeper – each generation passing down the knowledge of how the bulb's transformation aligned with the moon's phases. <words>82</words>

James's awkward charm had won him this duty, though he'd rather be anywhere else; his predecessors' journals spoke of how they, too, had fought their nausea in these crystalline corridors, drawn by the same compelling purpose. <words>121</words>

The mirror waited at the heart of the fortress, its surface rippling like the seas that haunted his dreams, holding centuries of reflected lies that had steered ships and souls astray. <words>153</words>

"I know why you chose me," he said to his wavering reflection, remembering how the Admiral had smiled at his clumsy salute and nervous jokes during the selection ceremony. <words>182</words>

The ghost orchid began to glow as moonlight filtered through the crystal ceiling, and James consulted his carefully maintained lunar charts, knowing the transformation could only begin when the moon reached its precise position. <words>219</words>

In his mind, he saw all the officers who had stood here before him: their hopes, their fears, their secrets now etched into the very walls of this shimmering sanctuary. <words>250</words>

The bulb floated from his hands as the moonlight intensified, its petals unfurling like the pages of a forgotten story, revealing the truth that the mirror had hidden for so long. <words>284</words>

Each petal held a reflection of its own – not of faces or forms, but of the lies the mirror had told: false harbors, phantom lighthouses, imagined safe passages that had led so many sailors to their doom. <words>324</words>

As the moon reached its apex, James felt his nausea transform into something else entirely – a weightless understanding of why the fortress had chosen those who suffered most upon the waves to be its confidants. <words>363</words>

The ghost orchid's light merged with the mirror's surface, and for the first time in centuries, the glass began to crack, each fracture releasing a whispered secret into the rainbow-stained air. <words>399</words>

James stood straighter, his usual awkwardness forgotten as he watched the mirror's power dissolve, knowing that his predecessors' long vigil had led to this moment of defiant triumph. <words>432</words>

The fortress seemed to sigh around him, its crystal walls humming with relief as the last lie shattered and the ghost orchid's petals settled like stardust on the floor. <words>466</words>

In the end, it wasn't the mirror that needed confronting – it was the weight of all those centuries of quiet longing for truth that had finally set them free. <words>500</words>
