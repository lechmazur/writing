Marcus droned on each night from his repurposed carnival ticket booth, serving drinks to lost souls who stumbled upon his peculiar establishment nestled between reality and shadow. <words>27</words>

His worn wallet contained photographs of faces that seemed to shift and blur whenever anyone but him looked at them, though few ever got close enough to try. <words>52</words>

The broken payphone booth outside, its cord eternally dangling like a hangman's rope, had become a confessional for the dimensionally displaced who whispered their stories into its dead receiver. <words>82</words>

Marcus listened, as was his duty, his abrasively charming demeanor masking centuries of collected sorrows while he polished glasses that never seemed to get clean. <words>108</words>

Tonight, like every night, the hour approached when the veil between realities grew thinnest, and his regulars – the time-lost and the space-worn – would begin to filter in. <words>139</words>

He'd inherited this post from another keeper of in-between spaces, learning to recognize the moment when the chaos of colliding worlds settled into an unspoken truce, allowing his patrons to breathe freely between their fractured existences. <words>176</words>

The carnival's long-dead lights still pulsed dimly in his peripheral vision, echoes of joy that midnight had stolen decades or centuries or moments ago – time moved strangely here. <words>208</words>

Through the window, he watched a woman in clothes from three different eras approach the payphone, her fingers trailing along its rusted shell as she whispered secrets that would help Marcus understand which version of reality she'd lost. <words>245</words>

He reached beneath the counter, past bottles that contained everything from starlight to forgotten dreams, and pulled out a key that would unlock whichever door she needed to find her way home. <words>280</words>

This was his purpose: to gather these fragments of lives through overheard confessions and half-remembered tales, piecing together maps of transient realities for those who'd lost their way. <words>314</words>

Each night he worked to reclaim slivers of light from midnight's grasp, returning them to those who'd wandered too far into the spaces between moments. <words>342</words>

A soft bell chimed – or perhaps it had chimed yesterday, or would chime tomorrow – and Marcus straightened his eternally stained apron, ready to serve another soul caught in the web of overlapping worlds. <words>376</words>

The woman entered, wearing an expression he'd seen a thousand times before: the look of someone who'd finally found the right wrong place. <words>401</words>

"Welcome," he said, his voice carrying the weight of countless greetings across countless versions of this moment, "What reality did you leave behind?" <words>425</words>

She smiled, understanding blooming in her eyes as she recognized him as a constant in an inconstant universe, and settled onto a barstool that had waited lifetimes for her arrival. <words>456</words>

Marcus reached for a glass, ready to pour whatever drink would help her remember – or forget – knowing that in this liminal space between what was and what could be, he was exactly where he needed to be. <words>495</words>
