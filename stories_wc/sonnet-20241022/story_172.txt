Marcus fidgeted with his tour guide badge as the last tourist's camera flash faded in the spiral hallway of the Giant Nautilus Hotel, leaving him alone with his thoughts and the endless curves of mother-of-pearl walls. <words>39</words>

The prophecy had been clear: by sunset, the ancient powers within this massive seashell-turned-resort would either destroy the coastline or be forever sealed, and somehow he'd been chosen as the one who'd have to make that choice. <words>82</words>

In his pocket, the wooden puzzle box he'd discovered that morning seemed to pulse with an otherworldly warmth, its intricate spirals matching the architecture that surrounded him. <words>114</words>

Each tour he'd given that day had felt like a farewell, his usual historical anecdotes tasting bitter on his tongue as he led visitors through chambers that might soon collapse into the sea. <words>152</words>

The box had come with a note explaining its power to grant wishes, but with a cruel twist: each wish would manifest in reverse, requiring careful thought and precise wording. <words>190</words>

Marcus traced the shell's ribbed interior as he descended to the deserted beach, where foam-tipped waves whispered secrets of what lay beneath the magnificent structure. <words>221</words>

"I wish the hotel would remain unstable," he murmured, understanding that the reverse would lock its foundations permanently, but as the words left his lips, he felt the ground shudder ominously. <words>259</words>

Panic rising, he realized he'd failed to account for the immediate effect – the building would first have to become dangerously unstable before stabilizing. <words>288</words>

Racing against the tremors, Marcus scrambled to align the puzzle box's shifting panels, each click echoing the prophecy's countdown. <words>312</words>

The shell's massive spiral chambers groaned above him as he worked, his fingers dancing across wooden surfaces that seemed to respond to his increasingly desperate touches. <words>343</words>

"I wish to fail in my task," he whispered, and immediately felt the puzzle box's mechanisms snap into place with satisfying precision. <words>369</words>

A soft chime rang out as the final piece aligned, and the shaking gradually subsided, leaving Marcus standing in the gentle surf, unexpectedly victorious through his carefully reversed wish. <words>406</words>

The Giant Nautilus Hotel settled into its new permanence, its pearlescent walls glowing with a warm, steady light that seemed to pulse in harmony with the waves. <words>439</words>

Later, as the sun set over the calm waters, Marcus sat in the sand, his anxious energy finally dissipating as he watched tourists return to photograph the now-legendary structure that he had saved, not through any grand heroic gesture, but through his nervous habit of second-guessing everything – even his own wishes. <words>508</words>
