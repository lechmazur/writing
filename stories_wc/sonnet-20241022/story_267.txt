Marcus had never wanted to be either the hero who saved the resort or the villain who destroyed it, he just wanted to keep his job as a security guard at the Black Hole Resort & Spa, where wealthy tourists came to experience the thrill of vacationing at the edge of a cosmic abyss. <words>54</words>

During his nightly patrols amid leisurely bike rides through the station's curved corridors, he noticed how the resort's artificial gravity began to hiccup, causing the decorative blacksmith's anvil in the "Old Earth Artifacts" display to float occasionally. <words>96</words>

The resort's structural integrity was unraveling like a loose thread in a sweater, but management insisted everything was fine, even as the cats from the station's pest control division started behaving strangely. <words>134</words>

Marcus, in his mild-mannered way, decided to disguise himself as a maintenance worker and follow the cats through the station's service alleyways, watching as they gathered in increasingly higher levels of the resort, as if sensing the growing gravitational distortion. <words>177</words>

His poetry-writing hobby had never produced anything but the blandest verses, yet now he found himself composing savage, ecstatic lines about the cats' primal understanding of the station's impending doom. <words>215</words>

The cats led him to a critical structural weakness where the resort's gravitational shields were failing, and Marcus realized he faced a choice that wasn't really a choice at all. <words>247</words>

He could alert everyone and be hailed as a hero, causing a panic that would likely tear the station apart as people rushed to escape, or he could remain silent and be vilified later as the guard who noticed nothing â€“ but neither option would save the resort. <words>300</words>

Instead, Marcus used his access codes to quietly begin rerouting power from the resort's luxury services to reinforce the failing shields, knowing it would result in countless complaints about cold pools and dimmed lighting, but would buy enough time for the regular maintenance cycle to discover and repair the problem naturally. <words>365</words>

As he watched the anvil settle back into its proper place and the cats return to their usual rat-hunting routines, Marcus felt a fierce joy in choosing the middle path, in being neither savior nor destroyer but simply a competent guard doing his job with quiet diligence. <words>421</words>

Years later, when tourists would complain about the resort's infamous "Week of Inconveniences," Marcus would just smile and continue his bike patrol, occasionally stopping to scratch behind the ears of the cats who had helped him thread the needle between catastrophe and glory. <words>470</words>
