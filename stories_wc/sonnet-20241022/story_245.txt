The smuggler pounded across the cracked tarmac of Bay 47, her boots striking a furious rhythm against decades of accumulated stellar dust. <words>21</words>

Each lap around the derelict spaceport's flight deck brought her closer to decoding the message left in that damned teacup, the one thing her former partner had left behind before disappearing into the void with their score. <words>63</words>

She clutched the single chopstick—snapped clean from its pair—that she used to stir the leaves, refusing to slow her pace even as her lungs burned in the thin atmosphere. <words>95</words>

The exercise wasn't about fitness; it was about forcing her mind into that abstractly physical state where patterns emerged from chaos, like star maps forming from random points of light. <words>134</words>

"You always said the heart would revolt," she spat between breaths, remembering how he'd philosophized about love and loyalty while they'd planned their heists. <words>164</words>

The tea leaves had formed a peculiar constellation that morning: three circles, interconnected, leading outward like a trail of breadcrumbs toward the planet's legendary hidden waterfalls—the ones he'd always dreamed of finding. <words>206</words>

Her daily running ritual had become a way to memorialize their partnership, each circuit around the abandoned landing pads a meditation on betrayal and longing. <words>238</words>

The chopstick caught the light of the setting sun as she twirled it between her fingers, its lacquered surface worn smooth from countless readings, countless laps, countless moments of bitter clarity. <words>274</words>

She'd traced the pattern of his betrayal in cooling tea dregs for weeks now: the way he'd lifted their cache of quantum crystals, the careful precision with which he'd arranged his final message, the maddening certainty that he was leading her somewhere specific. <words>328</words>

Another lap, another gasping breath, another moment closer to understanding why he'd chosen this particular dance of deception. <words>349</words>

The spaceport's skeletal towers cast long shadows across her path as she ran, their abandoned forms reaching out like grasping fingers while distant mountains—where waterfalls might hide—loomed purple against the horizon. <words>387</words>

She knew, with a certainty that burned hotter than her screaming muscles, that when she finally decoded his riddle, when she found him beneath those mythical cascading waters, she would either kill him or kiss him—and she wasn't sure which would be the greater betrayal of self. <words>448</words>

The sun dipped lower as she completed another circuit, her shadow stretching before her like an accusation, while overhead, the first stars emerged to witness her relentless pursuit of answers in leaves, in patterns, in the space between heartbeats. <words>498</words>
