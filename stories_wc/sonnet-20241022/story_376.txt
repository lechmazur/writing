Madame Ravenna traced her fingers along the ancient timber beams of the converted longhouse, feeling the centuries of stories trapped within the gnarled wood. <words>27</words>

The space, once echoing with Viking warriors' battle cries, now housed her collection of mystical oddities and an impressive wine cellar that zigzagged beneath the medieval foundations. <words>52</words>

Her amber inkwell, inherited from a wandering soothsayer in Prague, sat prominently on a dragon-carved table, its contents shimming with an otherworldly gleam that matched her modestly flashy ensemble of deep purple silk and burnished copper bangles. <words>89</words>

She wasn't like other fortune tellers who relied on crystal balls and dramatic pronouncements; instead, she archived emotional patterns, collecting them like vintage wines, each feeling carefully bottled and stored in her memory. <words>124</words>

Through the hush of this overlooked era, where ancient meets modern, she had built a unique clientele who shared her passion for both divination and fine wines. <words>153</words>

Tonight's visitor, a silver-haired woman named Eleanor, sat across from her, swirling a glass of century-old Bordeaux with practiced elegance. <words>177</words>

"The wine speaks of loss," Madame Ravenna murmured, watching the liquid catch the light from iron sconces. <words>194</words>

"As does your heart," she added, noting how Eleanor's fingers trembled slightly against the crystal stem. <words>210</words>

The unspoken offer hung between them like incense smoke - not just a reading of the future, but a chance to uncork the past's sealed memories. <words>236</words>

Madame Ravenna reached for her inkwell, its contents not ink at all but liquid memories she had collected over decades of readings. <words>259</words>

"Some vintages," she said softly, "are meant to be shared, just as some burdens are meant to be halved." <words>278</words>

Eleanor's eyes widened as Ravenna began drawing ancient runes with the mysterious liquid, the symbols glowing faintly against the weathered oak table. <words>301</words>

The longhouse creaked around them, its timbers remembering their seafaring past as wind howled outside like the ghosts of long-dead raiders. <words>325</words>

"Your grandson," Ravenna said, watching the runes shift and flow, "he carries your late husband's spirit - not just in his eyes, but in the way he laughs at dawn." <words>359</words>

Eleanor gasped, tears spilling down her cheeks as freely as wine into a glass. <words>374</words>

Together they sat in fierce repose, two women bound by the delicate art of understanding both wine and wisdom, as Ravenna continued to draw forth memories like a sommelier decanting a precious vintage. <words>413</words>

The night deepened around them as they shared more wine and more truths, each sip revealing another layer of Eleanor's story, each truth adding another emotional pattern to Ravenna's vast collection. <words>449</words>

When Eleanor finally left, clutching a small vial of the amber liquid from Ravenna's inkwell - a gift to help her remember - the fortune teller smiled, knowing she had once again helped bridge the gap between what was lost and what remained. <words>495</words>

She carefully recorded the evening's emotional vintage in her ancient ledger, adding it to her archive of human experiences, each one as unique and complex as the wines they had shared. <words>531</words>

As morning light began to seep through the longhouse's high windows, Ravenna raised her glass to the spirits of the Vikings who had built this place, grateful for their unwitting contribution to her unusual calling. <words>570</words>
