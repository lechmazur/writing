In the pulsing xenon glow of the maintenance tunnel, Marcus clutched his childhood dinosaur plush, its fabric worn thin from decades of anxiety-driven fidgeting. <words>27</words>

As the city's least confident bard, he'd spent years writing songs no one had heard, but tonight the dream-hopping machines would change everything. <words>52</words>

The irony wasn't lost on him that he, who could barely whisper a melody in public, had discovered that his stuffed T-Rex contained the key to accessing humanity's collective unconscious. <words>84</words>

His voice, described by his therapist as "shyly loud," had a peculiar way of resonating with the quantum circuitry embedded in the tunnel's walls – a gift he'd only discovered while practicing in what he thought was an abandoned subway station. <words>127</words>

As December 31st of that cursed year ticked away, Marcus understood why the universe had chosen him to unravel the tapestry of shared sorrow that had woven itself into everyone's dreams. <words>164</words>

"Sometimes," he sang softly to his dinosaur, "the gentlest hands are needed to untangle the most delicate threads," and the plush's eyes began to glow with an ancient light. <words>195</words>

The dream-hopping machines hummed to life, their crystalline structures reflecting the xenon light like frozen tears, responding to the trembling notes of his voice. <words>223</words>

In each dream he visited, Marcus found fragments of the year's collective trauma: canceled weddings, lonely funerals, empty classrooms – all suspended in the amber of memory. <words>252</words>

His dinosaur, now animated by the machines' energy, danced through these dreams, leaving trails of starlight that stitched joy back into the fraying edges of people's hopes. <words>285</words>

"Time isn't just fragile," he sang, his confidence growing with each dream-step, "it's flexible, and even the darkest years can be reshaped by the light we choose to remember them by." <words>322</words>

As midnight approached in the real world, Marcus orchestrated a symphony of healing across the dreamscape, his voice carrying thousands of sleepers toward a new year. <words>353</words>

The worn-out dinosaur, channeling the power of every child's bedtime companion, helped him weave a new tapestry from the threads of the old – one that acknowledged the pain but emphasized the resilience. <words>394</words>

In the final moments before the year's turn, Marcus found himself in the shared dream of the entire city, standing on a stage of stardust, his faithful plush dinosaur transformed into a constellation beside him. <words>436</words>

His voice, no longer held back by hesitation, rang out clear and true, motivating every dreamer to carry their hopes rather than their hurts into the dawn of a new year. <words>472</words>

As the dream-hopping machines powered down and the xenon lights flickered back to their usual hum, Marcus hugged his dinosaur close, knowing that sometimes the most powerful magic comes from the most unlikely combinations of courage and comfort. <words>521</words>
