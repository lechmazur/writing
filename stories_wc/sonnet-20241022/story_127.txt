Marcus adjusted his brass goggles and mechanically strummed his steam-powered guitar in the dimly lit corner of The Corroded Cog lounge. <words>21</words>

The usual crowd of gear-laden patrons barely glanced his way, his recent performances as lifeless as the automaton bartender serving drinks. <words>41</words>

His fingers traced the intricate patterns etched into his guitar's metallic surface, reminiscent of the coral reefs he'd explored in his former life as a deep-sea salvage operator. <words>69</words>

The memory stirred something within him, much like the day he'd discovered that rusted knight's gauntlet in the depths, the very one his nemesis Viktor now displayed behind the bar as a trophy of their bitter rivalry. <words>107</words>

Between sets, as the pneumatic tubes whistled with incoming drink orders, Marcus found himself remembering the day everything had changed – when both he and Viktor had raced to claim the legendary artifact, only to become trapped in an underwater cave together. <words>150</words>

The textures of the coral that had surrounded them that day – rough, yet delicate, ancient yet alive – had forced them to work together, to trust each other with their very breath as they shared a single oxygen tank. <words>190</words>

Now, five years later, Marcus's creative block felt as suffocating as those moments beneath the waves, his music as hollow as the salvage pods they'd once piloted. <words>221</words>

His secret identity as the infamous "Coral Raider" weighed heavily on him, especially here in Viktor's establishment, where his rival had no idea that his regular performer was the same man he'd sworn to destroy. <words>263</words>

As the brass-piped ceiling vented steam in rhythmic bursts, Marcus's fingers found a new pattern on the strings, mimicking the intricate formations of that long-ago reef. <words>296</words>

The melody that emerged was different – not the usual steampunk fare, but something deeper, something that spoke of ocean depths and shared survival. <words>324</words>

He watched Viktor pause behind the bar, the owner's mechanical arm whirring as he gripped a glass too tightly, recognition flickering in his eyes. <words>351</words>

In that moment, Marcus knew what he had to do – he wove into his song the code they'd once used in their diving days, a pattern of notes that only Viktor would understand. <words>389</words>

The message was simple: "The gauntlet was never worth our brotherhood." <words>401</words>

As the final notes faded into the hiss of steam and clicking gears, Marcus saw Viktor slowly reach up and touch the rusted gauntlet, their shared past reflecting in its corroded surface. <words>441</words>

When their eyes met across the room, Viktor's slight nod told Marcus everything he needed to know – sometimes the greatest treasures weren't the ones you could salvage from the depths, but the trust you could rebuild from the ruins of the past. <words>489</words>
