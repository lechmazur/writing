General Marcus slouched at the counter of the Dark Matter Diner, absently picking at a piece of dried seaweed that reminded him of the dehydrated rations from his last deployment. <words>33</words>

Between shuttle rides to the outer colonies, this quantum-powered establishment existed in a peculiar state of both here and nowhere, much like the thoughts that had been haunting him since his retirement. <words>65</words>

The walls were lined with black-and-white photographs of military campaigns through the ages, their arcing trajectories of war and peace seeming to pulse with an otherworldly energy in the diner's antimatter lighting. <words>103</words>

"You're carrying the weight of a thousand soldiers' anxieties," said the waitress, her form shifting between solid and translucent as she poured him a coffee that defied gravity, swirling upward instead of down. <words>143</words>

Marcus chuckled, recognizing the rationally absurd nature of his situation – a decorated general seeking wisdom from a quantum waitress while hiding from his own fears. <words>173</words>

"The funny thing about fear," she continued, her smile both ancient and playful, "is that it sits on reason's throne like a child playing dress-up in their parent's clothes." <words>208</words>

The seaweed crackled between his fingers as he watched the photographs on the wall begin to move, showing soldiers throughout history sharing the same haunted looks he now wore. <words>245</words>

"Perhaps it's time to renew your perspective," the waitress suggested, gesturing to a photograph that had appeared behind his seat – one he hadn't taken but somehow showed him sitting in this very spot, looking considerably more at peace. <words>290</words>

Marcus stood up, approaching the image, and as he touched its surface, he felt the collective anxiety of every commander who had ever second-guessed their decisions flow through him and then dissipate like quantum foam. <words>334</words>

"The universe has a peculiar way of making the most serious things seem ridiculous and the most ridiculous things seem profound," he mused, watching as the coffee in his cup finally decided to obey gravity. <words>377</words>

The waitress winked, her form stabilizing momentarily. "That's why we serve breakfast all day – nothing dethrones fear quite like pancakes at midnight in a diner that exists in dark matter." <words>421</words>

As his next shuttle departure approached, Marcus left a generous tip made of stardust and took one last look at the photographs, now showing future versions of himself leading with renewed purpose and lighter shoulders. <words>469</words>

He stepped out into the quantum flux, carrying with him the mischievous wisdom that anxiety, like dark matter, only holds power when you can't see through its illusion. <words>506</words>
