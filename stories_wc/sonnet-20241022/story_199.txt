Park Ranger Sarah Chen patrolled the elevated urban orchard, her boots crunching fallen apples on what used to be Interstate 42. <words>21</words>

The trees, planted in neat rows along the abandoned highway, swayed in patterns that seemed to fluctuate between random chaos and deliberate design. <words>42</words>

She clutched her grandmother's plain notebook, its worn pages filled with cryptic sketches of divine footprints and calculations tracking the movements of something ancient that walked among the fruit trees. <words>71</words>

The world had changed since humanity's collective ability to dream had vanished three years ago, but Sarah's grandmother had predicted this in her familiar yet somehow alien writings. <words>100</words>

"Ma'am, this is a restricted area after sunset," Sarah called out to a figure that seemed to shimmer between the cherry trees, her ranger's instinct battling with her grandmother's instructions to wait for exactly this moment. <words>134</words>

Through chance encounters with other insomniacs who wandered the elevated orchard, Sarah had pieced together that others had seen the same figure, though none had thought to document it with her grandmother's obsessive precision. <words>168</words>

The apparition moved like mist through the methodically planted rows, leaving behind a trail of perfectly ripe fruit in what should have been the wrong season. <words>195</words>

Sarah's fingers traced the notebook's equations, her grandmother's meticulous observations mapping the goddess's patterns across decades of nocturnal wanderings, all leading to this precise location and time. <words>224</words>

The organized chaos of her grandmother's notes had seemed like the ramblings of a lonely woman, until Sarah started noticing how the fruit trees responded to the moonlight in impossible ways. <words>255</words>

Her fellow rangers thought she was overzealous in her night patrols, but they hadn't inherited the knowledge that the last dreams of humanity hadn't disappeared – they'd been gathered here, crystallized in fruit that hung heavy on branches that shouldn't bear in winter. <words>297</words>

The figure turned, finally, and Sarah recognized her grandmother's face, though she'd been dead for five years – the goddess wore familiar features like borrowed clothing, a bridge between what was known and unknown. <words>334</words>

"You kept such careful notes of my visits," the figure said, gesturing to the notebook with a smile that rippled like wind through leaves. <words>359</words>

Sarah's hand trembled as she held out the notebook, understanding now why her grandmother had spent decades tracking the goddess's movements through this place that didn't exist yet. <words>389</words>

"Your grandmother caught my echo," the figure said, plucking an apple from a nearby branch, "and now you've caught me whole – the keeper of humanity's last dreams, preserved in this orchard until people remember how to dream again." <words>431</words>

As the goddess's form dissolved into the moonlight, Sarah opened to a fresh page in the notebook, her grandmother's methodical madness now flowing through her own hand as she documented the exact moment when chaos and order became the same thing. <words>474</words>

The dreams would return, Sarah knew, but until then, she would patrol her elevated orchard, protecting the fruit that held them safe in their sweet flesh. <words>504</words>
