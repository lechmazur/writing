Marcus had never intended to become an urban forager, but his peculiar talent for finding discarded treasures in Parisian alleyways had become something of an obsession. <words>27</words>

The stained-glass fragment he'd discovered last week, with its brilliant cobalt blues and emerald greens, now felt heavy in his pocket as he descended the spiral stairs into the champagne vault, forgetting for the third time which turn he was supposed to take. <words>71</words>

Above ground, the International Science Fair was in full swing, its closing ceremony featuring a performance by the Paris Symphony Orchestra, but Marcus had other concerns. <words>100</words>

He'd arranged to meet Madame Rousseau here, though he'd already forgotten whether she'd said 8:30 or 9:00, a detail that seemed rather important now that he stood among the endless rows of aging champagne bottles. <words>139</words>

The elderly curator had contacted him after seeing his blog post about the glass fragment, claiming it belonged to a priceless medieval window that had once graced Notre-Dame, and while Marcus typically ignored such messages, something in her tone had caught his attention. <words>186</words>

The distant strings of the orchestra's final performance filtered through the limestone ceiling as he wandered the dimly lit vault, his footsteps echoing against bottles that had rested there since Napoleon's time. <words>223</words>

A chance movement caught his eye – another visitor, though not Madame Rousseau – a young woman in a pristine lab coat who seemed as surprised to see him as he was to see her. <words>259</words>

"You must be the American collector," she said with practiced indifference, though her eyes fixed immediately on his pocket. <words>282</words>

What followed was the most peculiar negotiation of Marcus's life, as he learned she was a conservation scientist who believed the fragment contained unique properties that could revolutionize glass preservation techniques. <words>321</words>

Above them, the orchestra swelled into its crescendo as Marcus weighed his options, absently patting his pockets for his phone, which he'd predictably left in his other jacket. <words>356</words>

The scientist's clinical approach to the artifact clashed dramatically with his own romantic notion of returning it to its original home, yet there was something compelling about her vision. <words>391</words>

As the final notes of the symphony reverberated through the vault, Marcus reached his decision – they would share custody of the fragment, protecting it together, though he couldn't quite remember how they'd arrived at this compromise. <words>436</words>

Later, emerging from the vault into the warm Parisian night, Marcus smiled at how his foraging had led to such an unlikely partnership, even if he'd already forgotten half the details they'd agreed upon. <words>475</words>

The fragment would be safe now, caught between the worlds of art and science, much like the city itself, though he made a mental note – which he'd surely lose – to start carrying a notebook. <words>516</words>
