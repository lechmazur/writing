In the floating metropolis of Neo-Cirrus, where buildings drifted like crystalline clouds, Marcus Vale made his living absorbing other people's mistakes. <words>21</words>

As a professional scapegoat, he possessed a robustly delicate reputation – strong enough to weather any scandal, yet precisely calibrated to appear vulnerable enough for believable blame. <words>45</words>

The job had stripped away his original identity years ago, leaving only a collection of borrowed names and fabricated pasts, each one carefully refashioned to suit his clients' needs. <words>71</words>

Tonight, as the last library card was scanned and returned to the circulation desk far below his apartment, Marcus studied the ancient metal washer he'd found embedded in a client's case file. <words>103</words>

The washer's surface bore peculiar markings that matched the encrypted symbols he'd been documenting from his mysterious midnight caller – the one who'd been reaching out every night for the past month with fragments of what seemed to be an archaic code. <words>143</words>

His apartment walls were covered with photographs and diagrams, connecting threads of investigation that had become his obsession, yet his hands remained steady as he traced each pattern with methodical precision. <words>173</words>

The caller had never revealed their identity, but Marcus recognized the cadence of someone desperate to hide a truth so massive it required his particular talents – not to shoulder the blame this time, but to decode something sacred. <words>214</words>

As his clock struck midnight, the phone rang with its now-familiar static-laden tone, and Marcus answered with the calm of someone who had surrendered to the gravity of destiny. <words>244</words>

"The washer you found," the distorted voice whispered, "is the key to the Cirrus Codex – the original blueprints of our floating world, and the truth about why we abandoned the ground." <words>276</words>

Marcus touched the washer's worn edge, feeling its weight as both artifact and answer, understanding that his career of wearing others' guilt had prepared him for this moment of revealing a civilization's buried truth. <words>314</words>

Through the window of his high-rise apartment, he watched the city's luminescent spires pierce the eternal mist, knowing that somewhere in this labyrinth of suspended streets and floating gardens lay the truth he'd been unknowingly preparing to uncover his entire career. <words>359</words>

As he aligned the washer with his collected midnight notes, the symbols began to shift and merge in his mind, revealing not just a code, but a map – one that would lead him through the layers of cloud and consciousness to the heart of why humanity had chosen to rise above its origins. <words>414</words>

His fingers moved across his evidence wall with the precision of a curator and the fervor of a zealot, each connection illuminating another piece of the puzzle that would either elevate or destroy the carefully constructed reality of their suspended world. <words>456</words>

In the end, Marcus realized, he would need to become the ultimate scapegoat – the one who would bear the weight of exposing the truth about their celestial exile, all while maintaining the obsessively calm demeanor that had become both his shield and his signature. <words>502</words>
