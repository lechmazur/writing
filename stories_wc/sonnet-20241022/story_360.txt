Marcus shuffled through the winding tunnels of the goblin underground, his necromancer's robes catching on crystalline outcrops as children's laughter echoed from the cavern schools above. <words>27</words>

His broken fountain pen, the nib bent beyond repair, felt heavy in his pocket – a reminder of countless failed attempts to transcribe the universal riddle that had haunted him since childhood. <words>52</words>

The goblins had welcomed him, despite his peculiar ability to speak with the dead, recognizing in his gentle demeanor and sincere quest something that aligned with their own ancient wisdom. <words>82</words>

Before him hung the legendary Tapestry of All Things, its threads shimming with an inner light that seemed to capture every possible story in existence. <words>108</words>

As he stood studying its intricate patterns, the sounds of playing children filtered down through crystal-lined air shafts, their innocent joy a stark contrast to the weight of his scholarly burden. <words>139</words>

"The answer isn't in the threads themselves," whispered a small goblin elder who had appeared silently beside him, her wrinkled green face kind. <words>162</words>

Marcus nodded, watching as morning dew dripped from the cavern ceiling onto the tapestry's surface, each droplet catching and reflecting the phosphorescent fungi's glow in a mesmerizing dance. <words>191</words>

In that moment, as light fractured through a perfect sphere of water, he saw it – the pattern he'd been seeking, the simple truth hidden in complexity, reflected and refracted in that single drop of moisture. <words>228</words>

His hands trembled as he reached for his broken pen, but the goblin elder stopped him with a gentle touch. <words>247</words>

"Some truths," she said, "cannot be written, only regained through the heart's understanding." <words>262</words>

The revelation struck him like a soft breath – the universal riddle wasn't meant to be solved, but experienced, just as the tapestry wasn't meant to be read, but felt in the soul's quiet moments. <words>298</words>

Children's laughter rippled through the cavern again, and Marcus smiled, finally understanding why the dead he spoke with always seemed to carry both sadness and joy in their voices – the answer had always been in the simple duality of existence itself. <words>342</words>

He touched his broken pen one last time before offering it to the goblin elder as a gesture of gratitude, watching as she added it to the tapestry's ever-growing pattern, where it caught the light like another drop of dew. <words>383</words>

In the end, his meek nature had served him better than any grand magical gesture, allowing him to see the truth that had been reflecting back at him all along, as clear as morning light in a child's laugh, as simple as water falling in a crystal cave. <words>432</words>

The tapestry continued its eternal weave, but now Marcus saw it differently – not as a puzzle to be decoded, but as a mirror of life's beautiful, mysterious simplicity, each thread connecting all things in a dance of light and shadow, life and death, question and answer. <words>484</words>
