Marcus slouched in the crumbling control room of Station Echo-7, absently levitating a coffee mug an inch off the console while staring at the cornfields beyond the cracked observation window. <words>33</words>

His family's farmland stretched to the horizon, scheduled for auction next week – the final nail in the coffin of his magical heritage. <words>57</words>

The misdelivered package that had arrived that morning sat unopened beside him, its shipping label bearing someone else's name but his grandmother's old station address. <words>86</words>

With the same lackluster energy he applied to his half-hearted spells at the Mediocre Mages Academy, Marcus finally tore open the brown paper, revealing a porcelain doll head with unnervingly realistic blinking eyes. <words>120</words>

"Congratulations on being exceptionally usual," the eyes blinked in Morse code, and Marcus nearly dropped his floating mug. <words>139</words>

The message continued: "Your grandmother left this test knowing only the most perfectly average mage could activate it – one whose power lay in being precisely, mathematically ordinary." <words>170</words>

Marcus straightened in his chair, a spark of interest breaking through his chronic ennui as he realized his grandmother, the station's last magical engineer, had turned his greatest perceived weakness into a key. <words>208</words>

The doll's eyes blinked faster as he held it, and suddenly the control room's dead panels flickered to life, projecting a map of the farm's ley lines that his grandmother had carefully cultivated over decades. <words>248</words>

Each intersection pulsed with stored magical energy, trapped in a network that could only be unveiled by someone whose magical signature matched the exact median of all recorded mages. <words>284</words>

"Being average isn't your limitation," his grandmother's voice echoed from the doll head, "it's your superpower – the ability to resonate with all magic equally, neither too strong nor too weak." <words>321</words>

Marcus felt his chest tighten as he realized she had spring-loaded this trap not to catch him, but to catch his self-doubt. <words>348</words>

With mechanical precision, he began activating the station's dormant systems, his perfectly middling magical ability acting as a universal key to unlock each component. <words>378</words>

The farm below shimmered as hidden enchantments revealed themselves – preservation spells, growth catalysts, and weather harmonizers all calibrated to respond to his supremely average magical frequency. <words>408</words>

By the time the sun set behind the cornfields, Marcus had reclaimed not just his heritage but his identity, finally understanding that his grandmother had built an entire magical infrastructure around the power of being extraordinarily ordinary. <words>449</words>

He smiled, letting his coffee mug settle onto the console with a soft clink, no longer feeling the need to prove his magical worth through pointless levitation tricks. <words>482</words>

The doll head winked one final time before going still, its purpose fulfilled in helping Marcus understand that sometimes the most powerful magic lies in being precisely, perfectly unremarkable. <words>521</words>
