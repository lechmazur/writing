In the shared dream recording studio, where thoughts crystallized into tangible frequencies, Marcus slouched in his ergonomic chair, an apathetic summoner who had long since grown weary of calling forth spirits for other people's entertainment. <words>39</words>

He absently turned the handle of his grandfather's rustic coffee grinder, the only object that had followed him from the waking world into this liminal space where dreamers came to preserve their nocturnal visions. <words>71</words>

The death of the Ocean God three days ago had left an emptiness that even the most enthusiastically lazy person couldn't ignore, as coral reefs worldwide began to crumble without divine supervision. <words>103</words>

Marcus watched as his latest recording began to unfold through matching empty frames hanging in the deserted hall, each golden rectangle capturing fragments of the river wisdom he'd gathered from his countless sessions with sleeping marine biologists and grieving merfolk. <words>147</words>

The coffee grounds, he had discovered, when scattered in precise patterns while recording, could anchor dreams with the weight of reality – a secret he'd learned from the River Goddess herself, who now watched her brother's domain with growing concern. <words>190</words>

"You know," she had whispered through the static of his headphones, "sometimes the most important work comes from those who appear to care the least," and Marcus had pretended not to notice how her words made his chest tighten. <words>233</words>

As the frames filled with shimmering visions of healthy reefs from thousands of dreamers' memories, Marcus realized that his apparent apathy had been a shield against the overwhelming responsibility of what he needed to do. <words>273</words>

Each turn of the coffee grinder released not just the aroma of roasted beans, but the collective knowledge of how coral polyps grew, how fish communities thrived, and how the delicate dance of ocean ecosystems maintained their balance. <words>321</words>

The gentle sharpness of his purpose finally cut through his practiced indifference as he watched the recorded dreams merge into a perfect blueprint for resurrection. <words>352</words>

Frame by frame, the dreams synchronized, showing how the reefs had flourished under the Ocean God's care, and more importantly, how they could be rebuilt through the combined wisdom of human understanding and divine memory. <words>397</words>

Marcus straightened in his chair, his fingers steady on the grinder's handle, as he prepared to do what no other summoner had attempted – to use the captured dreams as a foundation to call forth not spirits or memories, but the very essence of life itself. <words>449</words>

In the end, it would be his peculiar combination of traits – his surface-level apathy and his hidden dedication, his enthusiastic laziness that masked years of careful observation – that would allow him to bridge the gap between the dying god's last breath and the ocean's rebirth. <words>506</words>

The coffee grinder turned one final time, and Marcus smiled as the scent of salt water began to fill the studio, knowing that sometimes the most profound changes come from the most unlikely sources. <words>547</words>
