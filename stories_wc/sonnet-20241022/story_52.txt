Marcus drifted through the sand-dusted marketplace, his nimble fingers twitching as timekeeper crystals trickled down the massive glass walls that enclosed the ancient bazaar. <words>27</words>

The broken pencil sharpener in his pocket was all he had left of his sister Sarah, who'd vanished into the upper chamber of the hourglass three years ago when the chalk markings she'd used to map the time-paths had finally faded away. <words>71</words>

He'd learned to pick pockets not out of greed, but because each stolen trinket might contain a clue to her whereabouts, and every lifted locket or pilfered pendant brought him closer to understanding the marketplace's temporal mechanics. <words>116</words>

When the off-key warbling of "Total Eclipse of the Heart" echoed through the bazaar, Marcus recognized Sarah's voice immediately, though it was intertwined with another's – deeper, older, impossibly familiar. <words>157</words>

His mother, who'd abandoned them decades ago, materialized near a stall selling crystallized memories, her voice harmonizing with Sarah's as they belted out the power ballad with a peculiar mix of irony and raw emotion. <words>206</words>

"You little thief," his mother called out with a smirk, pausing mid-chorus, "I knew you'd find us eventually – we've been watching you fumble around down here, picking pockets like a drunk bumblebee." <words>251</words>

Sarah emerged from behind a column of falling sand, grinning as she explained, "We had to wait until you learned the market's secret: that time flows differently for those who carry others' belongings – it's why pickpockets can slip between the moments." <words>309</words>

Marcus felt his face flush with equal parts anger and relief as he shot back, "Well, you could have left a less tastefully offensive note than 'Gone shopping for a better family' scrawled on the bathroom mirror." <words>359</words>

"Oh, darling," his mother sighed, reaching for his hand, "we needed you to feel just enough betrayal to start taking things that didn't belong to you – it was the only way to teach you how to navigate the timestreams." <words>414</words>

The truth seared through Marcus's soul like temporal lightning: every lifted wallet and snatched bracelet had been a lesson in bending time, orchestrated by the two women who'd seemingly abandoned him but had actually been preparing him for something greater. <words>470</words>

As the sand continued to fall around them, Sarah pulled out her own broken pencil sharpener – a perfect match to his – and their mother produced a third, completing the set of temporal anchors that would allow them to finally begin their real work: protecting the marketplace from those who would abuse its powers. <words>543</words>
