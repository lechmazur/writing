Dr. Hazel Thornberry adjusted her worn-out leather belt, which barely held together the numerous specimen vials containing her precious carnivorous plant extracts, as she settled into the creaking chair at the Mountain Lotus Tea House, perched precariously at 12,000 feet. <words>42</words>

The ancient projector sputtered to life during the intermission of what had been advertised as a documentary about high-altitude flora, but she knew better – hidden within the black-and-white footage were the secrets she'd spent decades pursuing. <words>82</words>

"The ionization patterns of Nepenthes altitude-vorax are absolutely crucial to understanding the ancestral migration routes," she announced to no one in particular, her face maintaining its characteristic stern expression despite the absurdity of talking to herself in an empty tea house. <words>127</words>

As the film flickered, showing mundane footage of mountain paths, Dr. Thornberry meticulously noted the seemingly random static disruptions, her collection of carnivorous plants rustling ominously in their cases, responding to something only they could sense. <words>170</words>

The tea house owner, Mr. Chen, watched from the shadows, alternating between offering her fresh oolong and reporting her suspicious behavior to competing botanical societies, each of which had promised him a fortune for information about the eccentric scientist's whereabouts. <words>218</words>

"These electromagnetic disturbances perfectly match the feeding patterns of my darlings," she muttered, completely oblivious to Mr. Chen's duplicity, as she cross-referenced her notes with ancient manuscripts depicting mysterious mountain pathways that seemed to defy physical geography. <words>263</words>

Her most prized specimen, a hybrid she'd named "Betrayer's Bloom," suddenly snapped its trap shut without any apparent stimulus, causing her to freeze mid-calculation and peer more closely at a particular frame of the film. <words>306</words>

There, in the grainy footage, she spotted it – a shimmer in the air that matched the precise frequency her plants emitted when they detected the presence of interdimensional portals, the very ones the ancient mountain monks had used centuries ago. <words>359</words>

"Empirical evidence demands absolute seriousness," she declared to her plants, straightening her wire-rimmed glasses while trying to suppress her excitement as one of her specimens began to glow with an otherworldly light. <words>397</words>

Mr. Chen, who had been about to make another call to a rival research institute, found himself transfixed as Dr. Thornberry's plants began to move in impossible ways, their leaves tracing patterns in the air that matched the mysterious markings on the tea house's ancient walls. <words>452</words>

The film reel suddenly stopped, but the projector's light continued to flicker in sync with the plants' movements, and Dr. Thornberry allowed herself a small, satisfied smile – she had finally found the convergence point between the ancient pathways and her beloved plants' peculiar abilities, though she couldn't have predicted that her discovery would cause Mr. Chen to faint dead away into his own tea service. <words>524</words>
