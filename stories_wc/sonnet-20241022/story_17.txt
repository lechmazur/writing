Miranda Chen shuffled through her morning walk in Salem's cobblestone alleys, clutching a chipped bowl filled with newspaper clippings of funeral announcements dating back decades. <words>27</words>

As a black market genealogist who specialized in fabricating prestigious family trees for the wealthy, she found herself drawn to Madame Blackwood's incantation chamber each dawn, seeking absolution for years of ancestral deception. <words>71</words>

The witch's workspace was atypically typical – crystal balls and dried herbs, yes, but also a laptop and a surprisingly modern coffee maker that would zoom to life whenever someone entered. <words>116</words>

"Your guilt feeds the spirits," Madame Blackwood would say, her voice carrying both authority and an almost brazen modesty, "but your skill in analyzing funeral eulogies reveals truths even I cannot see." <words>164</words>

Miranda had discovered that eulogies contained hidden genealogical patterns – the way distant relatives described the deceased, the careful omissions, the subtle hints of family secrets – all of which she had previously used to craft convincing false histories. <words>228</words>

But now, standing on the brink of renewal, she understood that her talent could serve a different purpose: helping adopted children find their biological families through the whispered truths in generations of farewell speeches. <words>284</words>

The chipped bowl, a family heirloom she'd stolen from her own grandmother's estate sale, served as both her penance and her divining tool, its crack representing the fissure between truth and deception in her life's work. <words>343</words>

"Pour the clippings into the bowl," Madame Blackwood instructed during their daily sessions, "and let the morning light reveal the patterns of redemption hidden in these final words of love." <words>391</words>

Each dawn brought Miranda closer to understanding that her gift for reading between the lines of loss wasn't meant for profit, but for healing – both for herself and for others searching for their roots. <words>442</words>

As she traced her fingers along the bowl's jagged imperfection, Miranda realized that like this damaged vessel, she too could hold something precious despite her flaws, and perhaps that was the first step toward forgiving herself. <words>499</words>

The morning fog swirled around her ankles as she left the chamber that day, her heart lighter with the knowledge that she would transform her shadowy expertise into a beacon of hope for those seeking their true histories. <words>557</words>
