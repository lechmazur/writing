The caretaker of the SS Nostalgia traced cloud patterns through the cargo hold's viewport, her wry smile reflecting off the glass as nebulae drifted by like cosmic seafoam. <words>27</words>

She'd been tracking their paths for weeks now, marking their trajectories with stolen chalk on the metal walls, searching for the pattern that would finally silence the questions that had haunted her since that last phone call. <words>71</words>

The ancient satellite phone lay silent in her pocket, its final dial tone having sputtered out somewhere between Mars and the asteroid belt, taking with it her last connection to a life she'd chosen to leave behind. <words>116</words>

"Time flows like those clouds out there," she would tell the crates of contraband she tended to, maintaining a warmly aloof relationship with both the cargo and crew who rarely ventured into her domain. <words>159</words>

Her chalk markings had grown into an intricate map of temporal physics, each swirl and line representing another "what if" she was trying to mathematically disprove: what if she'd stayed, what if she'd answered differently, what if she'd been brave enough to say goodbye properly. <words>225</words>

The space pirates who'd hired her appreciated her peculiarities as long as their stolen goods remained secure, though they whispered about the strange calculations covering every surface of their hold. <words>271</words>

She knew she was close to understanding something fundamental about the nature of time itself, how it curved and bent like the cosmic clouds she tracked, how it could fold back on itself if you just knew where to push. <words>324</words>

The chalk dust floated in the artificial gravity like stardust as she made her final calculations, each particle a tiny clock ticking away moments that refused to be recaptured. <words>369</words>

When the last equation clicked into place, she felt rather than saw the shift – the gentle harshness of reality bending around her like a cosmic curtain being drawn aside. <words>409</words>

The phone in her pocket hummed to life one last time, but she didn't answer it; instead, she watched as her chalk marks began to glow and her body started to fade, beginning with her fingertips. <words>456</words>

As she vanished into the mathematical proof she'd created, she finally understood that some questions weren't meant to be answered – they were meant to be released, like clouds dispersing into the infinite canvas of space. <words>506</words>
