Maya hadn't spoken directly to another person in three years, but her puppet Sebastian had plenty to say about the three moons hanging over this version of Venice Beach. <words>33</words>

Through Sebastian's painted wooden lips, she documented the peculiar atmospheric conditions that occurred when all three celestial bodies aligned, creating prismatic tide patterns she meticulously recorded in her weather journal. <words>71</words>

The late-night diner where she worked was closing up when she first overheard the phone conversation that would change everything – someone describing a weather anomaly archive exactly like hers, but from another dimension's coastline. <words>116</words>

The cardboard coffee sleeve she was fidgeting with nearly tore in half as she listened to the familiar voice she hadn't heard since crossing over: her own mother, from the universe she'd left behind. <words>159</words>

Despite the patronizing tone her mother always took when discussing Maya's selective mutism, something about hearing that voice again – even through an interdimensional phone glitch – filled her with an irrepressible hope. <words>201</words>

Sebastian, perched on her left hand, whispered that perhaps there was a reason the weather patterns between universes were connecting now, three years to the day since Maya had accidentally slipped through during that electrical storm. <words>251</words>

Each night after closing, Maya positioned herself in the booth nearest the phone, documenting the cross-dimensional weather conversations while Sebastian voiced her theories to the empty diner about how the atmospheric anomalies might be nature's way of knitting fractured families back together. <words>314</words>

The regulars at the diner had long accepted the peculiar ventriloquist who communicated exclusively through her puppet, but they didn't know she was methodically building a bridge between worlds, one meteorological data point at a time. <words>365</words>

When the third moon reached its apex and the tide pulled back farther than she'd ever seen, Maya heard her mother's voice crack through the phone line one final time: "I know you're there, listening, collecting the patterns like you always did – please come home." <words>428</words>

With trembling hands, Maya lifted Sebastian to her ear, and for the first time since crossing over, she found her own voice, whispering into the receiver not through her puppet but through the tears streaming down her face: "The weather's finally perfect for crossing back." <words>485</words>

As she stepped onto the impossibly dry seabed, following the path of converging weather systems between worlds, Sebastian tucked safely in her pocket and her weather journal clutched to her chest, Maya knew that sometimes family could only be redefined after being lost. <words>543</words>
