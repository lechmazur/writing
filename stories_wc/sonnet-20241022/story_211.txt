Marcus had typically never considered himself lucky until he started gambling with memories instead of money. <words>17</words>

In the abandoned schoolhouse where he now made his home, surrounded by the dust of a ghost town that had survived the Great Collapse, he carefully tended to his most precious possession: a botanical diary that could duplicate any memory pressed between its pages. <words>63</words>

The diary had been his salvation in 2157, when hope had become as scarce as clean water and uncontaminated soil. <words>86</words>

Every full moon, survivors would gather in his classroom-turned-sanctuary to play a peculiar game of spin-the-bottle confessions, trading their happiest memories for a chance to experience someone else's joy. <words>120</words>

Marcus, with his newfound power to duplicate these precious mental moments, had become their dealer of dreams, their merchant of manufactured happiness – and he'd discovered that people would trade anything for a taste of better days. <words>159</words>

At first, he'd used his ability to help others defy the gravity of hopelessness that threatened to crush what remained of humanity. <words>184</words>

But power, even the power to share happiness, has a way of corrupting the purest intentions. <words>201</words>

Soon, Marcus found himself hoarding the most beautiful memories, creating a private collection of stolen sunsets, first kisses, and childhood laughter, all preserved like pressed flowers between the diary's pages. <words>238</words>

He would sit alone in the gathering dusk, leafing through his botanical diary filled with both real pressed plants and the ethereal imprints of other people's joy, convincing himself that he was their guardian, their keeper. <words>284</words>

The truth was, he had become addicted to the rush of acquiring new memories, each spin of the bottle an opportunity to add another precious moment to his collection. <words>321</words>

In the hush of this unremembered future, where the line between preservation and theft had grown as blurry as the horizon, Marcus continued his games with a smile that never quite reached his eyes. <words>365</words>

His players would leave his schoolhouse with borrowed happiness, their own precious memories now duplicated and archived in his growing collection, while he remained trapped in a cheerful despair of his own making. <words>408</words>

Yet he couldn't stop – wouldn't stop – because in this world of faded hopes and broken promises, he had finally found something he was good at: being the lucky gambler who traded in the currency of remembered joy, even as it slowly hollowed him out from within. <words>470</words>
