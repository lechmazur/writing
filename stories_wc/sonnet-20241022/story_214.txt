Marcus adjusted the ancient telescope's focus, watching pinpricks of starlight dance through the observatory's dome as it bobbed gently on the methane sea. <words>23</words>

Between his monitoring shifts, he would pull out the piece of sea glass he'd found in his grandmother's effects - its clouded blue-green surface holding secrets he was only beginning to understand. <words>47</words>

The loss of his last living relative had led him to this solitary posting on Titan, but in her final letter, she'd hinted that the seemingly worthless trinket was more than mere beach debris. <words>82</words>

In the observatory's dim light, Marcus held the glass up to the auxiliary lamp, revealing microscopic etchings that whispered silently of coordinates and quantum frequencies. <words>108</words>

He'd spent months decoding the microfilm hidden in his grandmother's dusty archive boxes, piecing together her past as a deep-space surveyor and her discovery of something extraordinary near the galaxy's edge. <words>143</words>

The trapper's instincts that had served him well in catching solar wind particles now guided his investigation as he cross-referenced the glass's coordinates with the observatory's star charts. <words>173</words>

Each shift ended with him closer to understanding, the work becoming an obsession that filled the void her death had left, giving purpose to his isolation. <words>201</words>

When he finally aligned the telescope to the exact position encoded in the glass, he witnessed something impossible - a microscopic black hole that seemed to pulse with captured light. <words>234</words>

His grandmother had discovered a way to harvest energy from the phenomenon, and now he could recommence her work, using the observatory's specialized equipment to siphon and store the radiance that escaped the darkness. <words>272</words>

The process required precision and patience, skills Marcus had honed during long seasons alone in the solar winds, but the reward was beyond anything he'd imagined. <words>303</words>

Each successful extraction filled both the observatory's power cells and the empty spaces in his heart, transforming his loss into a legacy of light. <words>332</words>

As he worked through the artificial night, Marcus smiled at the whimsical thought that his grandmother had led him here not just to continue her research, but to find his own path among the stars. <words>371</words>

The sea glass sat on his console now, catching and refracting the harvested light in patterns that seemed to dance with joy, as if his grandmother's spirit was celebrating his discovery. <words>408</words>

In the end, what had begun as an escape from grief had become a journey of revelation, proving that sometimes the greatest discoveries lie hidden in what we think we've lost. <words>444</words>

The methane waves lapped at the observatory's pontoons as Marcus logged his findings, knowing that tomorrow he would begin again, grateful for the solitude that had led him to this moment of illumination. <words>479</words>
