The undertaker Darius traced his fingers along the astronomical clock's brass meridians, his shoulders heavy with the weight of ten thousand burials. <words>21</words> In the restored halls of Persepolis, where holographic tapestries flickered between ancient and modern scenes, he guarded the last remnants of his people's wisdom. <words>45</words> The clock, passed down through seventeen generations of death-keepers, held within its intricate gears the secret pathways to the afterworld – knowledge that his ancestors had sworn to protect. <words>73</words>

A car backfired in the empty street beyond the palace walls, its echo dissolving into an otherworldly silence that seemed to stretch time itself. <words>97</words> In that suspended moment, Darius watched the clock's celestial faces align, revealing the sacred geometries his grandmother had taught him to read, though he'd always questioned their practical value in a world of GPS coordinates and digital maps. <words>134</words>

Yet tonight was different. <words>138</words> The souls of the recently departed were restless, refusing to follow their prescribed paths to the beyond, and Darius knew he had to act. <words>164</words> With methodical precision, he adjusted the clock's rings to match the ancient sun paths etched into the palace floor, their golden inlays still gleaming after thousands of years. <words>195</words>

His grandmother's words echoed in his mind: "To imprison death itself, one must first trap its shadow." <words>213</words> The clock's mechanisms whirred to life, each constellation dial rotating in perfect harmony, creating a celestial cage that would hold the wandering spirits until dawn. <words>241</words>

In the absolute darkness that followed, broken only by the phosphorescent glow of the clock's face, Darius maintained his vigil. <words>263</words> The restored palace around him seemed to breathe, its walls expanding and contracting with the weight of centuries, while holographic peacocks strutted across digital gardens that flickered between past and present. <words>297</words>

His work was rarely practical in this modern age – who needed an undertaker who could read the stars when there were apps for everything? <words>324</words> But as the clock's arms swept through their ancient arcs, gathering lost souls like a shepherd collecting strays, Darius felt the fierce pride of his lineage burning in his chest. <words>359</words>

The night deepened, and with each tick of the astronomical clock, another spirit found its way home. <words>378</words> Darius stood watch, his placid expression masking the ferocity of his dedication, knowing that as long as he maintained these rituals, hope would remain – even in the darkest hours. <words>414</words>

When dawn finally broke, painting the palace's hybrid architecture in shades of rose and gold, the clock settled into its daily rhythm. <words>437</words> Darius allowed himself a small smile, understanding that some knowledge was worth preserving not for its practicality, but for the threads of wonder it wove through the fabric of existence. <words>470</words> The car-silenced street outside resumed its modern pulse, but within these walls, time continued to dance to the ancient rhythms of sun and stars. <words>500</words>
