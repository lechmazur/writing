In the Forbidden City's Hall of Supreme Harmony, Ming Wei arranged pressed flowers in her botanical press with the same precision she used to arrange deaths. <words>27</words>

As the Emperor's most trusted assassin-slash-royal herbalist, she found it delightfully ironic that both her vocations involved the careful preservation of delicate things. <words>52</words>

The whispers of longing that echoed through the palace corridors were literally keeping her awake these days, as the Emperor's numerous concubines had developed an unfortunate habit of dramatic midnight soliloquies beneath her window. <words>86</words>

Ming Wei watched a butterfly land on her press, its wings creating a pattern that, if one were versed in the ancient art of lepidopteromancy, spelled out "duck" – which was either a message from the gods or a warning about tonight's dinner. <words>127</words>

She needed to amalgamate all the signs before the Empress Dowager asked her annual question about the imperial succession, a tradition that invariably led to someone requiring Ming Wei's less botanical services. <words>164</words>

"When prophecies become this figuratively literal," she muttered, noting how the butterfly's wing pattern matched exactly with the pressed flowers' arrangement, which matched precisely with the palace guard rotation schedule, which aligned perfectly with the kitchen's duck-serving times, "it's just showing off." <words>214</words>

The entire situation was becoming absurd – here she was, a calm assassin trying to spin prophecies into possibilities, while surrounded by lovesick concubines, prophetic insects, and what she was increasingly certain was a conspiracy involving poultry. <words>263</words>

Ming Wei carefully closed her botanical press, trapping both the flowers and the butterfly's pattern within its pages, knowing that sometimes the best way to preserve fate was to press it flat and let it dry. <words>305</words>

As she made her way to the Empress Dowager's chambers, she passed three separate concubines practicing their forlorn sighs, two guards discussing the suspicious behavior of the palace ducks, and one very nervous-looking cook. <words>349</words>

The whole palace seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for the first question to be asked, but Ming Wei had already decoded the day's signs: someone was planning to poison the Emperor's duck, the butterfly had warned her, and now she had to decide whether to stop it or simply ensure it happened to the right duck at the right time. <words>421</words>

She smiled serenely, fingering her botanical press where both prophecy and poison were now safely pressed between pages, and thought that perhaps the best way to handle the situation was to let everyone's schemes play out – after all, what was the fun in being an assassin if you couldn't occasionally sit back and watch others do your work for you? <words>497</words>

"Though really," she whispered to herself as she approached the Empress Dowager's door, "they could have picked a less obvious bird." <words>524</words>
