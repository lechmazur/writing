The assassin watched through her paint-splattered camera lens as the last transport pod made its final descent across Asteroid B-771's crystalline surface. <words>21</words>

Through the viewfinder, the vehicle's lights traced patterns reminiscent of a spider's web glistening after a simulated rain shower in the biodomes. <words>41</words>

She laughed softly, the sound echoing off the baroque architecture that generations of wealthy miners had carved into the asteroid's metallic heart – all those ornate columns and gilded archways that tried so desperately to make this floating rock feel like home. <words>82</words>

The unforgiving road stretched before her, a ribbon of reinforced plasteel that wrapped around the asteroid's circumference like a choker of borrowed starlight. <words>108</words>

Her target was the bus driver, Marina Chen, who had spent fifteen years ferrying workers between the mines and their cramped quarters, but tonight would be her last route. <words>139</words>

The assassin had chosen this moment carefully, when the artificial dawn would begin to creep across the horizon, its trembling light seeping through the atmospheric shield that kept them all alive. <words>173</words>

She'd listened to Marina's supposedly profound speeches at the local bar about the nature of existence on the asteroid, how they were all just stardust trying to find its way home – the kind of superficial philosophy that comes easily after too many synthetic whiskeys. <words>220</words>

But the truth was far simpler: Marina had seen something she shouldn't have during one of her late-night routes, when the governor's private shuttle had docked in an unauthorized mining shaft. <words>255</words>

The assassin adjusted her position among the carved cherubs and twisting vines that adorned the observation deck, her body as still as the stone figures surrounding her. <words>285</words>

Through the lens, she watched Marina complete her final check-in at the last station, the driver's weathered face illuminated by the control panel's glow. <words>314</words>

The transport pod hummed to a stop, and Marina stepped out, her breath visible in the artificial cold, her hands raised as if to embrace the manufactured dawn that was now painting the dome in shades of amber and rose. <words>359</words>

The assassin felt an unexpected kinship with her target – they were both creatures of routine, of careful observation, of lonely dawns spent in the company of stars that weren't really there. <words>397</words>

She lowered her camera, now useless for its intended purpose of documenting the kill, its lens hopelessly smeared with iridescent paint from her earlier escape through the maintenance tunnels. <words>431</words>

As Marina stood there, arms outstretched to cradle the false dawn, the assassin made her choice – she would let the morning keep its witness, let Marina keep her superficial truths, and find another way to satisfy her employers. <words>475</words>

Sometimes, she realized, the most profound act was to simply walk away, leaving nothing but footprints in the cosmic dust and the echo of a laugh that would drift forever among the stars. <words>513</words>
