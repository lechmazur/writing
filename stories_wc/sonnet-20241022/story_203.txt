Sister Elena's hands trembled as she arranged pressed wildflowers across the control panel of the abandoned satellite, each dried petal a reminder of the Earth she'd left behind. <words>27</words>

The irony of an exorcist with stage fright being the only one qualified to cleanse haunted space stations wasn't lost on her, but her grandmother's final confession had changed everything. <words>56</words>

As she assembled the toy rocket her grandmother had given her – the same one that had been passed down through generations of their family – she finally understood why each exorcist before her had failed. <words>89</words>

The inheritance of lies floated around her like the orbital debris outside: stories of holy water and crucifixes, when the true power had always been in the quantum entanglement of memories preserved in pressed flowers. <words>124</words>

She could hear them now, the whispers of trapped souls caught in the never usual patterns of space junk, their voices rising and falling with the rotation of dead satellites. <words>154</words>

The key to her grandmother's antique music box turned with a decisive click, and Elena felt reality shift – the sound that had banished demons for centuries disguised as a simple lullaby. <words>187</words>

She watched as spectral forms began to submerge into the void, pulled by the music's frequencies through tears in space-time that her ancestors had discovered but never dared to document. <words>221</words>

"The church wanted theatrical displays," she whispered into her helmet's comm system, "but true exorcism was always about the quiet manipulation of quantum fields." <words>246</words>

Her grandmother's last words echoed in her mind as she continued assembling the toy rocket, each piece clicking into place like the tumblers of a cosmic lock: "Our fear of attention kept us safe, kept the truth hidden in plain sight." <words>288</words>

The dried violets and daisies began to glow with an inner light, their cellular memories activating in the presence of the ancient frequency, and Elena felt her stage fright dissolve into something stronger – a defiant hush that had protected her family's secret for generations. <words>341</words>

As the final pieces of both the toy rocket and the ritual fell into place, she understood that her grandmother had sculpted this moment from the ashes of every "never" thrown at their family: never reveal, never trust, never reach for the stars. <words>391</words>

The haunted debris field around her began to shift, aligning into a pattern that mirrored the pressed flowers' arrangement, and Elena smiled behind her visor as she realized that sometimes the quietest acts of defiance could reshape the very fabric of reality. <words>441</words>

In the silence of space, amid the final assembly of a toy that was never just a toy, she became what her grandmother had prepared her to be: not just an exorcist, but a guardian of the threshold between what was possible and what was forbidden. <words>492</words>

The key turned one final time, and the universe held its breath. <words>505</words>
