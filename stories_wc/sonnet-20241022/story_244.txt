The neon sign repair shop's buzzing lights cast shifting shadows across Mai's face as she traced the labyrinthine carvings on the tribal mask with calloused fingers. <words>27</words>

Her sword lay wrapped in silk beside her, a constant reminder of the blood she'd spilled in pursuit of this artifact. <words>48</words>

The half-truth historians had led her through a maze of contradicting tales, each one bringing her closer to understanding the mask's connection to the door of release – a portal said to appear only after the final petal dropped from the ancient rosebush in the temple gardens. <words>89</words>

Mai had watched that last petal fall three nights ago, its descent as gentle as her victims' final breaths. <words>108</words>

The shop owner, Mr. Chen, worked silently on his signs, pretending not to notice how she'd transformed his back room into a study of mystical possibilities, her reservedly bold nature allowing her to command the space without ever raising her voice. <words>149</words>

"The door appears to those who've lost everything," she murmured, piecing together fragments of lore gleaned from dusty scrolls and whispered confessions. <words>171</words>

Each historian had given her a different version of the truth, but all agreed: the mask was the key, and only one bearing the weight of profound guilt could unlock its power. <words>204</words>

The neon lights flickered as Mai stood, her shadow dancing across walls cluttered with half-repaired signs advertising forgotten establishments. <words>224</words>

She'd pursued this path for years, seeking absolution for the lives she'd taken as a blade for hire, each death adding another layer to the burden she carried. <words>254</words>

The mask seemed to pulse with its own inner light as she lifted it to her face, its edges fitting perfectly against her skin as if it had been waiting for her all along. <words>290</words>

Mr. Chen's hands stilled on his current repair, though he kept his back turned as the air in the shop grew thick with possibility. <words>315</words>

Through the mask's eyeholes, Mai saw the world differently – the shadows between the signs took on depth and meaning, and the space behind Mr. Chen's workbench began to ripple like disturbed water. <words>351</words>

The door of release materialized slowly, its frame constructed of pure darkness outlined by traces of neon light. <words>371</words>

Mai's hand found her sword's hilt as she stepped toward the threshold, understanding that this portal to the unknown might lead to either damnation or redemption. <words>399</words>

"Thank you for your patience," she said to Mr. Chen, her voice muffled behind the mask. <words>415</words>

He finally turned, revealing a knowing smile. <words>422</words>

"We all seek doors," he replied, returning to his work as Mai stepped through the threshold, leaving behind only the soft hum of neon and the lingering scent of fallen rose petals. <words>456</words>
