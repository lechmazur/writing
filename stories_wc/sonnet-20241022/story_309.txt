Detective Sarah Chen stared at the Queen of Hearts lying in the center of the empty gallery floor, its edges singed and corners curled like autumn leaves. <words>27</words>

"Oh sure, because a playing card at a crime scene isn't cliché at all," she muttered, crouching down to photograph the evidence while her joints creaked in protest from her third double shift this week. <words>71</words>

The Vanishing Point Gallery lived up to its name tonight – every piece of art had disappeared except for a broken kaleidoscope mounted on a pedestal near the emergency exit, its cracked lens catching the last flickers of the police lights outside. <words>116</words>

Sarah picked up the kaleidoscope, remembering how her daughter used to love these things before the accident, and as she turned it, fractured images danced across her vision: red queen, white walls, missing paintings, time running out. <words>159</words>

She began to rummage through her case files, spreading them across the floor in a desperate pattern that mimicked the kaleidoscope's shifting geometry, absolutely certain she'd seen this card before while simultaneously doubting every instinct she'd ever had. <words>208</words>

The silence that followed the final police siren felt like a held breath, and in that quiet, Sarah's memories crystallized: her daughter's collection of playing cards, the hospital room, the art therapist who'd helped during recovery, and the distinctive signature on the back of that Queen of Hearts. <words>264</words>

"Well, isn't this just perfectly twisted," she said to the empty gallery, her voice dripping with bitter amusement as she realized the art therapist – the one who'd helped her daughter heal, the one she'd trusted – had been leaving these cards at every heist. <words>315</words>

The kaleidoscope showed her fragments of truth in its broken mirrors: glimpses of paintings being carried through service doors, a familiar silhouette, the glint of therapy badges used to access restricted areas in hospitals and museums alike. <words>365</words>

Sarah knew she had exactly six hours before the next gallery opened, six hours to prevent another theft, six hours to catch someone who'd used her own painful memories as a smokescreen – and she was going to have to dance faster than her ghosts to do it. <words>424</words>

She pocketed the Queen of Hearts and took one last look through the kaleidoscope, watching as the fractured patterns resolved into a map of the city's art district, each fragment a possible target, each reflection a step in this twisted game of cat and mouse that had somehow become intensely personal. <words>485</words>

"Game on, Doc," she whispered, her voice carrying equal measures of determination and uncertainty as she headed for the door, leaving behind the empty gallery and its broken kaleidoscope still spinning slowly on its pedestal, throwing shattered rainbows across the walls like promises waiting to be broken. <words>543</words>
