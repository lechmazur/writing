The brass gears of the observation deck whirred as Marcus adjusted his measuring tape, watching his reflection fragment across the dusty mirror's cracked surface. <words>27</words>

As lightning illuminated the steam-powered spires of New Alexandria, he couldn't help but remember the thousands of suits he'd tailored over decades, each customer a window into another life he might have lived. <words>71</words>

"I see them too," he whispered to his newest client, a woman whose dress measurements matched exactly those of his long-lost wife, "the other versions of ourselves, dancing through the glass." <words>116</words>

The woman trembled, not from the cold, but from recognition as thunder rolled across the mechanical sky. <words>134</words>

"When they broke the final cipher last month," Marcus continued, pins held delicately between his lips, "they didn't just unlock the mathematical secrets of reality – they proved what I've known all along: every reflection holds a door." <words>181</words>

He gently turned her toward the mirror, his weathered hands steady despite the weight of revelation. <words>198</words>

"Don't be afraid," he reassured her, watching their reflections multiply infinitely in the fractured glass, each version showing a slightly different scene – some where they smiled, others where they wept, all existing simultaneously. <words>245</words>

The storm intensified, and brass lightning rods channeled celestial energy through the observation deck's crystalline windows, making the mirror pulse with otherworldly potential. <words>276</words>

"I've spent thirty years crafting garments that bridge the gap," Marcus confessed, his voice barely audible above the thunder, "Each stitch is a calculation, each seam a probability wave, creating clothes that can survive the transition between realities." <words>334</words>

His client's eyes widened as she noticed how her new dress seemed to shift and ripple, its fabric catching impossible lights. <words>359</words>

"We're all trapped in our single lives," he said, adjusting her collar with practiced precision, "but I've found a way to reach across, to touch the lives we might have lived – if you're brave enough to try." <words>414</words>

The mirror's surface began to liquify, mercury-like in the storm's electric glow, and Marcus felt the familiar pull of infinite possibilities. <words>443</words>

"Together," he whispered, his reflection's lips moving slightly out of sync with his own, "we can become more than this world allows – we can become every version of ourselves at once." <words>484</words>

As the storm reached its crescendo, Marcus held out his hand to his client, their reflections doing the same across countless realities, each one a step toward transcendence. <words>521</words>

The mirror pulsed one final time, and in that moment, they were infinite. <words>537</words>
