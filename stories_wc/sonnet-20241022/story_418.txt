In the withered orchard where mutant apples glowed an unnatural shade of violet, Marigold traced her fingers through the glitter residue on her old performance costume, remembering the days when she danced amid crowds who still knew how to smile. <words>42</words>

The last notes of "You Are My Sunshine" had crackled into silence on her grandmother's record player three days ago, and with it, the final echo of the Before Times had faded away. <words>71</words>

As a mage whose powers flowed from joy itself, Marigold found her abilities weakening in this new world of radioactive dust storms and endless gray, but she remained tenuously certain that beauty could still exist here. <words>103</words>

She pulled the stained glass box from her satchel, its panels depicting scenes from childhood fairy tales – princesses, dragons, and happy endings that seemed absurd now – yet the way it caught the sickly light gave her hope. <words>143</words>

"Even in this wasteland," she whispered to herself, watching the toxic wind feminize the harsh landscape by draping it in swirling veils of dust, "there's still magic in the small things." <words>173</words>

The orchard, against all odds, continued to bloom, its twisted trees bearing fruit that sustained the few survivors who dared to eat it, and Marigold had chosen this spot for her last desperate spell. <words>210</words>

She'd spent months gathering the components: the glitter from her costume, infused with memories of laughter; the stained glass box, holding the last pure colors; and most importantly, the courage to confess her deepest truth to the gray world itself. <words>251</words>

"I still believe in beauty," she declared with merry bitterness, her voice carrying both lightness and steel as she began her incantation, "and I refuse to let the darkness take it from us." <words>285</words>

The glitter rose from her costume in a spiral, catching the dim light and multiplying it thousandfold, while the stained glass box began to hum with ancient magic. <words>317</words>

As she worked her spell, Marigold thought of all the things that had been lost – the music, the dancing, the simple joy of a blue sky – and channeled her defiant hope into pure magical energy. <words>356</words>

The box shattered, but instead of falling, the glass shards hung suspended in the air, each piece capturing and transforming the sickly light into brilliant rainbow hues that began to spread across the wasteland. <words>397</words>

Color seeped back into the world like paint bleeding into water: first the trees turned a proper green, then the apples blushed red, and finally, gloriously, the sky began to clear to a tender blue. <words>441</words>

Marigold collapsed among the glitter and glass, exhausted but smiling, as survivors emerged from their shelters to witness the transformation, their faces showing the first real joy she'd seen in years. <words>475</words>

In the distance, somewhere beyond the healing orchard, she could have sworn she heard the faint notes of a new song beginning to play. <words>502</words>
