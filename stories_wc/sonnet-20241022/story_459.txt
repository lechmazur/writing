Marcus adjusted his tool belt as he rode the service elevator down to the Sand Castle Preservation Laboratory, where the morning's repair ticket awaited. <words>23</words>

The ghosts were particularly chatty today, their whispers echoing through the shaft as he descended past their favorite haunts in the research facility. <words>45</words>

He'd grown accustomed to their presence over the years, learning to dissect their stories between maintenance calls, though he still struggled to explain why spirits were so drawn to this peculiar place where scientists worked to permanently stabilize beach sculptures. <words>82</words>

A dried flower crown hung askew on his workbench—a gift from Sarah, the Victorian-era ghost who followed him on his rounds, claiming his elegantly clumsy movements reminded her of her long-lost brother. <words>116</words>

During his lunch breaks, Marcus had taken to joining local ghost tours, pretending to be just another curious tourist while actually mapping which spirits lingered where, trying to understand the deeper patterns in their attachments to the physical world. <words>157</words>

The dissonance of silence in the laboratory always struck him most powerfully at midday, when the living researchers departed for their meals, leaving behind only the quiet whispers of the dead and the soft hum of humidity control systems protecting the delicate sand structures. <words>206</words>

Today, as he tightened the elevator's brake assembly, he watched a young ghost in period dress repeatedly attempt to build her own sand castle in the corner, her transparent hands passing helplessly through the grains. <words>245</words>

"Sometimes," Sarah murmured, adjusting her spectral flower crown to match his physical one, "the hardest part of being dead is accepting that we can no longer touch the world we left behind." <words>277</words>

Marcus nodded, understanding that his unique ability to see them came with the responsibility to help them find peace—not by fixing what was broken, as he did with the elevators, but by showing them how to let go. <words>319</words>

He reached into his pocket and pulled out his notebook, where he'd documented hundreds of ghost encounters, each one teaching him that liberation often came not from holding on to what was lost, but from accepting the impossibility of returning to it. <words>365</words>

As he finished the repair and prepared to move on to his next call, he gently removed his dried flower crown and placed it beside the transparent child's failed sand castle, a bridge between their worlds that made her smile for the first time in what might have been centuries. <words>421</words>

"Sometimes," he said to Sarah, who watched the scene with glistening ethereal eyes, "the most complex truths can be found in the simplest gestures," and in that moment, both the living and the dead in that curious laboratory understood exactly what he meant. <words>470</words>
