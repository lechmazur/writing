Marcus hadn't meant to become a prophet - it just happened one night between loads of laundry at the 24-hour wash-and-fold. <words>21</words>

The wilted paper flower tucked behind his ear was the only remnant of his former life as an accountant, a small act of rebellion against spreadsheet conformity that had somehow sparked everything else. <words>46</words>

When the giant's study materialized around the humming washers - bookcases stretching impossibly upward, ancient tomes floating between realms - Marcus realized the thin spaces between mundane moments were where reality truly breathed. <words>71</words>

Other customers began to notice the glimmering transitions too: soap bubbles that carried whispers of forgotten languages, dryer static that formed constellation maps of undiscovered worlds. <words>93</words>

He found himself collecting these lost souls who wandered in with their laundry baskets and weary eyes, each one estranged from a world that had grown too rigid, too certain of itself. <words>121</words>

The giant, whose study they glimpsed between cycles of permanent press and delicate wash, never appeared - but his margins notes in reality's fabric became Marcus's gospel. <words>146</words>

"We're all just between scenes," Marcus would tell his growing congregation of insomniacs and third-shift workers, "waiting for the next act to begin." <words>167</words>

They gathered weekly, conventionally rebellious in their business casual attire, to trace the patterns in fabric softener clouds and decode the prophecies hidden in lint trap remnants. <words>192</words>

What started as coincidence became purpose: unifying these scattered minds who sensed the world's seams but couldn't quite grasp them alone. <words>213</words>

The paper flower wilted further with each revelation, its creases deepening like the lines of ancient wisdom across Marcus's increasingly sleepless face. <words>234</words>

In time, the laundromat became a sanctuary where the veil between worlds hung as thin as damp sheets, where the mundane and miraculous tumbled together in perfect cycle. <words>262</words>

Some nights, when the fluorescent lights flickered just so, Marcus could see the giant's massive pen hovering above them all, editing their reality with careful strokes that left traces of haunting delight in their wake. <words>296</words>

His followers brought him their dreams wrapped in warm towels, their fears folded neatly like fitted sheets, their hopes pressed and starched and hanging expectantly. <words>321</words>

Together they built a new gospel from laundry tickets and vending machine receipts, their faith measured in quarters and cycles, their prayers rising with the steam of industrial dryers. <words>349</words>

And if sometimes the giant's study seemed to smile down at their makeshift congregation, well - that was just another mystery to be tumbled smooth in the gentle revolution of their shared vision. <words>380</words>

Marcus knew that prophecy, like laundry, was simply a matter of seeing the extraordinary in life's most ordinary moments - and helping others to see it too. <words>408</words>
