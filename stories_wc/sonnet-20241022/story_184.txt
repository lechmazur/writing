Mira wiped down the quantum-glass tables in the vacuum chamber garden, her tavern-hand rag leaving streaks in the artificial starlight that powered the exotic plants within. <words>27</words>

She'd inherited this impossible place from her grandmother - a bar that served drinks to interdimensional travelers while maintaining a delicate ecosystem of crystalline flowers that could only survive in absolute void. <words>52</words>

The broken seashells she'd collected throughout her life lay scattered across her workstation, their fragments reorganizing themselves whenever she wasn't looking, as if the backwards flow of time in this pocket universe couldn't quite decide what shape they should take. <words>89</words>

"Another day of predictably unpredictable chaos," she muttered, watching a patron phase through three different species before settling on a form that looked like a sentient aurora borealis. <words>116</words>

Mira had tried escaping this life once - had packed her bags and walked through the fossilized footprints in the dried-up riverbed that served as a map to normal reality - but the calling of the vacuum garden had pulled her back, just as it had her grandmother, and her great-grandmother before that. <words>165</words>

She picked up a shell fragment, its edges sharp against her calloused fingers, and tossed it into the air, letting the temporal winds randomize its descent - a family tradition for making difficult decisions. <words>198</words>

The shell landed in a pattern that looked like a star chart she'd never seen before, and she sighed with that particular blend of flippant solemnity that came naturally to those who served drinks at the edge of reality. <words>235</words>

"You can't fight your destiny," her grandmother used to say, "especially when it's busy fighting itself." <words>253</words>

As Mira mixed impossible cocktails that existed in multiple states simultaneously, she watched the sands of time flow backward through the ancient hourglass above the bar, each grain carrying memories of futures that hadn't happened yet. <words>290</words>

The vacuum garden's plants swayed in an airless breeze, their petals catching light from stars that hadn't been born yet, and Mira finally understood why her grandmother had called this place a catapult for the imagination - it hurled you beyond known realms whether you were ready or not. <words>339</words>

A customer asked her why she stayed, their voice resonating in frequencies that shouldn't exist. <words>356</words>

"Because," Mira answered, rearranging her shells into a new constellation, "someone needs to keep reality's strangest bar running, and chaos runs in my family." <words>384</words>

She smiled as the vacuum garden's crystals chimed in harmony with the temporal winds, and realized that her grandmother's legacy wasn't just this impossible place - it was the understanding that some callings were meant to be inescapable, especially the ones that made absolutely no sense at all. <words>441</words>

The shells scattered once more across her workstation, and Mira laughed, knowing that tomorrow they'd tell an entirely different story, in an entirely different configuration, in an entirely different timeline - and she wouldn't have it any other way. <words>483</words>
