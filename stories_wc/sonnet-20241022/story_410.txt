The hermit Thaddeus sniffed the air of his phosphorescent cavern cathedral, the glowing fungi making his collection of blunt scissors gleam like dull teeth in a monster's maw. <words>27</words>

He'd chosen this place precisely because the underground springs had once fed the city above, though now they lay as dry as his sense of humor. <words>52</words>

The scent of fresh bread wafted down through the ventilation shaft—someone in the building above must be baking—and it amplified his loneliness until it echoed off the limestone walls like a mockery. <words>84</words>

"At least the mushrooms appreciate my jokes," he muttered to the softly pulsing flora, which had proven strangely effective at filtering toxins from the water when he could get the system flowing again. <words>116</words>

The distant ding of the elevator above made him pause in his work; he'd learned to track the building's rhythms during his three years below, and he knew that particular elevator only stopped at the basement level when something was wrong. <words>157</words>

His astute mind, sharpened rather than dulled by isolation, calculated the possibilities as he gathered his tools—the bread smell growing stronger, almost taunting him with memories of humanity. <words>186</words>

The ancient scissors, his only inheritance from a grandmother who'd taught him about water systems and subterranean ecosystems, felt heavy in his pocket as he crept toward the maintenance shaft. <words>216</words>

"Hello?" called a voice from above, followed by the sound of footsteps in the empty elevator bay. <words>233</words>

Thaddeus froze, suddenly aware of how wild he must look, surrounded by the ethereal blue-green glow of his fungal garden, his clothes stained with mineral deposits and time. <words>265</words>

The bread smell was overwhelming now, and as he peered up through the grating, he saw a young woman in a baker's apron, holding a loaf of sourdough and a folder stamped with the city's water department logo. <words>303</words>

"I know you're down there," she called out, her voice carrying a hint of laughter. <words>319</words>

"The mushrooms told you, I suppose?" he replied, surprising himself with his own sardonic tone. <words>335</words>

"No, your water purification system did—it's been sending data to the surface for months." <words>351</words>

She knelt by the grating, and the bread's aroma seemed to wrap around him like a warm embrace. <words>370</words>

"The department's been trying to figure out how the basement level is producing cleaner water than our treatment plant," she explained, "and I thought bread might be a better peace offering than a formal inspection." <words>409</words>

Thaddeus looked at his scissors, then at the glowing fungi that had been his only companions, and finally up at the first human face he'd seen in years. <words>439</words>

"Well," he said, managing a rusty chuckle, "I suppose I could use a fresh perspective on the filtration system—and someone to appreciate my fungal puns, which I must admit are growing on me." <words>476</words>

The baker groaned at his joke, but her smile was genuine as she helped him up through the maintenance hatch, the phosphorescent light below them casting long shadows that danced like celebration streamers across the empty elevator bay. <words>521</words>
