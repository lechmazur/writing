Maria kneaded the dough with practiced hands, her small-town bakery's windows reflecting the three moons that had appeared in the sky six days ago. <words>27</words>

The pressed flowers in her grandmother's journal had warned of this - ancient blooms that mapped celestial patterns and whispered of times when shadows would find their voice. <words>52</words>

She'd discovered that her family's sourdough starter, passed down through generations, contained more than just wild yeast; it carried the seeds of a peculiar contagion that made people remember futures that hadn't happened yet. <words>84</words>

In her cynically gentle way, Maria had been feeding the entire town her memory-laden bread, watching as their shared visions exceeded anything she could have planned alone. <words>116</words>

The emergency time machine garage, disguised as a defunct auto repair shop at the edge of town, had been her grandmother's true legacy - a place where temporal mechanics met the art of baking. <words>150</words>

By tracking moon patterns in both the sky and the reflections in her mixing bowls, Maria could pinpoint exactly when the Shadow Emperor had first torn through the fabric of reality, installing himself as eternal ruler across all timelines. <words>190</words>

The shadows now whispered to her at night, telling tales of their enslavement, how they had been bound to human forms and forced to serve as the Emperor's spies. <words>224</words>

Her plan was elegantly simple: she would distribute her bread throughout the timeline nodes, allowing people in every era to remember the truth of their subjugation. <words>254</words>

The garage's temporal engines hummed as she loaded tray after tray of sourdough, each loaf carefully decorated with the pressed flowers that served as temporal anchors. <words>284</words>

In the flickering light of the diagnostic panels, Maria's shadow separated from her feet and bowed, pledging allegiance to her cause. <words>309</words>

Other shadows peeled themselves from the walls, each carrying memories of alternate timelines where humanity lived free from the Emperor's grip. <words>334</words>

As she calibrated the time machine's coordinates using the positions of the three moons, Maria felt the weight of generations of baker-guardians who had waited for this precise moment. <words>370</words>

The bread would reach every corner of time, she knew, as she watched her shadow helpers load the last batches into the temporal chamber. <words>398</words>

When the final loaf was in place, Maria pressed her grandmother's flower-filled journal to her chest and pulled the activation lever. <words>424</words>

The garage filled with the scent of baking bread from a thousand timelines, and as the shadows danced around her, carrying her consciousness across the temporal plane, Maria smiled at how she would dethrone a tyrant not with weapons, but with the simple truth hidden in her family's recipe. <words>484</words>

As reality shifted and reformed around her, the three moons merged back into one, and the shadows rejoiced in their newfound freedom, singing ancient songs of gratitude to the baker who had remembered how to set them free. <words>532</words>
