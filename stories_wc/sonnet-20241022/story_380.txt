In the creaking treehouse library, where ancient books gathered dust and memories went to fade, Marcus counted his stolen dreams for the thousandth time, though numbers had never been his forte. <words>33</words>

The flimsy photo album in his lap contained fragments of other people's minds – snapshots of desires he'd extracted before they made dreaming illegal, back when humanity still bothered having children. <words>65</words>

Each page held a different piece of himself: the tennis player he'd wanted to become, the mathematician he'd failed to be, the storm chaser who never caught lightning. <words>95</words>

He'd served his time for dream theft, but freedom felt hollow now that he was the only one left who remembered the sound of tennis balls echoing across empty courts, the satisfying pop of a perfect serve. <words>134</words>

The last human had been born three years ago, and with them, humanity's capacity to dream had begun to wither. <words>156</words>

Marcus traced his fingers over the fading photographs, each one a stolen moment of someone else's tennis aspirations – serves, volleys, and match points that had never belonged to him but had somehow become his only authentic memories. <words>195</words>

His own self had fractured long ago, scattered across the dreams he'd taken, until he couldn't distinguish his original memories from the stolen ones. <words>223</words>

The treehouse swayed in the windless air as he stood, clutching the photo album to his chest, his quiet mania driving him to attempt what no one else would dare. <words>254</words>

If he could just combine all these tennis dreams, these fragments of competitive spirit and athletic grace, perhaps he could force the sky to remember what thunder sounded like. <words>285</words>

He climbed higher, past shelves of forgotten stories, until he reached the topmost window where the dead air hung heaviest. <words>308</words>

The photo album's pages fluttered as he held them up, each stolen dream of tennis glory rising like static electricity, charging the atmosphere with borrowed potential. <words>337</words>

Marcus knew the mathematics of probability were against him – they always had been – but he'd stolen enough dreams to know that impossible things happened in the space between reality and imagination. <words>372</words>

With trembling hands, he released the photos into the stagnant air, watching as they began to spiral upward instead of falling, carrying with them every tennis dream he'd ever stolen. <words>406</words>

He didn't hesitate to plunge after them, leaping from the window into the void, his fragmented self finally whole in this moment of desperate belief. <words>435</words>

As he fell, the pages of tennis dreams swirled around him, faster and faster, until the first crack of thunder in three years split the silence, and rain began to fall on a world that had forgotten how to dream. <words>476</words>
