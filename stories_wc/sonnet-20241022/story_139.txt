Brother Chen jolted awake in the swaying aerial gondola, the mountain peaks around him still hazy with dawn mist, as the dream that had haunted him for forty years finally crystallized into perfect clarity. <words>37</words>

His weathered hands clutched the ancient bamboo flute that had belonged to his master, its surface marred by peculiar indentations that he had spent decades studying. <words>65</words>

The creased shipping label that had led him to this remote Himalayan crossing lay forgotten in his lap, its faded characters bearing the address of the monastery where everything had changed. <words>97</words>

In his dream, he had once again witnessed his beloved teacher's murder, but this time, he saw what his younger self had missed – the killer's distinctive way of holding the flute between his teeth before striking the fatal blow. <words>139</words>

Brother Chen's reflection in the gondola's scratched window showed him a face that had grown as creased and visually unappealing as the label itself, marked by years of obsession and the weight of unresolved vengeance. <words>177</words>

Yet it was precisely this dedication to harvesting the past, to analyzing every tooth mark on the flute's ancient surface, that had finally revealed the truth: the killer had been his own twin brother, who had envied their master's choice of successor. <words>229</words>

The gondola creaked as it crested the final ridge, revealing the golden spires of the monastery where his brother now served as head monk, having built his reputation on a foundation of stolen wisdom and hidden crimes. <words>273</words>

Brother Chen touched the flute to his lips, not to play but to feel the grooves that matched his own dental pattern – proof that would have been impossible to fabricate, proof that would finally expose the darkness that wore his face. <words>324</words>

His brother had always been the clever one, the charming one, believing he had orchestrated the perfect crime by using their identical appearance to cast doubt on any accusation. <words>359</words>

But in that heartbeat between sleeping and waking, Brother Chen had realized that his lifelong quest for vengeance had transformed him into something his brother would never expect: a patient, methodical scholar of the past's smallest details. <words>408</words>

As the gondola approached the monastery's landing, Brother Chen allowed himself a moment of cautious enchantment at how perfectly his plan would unfold – not with violence or accusations, but with irrefutable evidence preserved in the very instrument that had witnessed the crime. <words>465</words>

He would outsmart his own dark reflection not by becoming him, but by remaining true to the careful, contemplative path that his master had chosen him for in the first place. <words>502</words>

The morning sun finally broke through the clouds, illuminating the flute's scarred surface like a text written in light and shadow, as Brother Chen prepared to transform forty years of stubborn dedication into justice. <words>547</words>
