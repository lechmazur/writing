The minstrel slouched against the obsidian bar of the Sky Velvet Lounge, his broken watch band catching the starlight that streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows. <words>27</words>

He'd been hired to map the endless night of Neo-Shanghai, a task that seemed perfectly rational to him, even if others called it madness. <words>52</words>

Through the lounge's crystalline walls, the city stretched infinitely in all directions, its neon arteries pulsing with perpetual twilight. <words>71</words>

The old polaroids scattered before him showed the city's forgotten gardens, each one a secret pocket of darkness in the eternal glow, and he methodically arranged them like puzzle pieces of shadow. <words>103</words>

"You can't chart the boundless," the bartender said, polishing a glass that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it. <words>122</words>

The minstrel's fingers, calloused from years of plucking strings, traced lines between the photographs, excavating patterns from the chaos of urban sprawl. <words>145</words>

In each garden snapshot, he'd discovered markers – ancient stone lanterns, twisted topiary, and moss-covered sundials – that defied the city's timeless nature. <words>168</words>

His dismay grew with each connection made; the gardens weren't random at all, but formed a vast geometric sigil across the metropolis, a boundary drawn by hands long forgotten. <words>200</words>

The lounge drifted higher on its anti-gravity tethers, and he pressed his forehead against the cool glass, watching his breath create temporary borders on its surface. <words>229</words>

"Every garden," he whispered, his voice carrying the weight of revelation, "is a punctuation mark in an endless sentence." <words>248</words>

He began to hum, a melody that matched the rhythm of the city's pulse, as his fingers connected more photos with invisible lines. <words>273</words>

The map was emerging: not of physical space, but of the night itself, defined by the absence of light in these secret gardens. <words>299</words>

Other patrons of the Sky Velvet Lounge cast curious glances his way as he worked, his excitement barely contained despite his measured movements. <words>324</words>

When the last photograph found its place, the minstrel stepped back, his eyes reflecting the pattern that only he could see – a constellation of darkness mapped across the infinite city. <words>357</words>

He pulled a string from his instrument, laid it across the photographs, and began to weave it through the images, physically manifesting the boundaries he'd discovered. <words>387</words>

The broken watch band slipped from his wrist, landing among the photos, its fractured face marking the center of his mapped constellation. <words>410</words>

As dawn threatened to break – as it always did but never quite managed in this eternal city – the minstrel finally smiled, for he had done what they said couldn't be done: he had given shape to infinity. <words>452</words>

In the end, his map revealed not just the gardens' locations, but the very rhythm of darkness itself, a song written in shadows and secrets across the endless urban expanse. <words>487</words>
