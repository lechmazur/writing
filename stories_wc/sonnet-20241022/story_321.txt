The guard slouched at his post in Hell's kitchen, watching demons dice souls into ethereal confetti while a partial spool of ribbon dangled forgotten from his belt loop. <words>27</words>

His mind wandered to the argument with his sister, their last words before she passed, and how the weight of his unsaid apology had followed him even into this infernal employment. <words>52</words>

The industrial-sized hourglasses that powered the soul-processing machinery lined the walls, their swirling patterns hypnotizing him as they sorted sins from salvation with mechanical precision. <words>76</words>

He'd taken this job to escape the cosmic silence that had descended after her funeral, but the rhythmic chopping of demon cleavers only amplified the void where his words should have been. <words>107</words>

The almost radical thought struck him as he watched one particular hourglass, its patterns unusually clear today: time wasn't linear in Hell's kitchen – it folded like origami, creating pockets where past and present could touch. <words>143</words>

He approached the hourglass, ignoring the caustic steam rising from the soul-rendering vats, and pressed his palm against its warm glass surface. <words>165</words>

The ribbon at his hip began to unwind of its own accord, dancing upward like a charmed snake, its tip pointing to a specific swirl within the glass where he could see his sister's face. <words>199</words>

The patterns clarified further, displacing the normal flow of time grains, creating a window through which he could finally speak – but the price of forgiveness in Hell's kitchen was never small. <words>234</words>

"I'm sorry," he whispered, and felt the hourglass draw something from him – years of his own existence, perhaps, or a portion of his essence – but the abrasive calm that followed was worth the cost. <words>270</words>

In that moment, the ribbon wrapped around his wrist, pulled tight, and showed him one final vision: his sister in her own afterlife, smiling as his words reached across the divide, her forgiveness displacing the weight he'd carried for so long. <words>314</words>

The demons continued their work, pretending not to notice as the guard returned to his post, the ribbon now nothing but threads, the hourglass showing only ordinary swirls – but his posture was different, lighter, as if he'd finally set down something heavy he'd been carrying since before his infernal employment began. <words>375</words>

Sometimes, in Hell's kitchen, between the chopping of souls and the sizzle of eternal flames, the price of forgiveness is paid in moments of existence – but for those moments when an apology finally finds its way home, no price is too high. <words>424</words></story>
