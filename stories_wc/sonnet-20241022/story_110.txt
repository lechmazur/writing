The water clock repair shop had always been Madame Voss's sanctuary, a place where time literally dripped through her fingers as she fixed the ancient mechanisms. <words>27</words>

Her customers never suspected she was the city's most sought-after assassin, though her quietly flamboyant style of dress – all black Victorian lace with hidden weapon compartments – should have been a dead giveaway. <words>71</words>

She particularly adored the moss-covered lantern hanging outside her shop, a gift from her last victim, who had been a rather poetic serial killer with excellent taste in antiques. <words>116</words>

Between assignments (or chapters, as she liked to call them in her memoir-in-progress), Madame Voss would compose elaborate eulogies for her targets, weaving their darkest secrets into seemingly heartfelt tributes that made mourners shift uncomfortably in their seats. <words>177</words>

"Herbert was a man of precision," she had intoned at her most recent funeral performance, "who kept his basement exceptionally clean, especially after his weekly poker games, from which, curiously, none of his opponents ever returned." <words>234</words>

The eulogies were her way of transforming each kill into art, transmuting the raw pain of her own tragic past into something darkly beautiful, like pressing flowers between pages of a murder notebook. <words>285</words>

The domestic mysteries that lurked behind her clients' requests always fascinated her; how many perfect homes concealed perfect crimes, how many garden parties masked garden graves. <words>377</words>

A bell tinkled as someone entered her shop, and Madame Voss quickly adjusted her elaborate mourning veil, the one she'd worn to six different funerals (five of which she'd personally necessitated). <words>424</words>

"I need my grandfather's water clock repaired," said the elegant woman in the doorway, fidgeting with a handkerchief that Madame Voss immediately recognized as being monogrammed with the initials of a recently disappeared judge. <words>474</words>

Madame Voss smiled beneath her veil, already composing the opening lines of what would surely be her finest eulogy yet: "Time, like water, flows ever forward, carrying secrets in its current – and none knew this better than our dear departed friend..." <words>532</words>
