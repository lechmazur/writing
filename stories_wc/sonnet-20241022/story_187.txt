The stoic wanderer traced his fingers along the weathered floorboard, feeling the grooves where countless witch's familiars had practiced their first transformations. <words>23</words>

He'd stolen it from the abandoned cabin where he once trained, before the Purge forced their kind into hiding. <words>42</words>

The lies he'd told to obtain it were necessary – claiming to be a historical preservationist, flashing forged credentials at the property's new owners, all while maintaining a mesmerizingly bland demeanor that made him instantly forgettable. <words>71</words>

Now, watching through the academy's warped windows as the last teacher wiped clean the final transformation formula from the enchanted blackboard, he knew his timing was perfect. <words>97</words>

The familiar training ground had always been his sanctuary, even as others found it unsettling – the way the practice dummies shifted forms in the corner of your eye, how the mirror pools rippled with remembered shapes. <words>134</words>

He'd followed a trail of nightmares to find this place again, each dark dream leading him closer like breadcrumbs of shadow, until he could impose himself back into the world he'd left behind. <words>168</words>

With gentle reverence that belied his rough exterior, he placed the floorboard in the center of the training circle, watching as the old wood recognized its purpose and began to glow with archived memories. <words>204</words>

"I knew you'd come back, Marcus," came a familiar voice, and he turned to find his old mentor – now more cat than human – regarding him with gleaming eyes. <words>234</words>

"Someone has to preserve the old ways," he replied, his calloused hand resting on the floorboard as it projected spectral images of long-ago training sessions into the dusty air. <words>265</words>

His mentor padded closer, tail swishing thoughtfully. <words>272</words>

"The modern methods are safer, you know – no risk of getting stuck between forms like in the old days," she said, but her claws were already reaching toward the glowing wood with unmistakable longing. <words>309</words>

Together they watched as the floorboard revealed ritual after ritual, each one more complex than the last, their movements preserved in ghostly light. <words>335</words>

"They were beautiful, weren't they?" he asked, his voice rough with emotion as he watched young familiars of the past learning to shift their shapes for the first time. <words>367</words>

His mentor's purr was both acknowledgment and warning. <words>375</words>

"Beauty can be dangerous," she said, but her paw was already tracing the patterns in the air, muscle memory taking over as she demonstrated the ancient forms with fluid grace. <words>408</words>

The wanderer smiled, knowing he'd achieved what he came for – not just to archive the old practices, but to reignite the spark of their heritage in those who remained. <words>443</words>

As the sun set outside the academy windows, teacher and student sat together, sharing stories of transformations past while the floorboard continued its ethereal display, preserving their legacy one shimmering memory at a time. <words>478</words>
