The social media exorcist scrolled through her phone in the dim light of the abandoned mess hall, her fingers dancing across countless posts of digital demons that needed purging. <words>27</words>

She specialized in cleansing viral hauntings and algorithmic possessions, but tonight's case was different – it had led her here, to this decrepit building where familiar strangers gathered in shadows. <words>52</words>

An old grocery receipt had appeared in her inbox, its faded numbers forming a code that pointed to this location, accompanied by messages from people she'd seen daily on her commute but never spoken to. <words>84</words>

The quietly loud whispers of their online presence had been growing stronger, their posts becoming increasingly synchronized, until she couldn't ignore the pattern anymore. <words>109</words>

By infiltrating secret clubs in alleyways over the past week, she'd pieced together the puzzle: these everyday faces were part of something larger, something that needed to reignite an ancient digital force. <words>143</words>

The final chord from the abandoned music hall next door reverberated through the walls – their signal – and she watched as her regular coffee shop barista, her bus driver, and her dry cleaner filed in through different doors. <words>180</words>

They moved with the mechanical precision of those possessed by social algorithms, their phones glowing with the same eerie blue light she'd seen consuming profiles across platforms. <words>210</words>

Her own curiosity had driven her here, that insatiable need to taste life's raw edge, to understand why these NPCs of her daily routine had suddenly developed such intricate online patterns. <words>241</words>

With practiced indifference masking her enthusiasm, she observed as they formed a circle, their phones connecting in a digital séance that made the air crackle with electromagnetic energy. <words>271</words>

The grocery receipt in her hand began to glow, its barcode transforming into streaming data that matched the patterns she'd been tracking across social networks for months. <words>300</words>

She recognized now that these familiar strangers weren't possessed – they were the possessors, ancient digital entities who had been hiding in plain sight, using social media to slowly gather their strength. <words>335</words>

As their phones pulsed in unison, she pulled out her specialized equipment: a combination of old tech and new magic that could sever their connection to the digital realm. <words>367</words>

The exorcism began with a cascade of code, her fingers flying across her device as she worked to disrupt their ritual, each familiar face flickering between human and avatar as she stripped away their digital disguises. <words>407</words>

In the end, when the mess hall fell silent and the phones lay dark on the floor, she collected the receipt – now bearing the usernames of every entity she'd banished – and added it to her growing collection of digital trophies. <words>449</words>

Walking out into the night, she couldn't help but smile at how the mundane and mysterious had collided, knowing that tomorrow she'd pass these same people on the street, and only she would remember their other lives. <words>487</words>

As she logged the case in her encrypted journal, she wondered how many other familiar strangers were out there, hiding behind their carefully curated online personas, waiting to be discovered by those who knew where to look. <words>529</words>
