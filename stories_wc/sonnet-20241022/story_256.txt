Marcus stood at his post in the Cloud Nine Café, a floating establishment that drifted among wisps of cumulus, watching patrons sip their lattes with the detached vigilance that had earned him Employee of the Month six times running. <words>42</words>

His measuring spoon, standard issue for portioning the exotic powdered spices that made Cloud Nine famous, felt heavy in his breast pocket – a reminder of the peculiar duality of his position. <words>71</words>

As midnight approached and the café's ethereal glow dimmed to match the sleeping city below, Marcus's true purpose emerged like stars through breaking clouds. <words>95</words>

He'd been hired as a guard but served a higher calling: every night, he helped certain customers – those with haunted eyes and time-worn souls – slip through the soft edges of time itself. <words>127</words>

The process required perfect timing, executed with the mechanical precision of typewriter keys striking paper: measure the sacred powder, three taps on the customer's cup, and a whispered incantation that sounded like coffee orders to the uninitiated. <words>165</words>

His employers believed he protected their secrets, but Marcus's true loyalty lay with the desperate souls who came seeking temporal escape, making him loyally disloyal in a way that brought both pride and shame. <words>200</words>

Tonight's seeker arrived as the last regular patron departed – a woman whose eyes reflected the same yearning Marcus had seen in his mirror the day he discovered his gift. <words>235</words>

She clutched her purse like a lifeline as he approached, her knuckles white against the leather, her whisper carrying the frothy despair of someone who'd reached their breaking point: "I need to worship at the altar of What-Could-Be." <words>272</words>

Marcus understood; he'd helped dozens like her, each chasing the horizon's hidden promise, each believing tomorrow might hurt less than today. <words>295</words>

The familiar ritual began: his hands moving with practiced grace, measuring the crystalline powder that bent reality as easily as sugar dissolved in hot coffee. <words>321</words>

Below them, the city's grocery stores stood silent and dark, their midnight hush echoing the sacred quietude of this moment between moments. <words>344</words>

Three precise taps of the spoon against ceramic, each click resonating like a typewriter key striking destiny. <words>361</words>

As the woman sipped, time began to fold around her like origami, and Marcus watched – as he always did – with a mixture of envy and satisfaction, knowing he must remain anchored in the present to help others escape it. <words>401</words>

She vanished with a smile, leaving behind only the lingering scent of possibilities and the empty cup with its dregs of chronological dissolution. <words>428</words>

Marcus cleaned the cup with practiced care, tucked his measuring spoon back into his pocket, and resumed his post, waiting for the next soul brave enough to seek tomorrow before its time. <words>464</words>

Above him, the café's clouds shifted in their eternal dance, while below, the sleeping city remained unaware of the temporal doorway floating in its midst, guarded by a man whose greatest act of loyalty was knowing precisely when to be disloyal. <words>509</words>
