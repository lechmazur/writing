Miranda Blackwood scrolled through her great-grandmother's archived MySpace page, her perfectly manicured fingers trembling as she studied the photographs of four generations of glamorous undertakers. <words>27</words>

The brass measuring tape, worn smooth from decades of sizing the departed, lay coiled like a sleeping serpent next to her laptop while the paint mixer droned in the background, preparing the precise shade of rouge her family had used to bring life to dead faces since 1897. <words>71</words>

She'd been waiting for three hours now, watching the ancient pigments swirl together, knowing that her great-grandmother Cordelia's secret formula required exactly this much patience – no matter how fruitlessly she wished it would hurry along. <words>108</words>

The myth of ordinariness had never touched the Blackwood women; they transformed death into an art form, elongating necks with clever makeup tricks and positioning bodies with a grace that made mourners gasp at how peaceful – how alive – their loved ones appeared. <words>149</words>

Miranda smiled at a particular photo of Cordelia, posed dramatically beside a casket in her signature crimson lipstick and black lace veil, the same brass measuring tape dangling from her fingers like a golden serpent. <words>182</words>

"We are the architects of memory," Cordelia had written in her final blog post, "and every corpse is a canvas that deserves to be painted with dignity." <words>209</words>

The paint mixer chimed, and Miranda felt that familiar bittersweet thrill – the jubilant satisfaction of carrying on her family's legacy mixed with remorse for the circumstances that made her art necessary. <words>241</words>

She carefully decanted the liquid into crystal bottles, each movement a ritual passed down through social media archives that documented every detail of their craft: the exact angle to hold the bottle, the precise temperature of the room, the specific prayers to whisper over each batch. <words>290</words>

Her phone pinged with a new comment on her great-grandmother's preserved Facebook timeline: "Your family made my mother beautiful for her final goodbye forty years ago, and now I need you for my husband." <words>324</words>

Miranda lifted the brass measuring tape, letting it catch the light just as her ancestors had done, and thought about how this simple tool had measured thousands of bodies, each one treated not as a mere vessel to be disposed of, but as a final masterpiece to be reverently created. <words>375</words>

The rouge was ready now, and as she prepared her kit for her next client, Miranda felt the weight of her family's legacy in every crystal bottle and vintage tool, each one documented in countless posts and photos across decades of social media, preserving their ancient practices in the modern digital age. <words>434</words>

She would honor them all – Cordelia, her grandmother Vivian, her mother Elena – by continuing to transform the mundane business of death into something extraordinary, measuring and painting and arranging until each client's final portrait was nothing short of magnificent. <words>478</words>

The paint mixer hummed to life again as she prepared the next batch, and Miranda smiled, knowing that somewhere in the digital ether, her great-grandmother was smiling too, proud that their family's artistry continued to defy the ordinary, one beautiful goodbye at a time. <words>525</words>
