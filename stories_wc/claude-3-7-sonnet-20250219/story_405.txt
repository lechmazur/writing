Marcus folded his cards, eyeing the collection of dried petals arranged beside his dwindling chips with growing suspicion. <words>17</words>

"They bring luck," whispered the old woman across the table, her smile revealing more than her words ever could. <words>34</words>

He didn't believe in luck—never had—but the uncharted grief that had led him to this underground mushroom farm's weekly poker game made him desperate enough to consider any possibility. <words>61</words>

The farm's dim lighting cast long shadows across the makeshift gambling table, the air thick with spores and secrets as workers moved between rows of cultivated fungi. <words>86</words>

"I'm truthfully lying when I say these petals have no power," the woman added, pushing a small bundle toward him while the other players continued their recipe testing for the farm's famous mushroom stew in the adjacent kitchen. <words>121</words>

Marcus pocketed the petals with a dismissive grunt, yet couldn't ignore how they seemed to pulse with warmth against his thigh. <words>140</words>

Later that night, as he rode the last subway home, the petals began to burn through his pocket, compelling him to notice the cryptic scrawls etched into the seat beside him. <words>170</words>

What others saw as vandalism, Marcus suddenly recognized as coordinates—directions—the same kind he'd been searching for since his daughter had vanished three months ago. <words>195</words>

His hands trembled as he traced the markings, memories flooding back of how authorities had been forced to impound his car after he'd driven it into a ditch during his frantic search for her. <words>227</words>

The subway screeched to a halt at an unfamiliar station, and Marcus felt an inexplicable urge to exit, the petals now cool against his skin. <words>251</words>

Following the interpreted directions, he descended into a maintenance tunnel where the walls glistened with the same phosphorescent fungi he'd seen at the farm. <words>274</words>

There, huddled in a small alcove, were three teenagers—lost, hungry, and among them, his daughter. <words>290</words>

"Dad?" she whispered, her voice cracking with disbelief. <words>298</words>

Later, as authorities arrived to help the runaways, the old woman from the poker game materialized beside Marcus, her eyes reflecting the emergency lights. <words>322</words>

"You found them," she said, not a question but a statement of fact. <words>335</words>

"You knew," Marcus replied, understanding dawning that his grief had been manipulated, channeled toward a greater purpose. <words>352</words>

She nodded, explaining how she used the petals and subway scrawls to guide those with the right desperation to find lost travelers who needed help returning home. <words>378</words>

"Some people call it coincidence," she said, collecting the dried petals from his pocket, "others call it fate—I call it paying attention to the signs most people ignore." <words>406</words>

As Marcus embraced his daughter, he felt a strange frantic peace wash over him—the chaos of his recent existence settling into something profound and unexplainable. <words>431</words>

He would return to the underground farm next week, not to gamble with cards, but to learn how to interpret the signs himself, to join the network of unlikely guides who used their own grief to light the way for others. <words>472</words>
