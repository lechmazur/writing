The scarecrow stood sentinel at the edge of the field, his burlap face weathered by countless seasons, his consciousness a peculiar accident of magic and loneliness. <words>23</words>

He clutched a forgotten lace fan in his straw-stuffed fingers, the delicate object incongruous against his rough-hewn form. <words>41</words>

The fan had belonged to Lady Elspeth, who had sworn him to an oath before disappearing between the parallel worlds that intersected at this very spot once every century. <words>67</words>

"Guard the lines," she had whispered, pointing to the strange geometric patterns etched into the earth, "until I return." <words>85</words>

Crow watched with fervent apathy as humans came and went, caring deeply about his duty while pretending indifference to the loneliness that gnawed at his stuffing. <words>110</words>

The lines in the earth were not mere drawings but ancient wards, protecting this world from the one that existed alongside it, separated by the thinnest of veils. <words>137</words>

He stood upon what locals believed was merely an unusually shaped hill, but Crow knew better—he guarded the fossilized remains of a giant who had fallen during the last convergence of worlds. <words>168</words>

Tonight marked the centennial alignment, and already the air shimmered with potential as the boundaries between realities thinned. <words>185</words>

Crow felt a familiar pull—the virtual reality interface Lady Elspeth had installed within his consciousness activating, drawing his mind into the space between worlds. <words>208</words>

In this digital limbo, he could move freely, his scarecrow form replaced by a more human avatar, though still bearing stitch-marks across his face. <words>230</words>

Here, others like him patrolled—guardians of other thin places, all sworn to the same oath, all bearing tokens of their absent mistress. <words>253</words>

"They're coming through," warned a guardian shaped like a brass automaton, pointing to where the virtual landscape fractured, revealing shadowy figures attempting to skewer the barrier with crystalline spears. <words>279</words>

Crow raised the lace fan, which transformed in this realm into an elegant rapier, its guard still bearing the intricate patterns of the original lace. <words>303</words>

The battle was swift and strange, a dance of impossible geometries as guardians defended reality itself from entities that existed in dimensions humans could never comprehend. <words>327</words>

When it ended, Crow found himself back in the field, the fan still clutched in his straw hand, the lines in the earth glowing faintly before fading back to ordinary dirt. <words>357</words>

A woman approached from the direction of the village, her face both familiar and strange—Lady Elspeth, yet not quite the same, perhaps a descendant or parallel version of herself. <words>384</words>

"You've kept your oath," she said, touching the fan with reverent fingers. <words>396</words>

"Always," Crow replied, his voice rusty from disuse, "though sometimes I wonder if this existence—neither fully magical nor entirely mundane—is worth the price of loyalty." <words>423</words>

She smiled sadly, "The realistically fantastical is always the hardest to bear—too magical to be dismissed, too grounded to provide escape." <words>445</words>

As the sun set behind them, casting long shadows across the lines in the earth, Crow resumed his post, knowing that between worlds was exactly where he belonged. <words>473</words>
