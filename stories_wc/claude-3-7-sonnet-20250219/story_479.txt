Morgana Blackwood measured the digital screen with her brass measuring tape, a relic passed down from her great-grandmother Eliza, the first female undertaker in their family. <words>23</words>

"Perfect dimensions," she whispered to herself, adjusting her crimson lipstick in the reflection of her tablet screen. <words>38</words>

The Social Network Archive glowed before her, illuminating her meticulously applied makeup and the vintage black dress that hugged her slender frame. <words>57</words>

She had been scrolling through the forgotten profiles of the deceased for hours, fruitlessly patient in her search for the right candidate. <words>76</words>

Behind her, the special embalming paint mixed slowly in its mechanical stirrer, the soft whirring providing a rhythmic backdrop to her digital excavation. <words>95</words>

Morgana's family had preserved the ancient practice of "Digital Afterlife Preparation" for three generations, a unique tradition that began when Eliza discovered that properly prepared bodies could retain a connection to their digital footprints. <words>124</words>

The brass measuring tape wasn't just for physical bodies; it somehow helped elongate the spiritual tether between the corpse and their online presence when used in the ritual. <words>148</words>

"People believe in the myth of ordinariness," Morgana often told her apprentices, "that death is simply an end, that our digital selves are separate from our physical forms." <words>173</words>

She felt a jubilant surge as she finally found what she was looking for—a forgotten profile with the specific constellation of life events that matched her current client. <words>197</words>

Yet remorse tinged her excitement; these digital ghosts were once living, breathing humans with hopes and dreams, now reduced to data points in her ancestral craft. <words>221</words>

The paint mixer beeped, signaling completion of the special pigment that would be applied to the eyelids of today's subject—the final component needed to complete the connection. <words>246</words>

Morgana stood, her heels clicking against the polished floor of her upscale funeral parlor as she moved to retrieve the paint, the measuring tape coiled in her manicured hand like a brass serpent. <words>274</words>

She was the most glamorous undertaker in the city, her waiting list months long, her methods mysterious to outsiders who saw only the perfect makeup and designer mourning clothes. <words>299</words>

What they didn't see was the brass measuring tape extending across digital spaces, the careful paint application during the exact moment of cosmic alignment, the whispered incantations passed down from Eliza. <words>326</words>

"Your digital footprint will remain connected to your essence," she promised the silent body on her preparation table, a wealthy tech mogul who had paid handsomely to ensure his online legacy would somehow remain... alive. <words>356</words>

As the specially mixed paint dried on his eyelids, Morgana wrapped the measuring tape around his wrist, then extended it to the tablet displaying his social media timeline. <words>382</words>

The tape seemed to shimmer and elongate beyond its physical length, stretching impossibly between worlds as Morgana completed the ritual her family had guarded for generations. <words>405</words>

"The connection is established," she announced to the empty room, feeling that familiar contradiction of professional triumph and existential sadness. <words>422</words>

She carefully returned the brass measuring tape to its velvet case, another successful preservation complete, another ancient practice maintained in a world that believed death was ordinary. <words>445</words>

Morgana Blackwood, glamorous undertaker and digital medium, closed the Social Network Archive and prepared for her next appointment, carrying the weight of her family's legacy with perfectly postured shoulders and immaculately lined eyes. <words>474</words>
