The stoic wanderer arrived at the witch's familiar training ground as shadows lengthened across the clearing. <words>14</words>

He carried a single floorboard from an abandoned cabin, its surface worn smooth by decades of footsteps and secrets. <words>31</words>

The wood had spoken to him in dreams, pulling him through a trail of nightmares that led inexorably to this place of power. <words>51</words>

Familiars in various stages of training—cats with too-knowing eyes, ravens with metallic feathers, and creatures less easily categorized—observed him with wary curiosity as he approached the central teaching area. <words>79</words>

At the massive slate board stood the instructor, a woman whose appearance was so mesmerizingly bland that his eyes kept sliding away from her features, unable to fix her in memory. <words>107</words>

"You're just in time," she said, her voice somehow both harsh and gentle, a brash tenderness that reminded him of his mother's calloused hands. <words>129</words>

The chalk in her hand made one final, decisive stroke across the board, completing a formula of breathtaking complexity before she promptly wiped it away with a cloth that seemed to absorb more than just chalk dust. <words>162</words>

"The necessary lies we tell ourselves about magic," she explained to her familiar students, not acknowledging the wanderer, "are sometimes more powerful than the truths." <words>185</words>

The wanderer stepped forward, revealing the floorboard with its underside covered in symbols matching those just erased. <words>201</words>

"You cannot impose your will upon knowledge that isn't yours to preserve," the instructor said without turning, though her shoulders tensed. <words>220</words>

"I don't seek to impose," he replied, his voice steady despite the trembling in his hands. <words>235</words>

"I seek to archive what others would erase—the ritual practices that saved my village when nothing else would." <words>254</words>

The familiars stirred, their training momentarily forgotten as power crackled between teacher and intruder. <words>268</words>

"Three generations ago, you taught my grandmother," he continued, "and she carved your lessons into this board before your acolytes burned our homes for practicing unsanctioned magic." <words>296</words>

The instructor turned finally, her face shifting subtly, becoming momentarily distinct before settling back into its unrememberable state. <words>314</words>

"The archives exist to protect, not to hoard," she said, extending her hand toward the floorboard. <words>330</words>

"Some knowledge must be earned through suffering, not stolen through cleverness." <words>341</words>

The wanderer nodded once, acknowledging her point while standing his ground. <words>352</words>

"I followed a trail of nightmares for seven years to find this place," he said. <words>367</words>

"My village suffers still from half-remembered protections. I've earned this knowledge through their pain." <words>383</words>

Something in his stoic demeanor must have reached her, for she nodded slowly and gestured to an empty seat among her students. <words>404</words>

"Then learn properly what your grandmother could not finish," she said, her brash tenderness returning as she took the floorboard and placed it carefully beside her teaching materials. <words>431</words>

"And when you've mastered it all, you may archive what you've earned—not what you've stolen." <words>448</words>

As he took his place among the familiars, the wanderer felt the weight of seven years of searching lift from his shoulders, replaced by the heavier but more hopeful burden of true learning. <words>483</words>
