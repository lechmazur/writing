Jax traced constellations on the rusty floor of the cargo hold, his piece of chalk leaving ghostly trails in the dim light. <words>19</words>

"Time isn't what you think it is," he muttered to the contraband crates stacked around him like silent companions. <words>36</words>

The space pirate ship Chronos drifted through the nebula, its engines humming a lullaby that only Jax seemed to hear. <words>54</words>

As the ship's caretaker, he maintained this peculiar relationship with the vessel—warmly aloof, like a parent who loves deeply but refuses to hover. <words>75</words>

The captain and crew respected his boundaries, understanding that his methods were unconventional but effective. <words>89</words>

Jax had been tracking cloud paths through the cosmos for decades, mapping the subtle shifts in cosmic dust that others dismissed as random. <words>110</words>

He knew better—these patterns revealed time's true nature, flowing not like a river but folding like origami. <words>127</words>

In his pocket, an outdated phone from Earth vibrated, its screen illuminating the shadows with a pale blue glow. <words>145</words>

He flipped it open, listening to the familiar dial tone that connected him to memories he'd tried to leave behind. <words>164</words>

The tone wavered, stretched, and finally cut out—the moment he'd been waiting for. <words>177</words>

"It's time," he whispered, completing the chalk diagram with a flourish that connected past to future. <words>192</words>

The "what if" siren song had haunted him since that day on Proxima Centauri when he'd chosen the stars over her. <words>212</words>

Every night since, the questions echoed: What if he'd stayed? What if he'd asked her to come? What if time could bend to his will? <words>235</words>

The captain's voice crackled over the intercom: "Jax, we've got company. Galactic Patrol, three clicks and closing." <words>251</words>

But Jax barely heard, focused instead on the chalk lines beginning to shimmer with an inner light of their own. <words>270</words>

"To hush the endless questions," he murmured, stepping into the center of his creation. <words>283</words>

The cargo hold filled with a gentle harshness—a light that caressed even as it burned, illuminating every corner of the vast space. <words>304</words>

Outside, stars wheeled in impossible patterns as the ship lurched into evasive maneuvers. <words>317</words>

Inside, Jax closed his eyes and felt the boundaries of his existence begin to blur. <words>332</words>

He'd discovered that time wasn't linear but layered, and with the right calculations, one could slip between those layers. <words>350</words>

The chalk diagram pulsed once, twice, and then Jax began to vanish—not all at once, but gradually, like fog burning away under morning sun. <words>373</words>

His last thought was of her face, and how time, that most stubborn of dimensions, might finally allow him to unhear the questions that had driven him across galaxies. <words>400</words>

The captain found only the chalk and the phone when she finally broke down the cargo hold door, both items arranged in perfect stillness as if waiting for a return that might never come. <words>432</words>

But sometimes, when the Chronos passes through certain nebulae, the crew swears they can see a figure tracking cloud paths among the stars, warmly aloof, forever charting the true nature of time. <words>464</words>
