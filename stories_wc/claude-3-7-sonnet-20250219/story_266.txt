Milo painted his face white every morning, not for an audience, but for himself. <words>12</words>

The clock hand on his wrist spun wildly, never settling on any particular hour, a constant reminder that time was both infinite and meaningless in his world. <words>33</words>

He had promised his daughter he would return when he "found himself," a drifting promise that had floated between them for seven years now. <words>53</words>

It was technically absurd, Milo thought, to seek enlightenment while dressed as a clown, but the universe operated on its own peculiar logic. <words>73</words>

He had mastered the art of balancing sorrow and joy, wearing one on his face while harboring the other in his heart. <words>93</words>

His method was unconventional—dismantling illusions in private poetry he scribbled in a worn notebook, verses that peeled away the layers of his painted persona. <words>115</words>

The floating rock yoga studio where he now spent his mornings was tethered to nothing but air, hovering thirty feet above an abandoned quarry, accessible only by a rope ladder that swayed in the breeze. <words>146</words>

Milo always arrived when the day's earliest train departed at dawn, its whistle cutting through the morning fog like a memory trying to surface. <words>168</words>

His motivation seemed simple to outsiders—a bleak clown seeking peace—but Milo's true desire was grander: to outshine the northern lights with a grin so authentic it would heal the fractures in his soul. <words>201</words>

"Breathe into your center," instructed Yara, the studio's owner, her voice carrying a jagged generosity that reminded Milo of broken glass wrapped in silk. <words>224</words>

The other practitioners—a retired astronaut, a mushroom forager, and a quantum physicist—never questioned why a clown joined their dawn sessions, accepting his painted tears as just another form of human expression. <words>253</words>

As Milo contorted his body into impossible shapes, the clock hand on his wrist spun faster, its metallic gleam catching the rising sun. <words>275</words>

"Your body remembers what your mind forgets," Yara said, adjusting Milo's posture as the studio gently rocked in the morning air. <words>294</words>

In downward dog, Milo watched his tears fall upward, defying gravity, collecting on the studio's crystal ceiling like inverted rain. <words>313</words>

His daughter had once asked why clowns were sad, and he had no answer then, but now, as his poetry filled notebooks and his body learned to bend without breaking, he was composing his response. <words>345</words>

The clock hand spun through another dawn as Milo balanced on one foot, his other leg extended behind him, arms spread wide—a flying clown on a floating rock. <words>372</words>

He had dismantled enough illusions to know that returning home wouldn't be as simple as boarding that dawn train, but each morning brought him closer to the grin he sought. <words>400</words>

When the northern lights appeared unexpectedly one morning, dancing across the sky above the studio, Milo's face cracked into a smile so genuine that his makeup split along the fault lines of joy. <words>431</words>

The clock hand stuttered for the first time in years, catching briefly on the hour his daughter was born. <words>449</words>

Tomorrow, Milo decided, watching the train depart without him one last time, he would board with his face clean, his poetry bound, and his promise no longer drifting but anchored in the certainty that he had, at last, found himself. <words>487</words>
