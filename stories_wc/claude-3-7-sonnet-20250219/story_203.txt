Father Elias clutched the pressed wildflowers in his trembling hands as he drifted through the abandoned space station, surrounded by orbital debris that tapped against the hull like impatient fingers. <words>27</words>

The inheritance of lies had brought him here, to this graveyard of human ambition floating above Earth. <words>43</words>

His grandfather's journal, filled with pressed wildflowers from a planet the old man had never actually visited, contained coordinates that were never usual, never what they seemed on first reading. <words>69</words>

"You'll find what was taken from our family," the final entry had promised, though Elias now suspected this too was another fabrication in a long lineage of deceptions. <words>93</words>

The space station's manufacturing level was still operational, and Elias found himself amid toy assembly machines that continued their mindless production despite being abandoned for decades. <words>116</words>

Tiny mechanical arms pieced together dolls with hollow eyes that seemed to follow him as he moved through the factory floor in a defiant hush, unwilling to alert whatever might still inhabit this place. <words>146</words>

As an exorcist, Elias had banished demons from possessed souls across three solar systems, yet the thought of confronting whatever waited for him here made his voice catch in his throat—his notorious stage fright emerging at the worst possible moment. <words>180</words>

He needed to submerge himself in the ritual, to forget the audience of stars witnessing his performance through the station's vast observation windows. <words>202</words>

The toy assembly line suddenly halted by the sound of a key turning in a lock somewhere deep within the station—impossible, he thought, since he was supposed to be alone. <words>229</words>

Elias pressed the dried wildflowers between his palms, reciting the incantation his grandfather had taught him, the one thing among his teachings that might actually be true. <words>253</words>

The flowers began to glow, illuminating the manufacturing floor with an ethereal light that revealed symbols etched into the walls, hidden beneath years of dust and neglect. <words>280</words>

"To sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'" was written in an ancient script above a sealed door—his family's motto, though he'd always dismissed it as meaningless poetry. <words>307</words>

Now he understood: his ancestors hadn't been exorcists but creators, using the energy of banished entities to forge new realities. <words>326</words>

The key turned again, and the sealed door slid open to reveal not a monster but a garden—impossible flowers blooming in the vacuum of space, sustained by something beyond conventional science. <words>355</words>

His grandfather's final lie was his greatest truth: there was no demon to exorcise, only a legacy to reclaim. <words>374</words>

Elias stepped through the threshold, his stage fright dissolving as he realized he wasn't performing for anyone but himself. <words>392</words>

The pressed wildflowers in his hand burst into life, their petals unfurling as if time had reversed, and he knew that here, amid the stars and forgotten dreams, he would finally transform the inheritance of lies into something honest and new. <words>432</words>

As orbital debris continued its eternal dance around the station, Elias began to understand that his true purpose wasn't to banish the unwanted but to preserve what others had deemed impossible. <words>462</words>

The toy assembly machines whirred back to life behind him, but now they created something different—small, perfect worlds waiting to be born. <words>485</words>
