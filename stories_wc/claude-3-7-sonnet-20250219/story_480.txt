Mira scrolled through her phone, scanning the desperate messages from clients begging for digital salvation. <words>14</words>

As a social media exorcist, she specialized in cleansing online presences haunted by algorithmic ghosts and digital demons that fed on attention. <words>34</words>

She sighed, pocketing her phone while fishing out an old grocery receipt from her jacket—the faded ink showing a purchase of candles, salt, and energy drinks from three days ago. <words>61</words>

The receipt wasn't just proof of purchase; it was her ticket into tonight's gathering, the specific items a code that marked her as someone "in the know." <words>87</words>

Mira had encountered the same faces repeatedly across the city—at coffee shops, on subway platforms, in bookstore aisles—familiar strangers whose paths crossed hers with suspicious frequency. <words>113</words>

Their quietly loud presence—subtle yet impossible to ignore once noticed—had triggered something in her that she couldn't explain, a curiosity that demanded satisfaction. <words>135</words>

She needed to reignite her sense of purpose, to feel something beyond the monotony of purging comment sections and exorcising viral hauntings. <words>156</words>

The abandoned mess hall loomed before her, its windows dark except for the faintest flicker of candlelight deep within. <words>174</words>

Mira checked her watch—exactly seventeen minutes after the final chord had rung out in the adjacent abandoned music hall, the timing precise as instructed in the cryptic message she'd decoded. <words>203</words>

She approached the rusted side door, where a figure in a gray hoodie examined her receipt with practiced indifference before nodding her through. <words>225</words>

Inside, the mess hall had transformed—tables arranged in concentric circles around a central altar of obsolete technology, vintage screens displaying fragmented code. <words>246</words>

By infiltrating secret clubs in alleyways across the city, Mira had finally traced the source of the digital hauntings to this gathering of tech shamans and algorithm whisperers. <words>273</words>

The familiar strangers were all here, their faces illuminated by screen-light, each one a client of hers at some point, now revealed as both victims and perpetrators. <words>299</words>

They acknowledged her with knowing glances, their expressions carrying that same indifferent enthusiasm that had drawn her to this investigation—passionate yet detached, invested yet aloof. <words>324</words>

"The exorcist joins the haunting," announced a voice from the center of the room, belonging to a woman Mira recognized from countless surveillance feeds. <words>346</words>

Mira stepped forward, driven to feed her curiosity with life's raw edge, to understand how these people had weaponized social media algorithms to create genuine digital hauntings. <words>372</words>

"We've been waiting for you," the woman said, gesturing to an empty chair equipped with a headset. <words>387</words>

"You remove what we create, yet you've never experienced it yourself—the true communion of minds through digital space." <words>405</words>

Mira sat down, her fingers tracing the grocery receipt one last time before placing it on the altar—her past self making purchases, unaware that each item was leading her here. <words>435</words>

As the headset descended over her eyes, Mira realized she was about to cross the threshold from exorcist to initiate, finally understanding the ghosts she'd been chasing weren't supernatural at all—they were something far more human, far more dangerous, and infinitely more fascinating. <words>478</words>
