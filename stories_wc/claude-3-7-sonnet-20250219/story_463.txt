Elias stood at the window of the lighthouse keeper's bedroom, watching the storm rage against the glass as if it sought entry. <words>19</words>

The piece of rope in his hand, frayed from years of use, was the last connection to a promise made long ago. <words>39</words>

He had been stationed here as a sentinel, not for ships, but for something far more ancient that dwelled in the waters below. <words>60</words>

"It's certainly possible that I've wasted my life," he muttered with dry wit to the empty room, though he knew the room was never truly empty. <words>83</words>

The lighthouse had been haunted long before Elias arrived, but he and the ghost had developed an unusual arrangement over the years. <words>104</words>

They shared a love for the waltz, of all things—the ghost leading while Elias followed, spinning across creaking floorboards every midnight when the fog rolled in. <words>130</words>

Tonight was different; Elias had just crossed the final name off his list—a roster of every keeper who had abandoned their post over the centuries. <words>154</words>

Each name represented a promise eroded by fear or madness, keepers who had fled rather than fulfill their duty. <words>173</words>

Elias had spent decades learning the traditional methods of keeping the entity contained, methods passed down through generations of keepers. <words>193</words>

The ghost—Marianne, the wife of the first keeper—had taught him with reckless precision, her spectral form demonstrating the intricate steps of both the waltz and the binding ritual. <words>222</words>

"I'm sorry," Elias said, coiling the rope around his wrist, "but I must confiscate your anchor to this world." <words>240</words>

The temperature dropped as Marianne materialized, her translucent form shimmering with indignation. <words>252</words>

"You promised we would dance until the sea claimed this lighthouse," she accused, her voice like distant thunder. <words>269</words>

"Promises erode, Marianne, just like the cliff beneath us," Elias replied, his tone measured despite the ache in his chest. <words>288</words>

He had come to love their dances, but he had also come to understand that her presence was what drew the entity closer to shore. <words>313</words>

With methodical movements, Elias began the final ritual, tying knots in the frayed rope that would bind Marianne's spirit to it rather than to the lighthouse. <words>338</words>

"One last dance?" she asked, extending a hand that would feel like nothing more than a cold breeze against his skin. <words>359</words>

Elias nodded, taking her invisible hand, and they began their final waltz, moving with the practiced grace of longtime partners. <words>379</words>

As they danced, the lighthouse groaned and the waves crashed higher, as if the sea itself protested their parting. <words>398</words>

When the music in their minds faded, Elias completed his task with tears in his eyes, watching as Marianne's form dissolved into the rope, which he would cast into the deepest part of the ocean at dawn—fulfilling his duty as sentinel with a heart as frayed as the rope in his hands. <words>452</words>
