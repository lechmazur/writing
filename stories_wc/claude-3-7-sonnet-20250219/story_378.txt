Mayor Gus Thornberry hadn't meant to become mayor of Marshwick at all; he'd simply complained loudly enough about the town's problems that people wrote his name on their ballots as a joke. <words>31</words>

"Ridiculous," he muttered, trudging through the polluted swamp orchard where the ancient apple trees struggled to survive in water that shimmered with chemical rainbows. <words>51</words>

The Brotherhood of the Mire, a group of reclusive monks who had tended these trees for centuries, barely acknowledged his presence as he made his weekly inspection, their hooded figures moving silently between the gnarled trunks. <words>81</words>

In his pocket, the clockwork beetle—a gift from Brother Silas—ticked softly, its tiny gears whirring with mysterious purpose. <words>99</words>

Gus had been told the mechanical insect contained ancient "water wisdom," whatever that meant, but he was too lovably grumpy to admit he was curious about its powers. <words>126</words>

As he reached the center of the orchard, where the carnival had set up its tents for the past week, he watched the workers dismantling their colorful world under the first rays of dawn. <words>155</words>

The carnival's visit had been his idea—a desperate attempt to bring joy to Marshwick despite the environmental devastation—but now he wondered if he'd made things worse. <words>180</words>

Seeking refuge from his thoughts, Gus ducked into a small café at the orchard's edge, where carnival workers and early-rising locals mingled over steaming cups. <words>205</words>

He sat alone, nursing his black coffee, when an overheard conversation from the booth behind him made his blood run cold. <words>224</words>

"The dam breaks tomorrow," a voice whispered, "and when it does, the toxic sludge will finish what the factory started—this whole place will be underwater by nightfall." <words>249</words>

Gus clutched the clockwork beetle, which suddenly grew warm in his palm, its metal wings beginning to vibrate with increasing intensity. <words>269</words>

To his astonishment, the mechanical creature began to metamorphose, its brass segments rearranging themselves into a miniature map showing the watershed, the dam, and—most importantly—a solution. <words>294</words>

With reluctant awe, Gus watched as the beetle projected a shimmering hologram of water channels that could divert the flow away from Marshwick if implemented immediately. <words>317</words>

He understood then why Brother Silas had given him the device—not because he was mayor, but because only someone stubborn enough to fight fate would use it. <words>343</words>

The monks had known all along that the town's destruction was coming, but they believed Gus could change the course of fate. <words>364</words>

As the carnival's final truck pulled away, Gus stood with renewed purpose, the beetle now transformed into a key that would unlock the ancient water management system the monks had built centuries ago. <words>395</words>

"Fine," he grumbled to no one in particular, pocketing the key and heading toward the monastery bell tower, "I'll save the town, but I'm still resigning after this." <words>423</words>

But as the morning light caught the healing shimmer beginning to spread across the water's surface, Gus knew his accidental mayoralty was just the beginning of a much greater responsibility. <words>450</words>
