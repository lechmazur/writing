Elias Mercer stood on the observation deck, gazing at Earth with aloof passion as the last forest disappeared from view. <words>17</words>

The planet below had once been verdant, but now resembled a mottled brown sphere, its final tree having fallen just hours ago to corporate expansion. <words>41</words>

He clutched his rustic butter churn—a family heirloom and the only possession he'd managed to salvage when his merchant vessel crashed into the station three months prior. <words>67</words>

The antique wooden cylinder felt honestly strange against the sleek, antiseptic surfaces of Orbital Platform Zenith-9, like an artifact from a forgotten civilization. <words>90</words>

"They won't tell them," he whispered, fingers tracing the worn grain of the churn's handle. <words>105</words>

The station's AI had been broadcasting manipulated imagery of Earth's surface to the colonies for years—digital forests where none remained, oceans teeming with life long extinct. <words>134</words>

Elias had discovered this grand illusion while repairing communication arrays after his shipwreck, finding the raw feed before it was doctored for transmission. <words>156</words>

Now he watched as rebellious sparks of anger ignited within him, much like the fires that had consumed Earth's final woodlands. <words>176</words>

The observation deck was empty save for a tattered travel poster—"Visit Earth's Majestic Redwoods!"—its corners peeling away from the wall in the station's artificial breeze. <words>204</words>

Elias approached it slowly, drawn by some inexplicable force to the flaking edges of this propaganda. <words>220</words>

He reached out, fingers slipping beneath the poster's curling corner, and felt something impossible—a draft, a passage, a way to ascend beyond the physical constraints of the station. <words>249</words>

The butter churn hummed in his other hand, vibrating with energies that defied explanation, as if recognizing this ghost station hidden behind reality's thin veneer. <words>275</words>

With determination hardening his features, Elias began to peel back the poster, revealing not the expected metal wall but a shimmering threshold. <words>296</words>

He stepped forward, butter churn in hand, and began to ascend via the flaking edges of the travel poster, climbing into a dimension that existed between truth and fabrication. <words>324</words>

The station's alarms blared as sensors detected the breach in reality, but Elias continued his impossible climb, each step taking him further from the manufactured world. <words>350</words>

This was his chance to shatter the grand illusion, to reveal to the colonies that their homeworld was barren, that the corporations had lied about Earth's condition to prevent panic and maintain control. <words>384</words>

As he fully entered the ghost station—a shadow realm where discarded truths collected like cosmic dust—Elias felt his shipwrecked past falling away. <words>407</words>

The butter churn glowed with ancestral power, channeling the memory of Earth's lost forests, oceans, and creatures. <words>424</words>

From this liminal space, he would broadcast reality to every colony ship and outpost—the truth of their devastated homeworld revealed through the honestly strange conduit of his family's rustic artifact. <words>456</words>

Elias smiled with detached determination as the ghost station materialized around him, its control panels awaiting his touch, ready to help him tear down the carefully constructed fantasy that humanity had been living within since the last tree fell. <words>495</words>
