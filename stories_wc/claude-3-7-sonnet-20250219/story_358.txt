Professor Thaddeus Blackwood, an old-fashioned mage with spectacles perched on his hooked nose, traced frost patterns on the glass wall of the arctic research greenhouse. <words>21</words>

The midnight sun cast long shadows across his weathered face as he contemplated the fragment of a pharaoh's coffin that lay before him on the laboratory table. <words>43</words>

"Three thousand years of silence," he whispered to the ancient wood, its hieroglyphs pulsing with a faint golden light that seemed to respond to his voice. <words>65</words>

The research facility had been built at the northernmost point of habitable Earth, where the veil between worlds thinned like morning mist, and where Thaddeus could work undisturbed in his quest to claim this uncharted frontier of arcane knowledge. <words>100</words>

Outside, the children of the scientists played in their designated hour of playground time, their laughter a stark counterpoint to the sanctified dread that filled Thaddeus's heart as he worked. <words>130</words>

He had discovered that the coffin fragment contained not just a piece of history, but an unfolding riddle that revealed itself only through ephemeral encounters with mirror reflections. <words>155</words>

Each day at precisely this hour, when the children's voices reached their zenith, the hieroglyphs would shift and dance in the reflection of his polished silver mirror. <words>180</words>

Thaddeus moved purposefully aimless around the greenhouse, allowing intuition rather than method to guide his steps among the tropical plants that scientists were testing for arctic adaptation. <words>205</words>

The contradiction of lush vegetation thriving amid eternal ice suited his work perfectly—life persisting where it should not, just as ancient magic endured in a world of science. <words>233</words>

In the mirror's surface, he watched as his reflection changed, aging backward until a child version of himself appeared, arms outstretched toward the coffin fragment. <words>258</words>

"Show me," Thaddeus commanded, his voice trembling as the child-reflection began to cuddle the wooden piece as if it were a beloved toy. <words>279</words>

The hieroglyphs flared brilliantly, casting the greenhouse in golden light that refracted through the ice crystals forming on the glass walls. <words>299</words>

Each mirror encounter revealed another piece of the pharaoh's final message—a map to power beyond mortal comprehension, hidden at the axis where heat and cold, life and death, past and future converged. <words>331</words>

Thaddeus felt the weight of centuries press upon him as the children's playground time ended, their departure marked by the sudden silence that amplified his isolation. <words>358</words>

He cuddled the fragment against his chest, feeling its ancient heartbeat synchronize with his own, knowing that tomorrow's reflection would bring him one step closer to solving the riddle. <words>388</words>

The mage smiled as frost crept across the mirror's surface, obscuring his reflection but not before he glimpsed the pharaoh's face superimposed over his own—a promise that this uncharted frontier would soon be his to claim. <words>425</words>

As darkness finally fell across the arctic expanse, Thaddeus whispered incantations to the wooden fragment, his words carrying the sanctified dread of one who stands at the threshold of forbidden knowledge, poised between illumination and oblivion. <words>460</words>

The greenhouse plants seemed to lean toward him, as if they too were drawn to the ancient power that pulsed between his fingers—a power that would soon transform this sterile research outpost into the nexus of worlds that the pharaoh had promised in his final, cryptic riddle. <words>500</words>
