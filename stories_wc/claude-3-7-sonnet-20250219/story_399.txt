Mortimer hunched over the unmarked cardboard tube, his weathered fingers trembling as he extracted the ancient parchment from within. <words>17</words>

The crypt caretaker's perpetual scowl deepened as he surveyed the witch's crystal scrying room, where he had been summoned despite his protests. <words>37</words>

"Stargazing begins at midnight," he muttered to the empty air, his voice echoing among the countless glittering crystals that hung from the ceiling like frozen tears. <words>59</words>

Each crystal seemed to multiply, singular in design yet reflecting infinitely upon itself, creating an overwhelming sensation of being watched by countless eyes. <words>79</words>

Mortimer had spent decades tending to the forgotten dead, preferring their silent company to the chaos of the living, but tonight's task required him to confront the very trauma he had buried alongside countless others. <words>112</words>

The witch had instructed him to jiggle the crystals in a specific sequence throughout the stargazing ritual, claiming it would reveal patterns necessary for his healing. <words>136</words>

"Ridiculous," he grumbled, yet he found himself following her instructions, watching as the light refracted through the crystals and cast intricate shadows upon the sand mandala spread across the floor. <words>163</words>

The patterns in the sand mandala shifted with each subtle movement of the crystals, forming and reforming like memories too painful to hold steady. <words>185</words>

Mortimer's hands began to shake more violently as the mandala revealed images from his past—the war, the faces of comrades lost, the moment he chose to become a caretaker of the dead rather than rejoin the living. <words>221</words>

Through the patterns in the sand mandala, he witnessed his life unfold with grandiose subtlety, each grain representing a moment of joy or sorrow, collectively forming the tapestry of his existence. <words>249</words>

The stars above aligned with the crystals below, creating channels of light that pierced through the room's darkness and through Mortimer's carefully constructed emotional barriers. <words>273</words>

He felt an uprising within—rage, grief, and longing—emotions he had locked away in the crypts of his heart alongside the bodies he tended. <words>297</words>

To quell this uprising within required not suppression but acknowledgment, not burial but excavation. <words>311</words>

"The dead don't judge," he whispered, a mantra that had comforted him for years, but now seemed hollow against the weight of his unprocessed trauma. <words>334</words>

As the night deepened and stars traced their ancient paths across the heavens, Mortimer continued to jiggle the crystals, each movement more deliberate than the last. <words>359</words>

The mandala responded to his touch, sand shifting to reveal not just his wounds but the pathways to healing them. <words>379</words>

By dawn, when the last star faded from view, Mortimer stood straighter, the perpetual hunch in his shoulders slightly less pronounced. <words>399</words>

He carefully rolled up the sand mandala, preserving the patterns that had shown him the importance of trauma not as something to be buried in unmarked graves, but as essential chapters in the story of his life. <words>435</words>

Returning the parchment to its cardboard tube, Mortimer nodded respectfully to the witch's empty chair before departing, knowing he would return to the crypts changed—still their caretaker, but no longer solely a guardian of others' endings while neglecting his own beginning. <words>476</words>
