Jasper clutched the torn corner of a flyer as he ducked beneath the cap of the giant mushroom house, his calloused hands betraying years of metalwork and electrical repairs. <words>25</words>

"Right on time," he muttered, checking his watch against the synchronized timepiece hanging from a strand of mycelium in the entryway. <words>43</words>

The interior glowed with bioluminescent spores that cast everything in a hazy blue light, making memories and reality blur together in a way that was both vivid and indistinct. <words>67</words>

Jasper had been called to fix the electrical system, but he knew the real problem lay deeper than faulty wiring—it was the distortion of memory that plagued the mushroom's elderly inhabitant. <words>95</words>

"You're the third tradesman this week," croaked Madame Spore from her fungal armchair, her eyes cloudy with age and confusion. <words>113</words>

"I'm the only tradesman, ma'am," Jasper replied with a comfortingly pessimistic smile that somehow reassured her more than false cheerfulness ever could. <words>132</words>

He unfolded the torn flyer fragment, revealing part of a diagram he'd need to vectorize if he was going to map the electrical currents flowing through the living walls of her home. <words>159</words>

Outside, the ancient windmill that had once powered the entire mushroom colony made its final rotation, its creaking audible even through the spongy walls. <words>181</words>

"When that stops," Madame Spore whispered, "the void comes, and only a flickering candle will guide us home." <words>198</words>

Jasper had dismissed such talk as the ramblings of a senile woman, but as the windmill groaned to a halt, the lights within the mushroom house dimmed to nothing. <words>225</words>

In the sudden darkness, Madame Spore pressed a candle into his hand, its flame dancing with an impossible steadiness. <words>242</words>

"Your watches are synchronized to the old world," she said, suddenly lucid. <words>253</words>

"The new one requires someone to carry the light through the endless void between memories." <words>267</words>

As if responding to her words, the walls of the mushroom house became transparent, revealing not the forest outside but an infinite darkness punctuated by floating islands of memory—some Jasper's, some belonging to Madame Spore, some to people he'd never met. <words>307</words>

"I'm just here to fix your wiring," Jasper protested, his edgy demeanor cracking as reality shifted around him. <words>324</words>

"No," she replied, "you're here because you understand loss and how to live with it—your pessimism is actually hope in disguise." <words>345</words>

The candle in his hand flickered, casting shadows that seemed to vectorize the void, creating pathways between memory islands. <words>363</words>

Jasper checked his watch one last time, synchronizing it with the timepiece on the wall, which now counted not hours but the rhythm of remembering and forgetting. <words>387</words>

With a resigned nod that contained more determination than defeat, he stepped forward, carrying the flickering candle into the void, guided by the torn corner of a flyer that now revealed itself as a map of forgotten moments waiting to be rewired and remembered. <words>432</words>

As he walked, the blurry vividness of the void sharpened around him, and he understood that he wasn't just a tradesman anymore—he was a custodian of memory in a world where the final rotation of a forgotten windmill had ended one reality and begun another. <words>476</words>
