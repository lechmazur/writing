Sir Gareth stood at the deserted intersection, his armor gleaming under the lone streetlight as he awaited his contact. <words>17</words>

The knight's perpetually cold nature wasn't just temperament—his blood ran cool, a condition that had plagued him since childhood and made him perfect for the agency's night operations. <words>42</words>

He fingered the small child's mitten in his pocket, the recognition token that would identify him to his informant in this clandestine exchange. <words>63</words>

The Secret Service's underground facility—nicknamed the "Knight's Watch" by its operatives—had dispatched him to collect folk remedies from an informant with access to healing traditions that modern medicine had forgotten. <words>91</words>

Sir Gareth's superiors would never officially sanction this mission; his actions were lawfully rebellious, operating within the letter of his oath while bending its spirit to serve a higher purpose. <words>119</words>

The hush of midnight enveloped him, broken only by the distant wail of a siren and the whisper of his own breathing inside his helmet. <words>142</words>

He had joined the agency to protect his country, but now found himself supporting a cause more personal—finding a cure for his daughter's mysterious illness. <words>166</words>

The doctors had given up, but Gareth refused to accept their prognosis, turning instead to ancient wisdom preserved by those who kept old traditions alive. <words>190</words>

A figure emerged from the shadows, an elderly woman whose eyes held both kindness and caution. <words>204</words>

"You seek healing for the child," she stated, not asked, her voice carrying an intimacy that bridged the physical distance between them. <words>224</words>

Gareth nodded, producing the small red mitten. <words>231</words>

The woman's face softened as she took it, examining the crude embroidery his daughter had added before falling ill. <words>249</words>

"Follow me," she whispered, leading him to an abandoned building where, in a hidden room, stood an incomplete family altar—candles, photographs, herbs, but conspicuously missing the central icon. <words>276</words>

"Our traditions are fragmented," she explained, arranging her collected remedies on the altar's surface, "just as your daughter's health is incomplete without these treatments." <words>298</words>

As she worked, mixing herbs and murmuring incantations, Gareth removed his helmet, feeling vulnerable yet strangely awakened. <words>315</words>

The woman handed him a small vial and a piece of parchment covered with intricate drawings. <words>331</words>

"Your daughter has the soul of an artist," she said. "These remedies will heal her body, but only if you help her complete what she has begun." <words>357</words>

Returning to headquarters, Gareth slipped past security protocols, the vial hidden in his armor's secret compartment. <words>373</words>

Three days later, as his daughter sipped the remedy, Gareth placed her art supplies beside her bed—the first time she had smiled in months. <words>397</words>

Within weeks, she was not only recovering but flourishing, her bedroom walls covered with vibrant paintings that seemed to pulse with life—an artistic awakening that healed not just her body, but Gareth's cold nature as well. <words>434</words>

Sometimes, he reflected, watching her paint, the most valiant knights must venture beyond the boundaries of convention to find true healing. <words>453</words>

And sometimes, a child's lost mitten could lead to finding something far more precious than what was initially sought. <words>472</words>
