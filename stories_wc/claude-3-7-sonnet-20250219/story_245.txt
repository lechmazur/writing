Vex Marrow pounded the flight deck's cracked console, his breath forming clouds in the frigid air of the abandoned spaceport. <words>17</words>

"Thirteen years of running contraband across the Outer Rim, and this is how it ends—betrayed by my own damn heart," he snarled, jabbing a single chopstick into the scattered tea leaves on the dusty control panel. <words>47</words>

The chopstick—the only memento from his partner Lira—trembled in his white-knuckled grip as he traced patterns in the leaves, desperately seeking meaning in their random arrangement. <words>73</words>

His morning jog through the derelict spaceport had become a ritual, a way to outrun the abstractly physical pain that had taken residence in his chest since Lira's disappearance three months ago. <words>103</words>

"She always said the heart would revolt against what the mind commanded," Vex muttered, his voice echoing across the cavernous flight deck where starships once thundered to life. <words>130</words>

The tea leaves—Lira's preferred method of divination—had become his obsession, a way to memorialize her while searching for clues to her whereabouts. <words>154</words>

With biting sincerity that would have made Lira proud, Vex admitted to himself that he wasn't really smuggling artifacts anymore; he was hunting for her, following rumors of hidden waterfalls where she'd once promised they would retire together. <words>191</words>

"The patterns never lie," she'd told him, her eyes twinkling with mischief as she'd read his fortune years ago, predicting his heart would one day betray his carefully constructed walls. <words>222</words>

Sweat cooled on his neck as he paused his jogging circuit, the abandoned flight deck's broken skylights casting prison-bar shadows across his weathered face. <words>245</words>

The chopstick moved of its own accord now, tracing a familiar mountain range in the scattered leaves—the same range where travelers spoke of waterfalls hidden in mist, visible only to those who had lost something precious. <words>280</words>

"I see it now, Lira," he whispered, a revelation dawning as the pattern suddenly made sense—not a random scattering but a map, coordinates hidden in plain sight all this time. <words>312</words>

His heart pounded against his ribs in a revolt against years of cynicism as he recognized the pattern: it wasn't just any waterfall but the Cascading Veils of Altair Seven, a place Lira had mentioned only once in passing. <words>351</words>

The irate smuggler who had cursed the universe now stood transfixed, the single chopstick hovering over the final pattern that completed the map. <words>374</words>

"You clever, impossible woman," he said with a smile that cracked the hard lines of his face, understanding now that she hadn't disappeared—she had gone ahead to prepare their future, leaving him a trail only his heart could follow. <words>414</words>

Vex carefully gathered the tea leaves into a small pouch, tucked the chopstick into his breast pocket, and resumed his jog with renewed purpose, his footsteps echoing with determination across the flight deck that had witnessed his heart's transformation. <words>452</words>

Tomorrow, he would leave this abandoned spaceport behind and follow the map to find not just hidden waterfalls, but the woman who had taught an irate smuggler how to read the patterns of his own rebellious heart. <words>489</words>
