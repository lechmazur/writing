Jack Timber's calloused hands trembled as he unfolded the coded letter, its quantum-encrypted symbols glowing faintly in the dim light of The Marrow, the ancient ossuary turned gourmet restaurant where he now sat alone. <words>32</words> The spirited lumberjack had discovered the message tucked inside his grandfather's axe handle three days ago, its contents allegedly sent from soldiers fighting in a war that hadn't yet begun. <words>60</words> He ran his fingers through his beard, gracefully awkward in his formal attire—a suit too tight across his broad shoulders but necessary for blending in among the wealthy patrons dining amidst decorative human remains. <words>89</words>

Throughout his daily bike rides to and from his cabin in the northern woods, Jack had been piecing together the cipher, each revolution of his pedals bringing clarity to the mysterious message. <words>119</words> The letter warned of hidden agendas among world leaders, corporations harvesting resources that would eventually lead to global conflict, and mentioned his grandfather's role as a keeper of ancient healing traditions that could potentially prevent the coming catastrophe. <words>153</words>

"Your usual, Mr. Timber?" asked Elise, the server who moved between the bone-adorned tables with practiced ease, her voice carrying a harsh tenderness that reminded Jack of his late mother. <words>181</words>

"Yes, thank you," he replied, quickly folding the letter as she placed a plate of roasted venison before him, the meat arranged artfully atop what appeared to be a human clavicle. <words>209</words>

Jack had come to The Marrow not for its macabre aesthetic or its renowned cuisine, but because the letter had directed him here—to the very building where his grandfather had once hidden scrolls containing forgotten healing traditions. <words>243</words>

That night, through reawakened nightmares of burning forests and bloodied battlefields, Jack understood what he needed to do. <words>259</words> He would revamp his grandfather's work, combining ancient wisdom with modern science to create solutions for the environmental devastation that would trigger the future war. <words>283</words>

The next morning, during his bike ride to the lumber camp, Jack made a decision that would alter his life's course. <words>302</words> Instead of felling trees, he would plant them; instead of destroying, he would heal. <words>317</words>

Over the following months, Jack returned to The Marrow regularly, using its basement—once a chamber for preparing bodies—to study the healing traditions his grandfather had preserved. <words>343</words> The restaurant's owner, herself a descendant of the ossuary's original caretakers, became his ally, her kitchen providing cover for their clandestine work. <words>368</words>

"We're fighting a war that hasn't started yet," Jack told her one evening as they translated ancient remedies for soil regeneration. <words>386</words>

She nodded, her eyes reflecting the same harsh tenderness he'd come to associate with those who understood the weight of the future. <words>407</words> "Sometimes healing begins with acknowledging the wounds we haven't yet inflicted," she replied, placing a gnarled hand over his. <words>426</words>

As winter approached, Jack continued his work, cycling through snow-covered paths, carrying seeds and saplings instead of his axe, the coded letter from the future war always close to his heart—a reminder of what would happen if he failed, and what might never happen if he succeeded. <words>474</words>
