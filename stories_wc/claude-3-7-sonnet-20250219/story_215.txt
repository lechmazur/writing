Father Matthias clutched the vintage postcard to his chest, his hands trembling as he entered the psychic research facility. <words>17</words> The rattled exorcist had received it three days ago, postmarked from a town that no longer existed, bearing only the cryptic message: "The veil thins where science and spirit dance." <words>45</words> He'd been summoned here, to this sterile laboratory disguised as a dance studio, by Dr. Eleanor Voss, whose reputation for guarded disclosures about her paranormal research was legendary in certain circles. <words>75</words>

"You're late, Father," Dr. Voss said with a smile that didn't reach her eyes, her tone carrying a coy aggression that made Matthias instantly uncomfortable. <words>97</words> "The intermediate waltz lesson began ten minutes ago." <words>105</words>

Around them, six pairs of dancers moved in synchronized patterns across the polished floor, each wearing electrodes on their temples connected to humming machines along the walls. <words>129</words> Matthias recognized the dance floor's intricate inlay for what it truly was—a complex circuit designed to capture and amplify psychic energy. <words>149</words>

"I don't dance," he replied, though his foot was already tapping to the rhythm, betraying his inwardly social nature that he'd suppressed through years of solitary prayer. <words>176</words>

Dr. Voss took his hand. <words>181</words> "Everyone dances when the right music plays, Father." <words>189</words> She pressed the postcard back into his palm. <words>197</words> "This is the first key." <words>202</words>

As they moved across the floor, Matthias began to understand—each dance pattern formed a puzzle, and with each correct sequence, hidden panels in the walls illuminated. <words>229</words> "You're trying to synthesize something," he whispered as they turned. <words>239</words> "Something between worlds." <words>243</words>

"I'm trying to entwine science with wonder," she corrected, her breath warm against his ear. <words>257</words> "Isn't that what you've sought your whole life, exorcising demons while secretly wondering if they held answers?" <words>276</words>

The dance lesson continued for hours, each new pattern revealing another puzzle—musical sequences, light patterns, temperature variations—all requiring both Matthias's spiritual intuition and Voss's scientific precision to solve. <words>308</words>

When the final dancer left, they stood alone before a wall that had transformed into a door. <words>324</words> "Your postcard was the map," Dr. Voss explained. <words>332</words> "Your exorcism rituals were always halfway there—banishing without understanding." <words>343</words>

The hidden room beyond the door glowed with unearthly light, containing a single table where spiritual artifacts and scientific instruments were arranged in perfect harmony. <words>368</words>

"For centuries, the church has guarded what science has sought to expose," Matthias said, finally understanding why he'd been chosen. <words>387</words> "Perhaps neither approach alone was sufficient." <words>394</words>

Together, they stepped into the room where the boundaries between faith and science dissolved, where the rattled exorcist found his trembling hands steadied by the very mysteries he'd once feared to acknowledge. <words>429</words> In this sacred laboratory, amid the echoes of dance lessons that had unlocked its secrets, Matthias realized that his lifetime of guarded disclosures had prepared him for this moment of perfect revelation. <words>464</words>
