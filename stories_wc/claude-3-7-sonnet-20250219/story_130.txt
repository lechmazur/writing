Zel wandered through the interstellar orchard ship's artificial gravity zones, her apprentice badge flickering with diminishing power. <words>16</words>

"Lost again, little sapling?" Captain Morrow's voice crackled through the static-laden cordless phone Zel had found abandoned in the cargo hold. <words>34</words>

She rolled her eyes at his mocking affection, knowing he monitored her movements across the vessel with paternal amusement. <words>51</words>

"I'm exploring, not lost," she replied, privately open to the fact that she had absolutely no idea which section of the massive ship she currently occupied. <words>74</words>

The Pomona was magnificent—a botanical ark migrating between galaxies, carrying Earth's rarest fruit trees across the promise of changing winds. <words>93</words>

Zel paused beneath a flowering cherry tree where a bird's nest, fallen from above, lay at her feet. <words>110</words>

The delicate construction fascinated her—twigs and synthetic fibers woven with mathematical precision by the ship's genetically modified sparrows. <words>126</words>

"What do you see?" asked Morrow through the phone's crackling speaker, his voice traveling across thousands of internal ship circuits. <words>143</words>

Zel picked up the nest, turning it in her hands. <words>152</words>

"I see something I could reverse-engineer," she answered, already mentally deconstructing the nest's architecture. <words>166</words>

Morrow laughed, the sound distorted by the ancient communication device. <words>176</words>

"There's traveler's wisdom in that nest, apprentice," he said. <words>185</words>

"The birds build homes they know they'll abandon when we reach the next habitable system." <words>199</words>

Zel sat cross-legged on the orchard floor, surrounded by falling cherry blossoms as the ship's artificial seasons progressed. <words>216</words>

She had fled the Engineering Guild three cycles ago, abandoning her prestigious position to stow away on this ancient vessel. <words>234</words>

"I wasn't meant to be an engineer," she confessed into the phone, words she'd never spoken aloud before. <words>250</words>

Through the static, Morrow's voice softened. <words>256</words>

"None of us were meant to be anything, sapling—that's the beauty of interstellar travel." <words>270</words>

Zel studied the nest more carefully, noticing how the birds had incorporated materials from every sector of the ship—bits of wire from Engineering, threads from Textiles, even strands of synthetic protein from Hydroponics. <words>302</words>

"They don't limit themselves," she whispered. <words>308</words>

"Neither should you," Morrow replied. <words>313</words>

Over the next ship-weeks, Zel used the cordless phone to gather fragments of conversation from across the Pomona, collecting wisdom like the birds collected building materials. <words>337</words>

She reverse-engineered her own identity from these static-laden confessions, piecing together a new understanding of herself. <words>353</words>

The ship continued its journey across the vast emptiness between galaxies, and Zel found herself no longer an apprentice without a master but a traveler charting her own course. <words>380</words>

When the Pomona finally approached the Andromeda Galaxy, Zel stood in the observation dome, the old phone in one hand and the preserved bird's nest in the other. <words>406</words>

"I'm staying aboard for the next migration," she told Morrow when he joined her, his actual voice replacing the static-filled version she'd grown accustomed to. <words>429</words>

He nodded, unsurprised. <words>432</words>

"The birds taught you well," he said with that familiar mocking affection that now felt like home. <words>448</words>

Zel smiled, finally finding freedom in self-acceptance as the ship's massive engines prepared to carry them into new, uncharted territories. <words>467</words>
