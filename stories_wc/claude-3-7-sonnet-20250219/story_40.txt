Eliza tended to the aquarium with practiced hands, her eyes lingering on the new goldfish swimming in lazy circles. <words>16</words>

"Hello, Bartholomew the Fourteenth," she whispered, tentatively fierce in her determination to keep this incarnation alive longer than the previous thirteen. <words>34</words>

The forgotten recipe library where she worked was quiet today, its towering shelves of abandoned culinary innovations gathering dust while rain pattered against the stained-glass windows. <words>58</words>

In her pocket, she carried the one-armed toy soldier that had belonged to Bartholomew the First's young owner—a reminder of her initial failure as a pet-sitter that had somehow morphed into her current peculiar profession as the neighborhood's goldfish resurrection specialist. <words>96</words>

The guilt's haunting echo followed her through each reincarnation, thirteen times she'd watched those orange scales go belly-up despite her increasingly elaborate care routines. <words>122</words>

"This time will be different," she told the toy soldier as she placed him beside the tank, his painted smile offering playful cynicism in response. <words>145</words>

Tomorrow she would visit Dr. Finley for her annual checkup, but before the doctor's chart confirms a turning point in her own health, she was determined to break her fish-killing curse. <words>175</words>

The ancient recipe cards surrounding her supposedly contained every formula ever created, and somewhere among them, she believed, was the perfect fish food that would alleviate her karmic debt. <words>203</words>

Outside, thunder cracked and the gentle rain transformed into a deluge, the sudden change of weather causing the library's ancient skylight to leak directly onto section F-I, "Fish Cuisine—Experimental." <words>233</words>

Water dripped onto a faded card labeled "Immortality Flakes—Caution: Results Vary," which might have remained unnoticed if not for the elderly man who suddenly appeared beside her, shaking rainwater from his umbrella. <words>265</words>

"Ah, I see you've found my grandfather's work," he said, picking up the wet recipe with reverent fingers. <words>282</words>

The chance encounter with the recipe creator's descendant seemed too coincidental, but Eliza had long ago stopped questioning the strange patterns that followed her fishy failures. <words>308</words>

"I've been trying to disrupt a stagnant tradition of goldfish mortality," she explained, gesturing to Bartholomew the Fourteenth, who was now performing what appeared to be synchronized swimming maneuvers with his own reflection. <words>339</words>

The man laughed, his eyes crinkling with the same playful cynicism as her toy soldier's painted expression. <words>356</words>

"My grandfather created that recipe to keep his pet goldfish alive after it swallowed his wedding ring—lived for twenty-seven years afterward." <words>378</words>

Together they mixed the formula, Eliza's hands no longer tentative but confidently fierce as she sprinkled the flakes into Bartholomew's tank. <words>398</words>

As the goldfish gobbled them eagerly, the one-armed toy soldier seemed to wink in the aquarium's refracted light, and Eliza felt the weight of thirteen fishy ghosts finally lift from her shoulders—just in time to face whatever news tomorrow's medical appointment might bring. <words>444</words>
