Bartholomew, the groggy brewer, stumbled through the haunted mansion graveyard, his mind still foggy from sampling his latest experimental batch. <words>17</words>

"This is uniquely generic," he muttered to himself, eyeing the weathered tombstones that looked just like every haunted graveyard from every B-movie he'd ever watched. <words>38</words>

The protest beyond the iron gates had momentarily quieted, that strange lull when demonstrators catch their breath before voices gather again with renewed vigor. <words>58</words>

Bartholomew had slipped away precisely during this interval, determined to initiate the ritual he'd discovered in his grandfather's moldering brewery journal. <words>77</words>

"To become the living embodiment of one's values requires sacrifice," he recited with flippant solemnity, clutching the piece of a broken mirror wrapped in velvet. <words>98</words>

The fragment reflected the encroaching darkness that seemed to flow like liquid shadow from the mansion's highest windows. <words>114</words>

Bartholomew had always preached authenticity in brewing and in life—no additives, no shortcuts—and tonight he would transform himself into the very essence of that philosophy. <words>137</words>

The mansion door creaked open at his touch, as if expecting him. <words>148</words>

Inside, dust particles danced in the dim light filtering through cracked stained glass, creating patterns that seemed almost deliberate in their arrangement. <words>168</words>

"Step one: find the spiral staircase," he mumbled, navigating the foyer with the confidence of someone following a recipe. <words>186</words>

The staircase revealed itself behind a rotting tapestry, its wooden steps groaning promises of collapse. <words>200</words>

As he ascended, Bartholomew held the mirror fragment at arm's length, watching how it captured and distorted the gloom surrounding him. <words>219</words>

Halfway up, he paused, noticing via the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase—a rusty smudge that didn't match the general decay. <words>239</words>

"The mark of the alchemist," he whispered, pressing his thumb against it. <words>250</words>

The stair shifted beneath him, and somewhere in the mansion's bowels, ancient machinery groaned to life. <words>265</words>

Outside, the protesters' chants swelled again, their demands for corporate transparency in brewing practices echoing across the cemetery. <words>281</words>

Bartholomew smiled grimly—they fought for what he was about to become. <words>292</words>

The mirror fragment grew warm in his hand as he continued climbing, each step bringing him closer to the ritual chamber where the encroaching darkness pooled like spilled ink. <words>320</words>

"Purity, honesty, craft," he intoned, his voice steadier than his legs as he reached the top landing. <words>336</words>

The chamber door stood ajar, revealing a circular room where shadows moved independently of light sources. <words>351</words>

Bartholomew stepped inside, raised the mirror fragment, and caught the reflection of the darkness as it reached for him with tendriled hands. <words>371</words>

"I initiate this transformation," he declared with that same flippant solemnity that had become his trademark at brewing conventions. <words>388</words>

The darkness responded, flowing into the mirror and then into Bartholomew himself, filling the spaces between his cells with its ancient knowledge of fermentation and time. <words>412</words>

As the transformation completed, Bartholomew felt his consciousness expand beyond his body, becoming one with every honest batch of beer ever brewed. <words>432</words>

When dawn broke, the protesters found the mansion gates open and a new figure among them—a man whose eyes reflected nothing and whose words about brewing carried the weight of centuries. <words>462</words>

They didn't question his presence or his passion, only followed his lead as he guided them toward a future where values weren't just marketed, but manifested. <words>487</words>
