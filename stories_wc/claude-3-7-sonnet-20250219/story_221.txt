The carnival had been abandoned for decades, its once vibrant colors now faded like memories in the salt air. <words>17</words>

Eliza traced her fingers along the shooting gallery's peeling paint, feeling the whispers of those who had come before. <words>35</words>

In her pocket, she carried the piece of amber her grandmother had given her, an ancient mosquito suspended in golden time. <words>54</words>

"They're louder here," she murmured to herself, the voices of the drowned calling to her as they always did when she was near water. <words>76</words>

The shooting gallery had flooded years ago during the hurricane that claimed her parents, the same storm that had awakened her ability to hear the dead. <words>100</words>

Eliza placed the amber on the counter where carnival-goers once exchanged tickets for prizes, its surface catching the dying light filtering through broken windows. <words>123</words>

She unfolded the letter from her pocket—her mother's final words, half-finished when the waters came. <words>139</words>

Between those lines of hurried handwriting lay the real message: the family tradition of attending the summer carnival's opening day, a tradition now fifteen years interrupted. <words>162</words>

"I'm here, Mom," Eliza said, her voice joyfully melancholic as she loaded the ancient BB gun still chained to the counter. <words>182</words>

The sound of the pellet hitting a metal duck aroused something in the gallery—a stirring of dust, a shifting of shadows, a whisper growing louder. <words>206</words>

As a professional wreck-diver, Eliza had recovered treasures from the ocean floor, but never had she felt so close to recovering what she truly sought—connection. <words>230</words>

The amber grew warm in her palm as spirits gathered around her, their presence a gentle pressure against her consciousness. <words>249</words>

"You always said I lived in your shadow," she spoke to the empty air where her mother's ghost should be, "but I've made my own way now." <words>274</words>

Her fleeting rebellion against grief had become a career of listening to the sea's dead, of bringing closure to families who lost loved ones to the waves. <words>299</words>

The carnival music box, untouched for years, suddenly chimed a tinny melody that Eliza recognized from childhood. <words>316</words>

She felt her heart—frozen since that terrible day—begin to thaw as her mother's presence finally emerged from between the lines of the letter, from within the walls of their special place. <words>347</words>

"I never wanted you in my shadow," came her mother's voice, clear as the day she'd been lost. <words>364</words>

"I wanted you to shine brighter than I ever could." <words>374</words>

Tears streamed down Eliza's face as she fired the BB gun again and again, hitting every target, each chime of success bringing her closer to the peace she'd sought for so long. <words>407</words>

The amber in her hand pulsed with light, the insect inside seeming to move as if awakening from its prehistoric slumber. <words>427</words>

As the sun set on the abandoned carnival, Eliza placed the half-written letter back in her pocket, knowing she would return next year and the year after that—continuing the tradition not from obligation, but from love. <words>462</words>

The thawing of her heart complete, she whispered goodbye to the ghosts and stepped out of the gallery, no longer a shadow of her past but a beacon for those lost between worlds. <words>495</words>
