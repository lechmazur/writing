Lord Percival Whitley, the most submissive aristocrat in three counties, knelt in the garden pulling weeds with gloved hands that had never known real labor before this month. <words>23</words>

His family estate had been "temporarily requisitioned" by the government for what they called a "strategic training initiative," but what was clearly a secret agent workshop operating right under his ancestral roof. <words>49</words>

Percival had been relegated to groundskeeper of his own property, a humiliation he accepted with characteristic deference, though his unusually perceptive nature had begun to piece together the true nature of the operation. <words>77</words>

The afternoon sun beat down as he worked near an open basement window, his mind wandering to the dull letter opener he'd inherited from his grandfather—the only family heirloom he'd managed to keep when the agents arrived. <words>110</words>

Suddenly, voices drifted up from below, and Percival found himself frozen in place, unintentionally eavesdropping on a conversation that echoed clearly through the foundation vents. <words>132</words>

"We need to liquify the assets immediately," a stern voice commanded, "before the target realizes what we've done." <words>148</words>

Another voice responded with earnest flippancy, "Oh sure, just melt down a century of intelligence work because someone got cold feet—brilliant plan, truly inspired." <words>171</words>

Percival remained motionless, his gardening shears suspended above a stubborn dandelion, as he realized they were discussing Operation Sparrow—a name he'd overheard repeatedly in the echo chambers of his own home. <words>201</words>

What the agents didn't know was that "Sparrow" wasn't a codename but an actual bird—a rare golden-throated sparrow that nested in the estate's north tower, a species Percival had protected since childhood. <words>232</words>

The bird's unusual coloring made its feathers valuable on black markets, and Percival suddenly understood why the agents had been scouring the grounds. <words>253</words>

A silent empathy welled within him for the vulnerable creature that had no idea it was being hunted by professionals. <words>272</words>

That evening, while the agents were occupied with tactical drills, Percival slipped into his former study, retrieving his grandfather's letter opener from its hiding place beneath a loose floorboard. <words>299</words>

Though dull and ornamental, the letter opener concealed a secret—its handle unscrewed to reveal a hollow chamber containing microfilm documenting the sparrow species' protected status under international law. <words>327</words>

With trembling hands but resolute heart, Percival made his way to the command center, where he found the operation director alone reviewing files. <words>349</words>

"Excuse me, sir," Percival said with practiced deference, "while tending to the yard work, I couldn't help but overhear your plans regarding the Sparrow." <words>372</words>

The director's head snapped up, eyes narrowing dangerously, but Percival continued with unexpected confidence, "Before you liquidate anything, you should know that interfering with this particular sparrow would violate seventeen international conservation treaties." <words>403</words>

He placed the microfilm on the desk, adding with a hint of his own earnest flippancy, "I'd hate to see His Majesty's finest secret service brought down by a bird, but I'd be delighted to help relocate our feathered friend if that would resolve your... ethical dilemma." <words>446</words>

The director stared at Percival for a long moment before a reluctant smile cracked his stern facade—it seemed the submissive aristocrat had finally found his voice, and the vulnerable sparrow would keep its home. <words>478</words>
