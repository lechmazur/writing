The calm assassin moved through the ancient Chinese palace like a shadow, his footsteps silent against the ornate marble floors. <words>17</words>

His name was Wei, though few knew it, and fewer still lived after learning it. <words>32</words>

In his quarters, nestled between scrolls of imperial decrees and maps of the forbidden city, sat his most prized possession: a botanical press filled with butterfly specimens, each carefully preserved between rice paper sheets. <words>62</words>

Wei's reputation for killing without emotion was figuratively literal—he felt nothing during the act itself but experienced overwhelming emotion during the preparation and aftermath. <words>87</words>

"The Emperor's soothsayer arrives tomorrow," whispered his contact, a palace servant with darting eyes and trembling hands. <words>102</words>

Wei nodded, already planning how to amalgamate his dual identities—deadly assassin and secret collector of delicate winged creatures. <words>120</words>

The prophecy that had reached the Emperor's ears spoke of a foreign usurper with hair the color of wheat fields, and Wei had been tasked with ensuring this future never materialized. <words>148</words>

But Wei harbored whispers of longing for a different life, one where his hands created rather than destroyed. <words>165</words>

He opened his botanical press that evening, studying the pattern of a butterfly's wings—a rare purple emperor whose markings resembled a map of the stars. <words>189</words>

"Curious how fate works," Wei mused to himself, tracing the delicate veins on the preserved wing. <words>204</words>

"They say the flutter of a butterfly's wings can cause a hurricane across the world—what might the death of one cause?" <words>224</words>

The palace hummed with preparation for the soothsayer's arrival, servants scurrying like ants while Wei contemplated the nature of prophecy. <words>243</words>

Before the first question is asked of the soothsayer, Wei would need to act—to spin a prophecy into raw possibility rather than predetermined fate. <words>267</words>

He arranged his collection of butterflies in a specific pattern on the floor of his chamber, creating a message only the soothsayer would understand. <words>290</words>

"If prophecies are like butterflies," Wei reasoned with humorous unease, "then perhaps they too can be pinned down and preserved—or changed entirely." <words>311</words>

The night air carried the scent of jasmine as Wei practiced his calligraphy, writing a false prophecy that would save both the Emperor's pride and the life of the foreign diplomat. <words>341</words>

In the morning, he would slip this message into the soothsayer's chambers, along with a butterfly whose wings bore markings resembling the Emperor's seal. <words>366</words>

Wei smiled at the irony—an assassin preserving life through deception rather than taking it through violence. <words>381</words>

As dawn approached, he closed his botanical press with gentle hands, whispering, "Some butterflies must be freed rather than collected." <words>400</words>

The calm assassin had found a way to honor both his duty and his conscience, transforming death into life with the same precision he normally reserved for his blade. <words>429</words>

And when the soothsayer arrived, wide-eyed at the butterfly message awaiting him, Wei watched from behind a column, his heart fluttering with something that felt remarkably like hope. <words>458</words>
