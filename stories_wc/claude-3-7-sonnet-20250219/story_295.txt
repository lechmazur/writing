Galen the sellsword whistled a merry tune as he approached the witch's herb garden, his sword swinging carelessly at his hip. <words>20</words>

The scent of rosemary and nightshade mingled in the twilight air, creating an atmosphere both inviting and dangerous. <words>36</words>

"Madame Verna," he called out with a bow that was both theatrical and genuine, "I've brought what you requested." <words>53</words>

The witch emerged from between rows of moonflowers, her silver hair catching the last light of day. <words>69</words>

"You're boldly reluctant as always, Galen," she observed, noting how he stood at the garden's edge, unwilling to step fully into her domain despite his cheerful demeanor. <words>94</words>

"A healthy caution keeps a sellsword alive," he replied, producing a small brass astronomical telescope from his leather satchel. <words>112</words>

The instrument gleamed with ancient markings, its lens capturing starlight even before darkness had fully fallen. <words>127</words>

"The withering vow requires precise timing," Verna said, taking the telescope with reverent hands. <words>141</words>

She led him deeper into the garden, past plants that seemed to whisper and shift as they passed, to a clearing where a small pit had been dug into the earth. <words>170</words>

"My family has made time capsules for seven generations," Galen explained, kneeling beside the pit. <words>184</words>

"But none have ever made one throughout the transformation of a celestial alignment." <words>197</words>

Verna nodded, her eyes reflecting starlight as she positioned the telescope toward the emerging night sky. <words>212</words>

"To dethrone doubt from the mind requires sacrifice," she murmured, placing herbs and small crystals around the pit in a pattern that seemed to pulse with its own heartbeat. <words>239</words>

Galen's jovial facade slipped momentarily, revealing the weight of his purpose. <words>250</words>

"I treasure the memory of my sister too much to let uncertainty cloud what I must do," he said, removing a lock of auburn hair from a silver locket. <words>276</words>

As the moon rose higher, elegant mayhem unfolded in the gardenâ€”plants swayed without wind, shadows danced without movement, and the air itself seemed to breathe with anticipation. <words>302</words>

Verna began an incantation, her voice weaving between harsh consonants and flowing vowels while Galen placed the locket, a small dagger, and a parchment with his sister's name into the earth. <words>335</words>

"Throughout the transformation, your doubt will wither like these leaves," Verna promised, crushing dried sage between her fingers and letting it fall into the pit. <words>358</words>

The telescope suddenly glowed with an inner light, capturing the precise moment when three stars aligned above them. <words>375</words>

Galen felt something cold and ancient pass through him as Verna sealed the time capsule with wax and earth. <words>393</words>

"In one year's time, when the stars align again, you'll return," she instructed, her voice now gentle. <words>410</words>

"And you'll know with certainty whether your blade should seek vengeance or if your sister truly left of her own accord." <words>429</words>

Galen's smile returned, though tempered now with something deeper than his usual cheer, as he rose and dusted soil from his knees. <words>450</words>

"Until then," he said with a bow, "I'll carry this withering vow and let it transform my doubt into purpose." <words>469</words>

As he departed the witch's garden, his step was lighter, his whistled tune more genuine, the elegant mayhem of uncertainty finally beginning to settle into order within his mind. <words>499</words>
