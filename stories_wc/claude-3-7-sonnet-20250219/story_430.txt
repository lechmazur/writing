Vex prowled the edges of Kaleidoscope Park, his scarred face twisting into what passed for a smile these days. <words>17</words>

The other reavers would have laughed to see him here, surrounded by prismatic light sculptures and giggling children, but something had drawn him to this place of innocence. <words>42</words>

In his pocket, he fingered the crumpled paper he'd found outside his doorstep that morning—a child's drawing of what appeared to be himself, rendered in crayon with exaggerated fangs and impossibly large hands, yet somehow capturing his essence with disturbing accuracy. <words>78</words>

"Charming little monster, aren't you?" he muttered to the absent artist, admiring the charmingly grotesque representation that somehow made his fearsome appearance seem almost whimsical. <words>102</words>

Around the edges of the drawing, barely visible in the creases, were scrawled poems—tiny, insistent words that seemed to nag at him: "The stars taste sweet for those who leap, but bitter for those who creep." <words>138</words>

Another poem curled around his crudely drawn boot: "Father's scowl becomes son's growl, the pattern set before the howl." <words>156</words>

Vex had spent decades building his reputation as the most closed-off reaver in the borderlands, yet these childish verses in the margins pierced his carefully constructed armor. <words>183</words>

He scanned the park's kaleidoscopic lights, which fractured and reformed in endless patterns, much like the generations of his family—reavers all, each following the path of the one before. <words>214</words>

A small figure sat alone on a bench beneath the central prism tower, a girl no more than seven, her pencil moving furiously across a sketchpad. <words>239</words>

"You've been following me," Vex said, his voice rougher than intended as he approached her, the drawing extended in his clawed hand. <words>260</words>

She looked up, unafraid, with eyes that mirrored his own unusual amber color. <words>273</words>

"You're late, Uncle Vex," she said with mocking affection, "I've been waiting all morning." <words>287</words>

"How do you know who I am?" he demanded, though something in his blood recognized her—his sister's child, the one he'd never met. <words>310</words>

"Mom said you'd come before I learned to lie," she replied simply, "before I learned to hide who I really am, like all the grown-ups do." <words>336</words>

She patted the bench beside her, and against all reason, he sat. <words>347</words>

"The stars, Uncle Vex," she whispered, pointing to her drawing of constellations, "Mom said you once told her you wanted to taste them." <words>369</words>

His throat tightened at the memory of his childhood dream, spoken only once to his sister under a meteor shower, before he'd hardened, before he'd left. <words>397</words>

"She said sometimes a kiss can taste like stars, if it's given with love," the child continued, then leaned over and placed an innocent peck on his ruined cheek. <words>426</words>

Something ancient and frozen cracked within Vex's chest as the kaleidoscope lights danced across their shared features, illuminating the generational pattern that didn't have to continue. <words>450</words>

"Draw me again," he said finally, his voice soft, "but this time, perhaps with smaller teeth." <words>466</words>

She smiled, tearing out a fresh page, and Vex felt the taste of stardust on his lips for the first time since childhood. <words>489</words>
