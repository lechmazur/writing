Mira checked her watch for the fifth time, the pressed four-leaf clover in glass dangling from its band catching the eerie lights of the abandoned funhouse. <words>23</words>

She'd found the clover on her first smuggling job, a token of impossible luck that had kept her alive through countless reckless ventures across borders both geographical and legal. <words>47</words>

Standing at the entrance to "Madame Morgana's Hall of Infinite Reflections," Mira felt the familiar contradiction of calculated anxiety—her rationally emotional approach to danger that had become her trademark in the smuggling world. <words>75</words>

The funhouse loomed before her like the spot where her contraband map had torn during her escape from the authorities, dividing the known territories from the uncharted waters she now navigated. <words>103</words>

Three minutes until synchronization. <words>107</words>

The Ghost Riders were legendary among smugglers—an outsider group that operated with near-mythical efficiency, and tonight was her one chance to gain their acceptance. <words>131</words>

Mira had never met any of them in person; their distant companionship existed only through encrypted messages and dead drops, a relationship built on reputation rather than presence. <words>157</words>

The abandoned amusement park creaked around her, whispers of past revelry now transformed into something more sinister, more alive. <words>175</words>

Two minutes. <words>177</words>

She rehearsed her lines again, knowing she would need to dramatize her most impressive smuggling feats without seeming desperate—the Ghost Riders valued confidence above all. <words>201</words>

A strange jubilance filled her chest despite the despair that clung to this rotting place, a contradictory emotion that matched the bizarre test they'd designed for her. <words>228</words>

One minute. <words>230</words>

Somewhere in this funhouse, five other candidates waited at their assigned positions, strangers united by ambition and the synchronized watch alarms that would soon signal their collective audition. <words>256</words>

The rules were simple yet bizarre: when the alarms sounded, each candidate would begin performing their prepared monologue to the empty air, voices overlapping across the funhouse in a cacophony that the hidden Riders would somehow evaluate. <words>290</words>

Thirty seconds. <words>292</words>

Mira touched the glass-encased clover, remembering how she'd pressed it herself after finding it in the pocket of a dead courier—a man who'd failed the Ghost Riders' test years before. <words>323</words>

The funhouse mirrors began to shift subtly, though no one was touching them, reflecting versions of herself that seemed to move independently, watching her with hungry anticipation. <words>349</words>

Ten seconds. <words>351</words>

The haunted reputation of this place suddenly felt less like superstition and more like a warning as cold air brushed against her neck. <words>373</words>

Five seconds. <words>375</words>

Mira took a deep breath, understanding too late that the Ghost Riders might be named more literally than she'd assumed. <words>393</words>

The watches beeped in perfect unison throughout the funhouse, and Mira began her speech to an audience she couldn't see but could suddenly feel all around her, her voice joining the others in a performance that would determine not just her acceptance, but perhaps her survival. <words>437</words>

As she spoke, the glass containing her four-leaf clover cracked silently, luck finally running out at the threshold between the world she knew and the one she was desperately trying to enter. <words>468</words>
