Elias, the astute hermit of Glowcave, knew the water systems had failed again when the elevator arrived with a mournful ding to his empty floor. <words>21</words>

"Perfect timing, as always," he muttered, watching the doors slide open to reveal absolutely no one, just as the last drops from his faucet sputtered into nothingness. <words>43</words>

He shuffled to his workbench where a pair of blunt scissors lay beside his maintenance tools, tools he'd been using to fix the underground community's infrastructure for decades since everyone else had abandoned the cavern cathedral. <words>71</words>

The scissors were strangely effective despite their dullness, much like Elias himself—worn down but still functional in this forgotten place. <words>89</words>

"Another day in paradise," he chuckled darkly, his voice echoing through his home carved into the vast chamber where phosphorescent flora cast everything in an eerie blue-green glow. <words>113</words>

The plants seemed to amplify his solitude, their silent luminescence a constant reminder that they were his only companions. <words>129</words>

Elias hadn't always been alone; once, the cavern cathedral had housed hundreds, a thriving underground community that had slowly dwindled as the outside world became habitable again. <words>153</words>

He stayed behind, promising to maintain the systems for those who might return someday, though his hope diminished with each passing year. <words>174</words>

Today, however, something was different—the scent of a fresh loaf of bread wafted through his ventilation system, so incongruous with the musty, mineral smell of his surroundings that he nearly dropped his scissors. <words>203</words>

"Has my isolation finally driven me mad?" he wondered aloud, but the aroma persisted, seeming to amplify his long-dormant memories of community and warmth. <words>226</words>

Following the scent like a cartoon character floating on visible aroma waves, Elias found himself at the central water distribution hub, where—impossibly—a young woman sat cross-legged, tinkering with valves while a portable oven beside her produced that tantalizing smell. <words>262</words>

"You're real," he stated, more question than fact. <words>270</words>

"And you're the hermit everyone topside thinks is a myth," she replied, not looking up from her work. <words>286</words>

"I'm Mira, hydrological engineer, sent to figure out why the water recycling system keeps failing despite someone's—apparently your—strangely effective but ultimately temporary fixes." <words>310</words>

Elias stared, scissors still in hand, as she offered him a slice of bread. <words>323</words>

"Thought I might need bait to lure out whoever's been maintaining this place," she explained with a wry smile. <words>341</words>

"Bread... as bait," Elias repeated, accepting the slice with trembling fingers, the warmth of it almost shocking against his skin. <words>359</words>

"Worked, didn't it?" Mira shrugged. <words>365</words>

For the first time in years, Elias laughed genuinely, the sound strange to his own ears as it bounced off the glowing cavern walls. <words>387</words>

"I've been trying to restore these water systems alone for fifteen years," he said, "and you just waltz in with bread?" <words>407</words>

"Sometimes the simplest solutions are the most effective," she replied, patting the ground beside her. <words>421</words>

As Elias sat down, the elevator dinged again in the distance, and he realized with a mixture of despair and humor that his days of isolation were numbered—all because someone had thought to bring the scent of humanity back into his forgotten world. <words>462</words>
