Sir Aldric, a hope-worn knight, wandered through the floating library, his armor dulled by years of quests that never quite fulfilled their promise. <words>23</words>

The library drifted among clouds that separated the real world from the mythical, a boundary he had long sought to cross. <words>44</words>

In his palm, he clutched an ordinary seashell, unremarkable save for the whispers that sometimes emerged from its spiral depths when held to the ear at precisely midnight. <words>70</words>

The shell had been his companion for decades, a gift from a deeply superficial sorceress who collected beautiful men and discarded them once their novelty faded—she had kept him longest because of his earnest eyes. <words>104</words>

"The answers you seek lie where words swim free of their pages," she had told him with a laugh that sounded like breaking glass. <words>127</words>

Aldric moved through aisles of hovering books, their pages fluttering like the wings of paper birds, until he found himself before a faded fortune teller's booth tucked between shelves of forbidden astronomy and forgotten prayers. <words>161</words>

Faint notations covered the booth's wooden panels, equations and symbols that seemed to shift when viewed directly but remained still in peripheral vision. <words>184</words>

He began to read them aloud, his voice growing stronger with each arcane syllable, and as he did, the library around him began to seclude itself from the world, drawing inward like a sea anemone touched by a curious finger. <words>224</words>

The consistent miracles began small—a raindrop suspended in air, a book whose words rearranged themselves to answer unasked questions, the sound of his heartbeat echoing back from the future. <words>254</words>

Aldric continued reading, driven by his desire to escape the limitations of perception that had always made him feel trapped behind his own eyes, unable to truly see the world as it was rather than as he was taught to perceive it. <words>294</words>

The shell in his hand grew warm, then hot, then cold as winter stars, and began to sing in a voice that was neither male nor female but somehow both and neither. <words>326</words>

The song told of worlds within worlds, of realities folded like origami, of truths that could only be understood by forgetting everything one knew. <words>350</words>

Aldric felt joyful agony as his mind expanded beyond its boundaries, pain and ecstasy indistinguishable as new understandings flooded in. <words>371</words>

The knight who had sought meaning in quests and battles now found it in surrender, in allowing himself to become part of the story rather than its hero. <words>398</words>

As the final notation was read, Aldric and the shell and the booth all dissolved into letters that floated upward to join the books, no longer separate from the knowledge they had sought but woven into its very fabric, finally understanding that the boundary between real and myth existed only in the minds of those who believed in such divisions. <words>456</words>
