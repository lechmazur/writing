Enzo traced his fingers along the dusty shelves of the forgotten library nestled in the ancient treehouse, his conviction as a dream thief still fresh in his mind. <words>24</words>

The sentence had been harsh—fifteen years banned from entering others' dreamscapes—but what else could society expect when the last human child had been born and dreams became the final frontier of originality? <words>53</words>

He clutched the flimsy photo album he'd discovered wedged between mathematical textbooks that had always confounded him, numbers swimming before his eyes like minnows he could never catch. <words>78</words>

"Seven plus nine is..." he muttered, then shook his head in frustration, abandoning the calculation as he had countless times before. <words>97</words>

The album's pages crackled as he opened it, revealing photographs of strangers playing basketball, their faces alight with joy beneath a sky that still knew how to rumble with thunder. <words>124</words>

Enzo had been obsessed with coaxing thunder from the now-silent skies ever since the weather patterns had stabilized to an eerie, cloudless constant after the population decline. <words>149</words>

His fingers trembled with quiet mania as he studied each photograph, recognizing fragments of himself in the players' expressions—the determination in one's eyes, the sly smile of another, the contemplative frown of a third. <words>181</words>

He had stolen dreams of basketball games where thunder accompanied every dunk, where rain baptized the players in moments of transcendent play, where the fragmented pieces of his identity seemed to coalesce into something whole. <words>215</words>

The treehouse library creaked around him, branches swaying in a wind that carried no moisture, no promise of storms. <words>233</words>

Enzo carefully removed a photograph from the album—five players mid-jump, suspended in time beneath dark clouds—and pinned it to the wooden wall beside his makeshift bed. <words>260</words>

"I know you," he whispered to the faces, "I've been inside your dreams, felt your love for the game, stolen the echoes of thunder that followed your victories." <words>287</words>

He reached for his dream-thieving apparatus, illegal but impossible to confiscate as it existed partly in his mind, and prepared to plunge once more into the collective unconscious of humanity. <words>316</words>

This time would be different; instead of stealing, he would give—reconstructing the fragmented dreams of basketball enthusiasts into a unified vision powerful enough to disturb the atmosphere. <words>343</words>

The mathematical impossibility of his plan didn't deter him; he'd never understood probabilities anyway, operating instead on intuition and desperate hope. <words>364</words>

As night fell, Enzo activated his apparatus, feeling his consciousness splinter and dive into thousands of dreaming minds connected by their shared love of basketball. <words>388</words>

He gathered fragments of thunder-dreams, weaving them together with the precision his mathematically challenged mind could never achieve in waking life. <words>408</words>

Hours later, as dawn broke, Enzo awoke to the first distant rumble heard in decades, his fragmented self momentarily whole as the impossible sound reverberated through the treehouse library. <words>435</words>

Outside, clouds gathered for the first time since the last human's birth, dark and pregnant with possibility, drawn by the collective dreaming of basketball games played beneath stormy skies. <words>464</words>

Enzo smiled, his quiet mania temporarily satisfied, knowing that sometimes it takes a thief to return what the world has lost—even if that thief remains forever fragmented, forever mathematically challenged, forever seeking wholeness in the dreams of others. <words>500</words>
