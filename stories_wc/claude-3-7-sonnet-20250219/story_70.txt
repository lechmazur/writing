Bartholomew hunched over his desk, meticulously transcribing the witch's recipes with perfectly measured strokes, his quill scratching against parchment with mechanical precision. <words>21</words>

The greenhouse glass distorted the view of the cemetery hill outside, tombstones tilting like crooked teeth against the evening sky. <words>39</words>

"Precision is paramount," he muttered to himself, a mantra that had served him well as the most sought-after scribe in three counties, though it had left little room for human connection. <words>65</words>

On his desk sat a curious object—a prototype light bulb from Tesla's workshop—gifted to him by the witch as payment for his services, its filament curled like a question mark inside the glass. <words>97</words>

Bartholomew was certainly uncertain about this payment; he preferred coins to curiosities, order to enigmas, and yet something about the bulb's gentle glow pulled at him. <words>123</words>

The witch had instructed him to examine it closely when the time was right, whatever that meant. <words>139</words>

As he worked, cataloguing the witch's knowledge of herbs that heal and harm, he noticed an envelope on the floor—one he'd missed during his meticulous cleaning earlier. <words>167</words>

It had been opened, its seal broken, but something about it called to him with the same pull as the bulb. <words>187</words>

By analyzing the leftover adhesive from the once-sealed envelope, rubbing it between his fingers and bringing it to his nose, Bartholomew detected a familiar scent—lavender and ash—the signature of his estranged sister. <words>219</words>

His heart quickened as he extracted the letter, eyes scanning her words about their mother's illness, her plea for reconciliation, her need for his help. <words>243</words>

The bulb suddenly flared, illuminating the greenhouse with impossible brightness, causing shadows to dance across the rows of mysterious plants and the gravestones beyond. <words>266</words>

"What sorcery is this?" he tried to whisper, but instead found himself bellowing the words, his voice echoing among the glass walls and startling dormant birds from the eaves. <words>295</words>

In that moment, like a puzzle piece finally fitting into place, Bartholomew understood the witch's payment—not a curiosity but a catalyst for the quiet transformation he had resisted for so long. <words>327</words>

The light revealed not just the greenhouse but the reflection of his own face, rigid with years of self-imposed rules and distance. <words>349</words>

He saw himself as others must—cold, precise, untouchable—and for the first time, felt the weight of his isolation. <words>369</words>

Tears welled in his eyes as he clutched the letter to his chest, the bulb's glow softening as if responding to his emotion. <words>391</words>

Bartholomew realized that his quest for perfection had been a shield, a way to cradle empathy in arms of steel, protecting himself from the messy vulnerability of human connection. <words>422</words>

As dawn broke over the cemetery hill, painting the gravestones in gentle gold, Bartholomew carefully packed his quills and inks, tucked his sister's letter into his pocket, and cradled Tesla's bulb in his hands. <words>454</words>

He stepped out of the witch's greenhouse with a new purpose, his rigid posture slightly softened, carrying with him the buried optimism that perhaps it wasn't too late to rewrite the most important story of all—his own. <words>492</words>
