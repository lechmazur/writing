Elias dabbed his brush against the canvas, his bloodshot eyes twitching from another sleepless night. <words>14</words>

The arboreal workshop swayed gently among the giant mushrooms, their bioluminescent glow providing just enough light for his work. <words>32</words>

He'd been painting faces for decades—smiling faces that hid the truth he alone could see. <words>47</words>

Behind the painted smiles lurked secrets, whispers of a world most couldn't comprehend. <words>59</words>

His latest commission sat before him: a portrait of the town's beloved schoolteacher, her expression serene yet somehow false. <words>76</words>

Elias reached for his tea, knocking over his most treasured possession—a tapered wizard's hat with a bullet hole through its center. <words>95</words>

The hat had belonged to his mentor, the only other person who understood the peacefully chaotic nature of reality that Elias struggled to capture in his art. <words>119</words>

"Almost dawn," he muttered, setting down his brush and moving to the window where the first hint of morning light reminded him of the hush of an empty classroom at first light. <words>147</words>

That's when the visions were strongest—when the world held its breath between night and day. <words>163</words>

Elias had discovered his gift by accident, by scrying in puddles after midnight during a particularly brutal bout of insomnia. <words>182</words>

The reflections showed him truths: the smiles people wore versus the shadows they carried. <words>196</words>

Tonight was different though; tonight he would finally devour the knowledge he'd been seeking for years. <words>212</words>

The final obstacle stood between him and understanding why his paintings sometimes came true. <words>226</words>

He placed the wizard's hat upon his head, feeling a frolicsome regret as he remembered his mentor's warning: "See too much truth and you'll never sleep again." <words>250</words>

Rain had pooled on the broad mushroom cap outside his window, forming a perfect mirror. <words>265</words>

Elias leaned out, his reflection distorted by ripples, the bullet hole in the hat aligned perfectly with his third eye. <words>283</words>

The schoolteacher's portrait behind him seemed to shift, her painted smile deepening as dawn's first rays touched the canvas. <words>301</words>

"Show me," he whispered to the puddle, watching as images formed: children with hollow eyes, the schoolteacher's smile hiding centuries of something ancient and hungry. <words>324</words>

His paintbrush had been capturing truths he wasn't ready to face, but to outlast the final obstacle—his own fear—he needed to see completely. <words>347</words>

The puddle's surface broke into fractals of light, each reflecting a different timeline, a different outcome. <words>363</words>

Elias gasped as understanding flooded his consciousness; his insomnia wasn't a curse but a protection—sleep would have made him vulnerable to what lurked behind the smiles. <words>389</words>

As first light fully illuminated his workshop, Elias picked up his brush with newfound purpose. <words>404</words>

He would paint the truth now, not just the shadows behind the smiles, but the light that could dispel them. <words>423</words>

The wizard's hat sat firmly on his head as he worked, the bullet hole a reminder that knowledge comes at a price—one he was finally ready to pay. <words>450</words>

In the peacefully chaotic dance of light and shadow, Elias found his answer: he wasn't meant to sleep, but to keep watch while others dreamed, guarding them with each stroke of his brush. <words>482</words>
