Jace checked his quantum tunnel badge for the thousandth time, the weathered fishing lure dangling from its lanyard—his father's last gift before the accident. <words>21</words>

"Tunnel shift begins in three minutes," announced the automated system as Jace positioned his paramedic kit beside the temporal stabilization chamber. <words>39</words>

He'd lived this day four hundred and thirty-seven times now, each loop resetting by the sound of a single raindrop that only he could hear—always at the bell's echo marking a forgotten recess in the elementary school across from the quantum facility. <words>73</words>

The time loops had begun after the incident, when he'd failed to save that family of four despite his best efforts—their faces permanently etched into his consciousness like privately public wounds that everyone could see but no one acknowledged. <words>107</words>

"Just another exciting day in the most boring job in the multiverse," Jace muttered with the excited boredom of someone who knew exactly what emergencies would occur and when. <words>132</words>

He would save seventeen lives today, but lose the one that mattered—the little girl with pigtails whose quantum signature kept fragmenting no matter what medical intervention he attempted. <words>159</words>

Dr. Eliza Chen entered the chamber, her lab coat pristine as always. <words>170</words>

"You look like you've seen this ghost before," she remarked, noticing his thousand-yard stare. <words>183</words>

"Just nesting in my thoughts," Jace replied, fingering the fishing lure as the quantum tunnel hummed to life, its blue-white energy illuminating their faces. <words>205</words>

What Dr. Chen didn't know—couldn't know—was that Jace had spent hundreds of loops trying to save everyone, until his therapist in loop three hundred and twelve had suggested a different approach: to baptize your nightmares in acceptance rather than fight the inevitable. <words>245</words>

The tunnel activated, and the first emergency call came through—a researcher with temporal displacement sickness. <words>260</words>

As Jace worked, his mind drifted to his unhealed traumas, the ones that kept him locked in this endless cycle—his father's drowning, the family he couldn't save, and the little girl he would lose again today. <words>294</words>

Perhaps acceptance wasn't about giving up but understanding that some wounds were meant to change you rather than heal completely. <words>313</words>

The day unfolded exactly as it had hundreds of times before—sixteen successful rescues, leading to the seventeenth call, the one with the little girl. <words>337</words>

This time, instead of frantically trying every procedure, Jace held her hand as her quantum signature faded, whispering, "It's okay to let go." <words>359</words>

When the school bell rang across the street, marking the end of a recess no one remembered, Jace closed his eyes, waiting for the raindrop that would reset everything. <words>386</words>

But the raindrop didn't come. <words>391</words>

Instead, the little girl's quantum signature stabilized, her eyes fluttering open as she whispered, "I saw your dad—he said it wasn't your fault." <words>414</words>

Jace's breath caught as he realized his acceptance had somehow broken the loop—that by nesting in his pain rather than fighting it, he had finally found a way forward. <words>444</words>

The weathered fishing lure gleamed in the quantum light as if brand new, and for the first time in four hundred and thirty-seven identical days, Jace had no idea what would happen next—and that uncertainty felt remarkably like hope. <words>483</words>
