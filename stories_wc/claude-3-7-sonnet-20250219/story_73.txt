Miguel's shovel bit into the earth with practiced precision, his movements as steady as the heartbeat of the ancient Aztec temple he now served. <words>21</words>

The once-sacred site had been reimagined as a cultural center, its stone steps and carved serpents now illuminated by electric lights rather than ceremonial fires, but Miguel maintained the grounds with the same reverence the original priests might have shown. <words>65</words>

He paused, wiping sweat from his brow as he felt the familiar sensation of worlds overlapping—the present moment thinning until he could almost glimpse the temple's glorious past through the veil of centuries. <words>97</words>

"I see them too," came a voice behind him, breaking the raucous silence that had enveloped the dig site since the director's sudden confession that morning about the temple's imminent closure due to funding cuts. <words>131</words>

Miguel turned to find Professor Alvarez standing there, her vintage magnifying glass dangling from a chain around her neck, her eyes fixed on the freshly turned soil where Miguel had been preparing a ceremonial garden bed. <words>167</words>

"The spirits don't want this place to change again," Miguel said, his voice barely audible through the hush of wind passing a broken fence line that separated the temple grounds from the encroaching city beyond. <words>204</words>

The professor nodded, her academic skepticism momentarily suspended in the strange energy that permeated the air during the hush that follows a sudden confession—that moment when truth hangs naked and vulnerable before being clothed in explanation or excuse. <words>245</words>

"I've dedicated my life to preserving the ritual practices of your ancestors," she said, her tone diligently whimsical as she attempted to lighten the weight of their shared concern. <words>274</words>

Miguel smiled despite himself; the professor had always had a way of kindrelizing people—drawing them into a sense of familial connection with both the past and each other—a talent as rare as it was valuable in their work of cultural preservation. <words>318</words>

"Perhaps," Miguel suggested, leaning on his shovel, "we could invite the board members here at dusk, when the alignment of the sun makes the serpent shadow climb the steps, just as it did a thousand years ago." <words>358</words>

Professor Alvarez lifted her magnifying glass, studying the intricate carvings on a nearby column as if they might hold the answer. <words>377</words>

"Yes," she finally said, "let them feel what we feel—let them stand where worlds overlap and understand why this place must be protected." <words>403</words>

As if in agreement, the wind picked up again, carrying dust and whispers through the broken fence line, and Miguel returned to his digging with renewed purpose, each thrust of the shovel a promise to the past that its stories would continue to be told. <words>450</words>

In the distance, the city hummed with progress, but here, in this pocket of preserved time, Miguel the gravedigger prepared not for death but for rebirth, turning the soil that would nourish new growth while honoring ancient roots. <words>492</words>
