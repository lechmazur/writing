Elias strummed his lute with fingers that no longer believed in the music they created. <words>14</words>

The black velvet sky-lounge floated serenely above the endless city, its transparent floor revealing a tapestry of lights that stretched beyond comprehension. <words>34</words>

His broken watch band dangled from his wrist, the timepiece itself still ticking away seconds that meant nothing in this place where night never yielded to dawn. <words>58</words>

"You've crossed the line again," said Madame Vex, the lounge's owner, her voice carrying the weight of drawn boundaries that Elias had violated once too often. <words>82</words>

"My performance was subjectively rational," he replied with practiced indifference, though dismay pooled in his stomach like cold lead. <words>100</words>

The patrons of the sky-lounge—shadowy figures sipping iridescent cocktails—had not appreciated his latest ballad about the mortality that awaited them all below. <words>123</words>

Madame Vex slid a stack of old polaroid photographs across the obsidian table. <words>135</words>

"Excavate the truth from these if you wish to stay," she said, her laconic exuberance somehow more threatening than anger would have been. <words>155</words>

The photographs showed the sky-lounge in earlier incarnations, floating above cities that no longer existed, filled with patrons whose fashions spoke of decades long past. <words>180</words>

Amid garden secrets—for the lounge had once housed a magnificent suspended garden—Elias spent the night studying the polaroids, noticing how the city below changed while the lounge remained constant. <words>209</words>

He realized that the sky-lounge wasn't merely floating; it was traveling, drifting through time as well as space. <words>227</words>

By morning—though there was no true morning here, only a slightly brighter quality to the perpetual night—Elias had begun to draw a map of an endless night, charting the lounge's journey across centuries. <words>258</words>

The photographs revealed patterns: the lounge appeared during times of great upheaval, collecting souls who sought escape. <words>275</words>

His fingers, now steady with purpose, traced constellations between different eras, different cities, different patrons. <words>290</words>

When Madame Vex returned, Elias presented his findings without flourish. <words>300</words>

"You've mapped our course," she observed, genuine surprise flickering across her ageless face. <words>312</words>

"And discovered why my music disturbs your patrons," Elias added. <words>322</words>

They were all like him—lost souls, travelers between moments, their journeys interrupted by the lounge's gravitational pull. <words>340</words>

"They don't fear death," he explained. "They fear being forgotten in the endless night." <words>354</words>

Madame Vex studied his map, then nodded slowly. <words>362</words>

"Play for them again tonight," she commanded. "But this time, play the songs of their homes, their times. Remind them of where they came from." <words>389</words>

That evening, Elias took the stage with his mended watch band—fixed with a thread from the ancient garden—and played melodies excavated from the photographs. <words>415</words>

As notes filled the velvet darkness, patrons recognized fragments of their pasts, and for the first time, the endless city below seemed less like a void and more like a tapestry of possibilities. <words>445</words>

In his subjectively rational way, the once-dismayed minstrel had found his true purpose: not to entertain, but to navigate, using music to draw boundaries between then and now, here and there, lost and found. <words>479</words>

And as the sky-lounge drifted onward through the endless night, Elias continued to map their journey, one song at a time. <words>500</words>
