Ezra stood at the edge of the lunar crater, his prophecies weighing on him like the artificial gravity that kept the colony's inhabitants from floating away. <words>23</words>

He clutched his collection of marbles, cracked from years of handling and the harsh lunar environment, each one representing a future he had foreseen but felt increasingly uncertain about. <words>46</words>

"The final oath approaches," he whispered to himself, his voice a mixture of dread and relief that characterized his happily sad existence as the colony's reluctant seer. <words>69</words>

The mining colony sprawled below him, its domes glittering under Earth's distant light, housing three thousand souls who both revered and avoided him. <words>90</words>

Ezra's visions came to him between heartbeats—that infinitesimal pause when time seemed to stretch and the universe revealed its secrets in flashes too brief for most to comprehend. <words>116</words>

Today's vision had been the clearest yet: to defragment reality itself, to rearrange the cosmic order that had grown too rigid, too predictable. <words>137</words>

He needed to scramble the cosmic scoreboard, reset the tally of fates that had been unfairly distributed across the galaxy. <words>155</words>

With bashful arrogance, Ezra had accepted his role—knowing he was unworthy yet uniquely qualified for this task that no one else could understand. <words>177</words>

The solution had come to him yesterday while rummaging through discarded items at the colony's monthly sale—a box containing pieces of ancient jigsaw puzzles, their edges worn but still holding the power to connect disparate realities. <words>210</words>

"Fragments to defragment," he murmured, carefully arranging his cracked marbles alongside the puzzle pieces on the lunar dust. <words>226</words>

Each marble contained a prophecy; each puzzle piece represented a potential path; together, they formed a map that only Ezra could read. <words>246</words>

The colonists watched from a distance as their ambivalent prophet worked, his fingers moving with surprising grace for someone who typically stumbled through social interactions. <words>269</words>

As Ezra connected the final puzzle edge to its mate, he felt the universe hold its breath—that space between heartbeats expanding into an eternal moment. <words>293</words>

"I take this final oath," he declared to the vacuum around him, "to unmake what has been wrongly made, to rebalance what has been unfairly weighted." <words>317</words>

The marbles began to glow, their cracks sealing as they absorbed the pattern of the completed puzzle beneath them. <words>335</words>

In that suspended moment, Ezra felt both immense power and humbling insignificance—the perfect balance needed for one who would dare to rewrite cosmic rules. <words>359</words>

The mining colony's alarms suddenly blared, but Ezra knew they weren't warnings—they were acknowledgments of a fundamental shift beginning to ripple outward from this dusty lunar surface. <words>386</words>

He smiled, a tear escaping down his cheek, as the marbles rose and orbited around him like tiny planets around a reluctant sun. <words>407</words>

"It is done," he whispered, watching as reality began to reassemble itself according to fairer principles, the cosmic scoreboard now scrambled beyond recognition. <words>429</words>

And in the heartbeat that followed—the first of a new cosmic order—Ezra the prophet finally found peace in the ambivalence that had defined him, knowing that his uncertainty had been the very quality that allowed him to see beyond the rigid boundaries of fate. <words>470</words>
