Vex stood motionless in the abandoned spaceport customs office, his hand hovering over the hilt of his ceremonial blade. <words>17</words>

The maggoty wooden chest that rattled on the dusty counter before him was the last remnant of his father's legacy. <words>36</words>

Amid the hum of server rooms that still functioned despite the station's abandonment, Vex's face remained impassive, a mask perfected through years of competitive dueling. <words>59</words>

His reputation as the cheerless duelist had spread across seventeen systems, but no victory had filled the void his father's betrayal had carved. <words>81</words>

The chest rattled again, as if impatient with his hesitation. <words>91</words>

"I didn't come here for reconciliation," Vex muttered to the empty room, his voice barely audible above the electronic drone. <words>109</words>

Yet his grandmother's final message had been clear: "Your fatal flaws mirror his—pride disguised as principle, anger masquerading as justice." <words>129</words>

With reluctant fingers, Vex unlocked the chest, revealing not the expected valuables but a collection of data crystals and a handwritten cookbook. <words>149</words>

The first crystal contained footage of his father in this very office, working tirelessly on precisely innovative modifications to the family's shipping business. <words>171</words>

The second showed the trial where Vex's testimony had condemned his father to exile, the older man's eyes not filled with hatred but understanding. <words>195</words>

Vex activated the third crystal with trembling hands, watching as his father, alone in a small kitchen, attempted to recreate his wife's—Vex's mother's—recipes after her death. <words>223</words>

"I try to elasticize the dough just as she did," his father's recorded voice explained to no one, "but my hands lack her gentleness." <words>246</words>

For hours, Vex sat cross-legged on the cold floor, watching his father's culinary failures and small triumphs through unexpected mutations of family recipes, each attempt accompanied by stories meant for a son who refused to listen. <words>281</words>

The final recording showed his father, visibly aged, writing in the cookbook that now lay in Vex's lap. <words>299</words>

"I've modified these recipes as I've had to modify my life without you both," his father said. <words>316</words>

"Some improvements, some disasters—like the business decisions that cost us everything—but each attempt honest." <words>331</words>

Dawn light filtered through the grimy windows of the customs office as Vex closed the cookbook, understanding at last that his father's innovations had never been malicious, merely desperate. <words>361</words>

The chest rattled one final time, revealing a false bottom containing a letter addressed simply: "When you're ready to forgive—or need forgiveness yourself." <words>386</words>

Vex tucked the cookbook under his arm and lifted the chest, its weight somehow lighter now. <words>402</words>

As he stepped out of the spaceport that had witnessed both his family's rise and fall, Vex felt something unfamiliar stretch within him—not the practiced extension of a duelist's lunge, but the tentative elasticity of a heart learning, at last, the power of forgiveness. <words>448</words>
