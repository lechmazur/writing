Dr. Eliza Swarm, the facility's hive-mind therapist, tapped her fingers against the desk as she studied the recruit's psychological profile. <words>17</words>

The scuffed phone charger plug dangling from the wall was the only personal item the young agent had brought to their session, a curious choice that spoke volumes about attachment issues. <words>42</words>

"Do you hear it?" she asked, her six voices overlapping in that uniformly peculiar way that unnerved most first-timers at the secret agent training facility. <words>64</words>

"Hear what?" Agent Mercer replied, glancing nervously at the candle burning between them. <words>76</words>

"The sound of hindsight—it's quite distinctive once you learn to recognize it," Dr. Swarm said, her collective consciousness drawing from thousands of therapy sessions simultaneously. <words>98</words>

The wax began to drain from the candle, forming intricate patterns on the metal plate below that only Dr. Swarm's compound eyes could properly interpret. <words>122</words>

Through the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes, she could read the subconscious fears that Mercer himself couldn't articulate. <words>142</words>

"Your mission tomorrow will fail if you don't confront what happened in Budapest," all six voices stated with merry bitterness, a tone that had become her trademark among the agents. <words>169</words>

The night air seeped through the partially open window, carrying with it the weight of anticipation that always preceded major operations at the facility. <words>192</words>

"I've been trying to forget Budapest," Mercer admitted, watching as another drop of wax fell, creating what looked like a tiny handgun. <words>213</words>

Dr. Swarm nodded her six heads in perfect synchrony and replied, "That's precisely why you're here on the eve of what could be a bold discovery for the agency." <words>240</words>

Her motivation wasn't simply to clear him for duty—it was to anchor the ephemeral in reality, to make concrete the wisps of trauma that clouded his judgment. <words>269</words>

"Watch the wax," she instructed, her voices now a harmonious whisper that somehow cut through the silence more effectively than a shout. <words>290</words>

As the night deepened around the facility, the candle continued its cryptic communication, each drip revealing another fragment of Mercer's fractured memory. <words>313</words>

"I see it now," he whispered, transfixed by the pattern that had formed—a perfect replica of the bridge where he'd lost his partner. <words>337</words>

Dr. Swarm felt the collective satisfaction of breakthrough ripple through her shared consciousness. <words>350</words>

"Tomorrow's mission requires you to return to a similar bridge," she explained, "and your hesitation would be fatal—not just to you, but to everyone depending on you." <words>379</words>

Mercer reached for his scuffed charger plug, a talisman of sorts that had kept him connected to the present when memories threatened to pull him under. <words>405</words>

"I'm ready," he said with newfound clarity, as the final drop of wax sealed the coded message that only Dr. Swarm and now Mercer could understand. <words>430</words>

Through the night air on the eve of this bold discovery, Agent Mercer had finally heard the sound of hindsight—it was the quiet drip of wax, the whisper of six voices in unison, and the promise that the past, once faced, loses its power to haunt. <words>478</words>
