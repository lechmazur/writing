Elias stood at the edge of the Event Horizon Deck, watching tourists float in zero-G pools beneath the observation dome of Black Hole Resort. <words>21</words>

His uniform badge read "Security," but he preferred "mild-tempered guard"—a job that required little more than directing lost guests and occasionally confiscating contraband souvenirs. <words>43</words>

The resort orbited just beyond the safe threshold of Sagittarius A*, offering wealthy patrons the ultimate thrill: gazing into absolute darkness while sipping cocktails named after theoretical physics concepts. <words>67</words>

Elias checked his watch—two hours until his shift ended and he could join the evening bike rides through the rotating habitat ring, where artificial gravity created perfect cycling conditions. <words>93</words>

But something had been bothering him lately: a feeling like an unraveling thread in the fabric of his carefully constructed life. <words>113</words>

It started three weeks ago when he discovered a blacksmith's anvil in maintenance bay four—an impossible object that shouldn't exist on a space station where every gram of cargo cost a fortune to transport. <words>145</words>

The anvil bore strange markings that seemed to shift when he wasn't looking directly at them, its surface impossibly cold despite the forge-like heat of the maintenance bay. <words>171</words>

Management had divided staff into two categories: those who reported anomalies and those who ignored them for career advancement—a false dichotomy of hero or villain that Elias refused to accept. <words>198</words>

Instead, he chose a third path that began with a simple observation: the station's stray cats—brought aboard as pest control—seemed drawn to the anvil during their prowls. <words>225</words>

So Elias began following them through service alleyways during his breaks, documenting their movements in his journal with poetically bland descriptions that wouldn't trigger the AI censors monitoring staff communications. <words>253</words>

"Gray tabby proceeds counterclockwise through Deck 7 junction, pauses at maintenance hatch 12B," he wrote, disguising his investigation as routine security logs. <words>275</words>

The cats led him to discover hidden doors, rooms missing from official blueprints, and staff members who moved with uncanny precision—their faces familiar yet somehow wrong. <words>300</words>

Tonight, amid bike rides circling the habitat ring, Elias would finally confront what he'd pieced together: the resort wasn't orbiting a black hole—it was slowly being consumed by one, time stretching differently in various sections. <words>333</words>

The realization brought not terror but a savage bliss—the clarity of finally understanding why maintenance crews aged faster than guests, why certain corridors seemed longer on return journeys, why the cats yowled at empty corners. <words>366</words>

Elias patted his pocket containing a small fragment chipped from the anvil, its weight reassuring as he prepared to share his discovery with the only other person he trusted—Chef Lina, who had noticed her soufflés rising at different rates depending on which kitchen she used. <words>406</words>

Together they would navigate this cosmic deception, not as whistleblowers or collaborators, but as curious observers documenting the beautiful physics of their slow dissolution into singularity. <words>430</words>

As the artificial sunset program began its daily display, Elias smiled at the irony: guests paid fortunes to observe a black hole from a safe distance, never suspecting they were already part of its embrace. <words>462</words>
