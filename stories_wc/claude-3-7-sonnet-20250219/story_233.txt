Elias had never meant to become a summoner, but the ancient tome found in his grandmother's attic had practically opened itself to him. <words>21</words>

The incantation slipped from his lips before he understood what he was doing, and suddenly, the air shimmered with peculiarly virtual particles that seemed both present and not. <words>45</words>

In his hand appeared a small piece of a broken statue, a fragment of marble finger pointing accusingly at nothing. <words>63</words>

"You have been chosen," whispered a voice that seemed to emanate from the stone itself, "to elevate what has been forgotten." <words>82</words>

Elias blinked, wondering if this was some elaborate hallucination occurring between commercials of the late-night show he'd been watching. <words>101</words>

The voice continued, "Bring this fragment to the Obsidian Circle through rumor-charged midnight gatherings where the veil between worlds thins." <words>120</words>

Over the following weeks, Elias found himself drawn to whispered conversations in coffee shops, catching fragments about a secret society that met when the moon was highest. <words>144</words>

His naivety made him an unlikely candidate for such clandestine affairs, yet the fragment in his pocket grew warmer with each new piece of information he gathered. <words>170</words>

When finally he received an unmarked envelope containing only an address and a time, Elias felt the seeds of understanding beginning to sprout within his mind. <words>195</words>

The building was unremarkable, but beneath it lay a treasure vault of the secret society, walls lined with artifacts similar to his fragment, each humming with quiet power. <words>223</words>

"You've brought the Seer's Finger," said an elderly woman with eyes that held a distant warmth, like stars offering comfort across the void of space. <words>246</words>

She explained that the broken statue, once whole, had been a conduit between realms, shattered when the last great summoner attempted to reach too far. <words>271</words>

"Your task," she said, placing her weathered hands over his, "is to hum a lullaby loud enough to be heard by fate itself." <words>293</words>

Elias laughed nervously, "I can barely carry a tune." <words>301</words>

"It's not about musical talent," she replied, guiding him to a circular platform at the center of the vault. <words>319</words>

As midnight approached, the society members gathered around him, their combined energy creating a resonance that made the fragment vibrate against his palm. <words>342</words>

They began to hum, a melody that seemed both ancient and newborn, and Elias closed his eyes, allowing the sound to flow through him. <words>365</words>

The piece of broken statue rose from his hand, suspended in the air as other fragments emerged from their displays to join it. <words>387</words>

As the lullaby reached its crescendo, the statue reassembled itself—a perfect figure of a child sleeping peacefully—and in that moment, Elias understood that they weren't summoning something to their world, but rather soothing the nightmares of another. <words>427</words>

The distant warmth he felt wasn't just from the society members surrounding him, but from countless beings across dimensions who could finally rest, their chaotic energies no longer seeping into our reality. <words>458</words>

Elias, no longer quite so naive, smiled as the statue gently lowered itself onto a pedestal, its purpose fulfilled not through grand magic, but through the simple, powerful act of offering comfort across the boundaries of existence. <words>495</words>
