Jasper had always been a naive gambler, betting his meager research stipend on the most absurd odds, convinced that fate would eventually smile upon him. <words>21</words>

The tidal power monitoring station where he worked was rarely predictable, its rhythms dictated by lunar cycles and storm patterns that defied even the most sophisticated forecasting models. <words>43</words>

He'd dock his small boat at the platform each evening, just as the sun disappeared beneath the horizon, leaving him alone with the hum of turbines and the gentle rocking of the ocean. <words>71</words>

It was during one of these candlelit dinners—necessitated by the station's perpetually failing electrical system—that Professor Hargrove first appeared, soaking wet and wild-eyed at precisely midnight. <words>97</words>

"The ocean knows your debts," she'd announced, water dripping from her lab coat as she launched into the first of what would become a series of rebellious midnight lectures by unhinged professors who had once worked at the station. <words>131</words>

They came to him, one by one, night after night, their faces illuminated by the flickering light of candles Jasper had begun crafting using an old rustic candle mold he'd discovered in a storage locker. <words>163</words>

The professors spoke of unspoken bargains between humanity and the sea, of energy harvested and consequences ignored, their words flowing with a manic intensity that left Jasper both terrified and enthralled. <words>193</words>

"They fired me when I tried to warn them," Professor Chen had whispered, laughing through tears as he described the anomalies in the tidal data, patterns that suggested something ancient was stirring below. <words>223</words>

Jasper began recording these lectures, transcribing them by candlelight, understanding with growing clarity that these weren't hallucinations but warnings delivered via rebellious midnight lectures by unhinged professors who had glimpsed something terrible. <words>254</words>

The candles he molded grew stranger—infused with seawater and algae—burning with an eerie blue flame that seemed to calm the professors, allowing their fractured minds to focus long enough to impart their knowledge. <words>287</words>

His gambling habits transformed; instead of cards or dice, he now bet on which professor would appear, what secrets they might reveal, the stakes no longer money but understanding. <words>315</words>

When the station manager discovered his transcripts, Jasper was given twenty-four hours to vacate, but he knew he couldn't leave—not yet. <words>335</words>

That night, as he prepared his final candlelit dinner at the station, all five professors appeared simultaneously, their eyes reflecting the blue flames as they spoke in unison: "It rises tonight." <words>366</words>

Jasper felt the platform shudder beneath him, watched as the monitoring equipment registered impossible energy spikes, and understood that his presence here—his willingness to listen—had been part of an unspoken bargain all along. <words>398</words>

As the massive form rose from the depths, illuminated by moonlight and the blue glow of his candles, Jasper smiled, finally comprehending his role: to capture one last spark before oblivion, to bear witness to the sea reclaiming what humanity had borrowed. <words>438</words>

He raised his glass in a final toast to the professors who stood with him at the edge of the platform, their laughter mixing with tears as the wave approached—not in fear, but in the profound relief of a burden finally shared. <words>476</words>
