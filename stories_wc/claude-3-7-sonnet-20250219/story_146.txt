Madame Zephyr fingered the bone flute nervously, her reputation as a charlatan weighing heavily on her conscience. <words>15</words>

She had never meant to deceive anyone, but people paid better for theatrical predictions than for the truth of her actual visions. <words>36</words>

The flute had called to her when she'd gotten lost in Prague last autumn, drawing her down a narrow alley to an antiquarian shop where the proprietor claimed it had been discovered in a forgotten crypt beneath the city. <words>70</words>

"This belonged to someone who spoke with spirits," he had told her, his eyes glinting with knowledge that made her uncomfortable. <words>89</words>

Now, sitting in the hushed atmosphere of the Extinct Language Archive, Madame Zephyr felt a peaceful anger stirring within her—peaceful in its certainty, angry in its intensity. <words>116</words>

She regularly visited the archive, though seldom during its public hours, preferring the quiet of early morning when she could explore the ancient texts without interruption. <words>142</words>

Throughout the planting season, she had been coming here, drawn by visions of symbols that matched those etched into the bone flute. <words>164</words>

Her fingers traced the markings as Professor Harlow placed another tome before her. <words>176</words>

"These symbols appear in only one known text," he whispered, his academic excitement barely contained. <words>190</words>

"A language dead for three millennia, yet here it is on an artifact carbon-dated to just five hundred years ago." <words>209</words>

Madame Zephyr nodded, not telling him that in her visions, she understood every word. <words>223</words>

She had taken chances before—claiming to read fortunes when she couldn't, touching objects that sent shockwaves of premonition through her body—but nothing compared to the risk of what she was about to do. <words>256</words>

Raising the flute to her lips, she blew gently, producing a sound like wind through ancient stones. <words>273</words>

The professor froze, his eyes widening as the symbols in the book began to glow with a soft blue light. <words>292</words>

"How did you—" he began, but she was already lost in the vision, seeing the creators of this language, understanding their purpose. <words>314</words>

They had developed these symbols not as mere communication but as a sacred technology, a way to bend reality through sound and intention. <words>337</words>

"I need to study this," she said finally, lowering the flute. <words>347</words>

"Not as a fraud, not as a performer, but as what I truly am—a conduit." <words>363</words>

Professor Harlow stared at her, then slowly nodded. <words>371</words>

"All these years cataloging dead languages, and I never considered they might be waiting for the right voice to speak them again." <words>393</words>

Madame Zephyr smiled, feeling the weight of deception lift from her shoulders. <words>405</words>

She had gotten lost in Prague and found this hidden gem, this bone flute that connected worlds, and now her path was clear—to study this sacred development not as the faux fortune teller she had been, but as the true seer she was meant to be. <words>453</words>
