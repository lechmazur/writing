Finley the minstrel strummed his lute half-heartedly as he surveyed the abandoned ink factory, its skeletal machinery looming in the dusty half-light. <words>21</words>

"Disappearing ink," he muttered skeptically, fingering the dragon-scale armor scrap in his pocket—his only evidence that the immortal trickster Zephyrus actually existed. <words>42</words>

The timepiece on his wrist showed high noon, and somewhere outside, Finley knew mailboxes stood empty, their metal mouths agape in the midday hush, waiting for letters that would never arrive—much like he waited for proof that wasn't coming. <words>76</words>

The note that had led him here had appeared in his soup last night, written in what could only be disappearing ink: "Bring the scale to the factory, and I'll show you dragons are real." <words>109</words>

Finley had spent his life debunking myths, singing satirical ballads about gullible knights and their imaginary quests, yet here he was, following instructions from vanishing text. <words>135</words>

An impossibly plausible scenario, really—the skeptic seeking the supernatural. <words>145</words>

He wandered deeper into the factory, where massive vats once held chemicals that made words fade like memories. <words>162</words>

The ancient steam vent in the corner hissed suddenly, startling Finley into dropping the dragon scale. <words>177</words>

It skittered across the floor, landing near a contraption that looked suspiciously like a slingshot built from old factory parts. <words>196</words>

"Ah, the minstrel arrives," came a voice that seemed to emanate from everywhere and nowhere. <words>210</words>

"Zephyrus?" Finley called, gripping his lute like a shield. <words>219</words>

"The very same," replied the voice, followed by a chuckle that echoed off the empty vats. <words>234</words>

"I don't believe in tricksters or dragons," Finley declared, though his voice wavered. <words>246</words>

"Yet you brought the scale," Zephyrus materialized beside the slingshot, a being of shifting smoke and gleaming eyes. <words>262</words>

"To prove you wrong," Finley retorted, though they both knew it was a lie. <words>275</words>

Zephyrus gestured to the slingshot. "This will launch your precious scale into the steam vent, revealing its true nature." <words>292</words>

"And why would I do that?" Finley asked, eyeing his only proof of dragons with sudden possessiveness. <words>307</words>

"Reckless generosity, my skeptical friend," Zephyrus grinned. "Give up your treasure to gain a greater one—truth." <words>324</words>

With trembling fingers, Finley placed the scale in the slingshot's cradle, pulled back, and released. <words>339</words>

The scale soared through the air, catching the factory's dim light before disappearing into the hissing vent. <words>356</words>

For a moment, nothing happened—then the factory filled with iridescent mist that formed words in the air: recipes for inks that could capture memories, reveal truths, and yes, even summon dragons. <words>387</words>

"I've guarded these secrets for millennia," Zephyrus said, "waiting for someone skeptical enough to question, yet generous enough to sacrifice proof for knowledge." <words>410</words>

Finley stood in irreverent awe, already composing in his mind the ballads he would never sing—for who would believe him? <words>429</words>

"You've out-schemed me," Zephyrus admitted with a bow. "I expected greed, but you gave up your only evidence willingly." <words>448</words>

As the immortal trickster faded away, Finley realized he'd gained something better than proof—a story that was his alone, written in ink that only he could see. <words>477</words>
