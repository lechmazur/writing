Marcus chiseled away at the granite, his fingers tracing the contours of what would become his masterpiece. <words>15</words>

The vintage reading glasses perched on his nose caught the dim light of the research base, nestled within the Barringer Crater where scientists studied cosmic impacts and he, the resident artist, captured their essence in stone. <words>47</words>

His assignment was simple: document the scientific endeavors through sculpture, but Marcus harbored deeper intentions beneath his brooding exterior. <words>65</words>

Every tap of his chisel was a countdown to freedom, each dust particle a promise of his theoretically spontaneous plan that had actually been meticulously crafted over months. <words>91</words>

The scientists barely noticed him anymore, just another fixture in their underground world, like the ancient meteorite fragments they catalogued with clinical precision. <words>114</words>

Today was car washing day, the one time when the researchers brought their vehicles to the crater's rim, creating the perfect distraction for what Marcus had planned. <words>140</words>

He watched Dr. Eliza scrub her sedan, her movements mechanical, another soul trapped in the webs of intrigue that the government had spun around this supposedly "purely scientific" operation. <words>168</words>

Marcus knew better; he had seen the classified files, understood what they were really studying beneath the crater's floor—knowledge that made his escape not just desirable but necessary. <words>198</words>

His fingers trembled slightly as he removed his glasses, folding them with deliberate care before placing them atop his unfinished sculpture—a farewell gift and a signature all at once. <words>228</words>

The afternoon sun slanted through the high windows of the workshop, illuminating swirling motes of stone dust that danced in the air like miniature galaxies. <words>252</words>

Marcus had studied these patterns for months, had learned how the security cameras faltered when the dust density reached a certain threshold, creating blind spots in their surveillance web. <words>281</words>

With a gentle breath, he sent more dust into the air, watching it shimmer and swirl, creating the perfect cover for his disappearance. <words>304</words>

There was a murky tenderness in his goodbye, a bittersweet acknowledgment of the beauty he had created here, even as he rejected the servitude that came with it. <words>332</words>

The dust thickened, catching sunlight, transforming the workshop into a glittering nebula that confused the motion sensors and obscured the cameras. <words>354</words>

Marcus stepped into the heart of the dust storm, his form blurring, edges softening until he seemed to dissolve into the dance of particles. <words>377</words>

By the time the scientists returned from their mundane task of car washing, Marcus would be gone, having slipped through the maintenance tunnels that honeycombed the crater. <words>403</words>

All that remained was his final sculpture: a perfect rendering of the research base itself, but with one crucial difference—a tiny figure escaping through a previously unknown passage, visible only to those who knew to look for it. <words>442</words>

And beside it, his vintage reading glasses, lenses catching the light, throwing prisms across the stone surface like silent fireworks celebrating his liberation from a life spent carving others' visions instead of his own. <words>478</words>
