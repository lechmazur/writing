Elian, the apathetic summoner, slouched in the shared dream recording studio, his fingers tracing the worn edges of a rustic coffee grinder. <words>20</words>

The air still vibrated with the last breath of Oceanus, the dying god of waters, whose final exhalation had rippled through reality three days prior. <words>42</words>

"You could at least pretend to care," said Mira, adjusting dials on the dreamcatcher console that captured collective unconsciousness. <words>58</words>

Elian shrugged, enthusiastically lazy in his commitment to minimal effort. <words>67</words>

"The coral reefs are dying without Oceanus's influence," Mira continued, her voice carrying a gentle sharpness that somehow cut deeper than anger. <words>87</words>

The rustic coffee grinder in Elian's hands had once belonged to the water deity—a humble tool used to grind pearls into dream-dust that nourished the ocean's imagination. <words>113</words>

"River wisdom doesn't just manifest itself," Mira said, gesturing toward the row of empty frames hanging on the studio's far wall, each one waiting to capture a fragment of collective memory. <words>139</words>

Elian sighed and finally stood, carrying the grinder to the center of the room where moonlight pooled on the floor. <words>158</words>

"I know we need to rebuild the reefs," he admitted, "but summoning without Oceanus feels pointless." <words>174</words>

He placed the grinder in the light and began to turn the handle, releasing not coffee but a fine mist that smelled of salt and dreams. <words>198</words>

The mist began to unfold like origami in reverse, forming shapes of forgotten sea creatures and ancient coral formations. <words>216</words>

"The dreams are responding," whispered Mira, as the mist drifted toward the empty frames. <words>229</words>

Through matching empty frames hanging in the deserted hall, the essence of river wisdom—the accumulated knowledge of every stream, brook, and ocean current—began to materialize. <words>252</words>

Each frame filled with a different scene: spawning grounds, reef ecosystems, the dance of currents, all knowledge that had died with Oceanus. <words>273</words>

"It's working," Mira breathed, her fingers dancing across the console, recording these dream-memories before they could fade. <words>290</words>

Elian felt something stir within his apathetic heart as he watched the frames fill with blue-green light. <words>307</words>

"The reefs need more than memories," he said, surprising himself with sudden conviction. <words>321</words>

He turned the grinder faster, his previously lethargic movements now purposeful, as if his enthusiastically lazy nature had found its perfect expression in this minimal yet crucial task. <words>347</words>

The mist thickened, and from it emerged spectral polyps, dream-coral that would serve as templates for real-world restoration. <words>366</words>

"We're capturing the blueprint of life itself," Mira said, her voice soft with wonder. <words>380</words>

Elian nodded, understanding now why he had been chosen as summoner—not despite his apathy but because of it. <words>398</words>

In a world overwhelmed by the death of a god, his emotional distance allowed him to channel pure creation without the distortion of grief. <words>421</words>

As the last frame filled with living light, Elian placed his hand on the coffee grinder and whispered, "From your death, Oceanus, we will rebuild your greatest achievement." <words>444</words>

The dream recording studio hummed with potential as Mira finalized the capture, preserving the river wisdom that would guide oceanographers and environmental mages in the physical restoration of Earth's coral reefs. <words>473</words>

And for the first time since becoming a summoner, Elian felt the weight of purpose replace the comfortable void of apathy. <words>493</words>
