Elias Thornwood pressed the black rose between the pages of his journal, a ritual he performed each night after his solitary walks. <words>17</words>

"Another specimen for my collection," he murmured, admiring how the frost had crystallized along its edges before closing the leather-bound book with reverence. <words>37</words>

Elias was seldom odd in the conventional sense—his peculiarities manifested in subtle ways, like his methodical cataloging of dead flowers or his preference for Tuesday dinners at exactly 7:13 PM. <words>63</words>

The black rose represented his latest victory against what he privately called "the alpha predator"—despair—which had stalked him since childhood, threatening to unravel his carefully constructed routines. <words>89</words>

His apartment walls were lined with shelves of journals, each containing pressed flowers that marked days he had chosen life over darkness. <words>110</words>

When the invitation slid under his door—embossed with silver frost patterns and requesting his presence at "The Glacial Gathering"—Elias initially filed it with his collection of unsolicited mail. <words>137</words>

"Board games and refreshments throughout the evening," it promised, signed simply "Ymir." <words>149</words>

Three days later, driven by a curiosity he couldn't explain, Elias found himself following map coordinates to a cave entrance nestled in the mountains, journal tucked safely in his coat pocket. <words>177</words>

The frost giant's lair was not what he expected—a cavernous space transformed into a cozy parlor with ice furniture draped in furs, where beings of various sizes gathered around massive game boards. <words>208</words>

"Ah, the collector arrives!" boomed Ymir, a towering figure with icicle-beard and eyes like frozen lakes. <words>223</words>

"I've been watching you catalog your victories against our mutual enemy," the giant continued, gesturing Elias toward an empty chair. <words>240</words>

Throughout the night, as game rounds progressed from chess to more exotic competitions Elias had never heard of, he realized each player represented a different form of solitude—some embraced it like him, others fought against it. <words>275</words>

"Your turn, Rose-keeper," Ymir announced with earnest flippancy during the seventh game, sliding obsidian pieces toward Elias. <words>292</words>

"The objective is simple—build something beautiful from the void," the giant explained, eyes twinkling. <words>307</words>

As dawn approached, Elias had won three games and lost four, but somehow felt victorious in ways his journals could never capture. <words>328</words>

"We gather monthly," Ymir said as players departed, "those of us who understand that embracing solitude isn't surrendering to it." <words>347</words>

Back home, Elias pinned a new item in his journal—a crystalline game piece Ymir had gifted him—beside the black rose. <words>368</words>

"Perhaps," he thought with a smile that would have seemed foreign on his face just days before, "triumph over despair isn't always a solitary pursuit." <words>392</words>

He began a new entry: "Today I learned that collecting moments can be as meaningful as collecting objects, and that embracing solitude doesn't mean I must always be alone." <words>423</words>

As he wrote, the black rose seemed to shimmer slightly, as if acknowledging that sometimes the most carefully constructed defenses against despair need to unravel just enough to let others in. <words>455</words>
