Jasper walked the pedigree hounds through the estate gardens, his footsteps crunching on gravel paths as twilight descended. <words>17</words>

The mansion loomed ahead, its Victorian silhouette cutting against the sky where color bled from day into night. <words>33</words>

He had made silent agreements with all his ultra-rich clients—he saw nothing, heard nothing, and most importantly, said nothing. <words>51</words>

This carefully careless attitude had served him well, allowing him access to worlds most would never glimpse. <words>66</words>

The Blackwood estate, however, tested his resolve with its persistent whispers and shadows that moved without source. <words>81</words>

Tonight, Mrs. Blackwood had requested he bring the dogs inside after their walk—something about a dinner party requiring "living decorations." <words>100</words>

As he approached the mansion's rear entrance, the dogs suddenly tensed, their aristocratic composure fracturing as they whined and pulled against their leashes. <words>121</words>

"Easy," Jasper murmured, though his own heart quickened as he stepped into the service corridor. <words>135</words>

The dining room doors stood ajar, revealing crystal chandeliers that cast prismatic light across a table set for twelve, though Mrs. Blackwood lived alone. <words>156</words>

Jasper had first met Mrs. Blackwood at a blood drive three months ago—an encounter that had led to this lucrative position and the strangest job of his life. <words>180</words>

He remembered how she'd justified her excessive donation by claiming rare blood properties, her eyes never leaving his as the nurse had drawn vial after vial. <words>203</words>

The dining room's loud silence pressed against his ears as he entered, the dogs now eerily calm, as if sedated by the room's atmosphere. <words>225</words>

Mrs. Blackwood's botanical collection lined the walls—rare specimens in antique terrariums, some glowing with an unnatural phosphorescence, others seeming to pulse with a rhythm like heartbeats. <words>249</words>

"Ah, Jasper, perfect timing," Mrs. Blackwood materialized from a shadowed corner, her pale fingers stroking a leaf that curled toward her touch. <words>268</words>

"The others will arrive soon," she continued, though Jasper had seen no preparations for guests, no staff bustling about. <words>286</words>

He nodded, maintaining the silent agreement that kept his employment secure and his questions unasked. <words>300</words>

As he arranged the dogs around the table per her instructions, he noticed the place settings—ancient silver tarnished black, wine glasses filled with something too viscous to be wine. <words>329</words>

"You're different, Jasper," Mrs. Blackwood said, her voice like silk over stone. <words>341</words>

"You stand where fear dares not tread." <words>348</words>

The air thickened as darkness fully claimed the sky outside, and the botanical specimens began to emit a low, harmonious hum. <words>368</words>

Jasper felt something brush against his consciousness—an invitation, a promise, a threat. <words>381</words>

He had always prided himself on his ability to look away, to maintain that carefully careless demeanor that made him invaluable to his wealthy employers. <words>405</words>

But as spectral forms began to materialize around the dining table, their outlines shimmering like heat mirages, Jasper made a new silent agreement—this time with himself. <words>429</words>

Tonight, he would not look away. <words>435</words>

Tonight, he would finally learn what happened in the Blackwood mansion when color bled from day into night, and why Mrs. Blackwood needed someone who could stand where fear dared not tread. <words>467</words>
