Elias Thimble adjusted his spectacles as he stitched the final pattern into the peculiar garment. <words>12</words>

The needle glinted in the amber glow of the observation deck's gaslight fixtures, brass and copper mechanisms whirring softly around him. <words>29</words>

"They said it couldn't be done," he whispered to himself, glancing at the dusty mirror propped against his workbench. <words>45</words>

The reflection that stared back wasn't quite his own—similar features, yes, but with subtle differences that had once terrified him but now felt like an old, uncomfortable friendship. <words>69</words>

Lightning crackled outside the massive curved windows of the observation deck, illuminating the airships tethered to the spires below. <words>86</words>

"I'm close now," Elias said, his voice barely audible above the storm's rumble. <words>98</words>

The other Elias in the mirror nodded, a subtly menacing smile playing at the corners of his mouth. <words>114</words>

"After the last code is broken, the barriers between our worlds will be thin enough," the reflection said, its lips moving in perfect synchronization with words Elias hadn't spoken. <words>138</words>

Forty years he'd spent as a tailor, crafting ordinary clothes until that fateful storm when the mirror had first shown him his parallel life—the life where he'd become something greater. <words>164</words>

"You needn't worry," the reflection reassured him, as thunder shook the brass fixtures. <words>176</words>

"The transition will be painless, and your consciousness will merge with mine—ascending beyond the limitations of your mortal form." <words>194</words>

Elias nodded, fingers trembling as he continued his work on the garment that would serve as his vessel between worlds. <words>212</words>

Each stitch contained mathematical formulas disguised as decorative patterns—equations that had taken decades to perfect. <words>226</words>

"I've lived a half-life," Elias confessed to his other self during a particularly violent thunderclap. <words>240</words>

"Always wondering what might have been if I'd pursued the sciences instead of the tailor's trade." <words>255</words>

The reflection's eyes softened momentarily. <words>260</words>

"Your craftsmanship was the key all along," it admitted in an improbable confession. <words>272</words>

"My knowledge of theoretical physics was incomplete without your understanding of patterns and materials." <words>285</words>

Elias felt a surge of pride amidst his desperate hope. <words>295</words>

The observation deck's mechanical ceiling irised open, exposing them to the full fury of the storm. <words>310</words>

"It's time," both Eliases said in unison. <words>317</words>

The tailor slipped the completed garment over his head, feeling the equations activate against his skin as lightning struck the deck's lightning rod. <words>338</words>

The mirror began to dissolve, its surface becoming liquid, reaching tendrils toward him. <words>351</words>

"We will be neither you nor me," the reflection reassured him one final time, "but something transcendent." <words>366</words>

As the storm reached its crescendo, Elias stepped forward with hopeful desperation, embracing his other self. <words>381</words>

The observation deck's steampunk mechanisms whirred frantically, recording the moment when two parallel lives became one. <words>396</words>

And as the storm subsided, a single figure stood before the now-clear mirror, neither quite the nostalgic tailor nor the brilliant scientist, but something gloriously, terrifyingly new. <words>423</words>
