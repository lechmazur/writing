Madame Vex adjusted her amber earrings, watching how they caught the light as clients poured their heartbreak into her office. <words>17</words>

"Time heals nothing," she would tell them, "but understanding the gravity of desires can set you free." <words>33</words>

The earrings were her talisman, harvested from the same ancient tree sap that had preserved the first time travel coordinates three centuries ago. <words>53</words>

She had been a temporal physicist before becoming a heartbreak counselor, back when the world still believed time was linear rather than a pool of possibilities. <words>76</words>

Madame Vex's specialty was helping those who had glimpsed alternate timelines of their relationships—the cruelest form of modern heartache. <words>94</words>

Her restlessly curious mind made her exceptional at her work, always probing the edges of her clients' narratives for inconsistencies across timelines. <words>114</words>

Today's client was different—a time agency operative who had fallen in love with the same person across seventeen different realities. <words>132</words>

"I track them by following cloud trails," he explained, describing how temporal rifts left distinctive patterns in the sky. <words>148</words>

"And in each reality, they leave me for the same reason." <words>158</words>

Madame Vex led him to her rooftop, where her sky reflection pool mirrored the heavens above—its surface engineered to reveal temporal disturbances invisible to the naked eye. <words>184</words>

"Watch," she instructed, dropping a single tear from her amber earring into the water. <words>197</words>

The pool's surface began to zip with energy, revealing hundreds of cloud trails converging toward a single point in time. <words>215</words>

"Your lover isn't leaving you seventeen times," she said with cautious impulsiveness, "they're trying to find the one reality where you both survive." <words>235</words>

The man's face paled as understanding dawned. <words>242</words>

"The time agency has been using you," Madame Vex continued, "conditioning you to believe you're pursuing love when you're actually hunting a temporal fugitive—yourself." <words>265</words>

She had seen this before—the agency's most insidious technique: turning operatives into unwitting assassins of their alternate selves. <words>284</words>

"But why would I hunt myself?" he whispered, hands trembling above the pool's surface. <words>297</words>

"Because in one timeline, you discovered how to truly break free from temporal constraints—to proclaim yourself free in a cage of illusions." <words>318</words>

Madame Vex removed her amber earrings and placed them in his palm. <words>329</words>

"These contain coordinates to that reality—the one where you succeeded." <words>340</words>

She wasn't just a heartbreak counselor; she was the femme fatale of the resistance, using her position to identify those who could be awakened. <words>363</words>

"Your heart isn't broken," she said, watching recognition flash across his features, "it's been deliberately scattered across time." <words>381</words>

As the pool's surface calmed, their reflections merged momentarily—revealing they were variants of the same person from different timelines. <words>399</words>

"Now go," she whispered, "find yourself, and remember that the gravity of our desires is the only force powerful enough to bend time itself." <words>421</words>

He disappeared into the temporal fold, and Madame Vex smiled, knowing that somewhere, another piece of herself had just proclaimed freedom from the grand illusion. <words>444</words>
