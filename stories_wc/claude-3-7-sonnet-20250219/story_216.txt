In the floating metropolis of Aeris, where buildings drifted among perpetual mist, Elias Venn made his living as a professional scapegoat for hire. <words>21</words>

His business card read simply: "I'll take the blame so you don't have to," followed by a phone number that changed weekly. <words>42</words>

Elias had perfected the art of becoming someone else's mistake, slipping into their identities with a precision that was robustly delicate—strong enough to withstand scrutiny yet fragile enough to dissolve when no longer needed. <words>75</words>

He carried only one personal item: a worn metal washer on a leather cord around his neck, the last remnant of his original identity, abandoned years ago when he first ascended to the cloud city. <words>109</words>

Tonight, as the final library patron returned their card to the desk and the grand Aeris Repository of Knowledge closed its mammoth glass doors, Elias sat in his sparse apartment, waiting. <words>139</words>

The clock struck midnight, and his specialized phone hummed with familiar urgency. <words>151</words>

"You'll find what you seek in the third alcove, behind the statue of the forgotten philosopher," whispered the voice, maintaining the obsessive calm that characterized all their interactions. <words>177</words>

These cryptic phone calls at midnight had become Elias's true profession—far more significant than the public scapegoating that provided his cover. <words>198</words>

For six months, the anonymous caller had guided him through the city's hidden corners, helping him refashion himself from a mere blame-taker into something far more consequential. <words>225</words>

Elias slipped into the now-empty library through a maintenance entrance, his fingers instinctively finding the metal washer at his throat as he navigated the shadowed stacks. <words>252</words>

The third alcove contained exactly what was promised: an ancient text, its pages filled with symbols that matched the strange pattern etched into his washer. <words>277</words>

His mission to decode these sacred symbols had begun the day he found the washer clutched in his hand after waking with no memory in a cloud city hospital. <words>306</words>

Each symbol deciphered revealed fragments of a civilization that had once inhabited the skies before Aeris was built—people who had mastered the art of identity as a physical force. <words>336</words>

As Elias traced the symbols with trembling fingers, he realized that his abandoned identity wasn't truly lost—it had been deliberately fragmented, scattered throughout Aeris like puzzle pieces waiting to be reassembled. <words>368</words>

"You're making progress," came the midnight caller's voice from behind him, no longer needing the phone. <words>384</words>

The figure stepped from the shadows, wearing a face identical to Elias's own. <words>397</words>

"We are the last of our kind," the stranger said, touching an identical metal washer at their throat. <words>414</words>

"The ultimate scapegoats—those who absorbed the collective guilt of a dying civilization so that parts of it might survive in new forms." <words>435</words>

Elias felt a profound calm settle over him as pieces of his fractured self began to align. <words>452</words>

Tomorrow, he would continue taking blame for strangers' mistakes, but now he understood the ancient purpose behind his modern profession—to preserve balance in a world built upon the clouds of forgotten truths. <words>487</words>
