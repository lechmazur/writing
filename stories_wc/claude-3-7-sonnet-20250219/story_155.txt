Beneath the waves, Elias mended fractured oil rigs with a torch that burned even underwater, a skill that made him both valuable and invisible. <words>21</words>

His weathered hands, steady from years of precision welding, now trembled as he clutched the vintage button box he'd discovered in the submerged wreckage of a 1940s cargo ship. <words>45</words>

The box—mother-of-pearl inlaid with brass filigree—contained not buttons but small glass discs that seemed to capture light from sources that weren't there. <words>68</words>

Elias had been patiently impatient his entire life, a contradiction that defined him—methodical in his work yet always feeling time slipping away too quickly. <words>92</words>

"The Celestial," once Portland's premier planetarium before a earthquake cracked its massive dome, had been reimagined as the city's most exclusive nightclub, where the wealthy pampered themselves under fractured constellations projected onto broken architecture. <words>126</words>

Elias stood in the club's bathroom, the vintage button box open before him, watching as his reflection in the spotted mirror seemed to shift between versions of himself—one in diving gear, one in an elegant suit he'd never owned. <words>163</words>

The inheritance from his grandmother had come with a journal describing moments of unraveling, times when reality thinned and possibilities multiplied, all connected to this box of not-quite-buttons. <words>193</words>

"At the crossing where two timelines should never meet," she'd written, "the bearer of the discs may glimpse and step through." <words>215</words>

The inherited mystery had brought him here tonight, following coordinates and dates from his grandmother's calculations, seeking the moment when the club's broken dome would align with celestial bodies in a configuration that occurred once every eighty-three years. <words>251</words>

Through glimpses in the vintage store mirrors that lined the club's walls—salvaged from the same era as the button box—Elias watched himself in another life, one where he wielded improbable power, commanding elements rather than merely working among them. <words>290</words>

The DJ's music pulsed as the midnight hour approached, the damaged star projector casting fractured constellations that began to synchronize with the actual stars visible through the cracked dome. <words>320</words>

Elias placed the glass discs in a pattern described in his grandmother's journal, each one catching light and refracting it into impossible colors. <words>343</words>

The mirror before him rippled as two timelines—one where he remained a solitary welder and one where he became something transcendent—approached their forbidden intersection. <words>367</words>

He understood now why his grandmother had chosen him: his hands could mend the broken places between worlds just as they mended broken metal beneath the sea. <words>393</words>

As the final disc clicked into place, Elias saw both versions of himself reach forward, fingertips nearly touching across the glass divide, the moment of unraveling now complete. <words>422</words>

The choice was his—remain in the familiar depths or step through to wield the elemental power that had always been his birthright—as the two timelines trembled at their impossible meeting point, waiting for him to decide which reality would continue and which would dissolve back into mere possibility. <words>473</words>
