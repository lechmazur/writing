Eliza knew she was different, having mastered astral projection at age twelve, keeping her ethereal journeys secret even from her twin sister. <words>21</words>

She sometimes always returned to her body before dawn, a peculiar consistency that gave her spiritual wanderings a predictable rhythm despite their otherworldly nature. <words>43</words>

The abandoned carnival had become her favorite projection destination, its roller coaster track spiraling toward the sky like a rusted prayer, silent except for the whispers of those who had once screamed in delight along its curves. <words>75</words>

Tonight, as her consciousness hovered above the highest loop, moonlight glinted off something wedged between two warped boards – an antique brass key, its teeth forming a pattern she recognized from her grandmother's stories about doors between worlds. <words>110</words>

In the seconds following this sudden revelation, Eliza's astral form trembled with understanding: the key wasn't physical but metaphysical, visible only to those who existed between realms. <words>137</words>

Her grandmother had been like her – a projector, a traveler, a keeper of the in-between spaces. <words>153</words>

With practiced spontaneity that belied her racing thoughts, Eliza's spirit hand closed around the key, feeling its impossible weight even in her non-corporeal form. <words>178</words>

She needed to flee this place immediately, return to her body, and hide this discovery from the Watchers – entities her grandmother had warned about who harvested the abilities of astral projectors. <words>211</words>

By tracking sun shadows across the abandoned fairground, Eliza oriented herself toward home – a technique her grandmother had taught her for spiritual navigation when conventional directions failed. <words>238</words>

The shadows stretched like fingers pointing east, where her physical form lay sleeping twenty miles away. <words>253</words>

Her motivation wasn't fear but preservation – to preserve the survival skills passed through generations of women in her family, knowledge that would die if the Watchers found her. <words>282</words>

As she accelerated through the pre-dawn air, the key clutched in her spectral grasp, Eliza felt an unyielding compassion for her grandmother who had carried this burden alone, who had hidden keys throughout the world for Eliza to find when she was ready. <words>326</words>

The carnival shrank behind her, its faded colors and broken dreams housing more secrets than she had imagined. <words>344</words>

By sunrise, Eliza had returned to her body, the brass key somehow materialized beside her pillow, its metal warm as though it had absorbed her journey. <words>371</words>

She would need to find the others – six keys in total, her grandmother's journal had mentioned – each unlocking a different aspect of her abilities. <words>396</words>

For now, though, she tucked the key into the hollow book beneath her bed, knowing that tonight she would project again, her spirit drawn to the next shadow-marked location, her heart steady with the compassion that allowed her to understand: she wasn't running from something, but toward someone – all the women before her who had kept these passages safe. <words>460</words>
