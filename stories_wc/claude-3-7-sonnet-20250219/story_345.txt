Father Elias jogged through the labyrinth orchard, his breath forming clouds in the crisp morning air. <words>15</words> The giant bean stalks towered above him, their massive stems twisting skyward until they disappeared into the low-hanging clouds. <words>33</words> He clutched his abacus—a relic from his days at the seminary—its wooden frame worn smooth from years of anxious calculations, several beads missing from the middle row. <words>59</words> The loss of those beads mirrored the gaps in his faith, each missing piece a question he could no longer answer. <words>78</words>

Through the hush of fate unraveling, Elias followed the peculiar snow patterns on the ground, unapologetically confused about where they might lead. <words>98</words> The patterns formed arrows and spirals, unlike anything natural weather could create, as if someone—or something—was leaving him a trail. <words>119</words> Three years had passed since he'd abandoned his collar, yet here he was, drawn back to the sacred by forces he couldn't explain. <words>141</words>

"The price of complacency," he muttered, remembering his mentor's warning. <words>151</words> He had grown comfortable in his doubt, settled into a life without divine purpose, until the dreams began—dreams of this very orchard, of paths untaken. <words>178</words>

The snow patterns led deeper into the maze of stalks, where the light filtered through in what could only be described as a dull radiance—neither illuminating nor concealing, but existing in that liminal space between revelation and mystery. <words>216</words> Elias checked his abacus again, sliding the remaining beads across their rods as if they might calculate his position in this strange cosmology. <words>238</words>

A fork in the path appeared before him, and the snow patterns split in two directions. <words>253</words> The left path was well-trodden, safe; the right disappeared into untamed growth. <words>266</words> His old self would have chosen safety, would have accepted the predetermined route. <words>279</words>

"To step beyond fate's design," he whispered, the words emerging unbidden from some forgotten prayer. <words>294</words> He chose the right path, jogging with newfound determination. <words>303</words>

As he ventured deeper, the bean stalks grew closer together, their leaves forming a cathedral ceiling above. <words>320</words> The abacus in his hand began to warm, and to his astonishment, where beads had been missing, small points of light now hovered in their place. <words>347</words>

Elias reached a clearing where the snow formed a perfect circle. <words>358</words> In its center stood a simple wooden door, attached to nothing, standing alone. <words>372</words> He approached it slowly, understanding now that his confusion had been a form of awakening. <words>387</words> The complacency of certainty—whether in faith or doubt—had been his true failing. <words>401</words>

With trembling fingers, he placed the abacus against the door, and the lights where beads should have been flared brilliantly. <words>420</words> The door swung open to reveal not another part of the orchard, but a vast, unwritten expanse. <words>437</words> Father Elias stepped through, leaving behind both his lapsed faith and his comfortable doubt, embracing instead the sacred journey of not knowing. <words>461</words> The door closed behind him, and the snow patterns rearranged themselves, waiting for the next seeker brave enough to jog beyond the boundaries of their own understanding. <words>491</words>
