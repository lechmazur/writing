Elias kept his collection of smooth stones in a worn shoebox, the only inheritance from parents he couldn't remember. <words>17</words>

He arranged them meticulously by size and color whenever anxiety crept into his bones, a ritual that brought order to his otherwise chaotic life. <words>39</words>

The foster families had come and gone, but Elias remained unchanging—an aloof orphan who preferred the company of geological specimens to the unpredictable nature of human relationships. <words>64</words>

Today, Mrs. Harmon had insisted he clean the garage, a task he approached with his characteristic affectionate detachment, caring enough to do it properly but emotionally removed from the tedium. <words>92</words>

"Strange things happen in that garage," she had whispered, her voice softly audible as she handed him a broom. <words>109</words>

Elias dismissed her warning until he noticed the peculiar behavior of dust particles suspended in the air, hanging motionless as if time had forgotten them. <words>131</words>

He reached for a fallen tennis ball, only to watch it roll upward against the wall and hover at eye level—a gravitational anomaly that defied everything he understood about physics. <words>158</words>

Throughout garage cleaning, more oddities emerged: water flowing sideways from a leaking pipe, tools drifting upward when set down, and a calendar from 1987 whose pages flipped backward in the still air. <words>190</words>

Sweeping beneath an old workbench, Elias discovered a crumpled lottery ticket with a cryptic message scrawled across its back: "To loosen the grip of gravity, one must first release the weight of the past." <words>224</words>

The handwriting looked eerily similar to what he imagined his mother's might have been. <words>237</words>

Clutching his shoebox of stones, Elias felt them vibrate against his palms as the gravitational pull in the garage intensified, threatening to crush everything within its walls. <words>264</words>

"Adapt or perish," whispered a voice from everywhere and nowhere, a phrase his dreams had echoed for years. <words>281</words>

With trembling hands, he opened his precious collection and watched as the stones rose from their compartments, orbiting around him like miniature planets. <words>302</words>

Each stone represented a memory he'd never formed, a connection he'd never allowed, a fear he'd cultivated instead of courage. <words>322</words>

Understanding bloomed within him: the anomaly wasn't in the garage but within himself—his inability to let go had created a gravity well of isolation. <words>345</words>

One by one, Elias released his stones into the swirling vortex above, each surrender lightening the invisible burden he'd carried since childhood. <words>368</words>

As the final stone left his possession, the gravitational distortion stabilized, and objects gently returned to their natural positions. <words>387</words>

Mrs. Harmon found him sitting cross-legged on the now-spotless garage floor, empty shoebox in his lap, a serene smile replacing his usual guarded expression. <words>410</words>

"I've finished cleaning," he said, his voice carrying a warmth that had never been there before. <words>426</words>

That evening, for the first time, Elias joined the family for dinner without being coaxed, his orphan heart beginning to loosen its protective shell, transforming fear into the courage to belong. <words>457</words>
