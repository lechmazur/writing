Marcus stood behind the prize booth at Hollow Heights Amusement Park, his cynical gaze following a family as they approached with tickets in hand. <words>21</words>

"Your chances of winning that stuffed bear are approximately one in seventy-three," he stated flatly, unable to soften the brutal statistics due to the witch's curse that bound him to absolute honesty. <words>46</words>

The father's smile faltered, but he pushed forward five tickets anyway, his daughter's hopeful eyes preventing retreat. <words>62</words>

Marcus sighed and reached beneath the counter for his vintage pencil box, a weathered cedar container that held more than just the carnival's rigged game pieces. <words>85</words>

The box had belonged to his grandmother, who had explained that within its worn corners lay a tapestry of fate—invisible threads connecting all living things, occasionally visible to those patient enough to look. <words>116</words>

"You'll fail at this game, but succeed at something more important today," Marcus told the man as he politely, yet vindictively, handed over three dull darts. <words>138</words>

The family moved on after their inevitable loss, leaving Marcus alone with his binoculars as dusk approached—his bird watching hours were the only peaceful moments in this haunted place where the deceased carnival workers whispered through the cotton candy machines. <words>173</words>

He focused on a red-tailed hawk circling above, its wings spread against the emerging crescent moon, when he noticed the father from earlier sitting alone on a bench, staring blankly at his phone. <words>204</words>

Marcus felt the familiar tug—the compulsion to speak truth—and approached the man with measured steps. <words>219</words>

"Your daughter doesn't need another stuffed animal; she needs you to look up from that screen and see the hawk hunting above us," he said, offering his binoculars with a gentleness that contradicted his harsh words. <words>251</words>

The man's irritation dissolved as he accepted the binoculars, his gaze following Marcus's pointing finger to where the raptor soared. <words>271</words>

"With each phase of the moon, we either grow or petrify," Marcus continued, watching understanding dawn in the man's eyes as they tracked the bird's graceful hunt. <words>295</words>

The father's face softened as he called his daughter over, lifting her up to see the hawk's majestic flight. <words>313</words>

In that moment, Marcus felt the curse lighten—not because he'd spoken anything but truth, but because his truth had provoked evolution in a stagnant mind. <words>339</words>

The evening settled around them with layered tranquility: the carnival's gaudy lights, the hawk's silent patrol, the father and daughter sharing wonder, and Marcus's quiet observation of it all. <words>367</words>

Later, as the family departed, the father returned the binoculars with a nod of genuine appreciation. <words>382</words>

"There's a whole world beyond screens and carnival games," Marcus said, his curse compelling honesty but no longer feeling like punishment. <words>401</words>

He placed his binoculars back in the vintage pencil box, alongside the invisible threads of fate he'd helped reweave, knowing that tomorrow would bring more opportunities to transform harsh truths into moments of awakening. <words>436</words>

As the moon climbed higher, casting silver light across the empty midway, Marcus smiled—perhaps being cursed to speak only truth wasn't so terrible when that truth could break the spell of modern disconnection. <words>469</words>
