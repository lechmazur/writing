Elias had been a student for over three centuries, his pursuit of immortality both a blessing and a curse in the lightless world beneath the earth. <words>23</words>

His coal miner's headlamp—salvaged from the Great Collapse that had driven humanity underground—cast a weak yellow glow across his cramped quarters in the subterranean city of the mole people. <words>47</words>

The lamp was mundanely glorious in its simplicity, a relic that had outlasted even the stars above, which had all burned out eons ago according to the elders. <words>71</words>

Elias adjusted the strap of the headlamp and returned to the ancient travel journal in his hands, a gift from his predecessor who had also carried the burden of near-eternal life. <words>97</words>

"To become a master of one's own reality," the journal read, "one must first accept that immortality is not freedom but responsibility." <words>118</words>

The mole people had accepted Elias with detached devotion, viewing his unending studies as both sacred and slightly absurd, much like he viewed their reverence for the darkness. <words>143</words>

Tonight, as he had done for countless nights before, Elias would digitize another page of the journal using the crude scanner he had built from salvaged pre-collapse technology. <words>169</words>

The process was tedious but necessary; the physical journals were deteriorating, and with them, centuries of observations on extending human life beyond its natural boundaries. <words>194</words>

His own journal lay open beside him, ready to be swapped with another immortality seeker in the neighboring underground colony—their method of sharing knowledge despite the collapsed tunnels between their cities. <words>225</words>

Elias had never met the other seekers, but their words had become as familiar to him as his own thoughts, their handwriting as recognizable as old friends'. <words>251</words>

The burden of his gift—his extended lifespan—weighed on him most heavily during these quiet hours of transcription, when the city slept and only the soft clicking of his scanner broke the silence. <words>282</words>

He had watched generations of mole people live and die, their eyes adapted to darkness, their bodies evolved for the underground, while he remained unchanged, a living artifact of a forgotten surface world. <words>315</words>

Sometimes Elias wondered if true immortality was worth pursuing in a world where even stars died, but then he would remember the words from the first journal: "We seek not to outrun death, but to understand life." <words>349</words>

As he digitized the final page of the current journal, a sense of completion washed over him—another small victory in his endless quest. <words>372</words>

Tomorrow, he would leave his own journal in the exchange point and retrieve a new one, continuing the cycle that had sustained his research for centuries. <words>397</words>

In this mundanely glorious ritual, Elias found purpose: to preserve knowledge that might otherwise be lost to time, to connect with others who shared his burden across the vast darkness, and perhaps, someday, to master the reality of existence itself. <words>438</words>

His headlamp flickered briefly—a reminder of its fragility—but Elias simply adjusted it and continued his work, eternal student of an eternal night, digitizing memories in a world that had forgotten the light. <words>472</words>
