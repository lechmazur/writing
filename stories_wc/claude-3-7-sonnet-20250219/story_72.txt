The sneering envoy from Earth's Diplomatic Corps stood at the edge of the domed vineyard, his shadow stretching across the rusty soil of Mars. <words>21</words>

His thin lips curled with disdain as he surveyed the impossible green flourishing under the transparent hemisphere, the only splash of life on the barren alien plain. <words>43</words>

"Ambassador Kline sends his regards," he said, producing a folded note from his breast pocket with theatrical slowness. <words>59</words>

The paper—real paper, not the synthetic kind—was an extravagance that spoke volumes about the message it carried. <words>76</words>

Dr. Elena Vasquez accepted it without a word, her expression furiously tranquil, a storm contained behind still waters. <words>92</words>

She had spent fifteen years cultivating this vineyard, creating an ecosystem that could sustain Terran grapes in Martian soil, and now Earth wanted documentation, records, paper trails. <words>118</words>

"The Council requires proof that your experiments aren't wasting resources," the envoy said, watching her with eyes that gleamed like polished stones. <words>137</words>

Elena tucked the note into her pocket and turned away, moving deeper into her greenhouse where the temperature rose and the air hung heavy with moisture. <words>161</words>

"Follow me," she said, leading him through rows of grapevines whose tendrils reached toward the artificial sun. <words>177</words>

Autumn had been programmed into this section, and she began to sift through the swirling leaves in a neglected corner, her movements deliberate and unhurried. <words>200</words>

"What exactly are you looking for?" the envoy asked, his sneer faltering as curiosity crept in. <words>214</words>

"Patience," Elena replied, continuing to sift until her fingers closed around a small device buried among the decaying foliage. <words>231</words>

She straightened and held it up—a data crystal that captured the light and fractured it into a thousand colors. <words>249</words>

"This records everything," she said. <words>254</words>

"Across the hush of a possibility just born, I've been documenting something extraordinary." <words>267</words>

The envoy's expression shifted as Elena activated the crystal, projecting images of the vineyard at night when the dome turned transparent. <words>286</words>

The vines reached upward, their leaves unfurling toward the stars, and as they did, they captured something—a faint luminescence that they absorbed and stored. <words>310</words>

"They're photosynthesizing starlight," Elena explained, her voice soft with wonder. <words>320</words>

"The compounds they produce could revolutionize medicine, energy—everything." <words>330</words>

The envoy watched, transfixed, as the recording showed Elena moving among the vines at night, her hands cupped beneath leaves that dripped with liquid light. <words>353</words>

"To cup starlight in mortal palms," she whispered, "that's what I've been doing here." <words>367</words>

The envoy's sneer had completely vanished now, replaced by a look of awe. <words>380</words>

"The paper trails they want—they can't capture this," Elena said, gesturing to the living cathedral around them. <words>397</words>

"Some discoveries follow a rambling destiny that can't be confined to reports and requisition forms." <words>412</words>

As if in agreement, a breeze stirred through the vineyard, sending more leaves dancing around them, each one carrying a fragment of captured starlight, each one part of a story too vast for paper to hold. <words>447</words>
