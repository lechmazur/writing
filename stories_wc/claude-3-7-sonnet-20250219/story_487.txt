Hector, a docile bruiser with hands like sledgehammers and a heart of cotton candy, stood at the entrance of the greenhouse labyrinth, his massive frame oddly still. <words>25</words>

He clutched the conductor's baton—an ebony sliver rumored to raise the dead—with surprising delicacy between his calloused fingers. <words>43</words>

The old Romanian woman who'd given it to him had spoken in fractured English, the language barrier making her warnings sound like poetry rather than the dire cautions they were. <words>69</words>

"Plants hungry for man-flesh," she'd said, tapping her temple with a gnarled finger, her disturbingly calm demeanor making the warning all the more unsettling. <words>91</words>

Distant drum solos echoed from the village festival, providing an erratic heartbeat to Hector's mission. <words>106</words>

He'd spent weeks piecing together a shredded treasure map found under the floorboards of his grandmother's cottage, each fragment revealing another twist in the path through the deadly foliage. <words>134</words>

The greenhouse glass distorted the moonlight, casting prismatic shadows across Hector's face as he took his first step inside, the humid air thick with the scent of loam and something metallic—like blood. <words>165</words>

A vine snaked toward his ankle, but Hector remained unruffled, tapping it gently with the baton. <words>181</words>

The plant recoiled as if burned, curling back into the shadows with a hiss that sounded almost human. <words>198</words>

Hector consulted his reconstructed map, the paper fragments held together with hope and paste, then turned left at a junction where a massive purple flower dripped digestive juices from its petals. <words>229</words>

The drum solos intensified outside, as if the musicians sensed his progress through the maze of murderous botany. <words>246</words>

When he reached the center, Hector found what the map promised: a single white lotus floating in a small pond, untouched by the carnivorous nature of its neighbors. <words>272</words>

According to the fragments of lore he'd gathered, this flower—combined with the baton's power—could bridge worlds, could make myth tangible. <words>293</words>

Hector raised the baton as the drums reached a crescendo, and began to conduct an orchestra only he could hear. <words>312</words>

The lotus responded, its petals unfurling further, releasing spores that glittered like stardust in the moonlight. <words>328</words>

A figure began to form from the spores—his brother, lost three winters ago to the same fever that had taken their parents. <words>350</words>

The apparition struggled to speak, its mouth moving without sound, another barrier between them. <words>364</words>

With brash tenderness, Hector reached out, not to touch but to show the notebook he'd brought, filled with pictures he'd drawn of their childhood, of the stories they'd shared. <words>394</words>

The ghost's eyes widened in recognition, and though no words passed between them, understanding did. <words>409</words>

This was why Hector had come—not to raise the dead permanently, but to mold a myth from the mud of reality, to create a moment where loss wasn't forever, where goodbye wasn't final. <words>443</words>

As the drums outside fell silent, Hector lowered the baton, and his brother's form dispersed back into spores, back into story—but this time, the story belonged to Hector, and it was enough. <words>476</words>
