The subdued vigilante sat in the abandoned waiting area, his fingers tracing the plain wooden bead that hung from his neck. <words>18</words>

It was a relic from a time before the price of war had been etched into his skin, before he had learned to move through the world with artfully clumsy steps that belied his deadly precision. <words>54</words>

The virtual calls would begin soon, connections to handlers who never showed their faces, only their voices cutting through the screaming silence of the derelict hospital wing. <words>79</words>

He had discovered, quite by accident, that the antique funhouse mirror mounted on the far wall—a bizarre remnant of some attempt to comfort children in this now-abandoned place—could reveal things invisible to the naked eye. <words>113</words>

Digital distortions, quantum fluctuations, the telltale signs of surveillance and counter-surveillance that his handlers never suspected he could detect. <words>131</words>

The wooden bead had been his first teacher's final gift, a reminder that to master an ancient art, one must first appear unremarkable. <words>153</words>

"Your greatest strength," his teacher had told him, "is that they will flatter themselves into believing they have you figured out." <words>173</words>

Tonight, as the laptop screen flickered to life, he positioned himself so the funhouse mirror captured the reflection of his screen at precisely the right angle. <words>198</words>

The distortions in the warped glass revealed the hidden data streams, the secondary transmissions his handlers were collecting while they spoke of justice and necessary evils. <words>224</words>

He played his part—the broken soldier, the useful tool—while his fingers absently worried the wooden bead, a habit they had come to expect, to dismiss as meaningless. <words>253</words>

They didn't know that each rotation of the bead was a count, a code, a message to the network of others like him who had seen the true price of war and chosen a different path. <words>289</words>

The mirror's distortions showed him what they were really after: not the terrorist cells they claimed to target, but the dissidents, the truth-tellers, the inconvenient voices. <words>317</words>

His artfully clumsy typing—another deception—allowed him to send his own message beneath theirs, warning those marked for elimination. <words>336</words>

When the call ended, he sat in the screaming silence of the waiting area, where hope had once perched on uncomfortable chairs and where he now orchestrated his quiet rebellion. <words>365</words>

The wooden bead had been hollowed out, filled with microfilms of evidence that would bring down the very network that believed they controlled him. <words>390</words>

Tomorrow, he would stumble through another mission, his movements so artfully clumsy that no one would suspect the precision with which he was dismantling their operation. <words>416</words>

For now, he watched the funhouse mirror, tracking the distortions that revealed the truth behind the lies, a vigilante subdued in manner but unyielding in purpose. <words>442</words>

The price of war had been his soul once, but in mastering the ancient art of patience and deception, he had found a way to buy it back, one wooden bead rotation at a time. <words>476</words>

In the abandoned waiting area, where time stood still between virtual calls, he prepared for the day when silence would no longer scream with the voices of those who had been sacrificed in the name of peace. <words>512</words>
