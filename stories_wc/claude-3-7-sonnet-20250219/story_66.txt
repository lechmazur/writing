Elias crept through the laboratory's shadowed corridors, his military boots making no sound on the polished floor. <words>14</words>

The desertion papers weighed heavy in his pocket, but not as heavy as the years of following orders that had hollowed him. <words>34</words>

In the botanical research wing, he found temporary sanctuary among the experimental chambers where scientists studied plant communication patterns. <words>49</words>

A cracked mirror hung on the wall, fractured during some long-ago accident, reflecting his face in disjointed pieces—much like his sense of self. <words>70</words>

"They say plants speak to each other," came a voice that made Elias freeze. <words>83</words>

Dr. Linnea stood in the doorway, her lab coat pristine, her eyes knowing but not accusatory. <words>98</words>

"They communicate trauma, warnings, memories—all without ever moving from where they're rooted," she continued, approaching him with dizzyingly grounded confidence that made him both envious and calm. <words>124</words>

She gestured to a table where porcelain masks lay shattered, each piece numbered meticulously. <words>138</words>

"These were ceremonial masks from cultures that understood plant wisdom," she explained. <words>149</words>

"I reconstruct their stories throughout my jigsaw puzzles of time, piecing together what we've forgotten." <words>164</words>

Elias found himself drawn to the fragments, his quiet nature settling into the methodical work of reconstruction. <words>180</words>

Days passed as he helped Dr. Linnea, his fingers learning to read the stories in each porcelain shard, tales of people who had listened to the earth. <words>206</words>

"What happens when we carbonize plant matter?" he asked one evening, thinking of battlefields where he'd seen life reduced to carbon. <words>225</words>

"We preserve its structure while transforming its essence," she replied. <words>235</words>

"Like soldiers," he whispered, and she nodded, understanding his unspoken confession. <words>246</words>

Together they worked, the noble foolishness of their endeavor—trying to hear what plants had always been saying—becoming a sanctuary for his war-weary soul. <words>270</words>

The masks gradually took shape, revealing faces of ancient listeners who had found belonging in understanding rather than conquering nature. <words>288</words>

"I've been trying to break the cycle," Elias admitted one day, staring at his fragmented reflection. <words>303</words>

"Of violence? Of running?" Dr. Linnea asked, placing a completed mask beside the mirror. <words>317</words>

"Of believing I must belong somewhere specific," he replied, realizing that his search for home had been misguided. <words>334</words>

The plants in the laboratory seemed to lean toward him as he spoke, their silent communication more honest than any human words he'd heard in years. <words>360</words>

When authorities eventually came looking for the deserter, they found only a laboratory filled with reconstructed masks and thriving plants. <words>378</words>

Dr. Linnea showed them her research on plant memory—how certain species could hold the essence of those who had cared for them. <words>398</words>

In a corner, a small carbonized leaf specimen bore the molecular pattern of a man who had finally found peace, belonging everywhere and nowhere at once, his story preserved in the silent language of plants. <words>434</words>

And sometimes, when the light hit the cracked mirror just right, visitors swore they could see a quiet smile reflected in its broken pieces. <words>458</words>
