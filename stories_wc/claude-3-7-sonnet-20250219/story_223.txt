Lieutenant Harlow clutched the railing of the crystal fortress, his stomach lurching despite being on solid ground for three days now. <words>18</words>

The seasickness never truly left him, even here at the edge of rainbow canyon where the air tasted of mineral dust and ancient promises. <words>40</words>

He withdrew the translucent ghost orchid bulb from his pocket, its milky surface catching the last copper rays of sunset as they filtered through the crystalline walls. <words>63</words>

"They said you would know what to do with this," he muttered to the empty chamber, his voice awkwardly charming in its uncertainty, like a man used to giving orders now finding himself adrift in the unfamiliar. <words>95</words>

The bulb had come to him through seven pairs of hands, each person trading secrets for its safe passage—coordinates whispered in taverns, star charts exchanged in shadowy corners of port cities, names of forgotten deities scratched onto parchment. <words>133</words>

Harlow had tracked the moon phases meticulously for eighteen cycles, noting how the bulb's translucency shifted from cloudy to clear as the lunar body waxed and waned. <words>159</words>

Tonight was the night of perfect alignment, when the fortress would catch the moonlight like a prism and scatter it across the canyon in ribbons of impossible color. <words>186</words>

He placed the bulb in the central basin, where water collected from condensation that had been gathering across the quiet longing of centuries, droplets forming with glacial patience. <words>214</words>

"I've come to confront you," he said to his reflection in the water, remembering the mirror in his childhood home that had shown him visions of this place, of a destiny that had seemed like fantasy until the day the admiral had handed him the bulb. <words>254</words>

The mirror had lied about many things—about the ease of the journey, about the friends he would keep, about the heart that wouldn't break—but it had been truthful about the beauty that awaited. <words>288</words>

As moonlight struck the water, the bulb began to transform, unfurling petals that weren't petals but memories given form—his first command, the storm that nearly took his ship, the lover who couldn't bear the long separations. <words>324</words>

Harlow watched with nostalgic defiance as the ghost orchid bloomed fully, revealing at its center not stamens but a tiny perfect replica of the mirror that had set him on this path. <words>356</words>

"You won't deceive anyone else," he whispered, reaching into the basin to touch the flower's heart. <words>371</words>

The fortress hummed around him, crystals singing as they absorbed the orchid's essence, transforming from clear to opalescent, sealing away the mirror's power to distort truth. <words>399</words>

Harlow felt his seasickness finally subside as the last of the orchid's light pulsed through the fortress walls, knowing that future travelers would find this place a beacon of clarity rather than confusion. <words>432</words>

He smiled, awkward yet sincere, as he realized he had finally found his land legs in this most unlikely of harbors, at the end of a rainbow canyon where secrets were not traded but finally, mercifully, laid to rest. <words>473</words>
