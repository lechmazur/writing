Eliza kneaded the dough with cynically gentle hands, her fingers pressing into the soft mass as she contemplated the pressed flowers hidden beneath her floorboards. <words>23</words>

The small-town baker had discovered them three months ago, vibrant blooms collected by her grandmother, preserved between the pages of an ancient grimoire that detailed how certain plants carried the seeds of contagion. <words>51</words>

"When shadows learn to speak," the text had warned, "the flowers will bloom again, and the world will change." <words>69</words>

Tonight, as moonlight spilled through her kitchen window, Eliza heard the whispers—her own shadow stretching across the wall, murmuring secrets of a tyrant who ruled from beyond time. <words>95</words>

The Mayor, they called him, though he was no ordinary official; he traveled through centuries, planting discord like seeds, harvesting fear, and Eliza's town was next on his list. <words>124</words>

She had been tracking moon patterns for months, noting how the lunar cycles corresponded with historical calamities, each disaster occurring precisely when the moon reached a specific phase in relation to certain constellations. <words>153</words>

Her calculations had to exceed those of the previous time travelers who had failed to stop him; their notes, scattered through history, had eventually found their way to her. <words>181</words>

Wrapping the bread in cloth, Eliza locked her bakery and walked to the edge of town where an abandoned gas station had been converted into something far more peculiar: an emergency time machine garage, operated by a mechanic who claimed to be from the 23rd century. <words>224</words>

"The flowers," she told him, placing the pressed specimens on his workbench, "contain a frequency that disrupts his temporal signature." <words>242</words>

The mechanic nodded, his eyes reflecting starlight as he carefully embedded the flowers into the machine's control panel. <words>258</words>

"Your motivation must remain pure," he cautioned, adjusting dials that seemed to bend reality around them. <words>273</words>

"To dethrone a tyrant isn't about vengeance," Eliza replied, "it's about freeing time itself." <words>287</words>

As she stepped into the chamber, her shadow detached slightly, whispering encouragement that sent chills down her spine. <words>304</words>

The machine hummed to life, a mystical reality forming around her as centuries began to blur—medieval castles rising and falling, industrial revolutions spinning past in smoke and steel, future cities glimmering briefly before dissolving into light. <words>339</words>

She clutched her basket of specially prepared bread, infused with the essence of those pressed flowers, knowing the Mayor would never suspect a simple baker to be his undoing. <words>367</words>

The time machine shuddered to a halt in a grand hall where the Mayor was hosting a feast across time, attendees from every era dining under his watchful eye. <words>394</words>

Eliza straightened her apron, her shadow now completely silent as if holding its breath, and stepped forward with her basket of bread that contained both ancient magic and future science—the perfect temporal trap for a tyrant who had ruled for far too long. <words>434</words>

As the Mayor reached for a slice, the pressed flowers hidden in the dough began to glow, and Eliza knew that some seeds, once planted, could never be uprooted—except by those who understood that time, like bread, required both patience and precise timing to master. <words>477</words>
