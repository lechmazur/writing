Elias sat cross-legged in the hush of a barn loft just after sunrise, his battered old skateboard covered in stickers resting across his lap. <words>21</words>

He traced the worn edges with calloused fingers, each sticker a memory from before everything changed. <words>37</words>

The workshop below him hummed with the gentle whirring of brass gears and the occasional hiss of steam valves releasing pressure. <words>56</words>

"The end isn't dramatic," he said to no one in particular, his voice carrying the calm certainty that had earned him the nickname "the Doomsayer" among the remaining townsfolk. <words>82</words>

"It's just the slow unwinding of what we thought would last forever." <words>94</words>

Elias had been faithfully odd his entire life, collecting predictions like others collected coins or stamps, recording them in a leather-bound journal with meticulous care. <words>119</words>

The morning light filtered through dust motes, illuminating the copper pipes and mechanical contraptions that filled his steampunk workshop below – a sanctuary he'd built after the world began its gentle collapse. <words>149</words>

He set the skateboard aside and moved to the loft window, watching as the golden light spilled across the abandoned fairgrounds where he'd spent his childhood. <words>174</words>

The loss of innocence hadn't come all at once but in increments: the closing of schools, the gradual exodus of neighbors, the day his parents didn't return from the city. <words>204</words>

Through the sound of a distant train whistle, memories flooded back – of laughter, of scraped knees, of believing adults knew what they were doing. <words>227</words>

The whistle faded, and with it, his reverie. <words>235</words>

It was time to resume his work. <words>241</words>

With placid ferocity, Elias descended the ladder to his workshop, each step deliberate, his face serene despite the determination burning in his eyes. <words>264</words>

The mechanical wings he'd been constructing for three years gleamed in the morning light, brass feathers interlocking with perfect precision. <words>283</words>

"Today," he whispered to the empty workshop, "I slam a door on the gods of stagnation." <words>297</words>

He'd watched everyone he loved either leave or surrender to quiet desperation, but he refused to join them in their resignation. <words>318</words>

Elias strapped the wings to his back, the weight familiar and comforting, then retrieved his skateboard from the loft. <words>336</words>

He would need the momentum of his childhood to launch himself into the unknown. <words>350</words>

Outside, he placed the skateboard at the top of the hill that overlooked the valley, the same hill where he'd learned to ride, to fall, to get back up. <words>380</words>

The train whistle sounded again, closer now, as if calling to him. <words>392</words>

Elias pushed off, the wheels of his skateboard clattering against the ground, his wings extending behind him, catching the morning light and the rising thermal currents. <words>417</words>

As the hill dropped away beneath him, he felt neither fear nor regret – only the certainty that in leaving behind the skeleton of his former life, he was not ending something, but finally, finally beginning. <words>456</words>
