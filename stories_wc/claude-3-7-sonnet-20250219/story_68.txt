Marcus navigated the reimagined ancient Roman marketplace, his neural implant scanning the digital auras surrounding each virtual merchant. <words>15</words>

His collection of bottle caps clinked softly in his pocket—physical anchors to remind him of the real world while he worked in this historical simulation. <words>36</words>

Each cap represented a successful data recovery mission, souls he had rescued from digital oblivion. <words>50</words>

Today's target was rarely common: a name deliberately erased from Imperial records, belonging to a woman history had labeled a monster. <words>69</words>

"Five minutes until your connection destabilizes," whispered Livia, his handler, through the comm link as Marcus approached a virtual scriptorium. <words>87</words>

He nodded, setting his timer to match the steeping of the ceremonial tea that anchored his consciousness during deep dives. <words>105</words>

The marketplace buzzed with activity—senators in togae praetextae bargaining with merchants, slaves carrying amphorae, and augmented historical figures programmed to interact with visitors. <words>127</words>

Marcus's moral code was simple: information deserved to be free, especially when it revealed truth about the marginalized. <words>143</words>

He approached a weathered data node disguised as a temple scribe, his fingers dancing across invisible keyboards as he bypassed the first layer of security. <words>165</words>

"Her name was deliberately struck from the Senate records after the uprising," Marcus muttered, working through encryptions dating back to actual Roman ciphers. <words>185</words>

The system recognized his intrusion, sending digital centurions marching through the forum. <words>197</words>

Marcus ducked into an alley, pulling out a broken rake handle he'd brought into the simulation—his most valuable hacking tool. <words>216</words>

To casual observers, it appeared to be merely a discarded implement, but along its splintered surface, tiny inscriptions contained compressed code sequences that could breach even the most secure historical archives. <words>244</words>

"Two minutes," Livia reminded as Marcus traced his finger along the third inscription. <words>256</words>

The marketplace began to shimmer, reality bleeding through as his connection weakened. <words>267</words>

He found the file—sealed, condemned, and buried beneath layers of historical revisionism. <words>280</words>

"I see her now," he whispered, "not the monster they claimed, but a woman who led slaves to freedom." <words>297</words>

With practiced precision, Marcus executed the final command to adopt the forbidden data, transferring it to his secure server. <words>314</words>

The marketplace began to dissolve around him as the tea completed its steeping in the physical world. <words>330</words>

"Did you get it?" Livia asked as Marcus's consciousness returned to his body, the taste of chamomile lingering on his tongue. <words>349</words>

With confident uncertainty—knowing the information was correct but unsure of its consequences—Marcus nodded, adding another bottle cap to his collection. <words>369</words>

"Her name was Vibia Perpetua," he said, "and history will no longer call her monster but remember her as she truly was—a mother, a scholar, a liberator." <words>397</words>

Tomorrow, her story would flood the networks, humanizing the monster that Imperial propaganda had created, restoring dignity to a name wiped from history. <words>419</words>

Marcus smiled, running his thumb over his newest bottle cap—this one from a vintage Italian soda—knowing that sometimes the greatest act of rebellion was simply remembering. <words>444</words>
