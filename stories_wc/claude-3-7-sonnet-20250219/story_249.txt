The Tooth Collector prowled the slick streets of the city of forgotten fountains, his face now bare to the world after years behind a mask. <words>21</words>

Marcus had never intended to become a vigilante, but his lazily ambitious nature had led him down an unusual path—one where minimal effort could yield maximum results. <words>45</words>

At the pause between raindrops, when the city held its breath and time seemed suspended, he would emerge from his apartment above Gianelli's Barbershop. <words>69</words>

The antique dentist's drill hung from his belt, not as a weapon but as a reminder of his grandfather's profession and the strange inheritance that had sparked his peculiar collection. <words>97</words>

"Traditional games require traditional tools," his grandfather had whispered before passing, leaving Marcus with both the drill and an unfinished collection of children's games from around the world. <words>124</words>

Tonight, Marcus leaned against a weathered fountain basin, its waters long dry, listening to the harmonies drifting from the barbershop's back room where the Fountain City Four practiced their quartet arrangements. <words>155</words>

He had discovered, quite by accident, that analyzing gossip from barbershop quartet rehearsals provided the perfect intelligence network—four men from different neighborhoods, sharing stories between songs about who had what treasures hidden away. <words>187</words>

The quartet's tenor had mentioned old Mrs. Abernathy's attic containing a hand-carved Mancala set from colonial West Africa, and Marcus intended to lure the widow into parting with it. <words>216</words>

Not through theft—his vigilantism had never been about taking, but about preserving what others had forgotten to value. <words>233</words>

The rain paused again, droplets suspended around him like tiny crystal lenses, each reflecting a fragment of the city's forgotten beauty. <words>253</words>

Marcus smiled, feeling the cool air on his unmasked face, a freedom he had only recently allowed himself after realizing that anonymity had been another mask—one of fear rather than protection. <words>284</words>

The art of resilience, his grandfather had taught him, wasn't about fighting against the current but finding the hidden eddies where one could float with minimal exertion. <words>312</words>

He crossed the square, passing another fountain where copper children eternally chased each other in a game of tag, frozen in verdigris and memory. <words>335</words>

Tomorrow, he would visit Mrs. Abernathy with flowers and stories, offering to repair her leaking sink—a small kindness that might open the door to her attic treasures. <words>362</words>

The barbershop quartet's voices swelled behind him, singing about moonlight and memories, as Marcus mentally cataloged his collection: hopscotch stones from Greece, knucklebones from Mongolia, spinning tops from Japan—each game a window into childhood joy across cultures and centuries. <words>399</words>

In this city where water once flowed freely through stone mouths and cupped hands, Marcus had found his purpose in preserving another kind of flow—the stream of play that connected generations. <words>431</words>

As the rain began again, he twirled the antique drill between his fingers, a habit that had replaced the nervous energy once spent maintaining his vigilante persona, and walked homeward with the hidden whimsy of a man who had found his true calling not in justice, but in joy. <words>478</words>
