Harlan adjusted his telescope on the floating observatory, the gentle hum of machinery silently audible in the vacuum of his pressurized dome. <words>20</words>

The lone trapper of cosmic phenomena had been stationed here for three years, collecting data between shifts while other astronomers slept. <words>39</words>

He reached into his pocket and pulled out the piece of sea glass, its edges worn smooth by time and salt, much like his own rough edges had been worn by solitude. <words>65</words>

The glass had been his daughter's final gift before the accident that took her from him, its aquamarine hue matching the Earth's oceans as viewed from his orbital perch. <words>92</words>

"Time to recommence," he whispered to himself, sliding the microfilm into the reader he'd smuggled aboard. <words>107</words>

By decoding microfilm from shady archives, Harlan had discovered something the Space Agency wanted hidden—evidence of intelligent signals emanating from the event horizon of the black hole he'd been studying. <words>136</words>

The data scrolled across his screen, patterns emerging that reminded him of his daughter's laughter—chaotic yet perfectly ordered. <words>153</words>

His motivation wasn't glory or scientific recognition; he sought to siphon radiance from a black hole of doubt, to find meaning in the cosmic void that mirrored his grief. <words>181</words>

The observatory rotated slowly, bringing the massive black hole into view, its accretion disk shimmering like a deadly rainbow. <words>199</words>

Harlan had lost everything earthbound, but up here, suspended between stars, he'd found the upside of loss—freedom from expectation, from pretense, from the crushing weight of normal human interaction. <words>229</words>

He pressed his sea glass against the viewport, watching how it caught and refracted the distant starlight, creating tiny prisms that danced across his weathered face. <words>253</words>

The microfilm contained coordinates, frequencies, and mathematical proofs suggesting that consciousness could be encoded in gravitational waves—perhaps his daughter's consciousness, preserved somehow in the fabric of spacetime. <words>281</words>

"Ridiculous," he muttered with a half-smile, even as he adjusted his instruments to the exact specifications. <words>296</words>

Between shifts, when the observatory was officially dormant, Harlan conducted his real work—sending messages into the black hole using modulated tachyon bursts, waiting for responses that defied conventional physics. <words>326</words>

The sea glass warmed in his palm as if alive, and sometimes he swore it pulsed in rhythm with the signals he received. <words>347</words>

His quarters were sparse but for star charts and the odd collection of space debris he'd gathered during EVA missions—a gritty museum of cosmic curiosities that brought him whimsical comfort. <words>376</words>

Tonight, as Earth rose over the lunar horizon, the microfilm revealed its final secret—a pattern matching his daughter's DNA sequence encoded in the radiation signature of the black hole. <words>403</words>

Harlan laughed, a sound both broken and hopeful, as he realized that in seeking to decode the universe's greatest mystery, he had found a way to reconnect with what he'd lost. <words>432</words>

He placed the sea glass on his console, watching as it seemed to glow with an inner light that couldn't possibly exist, much like the impossible hope now rekindling in his heart. <words>463</words>

"I hear you," he whispered to the void, to the black hole, to his daughter, as the silently audible hum of the cosmos seemed, just for a moment, to whisper back. <words>491</words>
