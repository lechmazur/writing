Eliza oscillated between the gnarled apple trees, her fingers tracing the bark as she followed the silver moon paths that only she could see. <words>21</words>

The enchanted orchard whispered secrets that most would never hear, but Eliza was a vivid dreamer even while awake, perceiving layers of reality others missed. <words>43</words>

Behind her, marble guardians creaked to life, their stone eyes tracking her unauthorized midnight wandering with mechanical precision. <words>59</words>

"They're slow tonight," she muttered with dour amusement, calculating exactly how many seconds she had before the living statues would corner her. <words>79</words>

In her pocket, her pressed penny collection clinked softly—thirty-seven flattened discs, each one bearing the image of a different constellation, collected from machines at observatories across the country. <words>107</words>

She was rationally mischievous in her approach, never breaking rules without purpose, always weighing consequences against potential discoveries. <words>124</words>

Tonight's trespass was her most significant yet, standing at the threshold of an apology she knew she would eventually need to offer her grandfather, the orchard's keeper, but one that would have to wait. <words>156</words>

For fifty years, her grandfather had been the patient guardian of this place, tending the trees that bore impossible fruits and keeping curious townsfolk away from the orchard's center. <words>184</words>

"The center holds the balance," he'd always told her, but last week, while organizing his astronomical journals, Eliza had discovered pages torn out, star charts deliberately altered, and references to something called "The Grand Deception." <words>222</words>

The moon slipped behind clouds, temporarily dimming her path, but Eliza had memorized the pattern of light needed to reach the orchard's heart. <words>245</words>

A statue lunged, missing her by inches as she ducked beneath an ancient pear tree heavy with luminescent fruit. <words>264</words>

"Sorry," she whispered to the guardian, not meaning it, her mind fixed on unraveling what she now suspected was the ultimate cosmic deception—that the fruit from this orchard didn't merely heal, as local legend claimed, but altered human perception of reality itself. <words>303</words>

At the orchard's center stood a single tree unlike any other, bearing fruit that resembled tiny planets, complete with swirling atmospheres beneath their translucent skins. <words>330</words>

Eliza removed a pressed penny from her collection—the one bearing Orion's Belt—and placed it in a small depression in the tree's trunk that matched it perfectly. <words>357</words>

The ground trembled as the tree's roots lifted, revealing a staircase descending into earth that smelled of stardust. <words>375</words>

Down below, she found her grandfather seated before a control panel of living wood and crystal, manipulating what appeared to be the very fabric of the night sky above their town. <words>404</words>

He turned slowly, unsurprised, his eyes reflecting constellations that didn't exist in any earthly sky. <words>419</words>

"I wondered when you'd figure it out," he said, gesturing to the empty chair beside him, "The universe needs new guardians, and dreamers make the best deceivers." <words>444</words>

Eliza sat down, the apology she'd rehearsed dying unspoken on her lips as understanding dawned—this wasn't a deception to be exposed, but one that required protection. <words>471</words>

The penny collection in her pocket hummed with newfound purpose as her grandfather began to explain how they had been maintaining humanity's comfortable illusions about their place in the cosmos for generations. <words>500</words>
