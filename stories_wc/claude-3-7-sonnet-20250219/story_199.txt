Park Ranger Eliza patrolled the urban orchard on the repurposed highway overpass, her badge gleaming under the artificial sun. <words>17</words>

The trees, genetically modified to bear fruit year-round, swayed in the manufactured breeze as she made her rounds through what humanity had salvaged after the last human dream was dreamt. <words>43</words>

It had been fifty years since the collective unconscious had gone silent, since people stopped dreaming altogether, leaving only the waking world and its harsh realities. <words>67</words>

Eliza clutched her plain notebook, its worn cover hiding her grandmother's secrets—transcriptions of dreams from the before-time, collected and preserved like precious artifacts. <words>90</words>

Her grandmother had been a dream-keeper, one of the last to experience the vivid nocturnal journeys that once connected humans to something greater than themselves. <words>114</words>

The orchard felt familiarly unknown today, as if something had shifted in the carefully maintained ecosystem that she couldn't quite identify. <words>133</words>

Temperatures fluctuated unnaturally around certain trees, rising and falling in patterns that defied the climate control systems. <words>149</words>

Eliza had become overzealous in her duties lately, checking and rechecking the orchard's parameters, convinced that these anomalies were messages. <words>171</words>

"There's something here," she whispered to herself, flipping through her notebook to compare readings from previous days. <words>187</words>

Her grandmother's final entry described a dream of a goddess whose voice could be heard in the rustling of leaves, whose breath could be felt in sudden temperature changes. <words>215</words>

Eliza's motivation wasn't merely scientific curiosity—she sought to catch the echo of a goddess, to prove that something of the dream world still lingered in reality. <words>242</words>

Through chance encounters with visitors to the orchard, she had collected stories of momentary sensations: whispers heard between heartbeats, glimpses of movement seen only in peripheral vision. <words>270</words>

The urban orchard existed in a state of chaotic organization, wild nature constrained by human design, much like Eliza's meticulous notes scrawled in increasingly frantic handwriting. <words>295</words>

Today, an elderly man sat beneath an apple tree, his eyes closed in what appeared to be peaceful meditation. <words>312</words>

"Do you feel it?" he asked without opening his eyes as Eliza approached. <words>324</words>

"The fluctuations," she replied, not questioning how he knew she was there. <words>336</words>

"She's trying to break through," the man said, finally looking at her with eyes that seemed to reflect a sky Eliza had never seen. <words>358</words>

He touched her notebook, and suddenly the pages filled with new writing—dreams that hadn't been dreamt by humans but by the earth itself, by the trees, by the very air. <words>387</words>

Eliza realized then that her grandmother hadn't merely recorded dreams; she had been translating the language of a goddess who still spoke, even when no one was listening. <words>415</words>

As the orchard's temperatures rose and fell around them like breathing, Eliza understood that her overzealous protection of this place had been guided by something beyond herself—the last goddess of dreams, waiting for someone to hear her echo in the spaces between waking moments. <words>458</words>
