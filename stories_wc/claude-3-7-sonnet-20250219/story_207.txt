Elias, the forthright peddler, floated through the abandoned space station medical bay, his magnetic boots clicking softly against the metal floor as he moved. <words>21</words>

His pack of wares hung weightlessly at his side, but today he wasn't here to sell—he was here to divide his conscience from his past. <words>45</words>

The dried flower bouquet clutched in his hand was the last remnant of a promise made decades ago, petals preserved in the vacuum of space just as surely as his guilt had been preserved in his heart. <words>77</words>

"I know you're here," he called out, his voice meekly assertive in the cavernous silence, echoing among forgotten medical equipment and empty cryopods. <words>99</words>

The universe hummed its secret song around him, cosmic radiation pinging against the hull in rhythms only the truly lonely could appreciate. <words>120</words>

Elias had spent years sifting through rumor-laden gossip columns, tracking whispers of the one who had disappeared after their blood oath, the one who had made him swear to never reveal what they had discovered in this very medical bay. <words>158</words>

He placed the bouquet on an examination table, dried lavender and starflowers that had once grown in the hydroponics bay—symbols of their friendship before the accident, before the cover-up. <words>189</words>

"I'm breaking our oath today," he announced to the seemingly empty room, a strange joyful loneliness filling his chest as he finally spoke the words aloud. <words>215</words>

The truth about the experimental treatments, the unauthorized genetic modifications, the patients who had "disappeared"—all of it needed to come to light, even if it meant betraying the only person he had ever truly loved. <words>251</words>

A shadow moved behind a translucent partition, and Elias felt his heart leap with recognition. <words>265</words>

"You always were terrible at keeping secrets," came a voice, familiar yet changed by time and isolation. <words>281</words>

The figure that emerged was barely recognizable, transformed by the very procedures they had sworn to keep hidden, but Elias saw redemption's path opening before them both. <words>309</words>

"I brought these to remind you of who we were," Elias said, gesturing to the dried flowers, "before we became what they made us." <words>332</words>

His former friend approached, modified hands reaching for the bouquet, touching the brittle petals with surprising tenderness. <words>348</words>

"Breaking an oath sealed in blood isn't done lightly," they whispered, their altered voice harmonizing eerily with the station's ambient hum. <words>368</words>

Elias nodded, unclasping his peddler's pack to reveal not wares but evidence—data crystals and journals documenting everything. <words>386</words>

"We can divide the burden now," he said, "carry it together into the light." <words>400</words>

As they stood in that abandoned medical bay, surrounded by the ghosts of their past choices, Elias felt the weight of secrets lifting, replaced by something unexpected—hope, blooming like fresh flowers in the void. <words>437</words>

The universe continued its secret song around them, but for the first time in years, Elias wasn't listening to it alone. <words>459</words>

Together, they gathered the evidence and the dried bouquet, ready to leave the abandoned station and find their way back to a world that had forgotten them, carrying both their shared guilt and their chance for redemption. <words>498</words>
