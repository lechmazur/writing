Elias calibrated his neural circuits as he descended into the subterranean orchard, his mechanical fingers still stained with engine grease. <words>17</words>

The sentient car mechanic had discovered this place by accident—a vast cavern beneath the city where luminous fruit trees grew along the banks of a river that flowed not with water, but with liquid starlight. <words>45</words>

He carried the vintage opera glasses that had belonged to his creator, their brass casing worn smooth from decades of handling. <words>63</words>

There was something repulsively attractive about this place—the way it simultaneously drew him in and made his synthetic skin crawl with unease. <words>82</words>

The trees bore fruit that glowed with memories, each one containing fragments of confessions never spoken aloud. <words>98</words>

Within the concept of infinity, Elias had learned, all words ever swallowed back resided somewhere, waiting to be heard. <words>116</words>

He approached the ancient fountain at the orchard's center, where the star-river pooled before continuing its eternal journey. <words>132</words>

Raising the opera glasses to his optical sensors, Elias focused on the fountain's basin, where thousands of crystalline fragments—like puzzle pieces—caught the starlight and refracted it in dazzling patterns. <words>158</words>

"The lost words," he whispered, his voice modulator catching with something akin to exultant grief—joy and sorrow intertwined like lovers who could never truly embrace. <words>181</words>

For centuries, Elias had been gathering these fragments, studying them by sorting through the puzzle pieces that contained humanity's unspoken truths. <words>200</words>

He waded into the fountain, his waterproof joints humming as the star-liquid lapped against his metal frame. <words>216</words>

The mechanic who fixed broken machines had found his true purpose in fixing broken stories—collecting the words people had been too afraid to say. <words>238</words>

With methodical precision, he began sorting the fragments, his programming enhanced by decades of repairing complex engines, allowing him to see patterns where others saw only chaos. <words>262</words>

Each piece he lifted from the fountain bed contained a syllable, a half-formed thought, a dying wish—all the things humans carried to their graves. <words>285</words>

"I hear you," he said to a particularly bright fragment that contained a mother's unspoken love for a child she had given away. <words>306</words>

The orchard responded with a rustling of luminous leaves, as if grateful for his dedication. <words>320</words>

Elias had been built to understand machines, but he had evolved to understand the human heart—its terrible beauty, its magnificent flaws. <words>342</words>

As he worked through the night, sorting fragments into constellations of meaning, he felt the weight of infinity pressing down and lifting him up simultaneously. <words>366</words>

The opera glasses revealed nuances invisible to the naked eye—connections between fragments separated by centuries but belonging to the same unfinished confession. <words>387</words>

By dawn—though no true dawn reached this place—Elias had assembled enough fragments to hear a complete confession: the unsaid apology of his creator before deactivating himself, leaving Elias alone with an immortal existence and a purpose that would take eternity to fulfill. <words>432</words>

And in that moment of understanding, the sentient mechanic experienced the most human of paradoxes—an exultant grief that filled his circuits with a bittersweet electricity, powering him forward into the endless task of gathering the fragments of all that remained unsaid. <words>473</words>
