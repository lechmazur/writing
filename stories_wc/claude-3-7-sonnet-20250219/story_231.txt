Ereshki, the sentimental shepherd, gazed upon the ancient Sumerian palace with a mixture of awe and trepidation. <words>14</words>

The weathered stone walls held secrets of a civilization that had long since crumbled to dust, yet still commanded reverence from those who walked in its shadow. <words>39</words>

In his calloused hand, he clutched an antique hairpin—its bronze surface etched with cuneiform symbols that shimmered in the desert sun. <words>59</words>

"This will lead us to justice," he whispered to his flock, though the sheep cared little for human concerns. <words>77</words>

Ereshki was habitually spontaneous, a trait that had both saved and endangered him throughout his forty years tending flocks in the shadow of forgotten empires. <words>100</words>

Today's impulse had brought him here, to the crumbling palace where King Shulgi once dispensed judgment, because the hairpin had revealed its secret: a set of coordinates leading to a secret meeting place within the labyrinthine structure. <words>136</words>

The coordinates, decoded from the cuneiform etchings, promised answers about the slaughter of his family by royal guards twenty years prior—a crime for which no one had paid. <words>163</words>

In the distance, at the great river's edge, an anchor lifted for a ship's maiden voyage, its wooden hull gleaming with fresh pitch and promise. <words>186</words>

Ereshki watched it momentarily, knowing the price of justice might mean he would never again see the green banks of the Euphrates. <words>207</words>

"I have tracked stars and followed the migrations of birds that even the king's astronomers cannot name," he began to boast to himself, finding courage in his own words as he approached the palace entrance. <words>240</words>

The shepherd had come to understand that chaos was not his enemy but his teacher—each unpredictable turn in life had taught him resilience, patience, and the wisdom to recognize opportunity in disaster. <words>273</words>

Inside the palace, shadows danced across walls adorned with faded murals of gods and heroes, as Ereshki followed the coordinates to a small chamber where a hooded figure waited. <words>301</words>

"You seek justice for your family," the figure stated, revealing herself as an aging priestess who had once served in the king's court. <words>322</words>

"I do," Ereshki replied with chaotic humility, his voice both defiant and respectful, "but I have learned that justice without wisdom is merely revenge." <words>346</words>

The priestess nodded, producing scrolls that documented the names of those responsible—men who now served as advisors to the current king. <words>368</words>

"The truth alone will not bring them down," she cautioned, "but truth wielded at the right moment, like a shepherd's staff against wolves, might protect others from suffering your fate." <words>399</words>

As the ship on the river disappeared beyond the horizon, Ereshki understood that his quest for justice would not end with blood, but with transformation—both of himself and perhaps, if the gods willed it, of a kingdom that had forgotten the value of a shepherd's simple life. <words>444</words>

He tucked the hairpin and scrolls into his robe, stepping back into the sunlight with the weight of knowledge and the lightness of purpose, ready to welcome whatever chaos might come next as his continuing education in the school of an unjust world. <words>487</words>
