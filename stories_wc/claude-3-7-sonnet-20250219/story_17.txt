Eliza Blackwood hunched over her laptop in the dim light of what most would call a basement, but what she preferred to term her "incantation chamber." <words>21</words>

The walls, lined with genealogical charts and family trees, glowed faintly under the black light she used to reveal hidden ink on forged documents. <words>43</words>

She sipped lukewarm tea from a chipped bowl—a family heirloom that had survived five generations but not her clumsy hands last Tuesday. <words>63</words>

The bowl was atypically typical: ordinary in appearance but extraordinary in its resilience, much like Eliza herself. <words>79</words>

Her fingers zoomed across the keyboard as she cross-referenced birth certificates with death notices, constructing identities for clients who needed to disappear or appear from nowhere. <words>103</words>

"Another day, another dollar earned through deception," she muttered, the weight of her chosen profession sitting heavy on her shoulders. <words>121</words>

Eliza had become the most sought-after black market genealogist in three states, crafting perfect paper trails by analyzing the subtext in funeral eulogies to build convincing backstories. <words>147</words>

She could tell more about family dynamics from what remained unsaid in a three-minute remembrance than most could glean from years of therapy sessions. <words>170</words>

The morning sun began to filter through her narrow basement windows, signaling it was time for her daily ritual. <words>188</words>

Amid morning walks through the cemetery behind her house, Eliza would contemplate the names on headstones and wonder about the legitimacy of the lives she had fabricated. <words>214</words>

Today's walk felt different; she stood on the brink of renewal, having decided last night that this would be her final falsification. <words>235</words>

Her latest client—a woman fleeing domestic violence—would be her last, a culmination of skills honed through years of ethical compromise. <words>256</words>

Eliza's business card read "Historical Research Specialist" with a brazen modesty that both acknowledged and concealed her true expertise. <words>274</words>

She stirred the contents of her chipped bowl, now filled with herbs and fragments of paper bearing her clients' original names—a witch's brew of identities she had altered. <words>301</words>

The ritual wasn't magic in the traditional sense, but it helped her process the guilt, a symbolic cleansing that she hoped would eventually lead to self-forgiveness. <words>328</words>

"I've helped people escape death, abuse, and persecution," she reminded herself, watching the papers dissolve in the liquid. <words>345</words>

Yet the faces of those who might have been hurt by her forgeries—creditors left unpaid, families searching for missing relatives—haunted her daily. <words>367</words>

As she completed her morning circuit through the gravestones, Eliza made a decision: she would use her skills to reconnect those she had helped disappear with the loved ones they had legitimately left behind. <words>399</words>

Her path to self-forgiveness wouldn't come from abandoning her craft but from redirecting it toward healing the very fractures she had helped create. <words>422</words>

The chipped bowl would become her talisman, a reminder that broken things could still serve a purpose, that damaged people could still do good in this world. <words>448</words>

Eliza returned to her incantation chamber, opened a new document, and began typing: "Finding Your Way Back: A Guide for the Intentionally Lost." <words>470</words>
