Eliza Thornfield, the most ruthless flower arranger in three counties, stood at the center of the ancient stone circle, her fingers clutching a scuffed plastic comb she'd found wedged between two monoliths. <words>30</words>

"This is it," she whispered, running her thumb over the comb's teeth as the folk singer at the summer solstice gathering paused between verses, creating a pocket of silence that seemed to amplify the stones' presence. <words>60</words>

The burden of watching had fallen to her after her grandmother's passing—the responsibility to observe the alignment of stars above this circle, to document the subtle shifts in shadow patterns across the weathered rock faces, to protect what others dismissed as mere prehistoric curiosities. <words>96</words>

"You're intellectually spontaneous, Eliza, just like your grandmother," her colleague Marcus had told her yesterday, "which is precisely why you'll distinguish the authentic markings from the tourist graffiti." <words>124</words>

The folk singer inhaled, preparing for her next verse, while Eliza knelt beside the westernmost stone, where faint spirals and concentric circles had puzzled archaeologists for decades. <words>149</words>

She hadn't planned this midnight excursion—it had materialized during one of those rambling conversations on their impromptu road trip from London, when Marcus had mentioned a new technique for enhancing barely visible pigments in rock art. <words>182</words>

"Conventional archaeology has failed here," she'd declared with the polite anarchy that characterized her approach to both flower arrangements and academic pursuits, "because they're looking for meaning in isolation, not connection." <words>212</words>

The plastic comb, ordinary as it seemed, had the perfect edge for applying the solution without damaging the stone's surface—another serendipitous discovery from their highway discussions about repurposing everyday objects for conservation work. <words>243</words>

As the singer's voice remained suspended in the night air, Eliza carefully applied the solution to a section of rock that had always drawn her eye, feeling the weight of generations of watchers before her. <words>276</words>

"The burden isn't just observation," her grandmother had told her, "it's understanding what you're seeing when others see nothing." <words>295</words>

The liquid seeped into microscopic crevices, and under her LED light, previously invisible red ochre markings began to emerge—a star map that aligned perfectly with the summer solstice sky eighteen thousand years ago. <words>327</words>

"Marcus," she called softly, her voice blending with the first notes of the singer's returning melody, "we've found it." <words>345</words>

He joined her, their shadows merging against the ancient stone as they decoded what generations of watchers had protected—a celestial calendar predating all written language, preserved through millennia by those who understood that some knowledge belongs not to individuals but to humanity itself. <words>385</words>

The comb in her hand caught the moonlight as she traced the newly revealed patterns, thinking how her ruthlessness in flower arranging—her insistence on perfect alignment, on harmony between elements that others would never combine—had prepared her for this moment of revelation. <words>425</words>

As the singer's voice swelled again, filling the stone circle with sound, Eliza felt the burden of the watcher transform into something lighter—the privilege of connection across time, of being one link in an unbroken chain of those who look up at the same stars and seek to understand their place beneath them. <words>476</words>
