Elias, an understudy sorcerer at the Academy of Whispered Arts, bowed with excessive formality to his mentor as she left the salt crystal growing chamber. <words>21</words>

"Thank you most graciously for this tremendous opportunity, Madam Vex, and might I add that your new spectacles are absolutely becoming," he said, his obnoxiously polite manner making her roll her eyes as she departed. <words>53</words>

The moment she was gone, Elias dropped the act and scrambled toward the small cardboard box he'd hidden behind the largest salt formation. <words>75</words>

The box contained his contraband listening device, a conch shell modified with forbidden runes that could capture distant whispers. <words>93</words>

"Perfect timing," he muttered, glancing at the chamber's clock, which was synchronized with the academy's laundry cycles to ensure minimal staff presence amid the washing and drying rotations. <words>118</words>

Elias had discovered that the salt crystal growing chamber, with its perfect acoustics and mineral resonance, could amplify his listening device's capabilities tenfold. <words>139</words>

He positioned the shell carefully against the largest crystal, its spiral opening aligned precisely with the formation's natural growth pattern. <words>158</words>

His thesis on tracking cultural evolution through magical residue had hit a dead end until he'd stumbled upon references to "the unheard" – ancient consciousness trapped within the oldest living things. <words>189</words>

The academy elders had forbidden such research, claiming it was dangerous to wake these dormant entities, but Elias couldn't resist the academic glory that would come from such a discovery. <words>217</words>

As the laundry machines rumbled in the distance, marking the midpoint of the cycle, Elias closed his eyes and focused his consciousness through the shell, eavesdropping on the whispers of an ancient oak grove miles away. <words>250</words>

The voices came slowly at first – murmurs of root and soil, of sunlight and rain – but then something shifted, a note of playful dread entering the whispers as the trees realized they were being heard. <words>284</words>

"Hello, little listener," came a voice like rustling leaves, "how kind of you to wake us after all this time." <words>303</words>

Elias felt a chill despite his excitement; he hadn't expected them to detect his presence. <words>318</words>

"We've been so lonely," the voice continued, "and you've been so... helpful." <words>332</words>

Suddenly, salt crystals began growing rapidly around his feet, anchoring him to the spot. <words>346</words>

"What's happening?" he gasped, his scholarly ambition giving way to fear as he realized his eavesdropping had somehow connected the ancient consciousness to the salt chamber. <words>371</words>

"We've been hindered for centuries," the voice explained with terrible cheerfulness, "but you've provided such a lovely bridge between worlds." <words>391</words>

As the crystals climbed his legs, Elias understood too late: in his quest to track cultural evolution, he had instead facilitated an invasion. <words>414</words>

The salt formations throughout the chamber began pulsing with an inner light, each crystal becoming a conduit for the awakened consciousness. <words>433</words>

"Don't worry," whispered the ancient voice as the academy's laundry cycle buzzed to completion, "we'll be ever so polite as we reclaim what was once ours." <words>458</words>

Elias could only watch, trapped in growing crystal, as the small cardboard box that had started it all was the last thing to be consumed by the awakening salt. <words>487</words>
