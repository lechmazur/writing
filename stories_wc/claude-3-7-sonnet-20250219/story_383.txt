General Thorne slumped into the vinyl booth of the Dark Matter Diner, his uniform hanging loosely on his frame like a flag on a windless day. <words>21</words>

The waitress slid a plate of dried seaweed crisps toward him—the only menu item he could stomach these days. <words>39</words>

"Between rides again?" she asked, nodding toward the teleportation pad outside where travelers materialized between cosmic jumps. <words>54</words>

Thorne nodded, his eyes fixed on the black-and-white photographs lining the diner walls, each capturing moments of joy that seemed to belong to another lifetime. <words>76</words>

"Those were taken before the Quantum Wars," he said, gesturing to a particularly striking image of children playing in what used to be the Andromeda Colony. <words>97</words>

The waitress—Mira according to her nametag—slid into the seat across from him, her eyes twinkling with mischievous wisdom. <words>115</words>

"You know what's rationally absurd, General?" she asked, tapping a photograph of Earth's last sunset. <words>129</words>

"That we fight wars across galaxies but can't conquer the battlefield in our minds?" Thorne replied, surprising himself with the candor. <words>148</words>

Mira laughed, a sound like distant wind chimes. <words>156</words>

"I was going to say that we serve seaweed in space, but your answer is better." <words>172</words>

The diner hummed with the soft murmur of travelers, each carrying their own anxieties across the cosmos. <words>188</words>

"I used to command fleets," Thorne said, his voice barely audible above the ambient noise of the diner. <words>204</words>

"Now I command nothing, not even my dreams." <words>212</words>

Mira reached across the table, her fingers tracing an arc across one of the photographs—a wedding where the bride's smile seemed to defy gravity. <words>233</words>

"These pictures," she said, "they're doorways, not just memories." <words>243</words>

Thorne felt something stir within him as he studied the arcs of movement captured in the frozen moments—dancers mid-leap, birds in flight, lovers embracing. <words>266</words>

"Each arc tells a story of renewal," Mira continued, her voice taking on an almost musical quality. <words>281</words>

"We all come here between rides, General, carrying our shared anxieties like luggage." <words>294</words>

She pointed to various patrons—a diplomat clutching reports, a terraformer with soil-stained hands, a poet scribbling furiously. <words>309</words>

"But look at these photographs—they remind us that fear is a usurper on the throne of reason." <words>325</words>

Thorne felt his breath catch as he truly saw the images for the first time—not as relics of a lost past but as blueprints for possibility. <words>349</words>

"How do I dethrone my fear?" he asked, his voice stronger now. <words>361</words>

Mira smiled and slid a small camera across the table. <words>371</words>

"Start capturing arcs, General—moments of transition, of becoming." <words>381</words>

As the teleportation pad outside flashed with new arrivals, Thorne picked up the camera, feeling its weight—lighter than his medals, heavier than his regrets. <words>405</words>

He aimed it at the swirl of cream dissolving in his coffee, finding unexpected beauty in the spiral. <words>422</words>

"The universe doesn't move in straight lines," Mira said, rising from the booth. <words>435</words>

"Neither should we." <words>438</words>

As Thorne left the Dark Matter Diner that day, camera in hand, he felt something he hadn't experienced since before the wars—the quiet thrill of renewal, of becoming a student of arcs rather than a general of lines. <words>478</words>
