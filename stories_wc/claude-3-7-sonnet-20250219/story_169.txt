Mortimer Vex adjusted his silver cufflinks as the floating tea platform gently bobbed above the Whispering Sea. <words>15</words>

"Welcome to your potential new residence," he announced to his client with practiced humility that somehow managed to sound impressive. <words>32</words>

The platform—a magnificent structure of reclaimed driftwood and salvaged glass—had been Mortimer's most challenging acquisition in his three centuries as a soul-broker real estate agent. <words>54</words>

His client, a displaced spirit named Eleanor, drifted weirdly static in the center of the main parlor, her form neither fully here nor elsewhere. <words>76</words>

"This property offers unparalleled opportunities for those seeking to reconnect with the ethereal plane," Mortimer explained, gliding toward an antique cabinet where a dusty wine bottle stood among other curious vessels. <words>103</words>

Eleanor's translucent eyes narrowed with suspicion, but Mortimer knew the art of persuasion required patience, especially when dealing with souls who had lost their way throughout recycling. <words>130</words>

"You mentioned wanting to learn forgotten songs," he said, his voice dropping to a reverent whisper as he lifted the ancient bottle. <words>149</words>

The label, faded and peeling, contained symbols that most would dismiss as decorative, but Mortimer had spent lifetimes learning to read reversed labels on dusty glass bottles—a skill essential to his peculiar profession. <words>181</words>

"This residence exists at the confluence of memory and melody," he continued, carefully turning the bottle to decipher its secrets. <words>199</words>

Eleanor's form flickered with interest as Mortimer began to choreograph an elaborate sequence of movements, his fingers tracing patterns in the air that matched the ancient script he was translating. <words>227</words>

The platform responded, creaking and shifting as if awakening, while teacups in the cabinet began to ring with delicate, crystalline notes. <words>247</words>

"The previous occupant was a composer of celestial harmonies," Mortimer explained, his movements growing more fluid as the music strengthened. <words>266</words>

Eleanor's static form began to pulse in rhythm with the emerging melody—a song that had been lost when the last library of Alexandria burned. <words>290</words>

"The platform remembers every note ever played upon it," he said, completing his translation dance with a flourish that sent ripples across the wooden boards beneath them. <words>316</words>

Eleanor's essence expanded with wonder as the full symphony manifested around them, her static quality dissolving into flowing light. <words>334</words>

"I've shown countless properties to wandering souls," Mortimer admitted with a bow that was both humble and grand, "but rarely have I seen one respond so perfectly to its potential resident." <words>364</words>

The dusty wine bottle hummed in his hands, its contents—not wine but distilled memories—swirling with renewed purpose. <words>382</words>

"The price, as discussed, is modest by immortal standards," Mortimer said, setting down the bottle. <words>397</words>

"One century of creative contribution to the collective consciousness, and the deed transfers to you." <words>413</words>

Eleanor's form solidified slightly as she extended what might have been a hand, and Mortimer smiled, knowing he had successfully matched another lost soul to its perfect eternal home. <words>443</words>

As they sealed their agreement, the floating tea platform rose higher above the misty waters, and somewhere in the distance, a chorus of forgotten voices joined the rediscovered song that would now never be lost again. <words>478</words>
