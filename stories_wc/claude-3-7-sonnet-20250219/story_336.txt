Mortimer adjusted his weathered hands on the astronomical clock, a relic he'd salvaged from the ruins of what locals claimed was an ancient Persian palace reimagined in the heart of Tehran. <words>27</words>

The mechanism had ceased its rhythmic ticking precisely during the hush after a car backfired in a silent street three nights ago, startling him from a rare moment of peace. <words>53</words>

As the city's longest-serving undertaker, Mortimer had buried enough souls to populate a small nation, each grave deepening the lines on his face and the hollowness behind his eyes. <words>79</words>

"The dead keep their secrets," his predecessor had whispered decades ago, passing down the tribal knowledge that had sustained generations of their morbid profession—wisdom rarely practical yet somehow essential. <words>106</words>

The astronomical clock was said to imprison the souls of ancient astronomers who had mapped the heavens with such precision that the gods themselves grew jealous. <words>130</words>

Mortimer's fingers traced the intricate golden pathways that charted celestial movements, each groove representing how the ancients had tracked destiny by following sun paths across azure skies. <words>154</words>

The palace where the clock had originally hung was described in manuscripts as having ceilings that mirrored the night sky, where kings contemplated mortality beneath painted constellations. <words>180</words>

In the silence of his workshop, surrounded by the tools of his trade—embalming fluids, silk shrouds, and polished caskets—Mortimer worked with placid ferocity to restore the timepiece. <words>207</words>

His determination wasn't born from horological passion but from something deeper: to hold onto hope in the absolute dark that had enveloped him since his daughter's passing. <words>233</words>

The clock, with its ability to predict eclipses and planetary alignments, represented continuity in a universe that had shown him only endings. <words>254</words>

As dawn approached, Mortimer aligned the final gear, his movements deliberate despite his trembling hands. <words>268</words>

The mechanism stuttered, then hummed to life, golden planets resuming their eternal dance around the brass sun. <words>284</words>

He remembered the Persian inscription his translator had deciphered: "Time imprisons all but those who understand its nature." <words>301</words>

Perhaps that was why he felt such kinship with the clock—both he and it were vessels containing the accumulated wisdom of countless transitions between life and what follows. <words>329</words>

Outside, the city began to stir, unaware of the small miracle occurring in the undertaker's workshop. <words>345</words>

Mortimer stepped back, watching as the clock's hands swept forward, measuring moments that would never return. <words>361</words>

In his profession, he had learned that death was not the opposite of life but its companion, just as this astronomical marvel measured not just hours but the grand cosmic cycles that dwarfed human existence. <words>396</words>

The weary undertaker smiled for the first time in years, understanding finally that his work—like the ancient astronomers'—was to help others transition with dignity through the greatest mystery of all. <words>426</words>

As morning light filtered through dusty windows, illuminating motes that danced like distant stars, Mortimer felt the weight of his profession shift from burden to purpose. <words>451</words>

He would continue to prepare the dead with the same precision that the clock measured the heavens—not because it would change the inevitable, but because in doing so, he honored the brief, brilliant flare of each life against the vast darkness. <words>491</words>
