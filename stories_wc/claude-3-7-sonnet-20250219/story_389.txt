Malvern Thorne adjusted his cashmere sweater over faded jeans as he descended into the abandoned mine, his thin lips pressed into a determined line. <words>21</words>

The formally casual attire was his trademark—a calculated contradiction, much like the man himself. <words>36</words>

As the last day of December waned above ground, Malvern knew the timing was critical; when the final calendar page of the year was flipped, the forgotten library hidden within these tunnels would reveal its secrets for precisely one hour. <words>70</words>

The warlock's slender fingers traced the rough-hewn walls, following markings that only those versed in ancient runes could comprehend. <words>89</words>

"It must be here," he muttered with absolute certainty, though he'd never been to this place before. <words>105</words>

His lantern illuminated what generations of miners had unknowingly built around—a vast chamber whose walls were lined with rotting bookshelves and water-damaged tomes. <words>129</words>

Malvern moved with purpose toward a stone pedestal where a wooden fragment lay—unmistakably the snarling visage from a viking ship figurehead, its paint long faded but its power undiminished. <words>158</words>

The fragment was said to be the key to locating all lost artifacts of the Old World, scattered across continents after the Great Sundering. <words>182</words>

Placing the figurehead upon a specific mark on the floor, Malvern withdrew three discredited textbooks from his leather satchel—works denounced by the Arcane Academy as dangerous nonsense. <words>210</words>

"They call it nonsense because they fear what I might optimize," he whispered, his confidence unwavering despite the questionable nature of his sources. <words>231</words>

The warlock had spent decades piecing together rumored cures for humanity's greatest affliction: ignorance. <words>245</words>

He arranged the books in a triangle around the figurehead fragment and began an incantation that would activate the location spell—a spell that would reveal the whereabouts of the Omniscient Orchard, whose fruit contained all knowledge ever lost to time. <words>285</words>

His mentors had warned against such pursuit, insisting that some knowledge was hidden for good reason, but Malvern's hunger to gorge on the fruit of knowledge had only grown with each caution. <words>319</words>

The chamber began to hum as dust particles danced in the lantern light, and ancient pages from the surrounding shelves fluttered as if caught in an unfelt breeze. <words>347</words>

Malvern's thin lips curled into a smile as the figurehead began to glow, projecting a map onto the cavern ceiling—a map that both confused and thrilled him with its impossible geography. <words>378</words>

"It exists in the spaces between spaces," he realized, understanding with perfect clarity something that should have been incomprehensible. <words>397</words>

As midnight struck and the new year began, Malvern Thorne stepped through a doorway that hadn't existed moments before, driven by an insatiable desire to feast upon wisdom that no mortal was meant to digest. <words>432</words>

Behind him, the forgotten library began to collapse, burying the discarded textbooks and the now-dormant figurehead fragment—tools that had served their purpose in a quest that would either elevate Malvern to godhood or reduce him to less than dust in the cosmic library of existence. <words>479</words>
