Agent Eliza Reed stared at the unfamiliar reflection in the cracked mirror of her safehouse bathroom, wondering when her face had become a stranger's. <words>21</words>

The neural implant surgery had altered her features just enough to infiltrate the Nexus Corporation, but not enough to erase the melancholy in her eyes that had lingered since Marcus's betrayal. <words>46</words>

She peeled an unused sticky label from her forearm—the last remnant of her medical procedure—and flicked it into the waste recycler, curiously indifferent to the pain of removing it. <words>71</words>

Pain had become an old friend in the three years since she'd discovered Marcus was a double agent, his love a carefully crafted lie. <words>92</words>

The holographic notification hovering above her wrist reminded her that tonight's rendezvous with her informant was scheduled in thirty minutes, barely enough time to prepare herself for the underbelly of New Shanghai's futuristic city slums. <words>123</words>

The Forgotten District, they called it—a labyrinth of abandoned arcologies and crumbling infrastructure beneath the gleaming megastructures, where the city's outcasts made their homes in the shadows of progress. <words>150</words>

Eliza had connected with her informant, a local named Jin, through a shared interest in urban exploration, their digital correspondence filled with maps of forgotten tunnels and decommissioned power stations. <words>177</words>

She slipped into her chameleonic coat, its fabric shifting to match the grime and neon of the slums, and headed out into the perpetual twilight of the lower levels. <words>203</words>

The meeting point was an ancient noodle shop, its proprietor one of the few who still cooked with real ingredients instead of molecular assemblers. <words>225</words>

Jin was already waiting, his eyes lighting up at the sight of her false face, unaware that her interest in him was purely professional—another manipulation in a life built on lies. <words>252</words>

"You're just in time," he said, gesturing to the steaming bowls before them, "Chef Wong has finally perfected his synthetic protein ramen recipe after fifteen years of experimentation." <words>277</words>

At the instant the new recipe was finally tasted, Eliza's implant pinged—the Nexus security protocols had been breached, her extraction window opening. <words>298</words>

She savored the umami explosion on her tongue, a moment of genuine pleasure in a life of fabrications, even as her mind calculated the fastest route to the extraction point. <words>325</words>

The data Jin had unwittingly provided would bring down the corporation responsible for the deadly avalanche of synthetic intelligence that was slowly consuming human autonomy—the very avalanche she was racing to outrun. <words>355</words>

"What's that smile for?" Jin asked, misreading her expression. <words>363</words>

She couldn't help but gloat, just a little, knowing that by this time tomorrow, Nexus would be in chaos and Marcus would finally understand who had bested him. <words>390</words>

"Just enjoying the moment," she replied, her voice steady despite the adrenaline beginning to course through her veins. <words>406</words>

As she finished her meal, Eliza contemplated the rambling destiny that had led her here—a lovelorn spy finding purpose in vengeance, now standing at the precipice of either salvation or destruction for a world she barely recognized as her own. <words>443</words>

She left payment on the table, enough for both meals and then some, a silent apology to Jin for the deception and a thank you for the unexpected friendship that had momentarily pierced her armor. <words>475</words>

Tomorrow would bring revolution or ruin, but tonight, in this fleeting moment of authentic connection, Eliza allowed herself to believe that perhaps not all reflections were meant to be familiar. <words>500</words>
