Elara twisted through the water, her limbs creating perfect arcs as she danced in her oversized clawfoot tub. <words>17</words>

The bubble bath was her nightly ritual, the only place where the weight of denial couldn't follow her quite so heavily. <words>37</words>

She reached for the small metallic patch she always kept on the bath's edge, running her fingers over the alien symbols from the Proxima Centauri mission that had crashed spectacularly three years ago. <words>65</words>

Her sharp wit had earned her a position at the Cognitive Resonance Institute, but her linguistic ineptitude had prevented her from deciphering the patch's message like her colleagues could. <words>93</words>

Instead, she would mimic the movements she'd observed the ship making before its descent, her dancer's body intuitively understanding what her mind could not translate. <words>118</words>

The bathroom walls shimmered and dissolved around her, the institute's thought experiment chamber activating as it detected her brainwaves reaching the necessary frequency. <words>140</words>

"Simulation 47-B initiated," announced the system as Elara's bath transformed into a pool of data, the bubbles becoming floating variables in the experimental space. <words>163</words>

Her grandmother had been the first to discover the connection between movement and the alien language, a secret she'd protected by disguising her research as nothing more than a family tradition of taking yearly photos of seemingly random dance poses. <words>201</words>

Each generation added one pose to the sequence, unknowingly building a physical vocabulary that would someday respond to the visitors when they returned. <words>225</words>

Elara felt the familiar saturated ambivalence wash over her—pride in carrying forward her family's legacy mixed with resentment at the burden of a prophecy she hadn't chosen. <words>254</words>

The final prediction, recorded in her great-great-grandmother's journal, stated that the seventh generation would complete the communication sequence during "the floating time," which Elara had interpreted as her bubble baths. <words>289</words>

Water dripped from her elbows as she held the patch above her head, her body contorting into the last pose her mother had photographed before passing away. <words>316</words>

The patch began to glow, responding to the precise angle of her limbs and the specific gravity of the water supporting her weight. <words>338</words>

As the chamber filled with a soft blue light, Elara realized the twist in the prophecy—it wasn't about communicating with returning aliens but becoming the translator between worlds. <words>366</words>

The denial she had carried—that her dancing was merely art rather than destiny—dissolved as the patch projected a star map onto the bathroom ceiling. <words>391</words>

Her body knew what to do next, moving through water and light to complete the sequence her family had been building for generations. <words>414</words>

As she finished the final movement, the patch disintegrated into the bath, its particles swirling around her like a galaxy being born. <words>435</words>

The prophecy fulfilled itself with the unexpected twist: Elara wasn't summoning them back—she was becoming the beacon that would guide humanity forward, her linguistically inept mind finally understanding that some languages are spoken not with words but with the poetry of motion. <words>477</words>
