Finnegan the bard stumbled across the tectonic ridge, his lute bouncing awkwardly against his back as loose stones skittered beneath his feet. <words>20</words>

The brass doorplate he'd stolen from Death's own threshold weighed heavily in his pocket, its engraved warning—"ABANDON HOPE, SPECIFIC APPOINTMENT TIMES ONLY"—pressing against his thigh like a guilty conscience. <words>45</words>

He'd never been one for careful planning, preferring to improvise his way through life with slapdash charm and half-remembered ballads, but stealing from Death required at least some forethought. <words>71</words>

"Grandmother always said the boundary between worlds thins at plate edges," he muttered, scanning the barren landscape where two massive sections of earth grudgingly met, neither yielding nor truly connecting. <words>97</words>

The hourglass tattooed on his wrist had begun to glow, signaling that Death had turned his own timekeeping device to begin the hunt; Finnegan had only until the last grain fell and reset to complete his possibly impossible task. <words>132</words>

His family had picnicked at this exact spot for seventeen generations, not for pleasure but necessity—a tradition that maintained the seal between realms, though most had forgotten why they came. <words>161</words>

Finnegan unfolded the checkered cloth with uncharacteristic reverence, arranging bread, cheese, and wine in the precise pattern his mother had taught him, his usual chaotic nature temporarily subdued by the weight of ritual. <words>191</words>

"To disrupt Death's pursuit, one must honor life in the places where worlds collide," he recited, the words feeling ancient on his tongue as he poured wine into the cracked earth. <words>221</words>

The ground trembled beneath him, a reminder that this sacred space existed in constant flux, neither fully stable nor completely unpredictable—much like Finnegan himself. <words>244</words>

He laughed with unexpected lightness, a sound that carried both joy and sorrow across the windswept ridge; he might die today, but at least he'd die free. <words>271</words>

The brass doorplate began to hum, its metal warming until Finnegan could no longer keep it in his pocket, forcing him to place it at the center of his makeshift picnic. <words>301</words>

It sank into the earth like a stone into water, ripples of golden light spreading outward as the boundary between realms momentarily dissolved. <words>324</words>

"I didn't expect that to actually work," Finnegan whispered, his voice caught between wonder and terror as the doorplate reappeared, now embedded in stone and bearing his name crossed out beneath Death's. <words>356</words>

The hourglass on his wrist froze, neither empty nor full, suspended in perfect balance as the tectonic plates beneath him shuddered and then stilled. <words>380</words>

Death would not claim him today—the picnic offering and sacred space had bought him time—but Finnegan understood with melancholic clarity that he had merely postponed the inevitable while binding himself more tightly to it. <words>416</words>

He strummed his lute, composing a new ballad on the spot, one that spoke of temporary victories and permanent consequences, singing with a voice that carried both triumph and resignation across the ancient boundary he had temporarily sealed. <words>452</words>

As the sun set over the ridge, Finnegan packed up his picnic, leaving only the embedded doorplate behind, and walked away with the peculiar freedom of a man who had cheated death but would forever bear its mark. <words>487</words>
