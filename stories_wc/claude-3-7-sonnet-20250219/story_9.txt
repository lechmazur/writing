Cassandra stumbled through the maze of billboards, her fingers tracing the edges of the pocket puzzle box with its thirteen locks. <words>19</words>

"Oh, sure, just wander aimlessly between lost years where time doesn't even bother to keep track of itself," she muttered to the empty neon-lit desert. <words>41</words>

The soothsayer had been mildly panicked since receiving the box from a client who'd vanished in a puff of probably unlikely smoke—which was saying something, given how many improbable things she'd witnessed in her line of work. <words>75</words>

Cassandra's gift of foresight was both blessing and curse, especially when the visions came with no instruction manual and a healthy dose of existential dread. <words>99</words>

"Environmental stewardship," she'd told her last client with molten sarcasm, "is probably unlikely when humanity can't even steward its own breakfast without creating three types of waste." <words>127</words>

The maze of advertisements loomed above her, hawking products from eras that overlapped impossibly—1950s cigarettes beside 2030s neural implants, all bathed in the harsh glow of neon that turned the sand beneath her feet into a kaleidoscope of unnatural colors. <words>166</words>

She finally spotted it—the dive bar that existed in all times and no time, its weathered sign proclaiming "The Last Drop" in flickering letters. <words>192</words>

Inside, the bartender—ageless, faceless in the shadows—nodded as she approached the battered wooden bar top, its surface marked with countless water rings left by patrons throughout the centuries. <words>222</words>

"I need to read," she said simply, placing the puzzle box on the counter. <words>234</words>

The bartender slid her a glass of water without a word, and Cassandra placed it deliberately on the wood, creating a fresh ring that began to intersect with ancient ones. <words>264</words>

"To shape destiny with bare hands," she whispered, "one must first understand the patterns." <words>278</words>

She passed her palm over the water ring, using her gift to magnify what others couldn't see—the microscopic connections between past and future embedded in the wood grain. <words>305</words>

The water rings began to glow faintly, revealing sequences, numbers, patterns that corresponded to the thirteen locks on her puzzle box. <words>326</words>

"Well, isn't this just peachy," she drawled, fingers working the tiny mechanisms. "Save the world by solving a cosmic Rubik's cube while time itself takes a coffee break." <words>354</words>

With each lock that clicked open, visions flooded her mind—oceans rising, forests burning, but also hands planting trees, communities building sustainable cities, futures branching like rivers. <words>382</words>

The final lock yielded with a soft click, and the box unfolded like a lotus, revealing a single seed glowing with inner light. <words>405</words>

"Of course," Cassandra sighed, pocketing the seed. "Because subtle metaphors are clearly lost on cosmic forces." <words>420</words>

She left payment on the counter—a coin from a kingdom that wouldn't exist for another century—and stepped back into the billboard maze, now seeing it for what it truly was: a map of human desire, consumption, and potential redemption. <words>458</words>

The seed pulsed in her pocket as she navigated toward the exit, toward the world that needed planting, toward a future she could finally see clearly enough to help shape. <words>490</words>
