Elias stood at the farmers market, watching the woman who shared his face haggle over apples. <words>14</words>

He'd discovered his twin sister's existence only after their mother's death revealed adoption papers with a name: Mira Thorne. <words>32</words>

The baseball in his pocket—allegedly signed by a time traveler from 2157—weighed heavily as he contemplated approaching her directly. <words>50</words>

Instead, he'd hired actors to befriend her, gathering intelligence on the woman who might hold the other half of his fractured identity. <words>70</words>

The baseball was typically unique among his mother's possessions, its inscription warning of an apocalyptic event that would befall twins born under the Gemini eclipse. <words>92</words>

Crystal shadows danced across the market stalls as clouds passed overhead, casting an ethereal glow on the bustling scene. <words>110</words>

Mira moved through the crowd with purpose, unaware that her brother watched from behind a display of homemade jams. <words>128</words>

His phone buzzed—a message from Cassandra, the actress he'd hired: "She's heading to Raven's Peak tonight. Alone." <words>145</words>

The mysterious mountain peak had featured in their mother's journals, described as a nexus of temporal energy where the veil between realities thinned. <words>166</words>

Elias knew he had to follow, to finally confront the forbidden knowledge their mother had kept from them both. <words>184</words>

That night, amid the farmers market bustle below, Elias climbed the treacherous path to Raven's Peak, guided only by moonlight and determination. <words>205</words>

The air grew thin as he ascended, his lungs burning with each step toward the truth that might save or condemn them both. <words>227</words>

At the summit, he found Mira kneeling before a stone altar, the baseball—identical to his own—rotating impossibly above her outstretched hands. <words>248</words>

"You brought yours too," she said without turning, her voice eerily similar to his own. <words>262</words>

"How long have you known?" Elias asked, approaching cautiously, ready to subdue her if necessary—the prophecy had mentioned one twin sacrificing the other. <words>283</words>

"Since I hired actors to find you," Mira replied with a sad smile. <words>295</words>

The revelation stunned him—they'd both employed the same strategy, mirrors seeking mirrors. <words>308</words>

"Mother split us to prevent the prophecy," Mira explained, "but I believe together we can outlive it." <words>324</words>

Their clandestine meeting in this hidden location felt predestined, the mountain peak humming with ancient energy beneath their feet. <words>342</words>

"The time traveler who signed these baseballs was us," Mira whispered, "our future selves, trying to warn us that separation leads to destruction." <words>364</words>

As they placed their identical baseballs side by side on the altar, the signatures began to change, the apocalyptic warning fading into new words: "The twins united rewrite fate." <words>392</words>

The crystal shadows around them solidified, forming a protective dome as the prophecy's deadline passed without incident. <words>408</words>

In that moment, Elias understood that their shared identity wasn't something to fear but to embrace—two halves of a whole that, when united, could bend reality itself. <words>435</words>

As dawn broke over the farmers market below, the twins descended together, no longer seeking to uncover their identity but ready to forge a new one beyond the constraints of prophecy. <words>465</words>

The baseballs remained on the mountain, a paradox waiting for their future selves to find and sign, completing a circle that had never truly begun or ended. <words>492</words>
