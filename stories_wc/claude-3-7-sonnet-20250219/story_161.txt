Elias Thornberry, a vigilant orchardist by trade, arrived precisely at 8:00 AM at the Aerodynamic Solutions paper airplane test facility. <words>17</words>

He was never tardy, not since the accident that claimed his wife's life when a late arrival meant missing her final moments. <words>38</words>

"Welcome back, Mr. Thornberry," said the receptionist with practiced cheerfulness that failed to mask her curiosity about the peculiar man who had been volunteering throughout the summer. <words>60</words>

Elias nodded curtly, his calloused fingers clutching an antique letter seal—his wife's family heirloom—which he carried everywhere as both talisman and tool. <words>82</words>

"I'll demonstrate the new prototype today," he announced with a hint of sardonic glee, knowing they still thought him merely an eccentric retiree rather than someone methodically unraveling conspiracies within their organization. <words>112</words>

The facility, ostensibly researching efficient paper airplane designs for educational purposes, was actually a front for something far more sinister—a fact Elias had suspected since noticing peculiar shipping manifests while delivering his orchard's apples to their cafeteria. <words>147</words>

He moved through the testing chamber, setting up his seemingly innocent experiment while surreptitiously photographing classified documents with a microcamera hidden in his seal. <words>170</words>

"My design incorporates natural aerodynamic principles," Elias explained to the gathering engineers, "specifically via the patterns in a peacock's tail—nature's perfect example of both beauty and functional design." <words>198</words>

What the engineers didn't realize was that the peacock pattern contained a cipher—each eye spot corresponding to a document he'd identified as suspicious over his three months of volunteering. <words>227</words>

"Notice how the airflow creates stability," he continued, launching a paper plane that executed a perfect arc before landing precisely on the desk of the facility's director. <words>252</words>

The director smiled nervously, unaware that the plane's decorative peacock pattern was actually mapping the company's illicit weapons research connections. <words>272</words>

Elias felt that familiar twist of sardonic glee as he watched them admire his craftsmanship, completely oblivious to his true purpose. <words>293</words>

To overcome a personal tragedy, some people attend therapy; Elias had chosen to dismantle the very organization whose negligent shipping practices had caused the truck accident that killed his wife. <words>323</words>

"The beauty of paper," he remarked, pressing his antique seal against a demonstration sheet, "is that it always retains impressions, even when people think the evidence has been destroyed." <words>351</words>

The seal left behind not just its decorative imprint but also transferred microscopic tracking particles onto every document it touched. <words>370</words>

As the facility staff applauded his presentation, Elias bowed slightly, the weight of his grief momentarily lightened by purpose. <words>389</words>

That evening, as he tended to his orchard's trees with the same vigilance he applied to his investigation, Elias received confirmation from his contact at the federal investigation bureau—they had enough evidence to move forward. <words>424</words>

Tomorrow, he would arrive at precisely 8:00 AM, never tardy, to witness the culmination of his elaborate plan—not with sorrow, but with the sardonic glee of justice finally taking flight. <words>456</words>
