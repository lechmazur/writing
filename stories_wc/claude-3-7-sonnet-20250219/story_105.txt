Professor Elias Thorne clutched the seashell to his chest, its strange symbol pulsing with an ethereal glow that matched his racing heartbeat. <words>21</words>

The symbol—a spiral within a spiral—was said to mirror the soul of whoever held it, revealing truths too painful to face in ordinary light. <words>45</words>

"It's time," he whispered to himself, his voice carrying a strangely trustworthy quality that had always made students confide in him, even as colleagues shunned his unconventional theories. <words>71</words>

The outcast scholar had spent decades piecing together fragments of forgotten lore, all leading to this moment in Madame Vorna's flying carpet garage—the last place anyone would expect to house a portal to the other side. <words>107</words>

Elias moved carefully through the suspended carpets that hung like ghostly sentinels, their tassels swaying in an unfelt breeze, each one tagged with repair notes and ownership sigils. <words>136</words>

The witch had granted him access reluctantly, her eyes narrowing as she'd said, "Midnight only lasts so long, Professor—prove your theory before the hour passes, or the doorway seals for another century." <words>170</words>

In the hush of a half-lit corridor at the back of the garage, Elias knelt before a wall of ancient tiles, his fingers tracing the patterns until he found the one that felt slightly warmer than the others. <words>210</words>

A jolt of energy shot through his fingertips as he pressed the tile, causing it to slide inward, revealing a small cavity where a stack of leather-bound diaries lay hidden. <words>242</words>

The diaries—written by seven different scholars across seven centuries—had been secreted here, in what was now a public restroom adjacent to the garage, each author adding their discoveries before passing the knowledge forward. <words>279</words>

With trembling hands, Elias opened the topmost journal, its pages filled with observations of the seashell's power to bridge worlds when the veil between realms thinned at midnight. <words>309</words>

The frantic peace that had sustained him through years of ridicule and isolation began to dissolve as the seashell grew warmer, its symbol now projecting onto the wall like a film reel of his deepest memories. <words>345</words>

"Show me," he commanded, his voice steady despite the chaos in his mind. <words>357</words>

The symbol expanded, creating a doorway of light that revealed not monsters or magic as his colleagues had mockingly predicted, but a perfect reflection of himself—younger, unburdened, standing in a sunlit field. <words>391</words>

Elias understood then that the portal wasn't to another world, but to the self he had lost in his obsessive quest—the seashell didn't open doors to other dimensions but mirrored the soul's true desires. <words>428</words>

As the clock tower outside struck the final toll of midnight, Elias stepped through the light, not to escape this world but to reclaim the joy he had sacrificed, proving that even the darkest midnight eventually yields to dawn. <words>469</words>
