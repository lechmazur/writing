The cranky oracle hunched over her abandoned terrarium, muttering incantations that no living soul had heard in centuries. <words>16</words>

"Fools, all of them," she hissed, watching the miniature desert landscape where exotic plants once thrived before her apprentice's neglect. <words>34</words>

The art of deception had always been her true talent, far more valuable than the prophecies clients thought they were paying for. <words>54</words>

Her gift—the ability to glimpse fragments of possible futures—was virtually rare, occurring in perhaps one person per millennium, but her skill at weaving half-truths around these visions was entirely self-taught. <words>82</words>

Tonight she would resettle in a new identity, as she had done countless times throughout her unnaturally long existence. <words>101</words>

She had discovered her next destination through the glimmer of battered dog tags in a pawn shop window three days ago—the tarnished metal somehow whispering coordinates to her sensitive mind. <words>130</words>

The secret society chamber awaited her beneath an unassuming bookstore in Prague, its ancient members unaware that their long-prophesied guide was about to arrive. <words>153</words>

She gathered her few possessions, knowing she must reach the designated meeting point under a fleeting golden sunset when the chamber's hidden entrance would briefly reveal itself. <words>179</words>

"They believe I come to serve them," she chuckled, carefully wrapping the terrarium in silk cloth. <words>195</words>

Her true motivation remained what it had always been: to chronicle ancient patterns that repeated through human history, recording them in a grimoire that had grown thick with observations over her many lifetimes. <words>227</words>

The society thought themselves keepers of secret knowledge, but they were merely another entry in her collection, another cycle of human folly to document. <words>252</words>

She slipped the dog tags around her neck—they had belonged to a soldier who had glimpsed her true nature decades ago in another life, another deception. <words>279</words>

With practiced hands, she applied her disguise: age spots faded under makeup, gray hair transformed to auburn, stooped posture straightened. <words>298</words>

"The candid deceit is in giving them exactly what they expect to see," she told her reflection, "while keeping what they truly need just beyond their grasp." <words>324</words>

The terrarium would serve as her focus object in the chamber, a seemingly innocent relic that actually contained soil from a hundred civilizations, each grain holding memories she could access during her divinations. <words>358</words>

As the sun began its descent toward the horizon, casting long shadows across her sparse apartment, she shouldered her bag and headed for the door. <words>384</words>

"Another century, another desperate group seeking answers," she sighed, locking the door behind her for the last time. <words>402</words>

The golden light of sunset painted the city in amber hues as she made her way through winding streets, her mind already composing the prophecies that would earn her place among the society's inner circle. <words>435</words>

They would welcome her as their savior, hang on her every cryptic word, never suspecting that she studied them like specimens in her long-abandoned terrarium. <words>460</words>

By midnight, she would be installed in their inner sanctum, beginning her chronicle anew, weaving truths and lies so seamlessly that even she sometimes forgot which was which. <words>489</words>
