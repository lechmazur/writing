Elias hunched over his desk, a meek necromancer who preferred the company of tomes to that of the living or dead. <words>17</words>

His fingers trembled as he held his beloved fountain pen with a broken nib, the only inheritance from his grandfather who had once been the most feared summoner in seven realms. <words>42</words>

The pen could no longer write in the world of ink and paper, but Elias had discovered it could still inscribe symbols in the air that only the deceased could read. <words>68</words>

Above him, through the crystal ceiling of the underground city of the goblins, he could hear the muffled sounds of goblin children at play, their shrieks and laughter filtering down like distant music amid playground sounds that made his work feel less lonely. <words>105</words>

The goblin king had granted Elias sanctuary in exchange for his peculiarly sincere promise: to decode a universal riddle that had plagued their civilization for centuries. <words>130</words>

"The tangled tapestry unravels only for those who see beyond sight," the ancient text had proclaimed, a puzzle that had driven seventeen previous royal advisors to madness. <words>156</words>

Elias traced patterns with his broken pen, watching as ghostly symbols hung in the musty air of his chamber, each one representing a thread in what he had come to understand was not merely a riddle but a map to something profound. <words>193</words>

The spirits he communed with spoke in whispers of a knowledge lost when the goblin ancestors retreated beneath the earth, a wisdom about the interconnectedness of all living things. <words>222</words>

For three years, Elias had studied, summoned, and contemplated, yet the answer remained elusive until this morning when he had walked through the fungal gardens and noticed something extraordinary. <words>249</words>

A single dewdrop clung to a luminescent mushroom, and through the way light reflects off a dewdrop, he saw the entire underground city mirrored in perfect miniature, but with pathways and connections invisible to the naked eye. <words>284</words>

In that moment of mystic simplicity, Elias understood—the tangled tapestry was not a metaphor but a literal description of the energy flows beneath the city, currents of ancient magic that the goblins had built upon without comprehending. <words>322</words>

With reverence, he raised his broken pen and began to trace what he saw in the dewdrop's reflection, calling upon the spirits to regain the lost knowledge of the goblin ancestors. <words>352</words>

The symbols glowed brighter than ever before, arranging themselves into a pattern that matched the city's layout but revealed hidden chambers and forgotten shrines where the magic had pooled for millennia. <words>383</words>

As the last symbol took its place, a resonance hummed through the caverns, and the playground sounds above momentarily hushed as every goblin felt the shift. <words>409</words>

Elias stood in awe as the tangled tapestry of energy became visible to all, flowing like luminous rivers through their city, connecting each goblin to their history, to each other, and to the earth that had sheltered them. <words>444</words>

In solving the riddle, the meek necromancer had not only fulfilled his promise but had helped the goblins rediscover their purpose—to be the guardians of these ancient flows, a role they had forgotten but would now embrace with the same peculiar sincerity that had guided Elias to their truth. <words>497</words>
