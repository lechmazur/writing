Lord Elias wandered through the endless corn maze, his steps as aimless as his life had become. <words>15</words>

The faded scarf around his neck—once vibrant crimson, now the color of dried blood—fluttered in the spectral breeze that perpetually haunted this plain. <words>37</words>

As a noble of the Seventh House, Elias possessed everything except purpose, his education and refinement rendering him naively sophisticated—knowledgeable about everything, yet understanding nothing of importance. <words>62</words>

The maze had existed since before the first creature developed sentience, or so the legends claimed; its patterns shifted with the phases of the three moons, confounding even the most determined explorers. <words>92</words>

"You appear lost, my lord," came a voice like autumn leaves crunching underfoot. <words>104</words>

Elias turned to find a figure wrapped in shadows, extending what appeared to be a small envelope. <words>119</words>

"An invitation," the figure explained, "to something spontaneous and, perhaps, illuminating." <words>130</words>

The noble accepted it with the practiced politeness of his station, though his eyes betrayed genuine curiosity for the first time in years. <words>150</words>

The invitation specified a rendezvous at the maze's center at midnight—a location Elias had sought unsuccessfully for days. <words>168</words>

"How shall I find it?" he asked, but the messenger had vanished, leaving only the scent of frost and fertile soil. <words>187</words>

For the first time since entering the maze, Elias felt something stir within him—intention, purpose, desire. <words>203</words>

He followed not the paths but the whispers of the corn, allowing intuition rather than logic to guide him through the labyrinth. <words>223</words>

When midnight arrived, so did Elias at the maze's heart, where a small gathering of similarly listless souls had assembled around a bonfire that cast no heat. <words>249</words>

"Welcome," said a woman whose eyes reflected starlight that wasn't there, "to the Ceremony of Intention." <words>264</words>

What followed was both ritual and revelation—each participant sharing their deepest unfulfilled desire, followed by shared laughter that seemed to crystallize those intentions into something tangible. <words>290</words>

Elias watched with ironic awe as these crystallized intentions rose like fireflies, illuminating the maze's true pattern from above. <words>308</words>

When his turn came, he found himself saying, "I wish to matter," and the simplicity of this desire provoked such genuine laughter from the group that Elias couldn't help but join them. <words>338</words>

Their shared laughter echoed across the haunted plain, temporarily silencing the whispers that had plagued it for millennia. <words>354</words>

As dawn approached, the participants dispersed, but Elias remained, studying the now-visible pattern of the maze—a perfect representation of consciousness emerging from chaos. <words>378</words>

He wrapped his faded scarf tighter around his neck and smiled, understanding now that the power of intention wasn't in achieving desires but in articulating them clearly enough that the universe might conspire to respond. <words>413</words>

The noble who entered the maze listless departed with purpose, carrying with him the ironic revelation that in this haunted place, predating sentience itself, he had finally discovered what it meant to be truly alive. <words>448</words>

And as the corn whispered his name, Elias realized that sometimes the most sophisticated understanding comes from the most naive of questions: not "What should I do?" but simply, "What do I want?" <words>482</words>
