Marcus carved the sugar with surgical precision, his fingers molding the crystalline sweetness into a perfect replica of his enemy's face. <words>17</words>

The rebellion had taken everything from him, but they couldn't take his art—his precisely creative way of exacting revenge. <words>35</words>

Each candy sculpture was a masterpiece of spite, left anonymously at strategic locations throughout the forgotten market where rebellion leaders gathered. <words>52</words>

The irony wasn't lost on him: using sweetness as his weapon, a counterattack against those who had turned his life bitter. <words>71</words>

As he worked, the forgotten locket hung heavy around his neck, containing the only image he had of his family before they were taken by the rebellion's "cleansing" operations. <words>97</words>

His fingers trembled slightly as he added the final details to General Krane's candy likeness—the man responsible for his family's disappearance and the one who might hold the key to the hidden continent Marcus's father had discovered in his cartography work. <words>134</words>

"Let them eat their own faces," Marcus muttered with ardent scorn as he placed the sculpture in a small box, alongside a cryptic note and the first photograph in the trail he had meticulously planned. <words>165</words>

The rebellion had buried his father's discovery of a landmass beyond the Western Seas, a continent rich with resources that could end their tyrannical control. <words>189</words>

Throughout the rebellion's five-year reign, Marcus had collected evidence, piecing together his father's research while maintaining his cover as a simple candy sculptor in the forgotten market. <words>215</words>

His plan was elegant: each leader would receive a candy effigy, consume it in their arrogance, and find a photograph leading them to the next, creating a breadcrumb trail of anonymous kindness that would ultimately expose their crimes to the public. <words>249</words>

The market, once vibrant before the rebellion, now stood as a shell of its former self, perfect for Marcus's clandestine operations. <words>269</words>

Stall owners who had survived the purges nodded respectfully as he passed, unaware that the quiet candy sculptor was systematically dismantling the rebellion from within. <words>292</words>

Marcus placed the first box at General Krane's favorite tea stall, knowing the man's sweet tooth would overcome any suspicion. <words>311</words>

The photographs would lead Krane through the market, past witnesses who would recognize him, to a final location where Marcus had arranged for the rebellion's atrocities to be projected for all to see. <words>341</words>

As he walked away, Marcus touched the locket, remembering his mother's words: "Kindness can be a weapon when offered to those who don't deserve it." <words>364</words>

His vendetta wasn't just about revenge—it was about revealing the hidden continent his father had died protecting, a land that could free everyone from the rebellion's grip. <words>393</words>

The final photograph in his trail would reveal the map to this new world, ensuring that even if Marcus didn't survive his mission, the truth would. <words>418</words>

As the sun set over the forgotten market, Marcus returned to his workshop, already planning tomorrow's sculpture, his heart filled with purpose and his mind with the sweet anticipation of justice. <words>447</words>

Sometimes, he reflected, the most devastating counterattack wasn't violence but truth, served with a spoonful of sugar and the patient precision of a man with nothing left to lose. <words>474</words>
