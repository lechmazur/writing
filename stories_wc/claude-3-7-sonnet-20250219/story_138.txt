Lord Everett Blackwood stood in the corner of the spontaneous combustion lab, watching the scientists with detached curiosity. <words>15</words>

Once the heir to a vast fortune, he was now merely a forgotten noble, his family name erased from society's memory after the scandal. <words>38</words>

The artificial hummingbird drone hovered near his shoulder, its emerald wings catching the fluorescent light as it recorded everything for his mysterious benefactor. <words>58</words>

"They don't know you're here, do they?" asked Dr. Mercer, approaching with a mysteriously obvious smile that suggested she had known all along who he truly was. <words>82</words>

Everett's phone buzzed with a text message, but he ignored it, knowing he had only until the next one arrived to complete his mission. <words>105</words>

"Candor doesn't suit a man in your position," he replied, his voice carrying the hollow recklessness of someone with nothing left to lose. <words>127</words>

Dr. Mercer's lab coat pocket bulged with old ticket stubs—evidence of the underground combustion demonstrations that had claimed seventeen lives last month. <words>148</words>

"I've come to cut through the illusions you've been selling to the public," Everett said, releasing the hummingbird drone to scan the room's contents. <words>170</words>

The tiny machine's camera captured everything: the modified ignition chambers, the illegal accelerants, the falsified safety reports. <words>187</words>

Another text message vibrated in his pocket—his window was closing. <words>197</words>

"Those ticket stubs you've been collecting," Everett nodded toward her pocket, "they're not just souvenirs, are they?" <words>214</words>

Dr. Mercer's face hardened as she realized the depth of his knowledge. <words>226</words>

"Each one represents a calculated risk, a person you deemed acceptable collateral damage in your pursuit of perfect spontaneous combustion technology." <words>246</words>

The lab's emergency lights suddenly flashed red as the hummingbird drone triggered the security system. <words>260</words>

"What you don't understand," Dr. Mercer hissed, backing toward her workstation, "is that some sacrifices are necessary for progress." <words>278</words>

Everett began to methodically remove the ticket stubs he had collected from the victims' families, arranging them in a precise pattern on her desk. <words>301</words>

"I've spent months gathering these, connecting the dots that everyone else missed," he said, completing the arrangement that would fortify his case against her. <words>324</words>

The pattern formed an undeniable timeline of premeditated negligence, each stub marked with a victim's name and a chemical formula. <words>343</words>

In this small moment of confrontation, the truth between them was laid bare with unexpected candor. <words>358</words>

"Your experiments weren't about advancing science," Everett said, "but weaponizing spontaneous combustion for the highest bidder." <words>374</words>

Dr. Mercer lunged for the alarm, but the hummingbird drone intercepted her, its tiny propellers whirring inches from her face. <words>393</words>

His phone buzzed one final time—the signal that authorities had received the drone's transmission and were on their way. <words>412</words>

"The truth was always there," Everett said, "mysteriously obvious to anyone who cared enough to look beyond the spectacle." <words>430</words>

As sirens wailed in the distance, he felt a weight lift from his shoulders—his family name might remain forgotten, but justice would not be. <words>453</words>

In the end, it wasn't wealth or status that gave his life meaning, but this moment of clarity amid the chaos, this small act of setting things right. <words>481</words>
