The phantom train ticket punch materialized in Elara's palm as she wandered through the abandoned spaceport hangar, its metal cold against her skin. <words>21</words> She had discovered it during a chance encounter at a farmer's market, nestled between heirloom tomatoes and artisanal cheeses, an object of ancient novelty that the vendor claimed had once belonged to a conductor on the lunar express. <words>63</words> The punch's brass edges were green with decay, yet the mechanism still worked with a satisfying click that echoed through the cavernous space. <words>86</words>

As a professional cuddler, Elara understood the power of touch, how it could heal wounds both visible and hidden, but she had never expected to find herself here, waiting in the hush before an acceptance speech begins. <words>123</words> The Interplanetary Comfort Guild award ceremony was minutes away, and she was the unlikely nominee. <words>138</words>

The hangar, once bustling with starships and travelers, now stood empty except for the makeshift stage and rows of chairs, its vastness unusually usual to those who remembered its former glory. <words>169</words> Elara paced, the ticket punch a talisman against her nerves, against the deep-seated prejudice she had fought her entire career. <words>191</words>

"Professional cuddling isn't real therapy," they'd say, their voices dripping with disdain. <words>203</words> "It's just paid affection for the lonely." <words>211</words>

But Elara knew better. <words>215</words> She had witnessed transformations, had held space for grief and joy, had navigated the unspoken rules of intimacy without crossing boundaries. <words>237</words> Her clients weren't just the touch-starved; they were survivors of the Martian dust storms, refugees from Neptune's moons, veterans of the asteroid belt conflicts—all seeking connection in a disconnected universe. <words>271</words>

The phantom punch had belonged to her grandfather, who had worked the rails when Earth was still the only home humanity knew. <words>292</words> He had been the first to scoff at her career choice, his prejudice rooted in generations of stoic self-reliance. <words>313</words>

"People should solve their own problems," he'd insisted before his passing. <words>324</words>

Now, as the audience filed in, Elara clicked the punch against her palm, imagining it marking a ticket to somewhere new. <words>346</words> She thought of her grandfather, of how she had overcome her own inherited bias against vulnerability, of how she had learned that strength sometimes meant asking for help. <words>376</words>

The lights dimmed, and a hush fell over the crowd. <words>386</words> Elara tucked the punch into her pocket and stepped toward the stage, ready to speak for those who sought comfort in a universe too vast for anyone to navigate alone. <words>420</words> In the silence before her name was called, she felt a peculiar peace—the knowledge that in this moment, in this decaying relic of humanity's reach for the stars, she had found her purpose: to punch tickets for journeys of healing that required no spacecraft at all. <words>473</words>
