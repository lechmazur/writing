The watchman stood at his post, his posture unwavering despite the strange surroundings of the giant beehive interior where he'd been stationed for three years now. <words>23</words>

His confidence had never faltered, even when the queen bee had selected him—a human—to guard her most precious secrets. <words>42</words>

Marcus ran his fingers along the cracked plastic ruler he always kept in his breast pocket, a reminder of his former life as a schoolteacher before the Great Pollination had changed everything. <words>69</words>

Throughout his coloring sessions with the larvae—a duty all hive guardians shared—he would use that ruler to draw perfect hexagons, teaching the young ones their heritage while fighting the echo of yearning for his human past. <words>103</words>

"Gentle strokes," he would instruct the bee children, his voice forcibly gentle despite the strength in his weathered hands. <words>120</words>

Today, however, was different; he had discovered something in the royal chamber that would change everything. <words>135</words>

Under the microscope in the hive's scientific sector, Marcus had noticed peculiar patterns in a fingerprint left on the queen's honeycomb throne—patterns that matched those of his long-lost daughter. <words>164</words>

The discovery sent waves of jubilant remorse through his body; joy at possibly finding her, regret for the years of separation. <words>185</words>

He had to mobilize, to act on this information before the drones erased all evidence during their cleaning ritual at dusk. <words>205</words>

As he carefully navigated the amber corridors, Marcus acknowledged the envy that had poisoned him for months—envy of the perfect community the bees had built, while human society had crumbled. <words>233</words>

He needed to hush the voice of envy that whispered he should stay, that he belonged here among the orderly hum and sweet-scented air. <words>257</words>

The larvae looked up from their coloring sheets as he passed, their compound eyes reflecting the golden light that filtered through the waxy walls. <words>279</words>

"I must find her," he whispered, clutching the ruler so tightly that another crack formed along its yellowed edge. <words>297</words>

The queen had known all along, he realized—had stationed him here so that one day he might discover the truth through his own vigilance. <words>323</words>

Marcus reached the communication chamber where pollen messages were dispatched to other hives across what was once called North America. <words>342</words>

With trembling fingers, he encoded his daughter's fingerprint pattern into a pollen packet, sending it to every outpost with a prayer that someone would recognize it. <words>367</words>

As the message launched into the afternoon sky, carried by worker bees, Marcus returned to his coloring session with the larvae, his heart lighter than it had been in years. <words>399</words>

"Today we'll color the world outside," he told them, his voice no longer needing to force gentleness as he sketched the horizon on their sheets with his broken ruler. <words>427</words>

The echo of yearning had transformed into a melody of hope, and as the young bees selected their colors—blues and greens long forgotten in this amber world—Marcus felt the last traces of envy dissolve into gratitude. <words>464</words>

Tomorrow he would continue his watch, confident not just in his duty to the hive but in the possibility that somewhere, beyond the waxy walls and humming air, his daughter was receiving his message and preparing to return to him. <words>500</words>
