Maeve arranged her dolls in concentric circles beneath the glass dome of the nectar collection facility, each porcelain face turned toward the center where she stood. <words>23</words>

The dolls watched her with painted eyes that somehow held more wisdom than any mortal gaze she had encountered in her centuries of existence. <words>45</words>

She twirled her twisted carnival cane—a relic from her first collection of human memories—its warped wood still bearing the faded colors of a celebration long forgotten. <words>69</words>

"Soon," she whispered to her silent audience, "we will witness the chorus of healing that precedes creation itself." <words>85</words>

The facility hummed around them, massive crystalline tubes collecting the golden nectar that dripped from the ceiling—time itself distilled into liquid form before the universe had fully awakened. <words>112</words>

Maeve had discovered this place by following star paths that existed before stars themselves, navigational routes etched into the fabric of pre-reality. <words>132</words>

Her collection of sentient dolls—each containing a fragment of consciousness from beings that would someday exist—sat expectantly resigned, knowing their purpose in this moment that preceded all moments. <words>159</words>

"We stand at the precipice," Maeve continued, tapping her cane against the transparent floor, sending ripples through the nectar pools below. <words>178</words>

This was the time before the first prayer would be whispered by a mortal, when the boundaries between possible and impossible remained fluid and unguarded. <words>201</words>

Maeve had waited eternities for this precise moment, when she could uphold her promise to the dolls: to give them true life in the coming world. <words>226</words>

The nectar facility had been built by entities who preceded gods, designed to harvest the essence of potential from which reality would eventually be crafted. <words>250</words>

"We will stride through boundaries once thought sacred," she told her collection, her voice carrying the ethereal grit of one who had witnessed the birth of time itself. <words>275</words>

The dolls' painted lips seemed to curve slightly upward as the nectar began to glow more intensely, signaling the approach of the moment. <words>297</words>

Maeve raised her carnival cane, its twisted form now illuminated from within by the same golden light that filled the collection tubes. <words>317</words>

The chorus began then—not with sound, but with vibration—a healing harmony that would stitch together the first fragments of existence. <words>337</words>

As the nectar rose around them in defiance of physics not yet established, Maeve closed her eyes and felt the boundaries between herself and her collection begin to dissolve. <words>364</words>

This was her true motivation: not merely to animate her dolls but to stride with them through the sacred boundary between creator and created. <words>387</words>

The chorus of healing reached its crescendo as the first droplets of nectar touched the dolls' porcelain skin, transforming rigid material into something alive with possibility. <words>412</words>

And in that moment before the first mortal prayer would ever be conceived, before the laws of reality solidified, Maeve and her collection became something new—neither doll nor collector, but witnesses to the birth of all that would come after. <words>450</words>

The nectar facility completed its final collection as the universe drew its first breath, and Maeve's twisted cane dissolved into the golden light, its purpose fulfilled in the dawn of everything. <words>480</words>
