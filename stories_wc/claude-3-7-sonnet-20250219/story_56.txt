Maxwell Thornton adjusted his silk tie, a practiced smile masking his unease as he navigated the reclaimed orchard farmland that now flourished inside the hollowed remains of the Apex Tower. <words>27</words>

The skyscraper had toppled during the Great Quake, but rather than demolish it, the city had transformed the horizontal glass-and-steel carcass into an urban agricultural wonder. <words>52</words>

"Just one more con," he whispered to the empty air beside him, knowing his invisible allies—figments of his imagination that nonetheless provided crucial confidence—were listening attentively. <words>75</words>

He moved with an energetically lethargic pace, a contradiction that had become his signature: appearing busy while conserving every ounce of actual effort. <words>96</words>

The blank price tag dangled from the rare "Quantum Apple" sapling he intended to sell to the orchard's wealthy proprietor—a tree that supposedly produced fruit capable of reversing aging, a complete fabrication Maxwell had spent weeks perfecting. <words>131</words>

His mark, Ms. Ellington, was due to meet him by the central fountain at precisely 3:15, the exact time her ancient computer system was scheduled to complete its weekly reboot. <words>159</words>

Maxwell knew from his research that during those vulnerable seconds of restart, the orchard's security cameras would momentarily go dark. <words>178</words>

He clutched his leather-bound portfolio containing falsified research papers, certificates of authenticity, and doctored photographs of celebrities allegedly rejuvenated by his miracle fruit. <words>201</words>

As he approached the meeting point, Maxwell's foot caught on an uneven solar panel, sending his portfolio tumbling to the ground, its contents spilling across the moss-covered marble. <words>229</words>

A woman with silver-streaked hair knelt to help gather the scattered papers, her fingers brushing against his as they both reached for the same dropped book titled "Botanical Miracles: Fact or Fiction." <words>260</words>

Their eyes met, and Maxwell felt something magnetize him to her gaze—not the practiced attraction he deployed on marks, but something genuine that disturbed his carefully maintained facade. <words>288</words>

"I'm Ellington," she said with a gentle harshness that suggested she'd weathered many storms, "and I suspect that tree you're selling is as authentic as this book you've written under a pseudonym." <words>319</words>

The computer monitors throughout the orchard flickered to life around them, security systems humming back online, and Maxwell realized with a sinking feeling that she had orchestrated their meeting to occur precisely at this moment of technological rebirth. <words>355</words>

"I've been tracking you for months," she continued, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Not to expose you, but because I need someone with your particular talents." <words>381</words>

She leaned closer, her expression softening. "I know about your abilities—how you can sense and communicate with energy patterns others dismiss as imagination—and I need you to bare a truth no one dares to handle about what's really growing in this orchard." <words>423</words>

Maxwell stood frozen, his carefully constructed world collapsing around him as he realized his invisible allies weren't figments at all, but something far more extraordinary—and Ms. Ellington was the first person who had ever truly seen him for what he was. <words>460</words>

"How did you know?" he asked, finally abandoning the script he'd rehearsed for weeks. <words>474</words>

"Because," she said, plucking the blank price tag from the sapling, "some things are too valuable to be given a price." <words>493</words>
