The lurking assassin watched through a paint-splattered camera lens as the transport pod docked at the baroque asteroid's main terminal. <words>17</words>

Each crystalline spire of the settlement glittered with borrowed starlight, casting prismatic shadows across the pockmarked surface. <words>32</words>

He adjusted his position behind an ornate column, carved with superficially profound quotations that the asteroid's founder had believed would inspire generations. <words>50</words>

"To seek truth beyond the veil of stars," read one such inscription that made the assassin laugh quietly to himself. <words>67</words>

Truth was simpler than that: everyone died eventually, he just expedited the process for certain individuals. <words>81</words>

The unforgiving road that had led him here was littered with the corpses of those who had crossed his employer, a journey measured in blood rather than distance. <words>105</words>

His target would arrive soon, when the bus driver completed the final route of the day—the last transport connecting this mining outpost to the central hub. <words>127</words>

The assassin studied the security grid via the pattern of a spider's web after rain, each droplet representing a sensor he would need to avoid. <words>148</words>

His neural implant processed the data, mapping safe passages through the terminal's defenses with cold precision. <words>162</words>

He wasn't here just for another kill; this assignment felt different, personal somehow. <words>174</words>

The target—a scientist who had discovered something in the asteroid's core—had information that could change everything. <words>189</words>

The assassin's handler had been uncharacteristically poetic during the briefing: "This knowledge is like cradling the dawn in trembling hands; beautiful, but impossible to hold for long." <words>215</words>

The terminal doors hissed open as the final transport arrived, disgorging weary miners and technicians. <words>228</words>

Among them walked his target, a slight woman with silver-streaked hair and eyes that darted nervously around the terminal. <words>244</words>

She knew she was being hunted. <words>249</words>

The assassin's fingers tightened around his weapon as he prepared to complete his mission, but something made him hesitate. <words>266</words>

Through his paint-splattered lens, he watched her clutch a small data crystal—her discovery, her dawn—with hands that indeed trembled. <words>284</words>

The baroque architecture around them seemed to pulse with anticipation, the ornate carvings witnessing another tragedy about to unfold on this lonely rock. <words>304</words>

He stepped from the shadows, decision made. <words>310</words>

"They sent me to kill you," he said simply, lowering his weapon. <words>320</words>

Her eyes widened, but she didn't run. <words>326</words>

"But I want to know what you found first." <words>334</words>

She studied him for a long moment before responding, "Something that makes all these superficially profound sayings actually mean something." <words>350</words>

The assassin smiled grimly. <words>353</words>

"Then perhaps it's time we both left this unforgiving road behind." <words>364</words>

As the terminal emptied and the bus driver logged the completion of his final route, two figures slipped away into the labyrinthine corridors of the asteroid, carrying between them a truth as fragile as the first light of dawn. <words>400</words>
