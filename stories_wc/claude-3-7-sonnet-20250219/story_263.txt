Beneath the aquamarine dome of Coralline, the last reef city on Earth, Mira adjusted her breathing apparatus and gripped her toxin-tipped dagger. <words>21</words>

She was a zealot assassin for the Oceanic Preservation Front, convinced that eliminating key polluters was the only path to salvation. <words>40</words>

Today's target was visiting during the city's famous guided nature walks, when tourists flooded the underwater pathways to gawk at what remained of the once-vast reef ecosystem. <words>64</words>

Mira fingered the faded carnival prize plush octopus tucked into her utility belt—a reminder of the surface world she'd abandoned, won by her father at a beachside fair before the coastal flooding. <words>94</words>

The plush's googly eyes stared back at her with what she imagined was judgment, a silent reflection of morality that she carried with her to every assassination. <words>119</words>

"Don't look at me like that," she whispered to the toy, her tone calculatedly playful as she swam through a school of engineered jellyfish that illuminated the coral apartments. <words>144</words>

Her target, Dr. Elias Vorn, was the celebrated author of "Heroes of the Anthropocene," a historical account that glorified the industrialists who had, in Mira's view, destroyed the world's oceans. <words>173</words>

Vorn's latest project aimed to consolidate all his research into an immersive virtual experience that would retell the epic of human progress from what he called "a more nuanced perspective." <words>201</words>

But Mira knew better—it was simply the villain's view masquerading as history, painting destroyers as creators. <words>217</words>

As she tracked Vorn through the Staghorn District, where tourists marveled at the genetically revived coral species, Mira rehearsed her approach: she would strike during his lecture, when the crowd's attention would be focused on his holographic displays. <words>254</words>

The assassination would be her masterpiece—a statement delivered through reversed echoes, as she planned to use the city's acoustic properties to distort her escape route, leading pursuers away from her actual path. <words>287</words>

When she finally spotted Vorn, he was kneeling beside a child, pointing excitedly at a rare blue-spotted grouper that had made its home in the reef. <words>312</words>

With humorous solemnity, the scientist was explaining how the fish had adapted to the changing ocean chemistry, his face animated with genuine wonder. <words>333</words>

Mira hesitated, her hand on her weapon, as Vorn pulled out a plush fish—identical to her octopus but newer—and presented it to the wide-eyed child. <words>359</words>

"Sometimes," Vorn was saying, "we must see the world through different eyes to understand our mistakes." <words>374</words>

The words struck Mira like a current, and she found herself lowering her dagger, the reflection of her own morality suddenly clear in the scientist's simple act of kindness. <words>402</words>

Perhaps there were other ways to preserve what remained, ways that didn't require blood to nourish the coral. <words>420</words>

As the nature walk continued and Vorn moved on with his group, Mira tucked her weapon away and instead followed silently, listening to his stories with new ears, her plush octopus watching with its eternal, understanding gaze. <words>456</words>
