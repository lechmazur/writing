Elijah clutched the wilted paper flower as he waited for the giant's study to empty. <words>14</words>

The once-vibrant origami creation had been his calling card for years, left behind at scenes where his prophecies manifested. <words>33</words>

He hadn't chosen this path—the visions had chosen him, an accountant turned unlikely prophet through no desire of his own. <words>52</words>

His predictions, scrawled in conventional handwriting but rebellious in content, had begun to estrange him from society. <words>69</words>

The glimmering transitions between reality and his visions were becoming more frequent, more insistent, like static interrupting a clear broadcast. <words>89</words>

Tonight's prophecy had led him here, to the enormous leather-bound books and celestial maps that dwarfed him in the giant's study. <words>110</words>

Footsteps thundered outside—the giant returning sooner than expected. <words>119</words>

Elijah slipped through a crack in the wainscoting, emerging between scenes of the giant's life: a frozen moment where time stretched thin. <words>141</words>

In this liminal space, shadows danced with substance and whispers carried weight. <words>153</words>

His motivation had crystallized over months of visions: to unify scattered minds under a single vision, to help humanity see what he saw. <words>175</words>

The paper flower crumbled further in his sweating palm as he navigated the in-between, searching for an exit. <words>193</words>

Hours later, exhausted and disoriented, Elijah stumbled into a late-night laundromat, the fluorescent lights harsh after the amber glow of the giant's study. <words>216</words>

A woman looked up from folding clothes, recognition flashing across her face. <words>227</words>

"You're him, aren't you?" she asked, her voice carrying a haunting delight that made the hairs on Elijah's neck rise. <words>246</words>

"The one who left the paper flower at the hospital before the earthquake—you saved dozens of lives." <words>263</words>

The run-in wasn't coincidence; she had been waiting. <words>272</words>

She reached into her laundry basket and pulled out identical wilted paper flowers. <words>284</words>

"We've been following your signs," she whispered, "gathering others who believe." <words>295</words>

Elijah felt the familiar glimmer begin, reality shifting around him like watercolors bleeding together. <words>309</words>

In the reflection of the laundromat window, he saw not himself but the giant, peering down at a miniature world. <words>328</words>

"The visions aren't prophecies," Elijah realized aloud, "they're glimpses between worlds—ours and the giants'." <words>343</words>

The woman nodded, conventionally dressed but with eyes that held rebellious fire. <words>355</words>

"We need you to complete the connection," she said, "to help us understand what's coming." <words>371</words>

As dawn broke outside the laundromat windows, Elijah felt the weight of scattered minds waiting to be unified. <words>388</words>

He carefully unfolded his crumbling paper flower, revealing inside it a map of glimmering transitions between worlds. <words>404</words>

"I never wanted to be a prophet," he said, the haunting delight of purpose finally settling in his bones, "but perhaps that's exactly why I must be one." <words>432</words>
