Valen slumped against the monastery wall, his calloused fingers tracing the worn hilt of his sword. <words>15</words>

The breakroom felt emptier since Brother Tomas had resigned that morning, taking his constant chatter and cheerful disposition with him. <words>34</words>

Through the open window, Valen could see the floating rock monastery's smaller satellite formations drifting in the twilight sky, their edges catching the last golden rays of sunlight. <words>59</words>

He reached into his plain cloth bag, retrieving the tattered star chart he'd carried since childhood. <words>75</words>

"Another resignation, another celebration," muttered Abbot Kell as he shuffled past, mistaking Valen's exhaustion for the fiercely apathetic attitude he'd cultivated among the brothers. <words>97</words>

Little did they know that beneath his practiced indifference burned a promise made long ago—to find the Celestial Gate that his dying father had spoken of. <words>122</words>

The monastery's isolation had suited Valen's purpose; floating among the clouds, it offered unparalleled views of the night sky and its meteor showers. <words>145</words>

For fifteen years, he had charted every falling star, noting patterns that the scholarly monks dismissed as random cosmic debris. <words>165</words>

Tonight would be different; the Perseid shower would peak, and according to his calculations, reveal the path he sought. <words>184</words>

Valen's knowing naivety had served him well—playing the role of a simple swordsman seeking spiritual refuge while secretly pursuing astronomical knowledge beyond even the monastery's ancient texts. <words>213</words>

As darkness fell completely, he climbed to the eastern observation deck, abandoned since Tomas's departure. <words>228</words>

The first meteor streaked across the sky, and Valen marked its trajectory on his chart with practiced precision. <words>246</words>

More followed, a cascade of light that most viewed with wonder but that Valen read like a map. <words>264</words>

Each streak confirmed what his father had whispered: "Follow the tears of the night sky when they fall most abundantly, and you will find what the ancients protected." <words>292</words>

The spark of defiance that had sustained him through years of pretending to be someone he wasn't flared brighter as the pattern emerged. <words>315</words>

He would need to leave tonight, while the brothers slept, to follow the celestial signposts to their convergence point. <words>335</words>

Valen packed his few possessions into his cloth bag, the weight of his sword a reminder of all he had overcome to reach this moment. <words>360</words>

The monastery had given him shelter, but it had also nearly smothered his purpose beneath layers of ritual and resignation. <words>380</words>

As the meteor shower reached its zenith, Valen slipped away from the floating sanctuary, leaping onto one of the smaller rocks that would descend closer to earth by dawn. <words>409</words>

The wind whipped his face as he descended, but his eyes remained fixed on the heavens, following the meteors that streaked like breadcrumbs across the cosmos. <words>434</words>

He was no longer the tired swordsman seeking refuge, but a seeker fulfilling the promise he'd made to himself beside his father's deathbed: to discover the truth that lay beyond the stars. <words>469</words>

And as the monastery shrank to a distant speck above him, Valen felt the weight of his apathy fall away, replaced by a purpose as clear and bright as the meteors guiding his way. <words>500</words>
