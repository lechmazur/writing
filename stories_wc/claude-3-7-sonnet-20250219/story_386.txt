Elara stood at the atom-powered lighthouse's highest point, her silhouette cut against the borrowed dawn that wasn't truly hers to witness. <words>19</words>

As a time refugee from the forgotten Lumerian Empire, she had learned to cherish these stolen moments of beauty. <words>37</words>

The embroidered tablecloth lay spread before her, its intricate patterns depicting star charts from her vanished civilization, threads glimmering with a knowledge that modern astronomers had yet to rediscover. <words>62</words>

She traced the constellations with her trustworthy strange fingers—six digits where others had five—a mark of her otherness that she no longer tried to hide. <words>86</words>

In the hush of a line that never moves—the temporal boundary between her lost past and this uncertain future—Elara worked quietly, defiantly, against the laws of chronophysics that had stranded her here. <words>119</words>

"The alignment will come tonight," she whispered to herself, calculating the precise moment when the stars would mirror the pattern on her cloth, creating a momentary bridge across millennia. <words>146</words>

The lighthouse keeper, Thorne, had grown accustomed to her peculiarities over the three years since he'd found her washed ashore, speaking a language that had been dead for twelve thousand years. <words>177</words>

"You're certain this will work?" he asked, setting down the final component of the temporal catapult they had constructed from salvaged atom-drive parts and her ancient knowledge. <words>202</words>

Elara nodded, her eyes reflecting the same unwavering light as the beacon that guided ships through treacherous waters. <words>219</words>

"By the alignment of the stars, I will open the way—not to return home, but to bring others forward," she explained, her voice carrying the weight of responsibility for the thousands of her people trapped in the collapse of their timeline. <words>256</words>

Thorne understood her motivation to bind old wounds with unstoppable will—she couldn't save her empire, but she could save its people, scattered across the fractures of time. <words>283</words>

As night fell, the lighthouse's beam swept across the darkened sea while above, the stars shifted into their predestined positions. <words>303</words>

The embroidered patterns began to glow with an inner light, each stitch becoming a coordinate in a vast equation that spanned centuries. <words>325</words>

Elara positioned the tablecloth at the center of their makeshift device, her movements precise and reverent. <words>341</words>

"Now," she commanded, and Thorne activated the catapult, sending a pulse of energy skyward that connected with the aligned stars. <words>361</words>

The air shimmered and tore, revealing glimpses of confused faces—her people, suspended in the moment before their world ended. <words>380</words>

One by one, they stepped through, dazed refugees from a civilization that history had forgotten, guided by the steady beam of an atom-powered lighthouse and the quietly defiant woman who had refused to let them vanish. <words>416</words>

When the last of them crossed over and the rift sealed itself, Elara collapsed beside her now-ordinary tablecloth, the embroidery faded to mundane threads. <words>440</words>

"You did it," Thorne said, helping her to her feet as the first true dawn she had earned broke over the horizon. <words>462</words>

Elara looked at her people gathering below, then back to the lighthouse that would now guide them all into an unexpected future. <words>484</words>

"No," she corrected him with a smile that bridged epochs, "we did it." <words>497</words>
