Elias strummed his guitar in the automated postal sorting facility, his melodies competing with the mechanical symphony of conveyor belts and sorting machines. <words>20</words>

The night shift supervisor had hired him to boost employee morale, though Elias suspected it was really to keep them awake during the graveyard shift. <words>42</words>

His fingers, calloused from years on street corners, moved through forgotten patterns across the strings, muscle memory guiding him through songs he'd written in happier times. <words>65</words>

In his pocket sat a vintage fountain pen, the last gift from his father before their relationship dissolved into silence and unanswered letters. <words>85</words>

Elias had used that pen to write hundreds of songs, but lately it only seemed capable of producing apologies to people who would never read them. <words>108</words>

"Play something cheerful!" called out a sorter, her hands blurring as she directed packages toward their destinations with practiced efficiency. <words>125</words>

Elias smiled with joyful despair, finding humor in the cosmic absurdity that he—once destined for concert halls—now performed among parcels and packages at 3 AM. <words>149</words>

He launched into an upbeat tune about second chances, watching workers bob their heads while his mind drifted to the suitcase waiting in his apartment. <words>173</words>

The suitcase contained every letter he'd written with that fountain pen, complexly deceptive missives where surface pleasantries masked the desperate longing underneath. <words>193</words>

Tonight, at the close of that suitcase that may never reopen, he would finally mail those letters or burn them—he hadn't decided which. <words>216</words>

"If only I could rewind," he sang, improvising lyrics that made the postal workers chuckle while unaware of the backlash of regrets churning inside him. <words>240</words>

Each note he played was both confession and absolution, a musical attempt to process years of choices that had led him here, among strangers and stamped envelopes. <words>265</words>

The facility manager approached during his break, envelope in hand. <words>274</words>

"Someone left this for you at the front desk," she said, handing him a letter addressed in handwriting he recognized immediately. <words>292</words>

His hands trembled as he used his father's pen to open it, ink staining his fingertips like tiny bruises. <words>310</words>

Inside was a ticket to his father's retirement concert—the old man had been a musician too, something Elias had spent years trying to forget. <words>334</words>

A note was paperclipped to the ticket: "I've been watching your street performances on YouTube. Perhaps we could play together sometime?" <words>354</words>

Elias laughed, a sound caught between joy and sorrow, as sorting machines continued their relentless categorization around him. <words>371</words>

He tucked the letter into his guitar case and resumed playing, his music now flowing with renewed purpose. <words>389</words>

Tomorrow, he would empty that suitcase of unsent letters, but tonight, among the mechanical sorting of other people's communications, Elias found his own message had somehow reached its destination. <words>419</words>

The vintage fountain pen felt lighter in his pocket as he played until dawn, each note a step away from regret and toward whatever absurd cosmic joke awaited him next. <words>448</words>
