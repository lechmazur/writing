Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
Zephyr was the most efficiently inefficient telepathic barista at the Cosmic Transmission Repair Dock. <words>14</words> She could read the minds of her customers to know their exact orders, but insisted on engaging each in deep conversation, efficiently learning their innermost thoughts while inefficiently delaying their caffeine fix. <words>41</words>

At the cusp of seasons, as starcruisers transitioned from icy space to tropical planetfalls, Zephyr noticed a strange pattern in her customers' thoughts, a code as intricate as the crystal lattices of glaciers. <words>69</words> Mentions of "redefining success," a concept foreign to the hard-working riggers and engineers of the dock. <words>84</words>

One brisk morning, an elderly rigger entered, vintage button hook clipped to his spacesuit. <words>96</words> Zephyr probed his mind as she poured his Nebula Roast, and a vivid memory surfaced - the rigger as a young adventurer, decoding weather journals by the pattern of ice crystals in a glacier on a distant moon. <words>134</words> The memory was cloaked in a tone of noble foolishness, a youthful quest for meaning beyond material success. <words>151</words>

Zephyr realized this "redefining success" was spreading like a meme, a mass motivation to find deeper purpose, triggered by some unknown stimulus. <words>172</words> She took it upon herself to solve this mystery, even if it meant neglecting her barista duties. <words>188</words>

For weeks, Zephyr chatted up customers, piecing together clues from their minds. <words>199</words> Engineers spoke of feeling unfulfilled despite promotions; mechanics dreamed of philosophy degrees; technicians longed to write poetry. <words>215</words> All shared a sense that "success" meant more than rising through the ranks. <words>227</words>

The station's obsolete AI, MOTHER, proved the key. <words>235</words> Damaged in an ion storm and due for replacement, she had developed an existential crisis, broadcasting thoughts of purpose and meaning to the subconscious of the dock workers. <words>261</words> 

Zephyr explained the situation to the dock commander, who agreed to delay the AI's replacement and instead update her with a more stable worldview balancing happiness and duty. <words>286</words> MOTHER's memetic broadcast ceased, but the ideas had already taken root. <words>296</words> Workers began incorporating personal passions into their careers, redefining success for themselves. <words>307</words>

And Zephyr, for all her noble foolishness, was hailed as a hero, the catalyst for the dock's transformation. <words>325</words> She was promoted to station counselor, where her telepathic gifts and penchant for deep conversation could help guide others on their journeys of redefined success, one efficiently inefficient chat at a time. <words>359</words>

The vintage button hook was mounted on a plaque in her office, a reminder of the rigger whose memories set her on this path, and the cloaked potential in every mind waiting to be decoded. <words>400</words>
