<story>
In the arctic research greenhouse, the old-fashioned mage Aldric pondered the fragment of a pharaoh's coffin, turning it over in his weathered hands amid the playground time of his youth, long past. <words>32</words> The unfolding riddle of the ancient relic filled him with a sense of sanctified dread, even as the tropical plants thrived incongruously around him under the geodesic dome. <words>60</words>

Aldric had always been driven to claim uncharted frontiers, pushing the boundaries of the arcane arts, but now in his twilight years, he felt purposefully aimless, unsure of his path forward. <words>89</words> As he gazed into the glossy obsidian surface of the coffin fragment, he caught ephemeral encounters with mirror reflections of his younger self - bold, driven, certain. <words>117</words> How different that impetuous mage was from the man he saw in the mirror each morning now.

The coffin piece seemed to whisper secrets to him, hinting at a profound magic he had yet to grasp. <words>146</words> Aldric knew the fragment was key to unlocking the riddle that had confounded him for decades. <words>163</words> An ancient incantation, glimpsed in a crumbling tome and never seen since. <words>176</words> Deciphering its meaning had become his obsession.

As the arctic sun hung perpetually on the horizon, Aldric lost himself in study, barely noticing the passage of days. <words>203</words> He pored over the fragment's hieroglyphics, cross-referencing them against obscure manuscripts and his own encyclopedic knowledge. <words>222</words> Whispers of the incantation haunted his dreams.

Then, on a frigid, unremarkable morning, the puzzle pieces clicked into place and epiphany struck Aldric like a lightning bolt. <words>248</words> The incantation was a map, the coffin fragment its key. <words>259</words> Together, they would lead him to a source of power unimaginable - the last uncharted frontier of magic.

In that moment, Aldric's aimlessness fell away, replaced with steely resolve. <words>280</words> He knew he must claim this discovery, even if it meant the end of him. <words>296</words> The path would be perilous, but the old mage's courage never wavered.

As he made his final preparations to depart the greenhouse, Aldric paused to cuddle the coffin fragment to his chest, feeling its ancient power thrum against him. <words>331</words> A whisper of fear threaded through his wonder. <words>339</words> The riddle was unfolding, and he must follow it into the unknown.

With a steadying breath, Aldric pocketed the fragment, gathered his few possessions, and stepped out into the arctic wastes. <words>365</words> The greenhouse stood behind him like a portal to another world - one he would likely never return to. <words>385</words> Aldric turned his gaze forward, to the uncharted frontier ahead, his destiny waiting to be claimed. <words>400</words>
