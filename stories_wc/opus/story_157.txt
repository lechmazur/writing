Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
In the forgotten lighthouse library, an elusive puppeteer worked in absurd solemnity throughout tailgating season. <words>16</words> His plain ring glinted in the candlelight as he pored over ancient tomes, tracking rain patterns in a quest to unveil secrets of the ancestors. <words>37</words> The lighthouse keeper had left him with a mysterious seed and a cryptic message: "To water the seeds of curiosity, you must paddle the tides of time." <words>61</words>

The puppeteer was determined to decipher the riddle, believing it held the key to a specifically universal truth about the human condition. <words>80</words> As he studied meteorological charts and lunar calendars, a theory began to take shape in his mind, as absurd as it was profound. <words>101</words> The rain, he realized, fell in patterns that mirrored the great cycles of history, from the rise and fall of empires to the passing of generations. <words>126</words> And at certain rare conjunctions, when the tides aligned with the phases of the moon, a window would open—a chance to voyage into the collective unconscious of humanity itself. <words>154</words>

Guided by his calculations, the puppeteer began to construct a vessel—a puppet theater built to harness the power of the storm. <words>174</words> He carved marionettes to represent archetypal figures from myth and legend, each one imbued with the symbolic essence of an ancestor. <words>194</words> As the fateful night approached, he staged the puppets around the "stage" of the lighthouse gallery and prepared to set sail. <words>216</words>

At the height of the tempest, the puppeteer took up his paddle and began to navigate the surging flood that poured in through the windows. <words>238</words> Lit only by flashes of lightning, his eerie marionettes sprang to life, acting out an ancient drama that echoed through the halls of time. <words>261</words> Faster and faster he paddled, riding the cresting waves, until the lighthouse itself seemed to lift free of its foundations, ascending into the eye of the storm. <words>287</words>

Then, in a blinding flash, the puppeteer found himself alone again, sprawled on the rain-slicked floor, the seed in his hand just beginning to sprout. <words>311</words> Though the vision had passed, he understood that his journey had only just begun. <words>325</words> With each new season of rain, he would return to nurture the seedling, watching it grow into a majestic tree, a living link between past and future. <words>351</words> And through the art of his marionettes, he would share the story of that tree with all who visited the lighthouse, watering the seeds of curiosity for generations to come. <words>380</words>

For he had seen the truth behind the ancestors' riddle: that the tides of time are but a puppet show in the theater of eternity, and we are all both puppeteers and marionettes in the great drama of existence. <words>418</words>
