<story>
The time-looping paramedic clutched the weathered fishing lure, a talisman of unhealed traumas from lives he had lived before. <words>20</words> In this quantum tunnel outside of space and time, he existed in a state of privately public solitude, known intimately to himself alone yet exposed to an audience of infinite selves. <words>52</words> He sought to nest here in the folds between dimensions, to burrow deep into the fabric of reality and hide from his pain. <words>77</words>

But there was no escape from memory - not by the sound of a single raindrop echoing endlessly in the void, not at the bell's echo marking a forgotten recess in the schoolyard of eternity. <words>111</words> His excited boredom consumed him, a buzzing static of contradictory longings for change and for numbing sameness. <words>131</words> How many times had he repeated these cycles, resetting again and again to the same starting point? <words>149</words> He couldn't recall, the knowledge sacrificed to maintain his tenuous sanity. <words>161</words>

The lure in his hand was the only constant, the only marker differentiating one iteration from the next. <words>180</words> Its frayed edges and chipped paint told a story of countless resets, of infinite attempts to alter the course of fate. <words>202</words> He turned it over and over in his fingers, as if the repetitive motion could conjure understanding or acceptance. <words>223</words>

In his heart, he knew the real reason he endured this endless recursion - to baptize his nightmares in acceptance, to finally make peace with the scars on his psyche. <words>250</words> Maybe this would be the loop where he found the strength to face down his demons, to untangle the knots of anguish woven through his being. <words>276</words> He closed his eyes and cast his mind back, trying to pinpoint the primordial wound festering at his core. <words>297</words>

But the memories slipped away like wisps of fog, tantalizingly close but impossible to grasp. <words>314</words> The paramedic sighed, resignation and determination warring within him. <words>324</words> He would continue this quest, this Sisyphean odyssey through the depths of his own soul, for as long as it took. <words>347</words> In the quantum tunnel, time was meaningless, a mere construct of mortal minds. <words>361</words> He had an eternity to heal, to transform, to transcend. <words>373</words> With a deep breath, he opened his eyes, ready to begin again. <words>386</words> The weathered fishing lure glinted in his hand, a symbol of his unending journey through the cycles of time. <words>407</words>
