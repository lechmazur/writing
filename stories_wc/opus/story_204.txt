<story>
Zara stepped into the abandoned spaceport hangar, her footsteps echoing in the cavernous space. <words>14</words> The professional cuddler had an appointment with a new client, arranged through a chance encounter at the farmer's market the day before. <words>35</words> In the hush before an acceptance speech begins, the hangar felt imbued with an ancient novelty, like a relic from a bygone era awaiting rediscovery. <words>57</words>

As Zara approached the designated meeting spot, she noticed an unusually usual sight: an antique train ticket punch, its once-gleaming metal surface marred by decay. <words>79</words> It seemed out of place in the futuristic spaceport, a phantom memento of simpler times. <words>93</words>

Her client emerged from the shadows - an elderly Zoranian named Klix. <words>105</words> His scaled skin was dull with age, but his eyes sparkled with anticipation. <words>118</words> "Thank you for coming," Klix said softly. <words>125</words> "I've never done this before. My people have strict unspoken rules against physical contact with other species." <words>143</words>

Zara smiled warmly. "That's why I'm here - to help you overcome that deep-seated prejudice, one hug at a time." <words>164</words>

As they settled into the cuddling session, Klix shared stories of his youth as a ticket taker on the intergalactic rail lines, punching countless tickets with his trusty antique punch. <words>193</words> The rhythmic clicking had been a comforting soundtrack to his days, a reminder of the connections he facilitated but could never quite make himself. <words>219</words>

Zara listened intently, her embrace providing a safe space for Klix to confront his long-held biases. <words>235</words> With each passing minute, she felt the tension drain from his body as touch began to heal the wounds of a touch-starved life. <words>259</words>

In the aftermath of their session, Klix retrieved his beloved ticket punch, running his fingers over the worn metal. <words>278</words> "I've been clinging to the past for so long, afraid to let go," he confessed. "But maybe it's time to punch my own ticket to a new future." <words>307</words>

With a grateful nod, Klix left the hangar, leaving Zara to ponder the transformative power of her unusually usual profession. <words>327</words> In a universe bound by unspoken rules and ancient prejudices, perhaps the simplest acts of connection and acceptance could be the most profound. <words>351</words>

Zara glanced at the antique ticket punch, now a symbol of the barriers she helped her clients overcome, one embrace at a time. <words>376</words> In the hush of the abandoned spaceport, she felt a renewed sense of purpose, ready to punch her own ticket to a future filled with compassion and understanding. <words>408</words>
