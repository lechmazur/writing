<story>
The dismayed minstrel sat alone in the black velvet sky-lounge, floating high above the endless city below, strumming his lute with laconic exuberance. <words>24</words> He gazed wistfully at his broken watch band, a relic of a distant past, as he pondered the subjectively rational boundaries he had drawn around his life amid garden secrets and fading memories. <words>52</words>

To draw a map of the endless night that stretched before him, the minstrel began to excavate his mind by studying old polaroid photographs strewn across the obsidian bar. <words>79</words> In one faded image, a young boy stood beaming, lute in hand, poised to take the stage and sing songs of love and loss, dreaming of a future bright with promise. <words>110</words> But that wide-eyed innocent was gone, washed away by the unceasing currents of time like tears in rain. <words>129</words>

The minstrel took a deep swig of glowing absinthe, savoring its burning emerald sweetness as the city lights sparkled in the liquid's swirling depths. <words>154</words> He realized with a start that he had become like this place - a floating world, detached from the mundane cares of the city below, lost in waking dreams and the deafening silence between the notes of a song only he could hear. <words>194</words>

Studying the photographs, the minstrel began to understand the strange and twisting path that had led him to this place, a road paved with broken promises and lost chances. <words>224</words> Each image told a tale of an eager young artist hungry to experience everything the world had to offer, heedless of the cost. <words>248</words> Amid garden secrets shared in urgent whispers and stolen kisses, he had thought himself the hero of his own story, only to find himself now exiled to this floating limbo, a jester in motley, a king of infinite space. <words>289</words>

With a sigh, the minstrel took up his lute once more, calloused fingers dancing across the strings, weaving a melancholy melody shot through with threads of hard-won wisdom and fragile hope. <words>320</words> He would draw a map of this endless night, tracing boundaries between past and present, love and loss, the man he had been and the one he had become. <words>349</words> And perhaps, if the notes rang true enough, if the song was sweet enough to charm the stars from the sky, he would find his way home once more, following the music on the night wind. <words>400</words>
