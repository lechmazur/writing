As he pored over the faded pages, his fingers absently fidgeted with a collection of mismatched buttons, each one a tiny relic of the outside world he had long since left behind. <words>95</words> The monk's devotion to his studies had rendered him timidly loud, his voice rarely rising above a whisper even as his mind raced with newfound knowledge. <words>124</words>
