Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
Lila worked as an elevator repair technician at the sand castle preservation lab, elegantly clumsy in her movements as she tinkered with the complex machinery. <words>25</words> Amid lunch breaks, she would wander the lab's halls, a dried flower crown resting on her dark curls, seeking the dissonance of silence that came from being utterly alone. <words>50</words>

But Lila was never truly alone, for she saw the ghosts that lingered there - forlorn spirits tied to the very sand castles she helped preserve. <words>75</words> Driven by a desire to unravel the mysteries that bound them, Lila began staking out local ghost tours, hoping to glean insights into their spectral nature. <words>101</words>

As she listened to the tales spun for wide-eyed tourists, Lila started to piece together the fragments of the ghosts' past lives, like shards of sea glass washed ashore. <words>129</words> In the lab's sterile chambers, she would sit cross-legged before the sand castles, closing her eyes to dissect the delicate threads that tethered spirit to sculpture. <words>155</words>

Through this intimate communion, Lila came to understand that each ghost was trapped by an unresolved burden - a final wish unfulfilled, a secret left unspoken, or a love that never knew closure. <words>185</words> Their whispered confessions, carried on stale currents of recycled air, painted a portrait of existences interrupted, forever suspended between the impermanence of sand and the eternity of regret. <words>214</words>

Moved by their stories, Lila resolved to help the ghosts find liberation in letting go. <words>229</words> During stolen moments between elevator repairs, she would carefully deconstruct the sand castles grain by grain, her slender fingers working with a complex simplicity that belied the depth of her purpose. <words>259</words>

As the castles dissolved beneath her touch, Lila sensed the ghosts' relief as they were finally unburdened, their essences scattering like windblown sand. <words>280</words> In the aftermath of each release, the lab's silence took on a different quality - no longer dissonant but tranquil, a peace born of absolution. <words>305</words>

Lila knew that her own time at the lab was drawing to a close, the ghosts' stories now irrevocably intertwined with her own. <words>327</words> On her final day, she left her dried flower crown on the workbench, a token of remembrance for the spirits she had freed and the unexpected purpose she had found within the lab's walls. <words>360</words>

As Lila stepped out into the world beyond, she carried with her the knowledge that even the most enduring structures - be they sand castles or human lives - were inherently ephemeral, and that true liberation lay in embracing the impermanence woven through all things. <words>400</words>
