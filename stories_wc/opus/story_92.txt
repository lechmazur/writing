Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
Dusk settled over the haunted mansion, the time when color bleeds from day into night, as Reginald entered the ornate dining room. <words>22</words> He was the dog walker for the ultra-rich Worthingtons, a carefully careless man who moved through their world on silent agreements and unspoken understandings. <words>44</words> An encounter at a blood drive last week had led to an unusual invitation to the mansion tonight, the purpose of which remained unclear. <words>65</words>

The dining room was dimly lit by flickering candelabras that cast eerie shadows on the dark mahogany paneling. <words>82</words> Antique portraits of stern-faced Worthingtons past lined the walls, their eyes seeming to follow Reginald's every move. <words>98</words> In the center of the long table sat Cornelius Worthington himself, the family patriarch, looking as pale and shriveled as a specter. <words>118</words>

"Reginald, thank you for coming," Cornelius rasped, his voice a loud silence in the cavernous room. <words>132</words> "I have something to show you." <words>138</words>

With a trembling hand, Cornelius gestured to an open door leading to the library. <words>151</words> Reginald stepped inside and beheld a vast botanical collection of exotic plants and flowers from around the world, all perfectly preserved. <words>170</words> Glass cases and jars contained vibrant specimens, their colors a stark contrast to the gloomy grays of the mansion. <words>187</words>

"This is my life's work," Cornelius said, hobbling over to a particular display. <words>199</words> "And this is what I wanted you to see." <words>208</words>

He pointed a bony finger at a strange crimson flower suspended in liquid, its petals curled like claws. <words>224</words> Reginald had never seen anything like it.

"The Sanguineus Immortalis," Cornelius whispered reverently. <words>233</words> "Exceedingly rare. And the key to standing where fear dare not tread - the key to conquering death itself." <words>251</words>

Reginald's heart pounded as the implications sank in. <words>258</words> The blood drive, the invitation, the flower - it all made a twisted kind of sense. <words>274</words>

"I need you to help me, Reginald," Cornelius pleaded. <words>282</words> "Only you can retrieve the final ingredient I require. Justify it however you must, but bring me what I need to achieve immortality." <words>304</words>

In that moment, Reginald understood the true nature of the silent agreements that had brought him here, the carefully careless path he had walked. <words>324</words> Fear clutched his heart, but also a dark fascination. <words>333</words> To stand where fear dare not tread - did he dare? <words>344</words> Could he justify the unjustifiable? <words>349</words>

The loud silence of the room pressed in on Reginald as he faced the choice that would define his fate, his very soul. <words>371</words> In the haunted depths of the mansion, a devil's bargain awaited. <words>382</words> The dog walker and the ultra-rich, bound together by blood and forbidden science, standing on the precipice where only the most intrepid or insane would go. <words>407</words>
