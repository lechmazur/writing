<story>
Liam was a naive gambler, always chasing that next big score. <words>12</words> He found himself drawn to the tidal power monitoring station, an unassuming concrete building perched on the edge of the sea. <words>37</words> There, a group of unhinged professors held rebellious midnight lectures, spouting grand theories and wild notions. <words>57</words> Liam attended religiously, scribbling notes by the light of rustic candle molds, rarely predictable in their insights but always captivating. <words>82</words>

Over candlelit dinners of canned beans and stale bread, Liam made an unspoken bargain with the eccentric academics. <words>103</words> He would bring them supplies and news from the mainland, and they would share their esoteric wisdom, helping him divine the patterns of chance and fate. <words>132</words> It was a partnership forged in desperation - the professors eager for any connection to the outside world, Liam hungry for an edge to keep playing the tables. <words>160</words>

But the bargain proved perilous. <words>166</words> The theories grew more extreme, the wagers more reckless. <words>176</words> Liam felt his luck turning, but couldn't walk away - the professors' frenzied passion was infectious, their ideas intoxicating. <words>199</words> He doubled down again and again, pawning everything he owned, burning through borrowed cash, chasing the promise of a big win that would make it all worthwhile. <words>228</words>

It all came crashing down one stormy night. <words>237</words> Liam staggered into the monitoring station battered and broke, having gambled away his last penny - and his final shred of sense. <words>263</words> The unhinged professors cackled with glee, dancing madly around guttering candle flames. <words>278</words> They had played their own game, using Liam to gather parts for a jury-rigged tidal generator, the key to their "revolutionary" new theory. <words>304</words>

In that moment, Liam finally saw the truth - that he was just a pawn in their crazed schemes, a convenient patsy to be used and discarded. <words>333</words> But it was too late. <words>338</words> The generator whirred to life with a deafening roar, the professors howling in triumph as the station began to shake itself apart. <words>366</words>

Liam fled into the raging night, the professors' mad laughter echoing in his ears, mingling with his own anguished sobs. <words>391</words> He had risked it all for one last spark of hope, and found only oblivion. <words>409</words>
