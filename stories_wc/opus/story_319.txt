Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
Arden, the frail guard, stood watch over the tidal island, his painted allegiances resolutely wavering in the salty breeze. <words>20</words> He clutched a sour-smelling alchemy phial, his ticket to escaping the predetermined fate the island's masters had assigned him. <words>37</words> Throughout the sorting process that would seal the fates of him and the other guards, Arden had secretly planned his escape, communicating with allies on the mainland through messages carved in tree bark. <words>64</words>

As the tide slowly receded, exposing the rocky causeway to shore, Arden glanced around nervously, ensuring none of the other guards took notice of him. <words>86</words> His heart raced as he uncorked the phial with a trembling hand and gulped down the foul-tasting elixir, a powerful concoction he had bartered for with one of the island's resident alchemists. <words>114</words> The potion would imbue him with temporary strength to make the swim to shore, but at a cost - it would leave him weakened for days after. <words>138</words>

Arden had little choice though; it was escape or face a dismal future in servitude to the corrupt island council, his free will permanently broken through the council's dark sorcery. <words>163</words> He shuddered to think of the poor souls who had already undergone the ritual, their minds no longer their own. <words>181</words> Arden refused to become another puppet guard, his painted allegiances forever binding him in unquestioning loyalty to the council. <words>199</words>

As the elixir took effect, Arden felt a surge of energy course through his frail limbs. <words>214</words> It was now or never. <words>219</words> Glancing around one last time, he broke into a run, his armor clanking noisily. <words>232</words> "Hey, stop! Stand down!" yelled one of the other guards, noticing his attempt. <words>245</words> Arden paid him no heed, sprinting for the edge of the water. <words>256</words> Just before diving in, he reached out and yanked on a rope connected to the warning bell, buying himself a few extra moments. <words>278</words>

Plunging into the cold waves, Arden swam with all his magically-enhanced might, knowing his one chance at freedom would soon be at an end. <words>299</words> He could hear the alarm being raised behind him, the island stirring like an angry beast. <words>313</words> His heart pounded as he swam, the ocean seeming to pull him away from shore with every stroke. <words>329</words> But gradually, the sounds of pursuit faded, and the shoreline drew closer. <words>340</words>

With the last of his strength, Arden dragged himself onto the beach and collapsed, exhausted but triumphant. <words>355</words> He had done it - he had escaped the island and the terrible fate that awaited him. <words>370</words> As he lay there catching his breath, a sense of hopeful melancholy washed over him, much like the waves lapping at his feet. <words>390</words> He was finally free, but he knew the road ahead would be long and hard, with the island council unlikely to let him go so easily. <words>414</words> Arden slowly pulled himself to his feet, ready to face whatever came next. <words>425</words>
