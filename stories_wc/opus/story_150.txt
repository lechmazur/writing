Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
The outlaw cowboy poet rode into town, his worn runic bone dice clattering in his saddlebag. <words>18</words> He was a virtually peculiar man, his intertwined destinies misaligned by the strange forces at work in this place. <words>37</words> He hitched his horse outside the steampunk observatory dome that loomed over the dusty streets, gears turning and steam hissing from its copper-plated exterior. <words>59</words>

Inside, the poet found the observatory transformed into a surreal coffee shop, its walls covered in ever-shifting text that seemed to rearrange itself before his eyes. <words>82</words> He ordered a black coffee and sat at a table, trying to decipher the cryptic messages scrawled across the walls, seeking to spark an unstoppable curiosity within himself. <words>108</words> Throughout rehearsals for some cosmic play he could not comprehend, the poet studied the walls, his saturated ambivalence slowly morphing into rapt fascination. <words>130</words>

As he sipped his coffee, a strange woman sat down across from him - the owner of this place, with stars in her eyes and a knowing smile. <words>155</words> "You seek answers in the writing on the walls," she said, her voice echoing like a melody from another world. <words>177</words> "But the truth you desire cannot be found in mere words." <words>189</words>

She took his dice from his hand and rolled them on the table, the ancient runes seeming to glow with an inner fire. <words>213</words> "Your destiny is intertwined with the very fabric of the universe," she intoned, reading the dice like a seer divining the future. <words>236</words> "To unravel its secrets, you must learn to see beyond the veil of reality and embrace the peculiar nature of existence." <words>260</words>

With those words, she vanished, leaving behind only a faint whiff of stardust and mystery. <words>275</words> The cowboy poet looked around, suddenly unsure if the observatory and its strange denizens had ever truly existed outside of his own mind. <words>300</words> He finished his coffee and stepped back out into the harsh sunlight, squinting up at the observatory dome that now seemed to be just an ordinary building. <words>327</words>

But deep within his heart, an unquenchable curiosity had been sparked, a burning desire to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos and his place within it. <words>353</words> He mounted his horse and rode off into the desert, his worn runic dice clutched tightly in his hand, ready to follow the threads of fate wherever they might lead him in this virtually peculiar world of saturated ambivalence and intertwined destinies. <words>400</words>
