Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
In the wasteland orchard, a headstrong mage named Lyra tended to the hardy trees that thrived amid the radioactive dust storms. <words>21</words> She was tenuously certain that her magic could restore the blighted land, but her power had begun to fade like the stained glass box that held her most cherished possession. <words>47</words> After the old record player had scratched its last tune, the music and color seemed to leach out of the world, leaving only gray behind. <words>69</words>

Lyra's quest to bring vibrancy back to this barren world had consumed her for years, fueled by a sense of merry bitterness at the unfairness of it all. <words>95</words> She refused to give up, even as her magic dwindled to mere glitter residue on her once-sparkling mage's costume. <words>115</words> The orchard was her last bastion of hope - if she could just coax enough life from the irradiated soil, perhaps the rest of the land would follow. <words>141</words>

As Lyra moved between the trees, feminizing them with floral wreaths to inspire the blossoms to emerge, she sensed a presence behind her. <words>163</words> She spun around to see Asha, her oldest friend and the one person who'd remained by her side through the fall of civilization. <words>186</words>

"I have a confession," Asha said softly, her dark eyes shimmering with unshed tears. <words>200</words> "I know why your magic is fading. It's because of me." <words>212</words>

Lyra stared at her, uncomprehending. Asha continued, "I was the one who broke your stained glass box. I thought... I thought if I took away your power, you'd finally stop this impossible quest and just stay with me. I love you, Lyra. I have for years." <words>255</words>

A maelstrom of emotions swirled through Lyra - shock, betrayal, sorrow. But beneath it all, a flicker of something else. Understanding. Empathy. And the courage to confess her own long-buried truth. <words>286</words>

"Asha," she said, taking her friend's hands. "Don't you see? My magic isn't in that box. It's here, between us. It always has been. I love you too. And together, we can find a new way to bring color back to the world. Not through magic, but through the love we share." <words>341</words>

As they embraced amid the wasteland orchard, Lyra felt a surge of renewed energy. Perhaps it was magic, or perhaps it was simply the power of two hearts finally uniting. <words>369</words> But in that moment, Lyra knew they would find a way forward, no matter how tenuously certain the path ahead might be. <words>400</words>
