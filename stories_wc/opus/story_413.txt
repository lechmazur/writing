<story>
Lord Aldric wandered listlessly through the endless corn maze stretching across the haunted plain, his once-vibrant scarf now faded and worn. <words>20</words> In a time before the first creature developed sentience, the naively sophisticated noble sought to discover the power of intention, though he knew not what he might find. <words>40</words> An unexpected invitation had arrived that morning, a cryptic summons to a spontaneous event at this uncanny site. <words>54</words>

As the dry stalks swished and crackled around him under an ashen sky, Aldric pondered the ironic awe that gripped him, marveling at forces beyond his ken. <words>73</words> What eldritch presence could have arranged this rendezvous in so desolate a place? <words>83</words> The wind keened mournfully through the maze, carrying whispers that tickled the edge of comprehension. <words>94</words>

Aldric froze as peals of eerie laughter suddenly echoed across the plain, sourceless yet undeniably real. <words>106</words> A chill ran through him, but beneath it stirred an ember of wonder - he was not alone in this liminal space. <words>124</words> The laughter rang out again, closer now, rippling and distorting like sound underwater. <words>134</words> 

He pressed on, scarf trailing behind him, a tattered pennant from a forgotten campaign. <words>145</words> The maze seemed to shift before his eyes, dead ends becoming new paths, the landscape reshaped by an unseen will. <words>160</words> Another refrain of distorted laughter, this time from just around the corner. <words>170</words> Aldric turned to find himself face to face with...himself, a perfect mirror image down to the faded scarf, grinning an impossible grin. <words>188</words>

"I've been expecting you," his doppelganger said, voice resonant with unnatural reverb. <words>197</words> "You seek the power of intention, do you not? <words>205</words> Behold!" <words>206</words>

The double threw wide its arms and the corn maze dissolved around them, leaving only a void. <words>220</words> Aldric gasped as galaxies wheeled overhead and nebulae billowed at his feet, the cosmos laid bare at the whim of his twin. <words>237</words> 

"Intention is the fundament of creation," the doppelganger intoned. <words>244</words> "Will and laughter, order and chaos, the weft and warp of what is and could be. <words>259</words> You need only claim it." <words>264</words>

It extended a hand, an invitation. <words>269</words> Aldric hesitated, then slowly reached out, fingers brushing those of his cosmic reflection. <words>280</words> Power surged through him, terrifying and exhilarating. <words>286</words> The noble laughed then, and his double laughed with him, voices entwining in a symphony of creation. <words>300</words>

And there in the space between spaces, a new universe was born, woven from the shared laughter of gods in the making. <words>319</words> Aldric marveled at what he had wrought, the ironic awe of a listless noble no more. <words>333</words> He was the shaper of worlds now, a being of pure intention. <words>344</words> 

With a thought, he crafted a scarf of shimmering starlight to replace the faded relic at his throat. <words>360</words> Aldric strode forward into the infant cosmos, doppelganger at his side, to explore the uncharted wonders that awaited them in this realm of their own design. <words>383</words> The haunted plain and its corn maze faded into myth behind them, a crucible of transformation none would ever know...save the Creators. <words>400</words>
