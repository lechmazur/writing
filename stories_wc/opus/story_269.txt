Here is a 400-word story incorporating the provided elements:

<story>
The nostalgic tailor stood before the dusty mirror on the steampunk observation deck, his reflection wavering in the flickering gaslight. <words>20</words> The storm raged outside, wind howling and rain lashing the glass panes, but he barely noticed, lost in thought. <words>35</words> In the mirror he saw not just himself, but glimpses of his parallel lives - roads not taken, choices unmade, destinies unfulfilled. <words>54</words> There was a subtly menacing undercurrent to the visions, hinting at dark secrets and unspoken regrets. <words>67</words>

"I've wasted so much time," he muttered, voice tinged with hopeful desperation. <words>77</words> "If only I had been bolder, reached further..." <words>85</words>

As if in answer, his reflections began to speak, voices blending together in an unsettling chorus. <words>100</words> They whispered improbable confessions, tales of lives where the tailor had ascended beyond mortal limits - conquering death, mastering the elements, becoming something more than human. <words>123</words> The tailor listened, equal parts enthralled and unnerved. <words>130</words>

"You can still achieve greatness," the reflections urged. <words>137</words> "The final code is broken; the path lies open before you. <words>148</words> Seize your destiny!" <words>151</words>

The tailor hesitated, doubt and longing warring in his heart. <words>160</words> Then, slowly, he reached out to touch the mirror's surface. <words>170</words> His fingertips brushed cool glass... and kept going, sinking into the quicksilver portal. <words>183</words> The mirror rippled around his hand, and he felt a shock like electricity race up his arm. <words>198</words>

"Yes," he breathed. <words>201</words> "I'm ready." <words>204</words>

He stepped forward, letting the mirror enfold him. <words>212</words> There was a flash of light, a rush of vertigo - and then the tailor was gone, leaving only an empty room behind. <words>233</words>

In another world, another life, he opened his eyes. <words>243</words> The skies were strange here, unfamiliar stars glinting down on alien vistas. <words>255</words> He could feel the thrum of power in his veins, vast and intoxicating. <words>268</words> His old self seemed small and distant now, a fading memory. <words>279</words>

"I made it," he said wonderingly. <words>285</words> "I ascended." <words>288</words>

But even as triumph filled him, shadows gathered at the edges of his mind - the price of this power, the cost of his transformation. <words>309</words> He shook his head, pushing the doubts away. <words>317</words> There would be time to face the consequences later. <words>326</words> For now, he had a new existence to explore, new wonders and terrors to embrace. <words>341</words>

The tailor - the god - smiled, and strode forward into eternity, leaving his humble beginnings far behind. <words>359</words> The storm still raged somewhere, in a world grown small and dim. <words>371</words> But he was beyond such mortal concerns now. <words>380</words> The universe lay before him, ripe with possibility. <words>388</words> And he would not waste this second chance. <words>396</words>
