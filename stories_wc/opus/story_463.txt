<story>
The dry-witted sentinel stood watch in the haunted lighthouse keeper's bedroom, a frayed piece of rope dangling from his weathered hand. <words>20</words> He had just crossed the final name off a list - a list of all those who had made promises to him over the years, promises that had slowly eroded like the cliffs upon which the lighthouse precariously perched. <words>54</words> It was certainly possible that he would add more names to the list in time, but for now, his obligations had been fulfilled, the ledger wiped clean. <words>80</words>

He began to confiscate the belongings of the deceased lighthouse keeper, searching for any valuable or sentimental items worth keeping. <words>98</words> As he rummaged through a trunk, he discovered a curious collection - dozens of guides and histories on a specific type of dance, the tango. <words>122</words> The sentinel, intrigued by this unexpected shared love, felt a sudden desire to learn the traditional methods of this passionate art form. <words>143</words>

Perhaps it was the lighthouse's isolation that had driven its former keeper to this obsession, an escape from the loneliness and tedium. <words>163</words> The sentinel could empathize, his own existence a solitary one, standing guard over the years with only the crashing waves far below for company. <words>188</words> He pocketed a well-worn book from the trunk and descended the spiral staircase, steps echoing in the hollow chamber. <words>207</words>

In a storage room, he cleared some space, kicking up dust that swirled in the beams of his lantern. <words>224</words> With a reckless precision, he began to move, attempting to imitate the tango poses illustrated in the guidebook's faded pages. <words>244</words> He stumbled at first, feeling foolish, but as he found the rhythm, the steps began to flow, and he lost himself in the dance. <words>269</words>

The sentinel practiced night after night, a man possessed, until the tango became a part of him, ingrained in his muscle memory. <words>291</words> He danced to remember the lighthouse keeper, to honor the promises he had failed to keep, to feel a connection to another human soul. <words>316</words> Most of all, he danced to feel alive, to find a shred of joy in his bleak and lonely existence. <words>337</words>

And so the dry-witted sentinel, the lighthouse's new keeper, danced on, a frayed piece of rope always tucked in his pocket, a symbol of the eroding promises he carried with him, even as he forged a new path through the artistry of the tango, a shared love with a dead man who had kept the light burning before him. <words>400</words>
