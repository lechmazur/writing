Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
Zhan Li stood in the calligraphy master's courtyard, his hand resting doubtfully on the hilt of his sword. <words>18</words> The arrogant swordsman had been summoned here, though for what purpose he knew not. <words>31</words> A faded tapestry fragment fluttered in the breeze, catching his eye with its intricate patterns. <words>45</words>

Master Shen emerged from his studio, his weathered face a map of harsh tenderness. <words>59</words> "Ah, Zhan Li, you have come," he said between breaths, his voice soft yet commanding. <words>74</words> "I have a task that only you can accomplish, to deliver a spark where all lights have gone out." <words>94</words>

Zhan Li scoffed. <words>97</words> "And what makes you think I would help you, old man?" <words>108</words>

The master smiled knowingly. <words>112</words> "Because deep within, your potential remains shackled by pride and ego. <words>123</words> Only by putting your skills to a higher purpose will you find true mastery." <words>137</words>

The swordsman bristled but held his tongue, curiosity piqued. <words>146</words> Master Shen continued, "In a village not far from here, a darkness has taken hold, smothering all hope. <words>165</words> You must go there and rekindle the people's spirit." <words>175</words>

"And how am I to do that?" Zhan Li asked skeptically. <words>186</words>

In response, the master began to sing a traditional song, one sung at every family wedding in their land. <words>205</words> The familiar melody stirred something in Zhan Li's chest. <words>214</words> As the final note faded, Master Shen held out a sealed scroll. <words>226</words> "You are hereby authorized to act as my emissary. <words>236</words> Go now, and let the song be your guide."

Zhan Li took the scroll with a curt nod, turned on his heel, and strode out of the courtyard. <words>259</words> As he journeyed to the village, the wedding song echoed in his mind, intertwining with memories of his own family and the legacy he had long tried to escape. <words>287</words>

Entering the village, Zhan Li found it shrouded in a soul-crushing silence. <words>299</words> He made his way to the central square and, in a voice both powerful and plaintive, began to sing the traditional song. <words>322</words>

Slowly, villagers emerged from their homes, drawn by the familiar melody. <words>333</words> As their voices joined with his, the oppressive atmosphere began to lift, replaced by a tentative yet growing sense of unity and resilience. <words>356</words>

In that moment, Zhan Li understood the true power of his skills - not to dominate, but to inspire and uplift. <words>378</words> With a newfound sense of purpose, he led the villagers in song, a spark rekindled, a light against the darkness. <words>400</words>
