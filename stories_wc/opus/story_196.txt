<story>
The tired swordsman trudged up the steps of the floating rock monastery, his plain cloth bag slung over his shoulder. <words>20</words> He had been fiercely apathetic for so long, the spark of defiance within him all but extinguished. <words>35</words> But a hidden promise to himself still smoldered deep inside, waiting to be rekindled. <words>47</words>

As he entered the quiet breakroom, the other monks looked up in surprise. <words>59</words> One of their order had just resigned and departed that morning. <words>70</words> The swordsman sat heavily on a bench, unsure why he had even come to this remote place. <words>85</words>

That night, unable to sleep, he wandered outside and gazed up at the meteor showers streaking across the dark sky. <words>103</words> Each fiery trail seemed to beckon him, as if the heavens themselves were calling him to awaken from his stupor. <words>122</words>

In a moment of knowing naivety, the swordsman made a decision. <words>133</words> He would follow those meteors to wherever they led, in search of a new purpose. <words>147</words> At dawn, he shouldered his bag and began the descent down the floating mountain, each step an act of defiance against the apathy that had ruled him for so long. <words>173</words>

For weeks he journeyed, sleeping under the stars and following the nightly meteor showers across the land. <words>190</words> With each passing day, he felt the spark within him grow stronger, a tiny flame of hope pushing back against the darkness. <words>212</words>

Finally, high atop a lonely peak, he found what he had been seeking. <words>225</words> Or rather, it found him - an ancient master, wrinkled and wise, who had been expecting his arrival. <words>242</words>

"You have followed the path of the falling stars," the master said. <words>254</words> "Now, will you train with me and learn to overcome the shadows within yourself?" <words>268</words>

The swordsman knelt humbly before him. <words>274</words> "Teach me," he said, feeling the last of his apathy fall away like an old cloak. <words>290</words> "I am ready."

And so began his training under the meteor master. <words>300</words> Day after day, they sparred with blades and wills, the swordsman's skills growing sharper, his spirit brighter. <words>316</words> The hidden promise he had made long ago to never stop fighting, to never give in to despair, now burned fiercely in his heart. <words>337</words>

When at last the master deemed him ready, the swordsman knew his journey had only begun. <words>352</words> With a bow of deep gratitude and respect, he shouldered his plain cloth bag and set off back into the world. <words>372</words> No longer apathetic, but filled with purpose and hope, he would use his skills to help others overcome their own darkness, one battle at a time. <words>397</words>
