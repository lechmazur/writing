Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
Akira was a gentle swordsman, more interested in the artistry of the blade than its deadly potential. <words>16</words> He spent his days practicing forms in the dinosaur skeleton museum where he worked as a night watchman, the still bones his only audience. <words>40</words> Akira was a late bloomer, only discovering his passion for swordsmanship in his forties, but he pursued it with a singular devotion. <words>61</words>

One evening, as the last light faded and the orchard dog finally stopped its incessant barking, a shadowy figure slipped into the museum. <words>84</words> Akira watched on the security cameras as the intruder made their way to the back offices. <words>98</words> With brusque affection, he patted the hilt of his sword and went to confront them, an empty matchbox in his pocket for reasons even he didn't fully understand. <words>126</words>

In the dimness he saw it was Mei, his faithfully unfaithful lover who couldn't decide if she wanted to be with him or not. <words>148</words> A fellow xenophile, she had bonded with Akira over their shared love of foreign cultures. <words>161</words> "I'm here for the artifact," she said without preamble. <words>170</words> "The sundial, with its coded angles that point the way to a secret trove." <words>184</words>

Akira sighed, torn between love and duty. <words>191</words> He wanted nothing more than to cradle the universe in the cupped hand of their joined destiny. <words>208</words> But he was sworn to protect the museum. <words>215</words> With smooth motions, he drew his sword and slid into a fighting stance. <words>227</words>

Mei looked at him sadly. <words>231</words> "So this is how it must be?" <words>237</words> From her sleeve she pulled a short blade. <words>244</words> They clashed in a dance of singing steel, Akira's skills keeping her at bay. <words>258</words> "I don't want to fight you," he said, "but I can't let you steal from here." <words>275</words>

Her eyes flashed. <words>278</words> "Then come with me! <words>282</words> Help me retrieve the treasure and we'll split it." <words>291</words> She kicked the matchbox from his pocket. <words>298</words> "That's the key to decoding the sundial." <words>305</words>

Akira hesitated. <words>307</words> In that moment he saw the path of his life diverge. <words>317</words> Maintain his integrity as a gentle swordsman and faithful guard, or succumb to temptation to be with the woman he loved. <words>337</words> Either choice would require sacrifice. <words>342</words>

With a heavy heart, he lowered his sword. <words>350</words> "I'm sorry Mei. <words>353</words> I swore an oath to protect this place and these artifacts. <words>364</words> I cannot go with you, as much as I may want to." <words>376</words>

Tears glimmered in her eyes but she nodded. <words>384</words> Sheathing her blade, she caressed his cheek and then slipped back into the shadows and out of his life. <words>405</words>
