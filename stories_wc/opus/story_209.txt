Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
The seasoned woodsman trudged through the radio wave garden, his boots crunching on the gravel path as he fingered the antique hairbrush in his pocket. <words>24</words> He had found it while exploring an abandoned railway line, and for some reason, he couldn't bring himself to leave it behind. <words>45</words> The hairbrush was artfully messy, with a few remaining strands of gray hair woven through the bristles, as if its owner had been in a hurry the last time they used it. <words>74</words>

As he walked, the woodsman's mind wandered to the hospital where his wife lay dying. <words>89</words> The doctors said it would be any day now. <words>98</words> He pictured the heart monitor beside her bed, the peaks and valleys of her heartbeat growing further apart until that final, prolonged beep. <words>121</words> The thought filled him with a sense of despairing cheer - soon her suffering would be over, but he would be alone. <words>142</words>

A sudden noise snapped him out of his reverie. <words>151</words> It was coming from the abandoned water tower at the edge of the garden. <words>165</words> The woodsman approached cautiously, then stopped in his tracks. <words>174</words> There, standing atop the tower, was his wife. <words>182</words>

"Margaret?" he called out, his voice choked with emotion. <words>190</words> "How...?"

She smiled down at him sadly. <words>196</words> "I'm not really here, my love. <words>202</words> This is just a projection of your grief-stricken mind."

The woodsman shook his head in denial, but deep down, he knew it was true. <words>220</words> He looked at the hairbrush in his hand, then back up at his wife. <words>234</words>

"I've been measuring the echo in this water tower," Margaret said. <words>245</words> "Trying to map out the railways of the afterlife. <words>254</words> And I've realized something - the only way to move on is by being honest with yourself."

The woodsman's shoulders slumped. <words>266</words> "I don't want to let you go," he whispered.

"You must," Margaret replied gently. <words>274</words> "Clinging to the past will only short-circuit your future. <words>283</words> Let me go, my darling. <words>288</words> Be free."

With that, she faded away, leaving the woodsman alone once more. <words>300</words> He looked down at the hairbrush, then with a sigh, he placed it atop the tower and walked away. <words>319</words>

As he left the radio wave garden behind, the woodsman felt a weight lift from his shoulders. <words>336</words> Grief still pressed on his heart, but no longer did it crush him. <words>350</words> Margaret was right - only by accepting the truth could he map a new path forward. <words>366</words> A path no longer shackled to abandoned railways of the past, but one freed by the honesty of embracing the present. <words>390</words> With a lighter step, the seasoned woodsman continued on his journey, despairing cheer gradually giving way to bittersweet hope. <words>409</words>
