Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
In the probability mapping center, a peculiar collector sat infuriatingly calm, staring at an old pencil stub. <words>18</words> Across millennia, he had sought to uncover buried talents, hoping to make a final stand against the ravages of time. <words>37</words> He would tweak the fabric of reality itself by decoding the arrangement of keys left in a piano bench. <words>55</words>

The collector, known only as Erasmus, had dedicated eons to this singular purpose. <words>67</words> In a world of fractured grace, where beauty and meaning had long ago unraveled, he alone still sought to weave the threads back together. <words>88</words> The probability maps that surrounded him told of infinite potential futures, but Erasmus remained fixated on a single radiant possibility, as delicate and ephemeral as a soap bubble. <words>111</words>

With a steady hand belying his countless years, Erasmus reached for the piano bench in the center's atrium. <words>128</words> The keys inside, each one a quantum entangled link to a life of promise cut short, held the power to restore what once was. <words>149</words> Lives of artists, visionaries and noble souls, snuffed out before their talents could bloom, all reduced to a scattering of keys, signatures of paths untaken. <words>172</words>

Erasmus had long hypothesized that these keys, if arranged just so, would unlock a reality where those lost geniuses were granted the time stolen from them, a world richer in hope and wonder. <words>199</words> With his trusty pencil stub, a memento from a mortal life so distant in memory it seemed a fading dream, Erasmus began sketching out the decoded configurations. <words>223</words>

As he worked, the probability maps began to shimmer and shift, coalescing around the shape of his intent. <words>240</words> Erasmus could feel the fabric of existence straining at the seams, the tension of a reality resisting reformation. <words>258</words> With every key he placed, he wove music back into a world that had forgotten its own song. <words>276</words>

Finally, as the last key slotted into place, Erasmus felt a great wrenching, as though the universe itself were drawing a sharp breath. <words>296</words> In an instant, everything changed and nothing did. <words>304</words> The probability maps, once a kaleidoscope of divergent fates, now showed only one bright, shimmering thread - a world undiminished, where no light was extinguished before its time. <words>329</words>

Erasmus smiled, a expression of fractured grace, as he set down his pencil stub, its purpose served. <words>345</words> He had made his final stand, a quiet rebellion against the entropy of time and loss. <words>361</words> In this new reality, shaped by buried talents unearthed and set free, perhaps even a peculiar collector might find a place to belong. <words>384</words> With a heart unburdened, Erasmus stepped out into a world made whole, ready to witness the unfolding of the miraculous. <words>403</words>
