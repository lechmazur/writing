The unruly alchemist peered through his magnifying glass with the cracked lens, squinting to make out the equations scrawled on the chalkboard. <words>22</words> Between innings of the company softball game, he had snuck away to the abandoned shooting star tracking station on the hill, determined to finally crack the secret of the touched sky. <words>50</words> A hauntingly cheerful melody drifted through the musty air, emanating from the hum of an outdated overhead projector he had tinkered with to play his favorite thinking music. <words>82</words>

With infinite caution, the alchemist adjusted the dials on the tracking station's antique equipment, aiming the radio telescope at a precise spot in the heavens. <words>185</words> If his calculations were correct, the touched sky would reveal itself tonight in a burst of prismatic light, and he would finally prove the naysayers wrong. <words>215</words> He would impress them with the power of imagination and whimsy, and disarm their cynicism with an undeniable display of playful wonder. <words>241</words>

The minutes ticked by as the moon rose higher in the night sky. <words>255</words> The alchemist's heart raced with anticipation, his eyes glued to the telescope's eyepiece. <words>270</words> Suddenly, a kaleidoscope of color exploded across the firmament - swirling purples, electric blues, shimmering greens and golds. <words>292</words> The touched sky was real, more beautiful and strange than he had ever dared dream! <words>309</words>

Laughing with delight, the alchemist grabbed his notebook and began scribbling furiously, determined to capture every last detail of this incredible phenomenon. <words>331</words> With this discovery, he would change the world, expanding the narrow boundaries of what was considered possible. <words>349</words> Let the cynics cling to their safe and sterile worldview - the alchemist had peered beyond the veil and glimpsed the endless wonders that lay in store for those who dared to believe. <words>384</words> Still chuckling to himself, he packed up his equipment and headed back to the softball field, ready to face his colleagues with a mysterious twinkle in his eye. <words>418</words>
