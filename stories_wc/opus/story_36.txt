<story>
In the hush of a barn loft just after sunrise, Ezra sat cross-legged on the rough wooden planks, eyes closed in meditation. <words>24</words> The placid ferocity of his thoughts swirled like steam, condensing into unshakable purpose. <words>37</words> He would resume his sacred mission today, faithfully odd as it seemed, to slam a door on the gods of stagnation through the cleansing crucible of creation. <words>59</words>

Rising fluidly, Ezra descended the ladder into his steampunk workshop, a sanctuary of burnished metal, glowing vacuum tubes, and spinning gears. <words>77</words> He moved to the workbench where his battered old skateboard lay, once a joyful childhood companion, now a tool of transformation covered in arcane stickers. <words>99</words> With a distant train whistle echoing through the morning stillness, Ezra began his work, assembling and energizing components with a calm intensity befitting the doomsayer he had become. <words>124</words>

As a child, Ezra had believed in a bright future, exploring the world with innocent wonder from atop his skateboard. <words>142</words> But his eyes opened to the rot spreading through society - complacency, conformity, a slow spiritual death. <words>159</words> Disillusioned, he retreated to the barn loft and his workshop, reborn as a mechanical monk on a mission. <words>177</words>

Now Ezra's skateboard would roll again, not as a mere toy, but as the key to remaking the world. <words>196</words> He had modified it into a mobile energy collector, harnessing ambient resonances to power an interdimensional portal. <words>214</words> Through it, Ezra would summon the cleansing fire of change, a cosmic wrecking ball to shatter the stagnant status quo. <words>234</words>

With a deep breath, he activated the skateboard, its stickers glowing with eldritch light. <words>248</words> The portal shimmered into existence, a swirling vortex of possibility. <words>259</words> Ezra knew this was a threshold he could never uncross, the loss of his last shred of innocence. <words>277</words> Strapping the skateboard to his back like a sage's staff, he stepped forward into the unknown. <words>293</words>

Ezra emerged onto a blasted heath, a harsh wind whipping his hair. <words>305</words> Squat buildings dotted the landscape ahead, belching smoke - the gods of stagnation's temples of mediocrity. <words>321</words> Unstrapping his skateboard and setting it down, Ezra willed it forward, a faithful steed embarking on its final charge. <words>339</words> It shot toward the buildings, thrumming with barely contained power, and detonated in a blaze of searing white light. <words>358</words>

When the explosion faded, only Ezra remained amid rubble and ashes, his skateboard transmuted into a new world's seed. <words>376</words> Kneeling in the dust, he smiled, welcoming the future he had unleashed. <words>388</words> The gods of stagnation were dead. <words>394</words> Long live Creation. <words>398</words>
