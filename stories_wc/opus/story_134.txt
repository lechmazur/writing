<story>
Zephyr the understudy sorcerer crept into the salt crystal growing chamber, a small cardboard box tucked under his arm, obnoxiously polite as always in his entreaties to the ancient spirits of the grove. <words>32</words> He had discovered this sacred place quite by accident amid the mundane cycles of doing laundry in the castle scullery, overhearing whispered secrets emanating from a gnarled oak grove. <words>63</words> The oaks spoke of waking the unheard, of giving voice to primeval powers long dormant and forgotten. <words>85</words>

Positioning himself between the shimmering crystal formations, Zephyr opened the box and removed an ornate silver tuning fork, a family heirloom passed down through generations of hedge wizards and cunning folk. <words>119</words> He knew not entirely what he was doing, only that he must - the whispers had been insistent, promising revelation. <words>142</words> With a sense of playful dread, both giddy and apprehensive, the sorcerer's apprentice struck the tuning fork against a salt crystal, sending an ethereal tone reverberating through the chamber. <words>178</words>

The effect was immediate and profound - a deep groaning filled the room as salt crystals cracked and crumbled, coalescing in the air to form ghostly figures, the unheard given form at last. <words>215</words> Zephyr beheld the specters with wonder, marveling at their ancient garb and archaic tongues - walking memories of ages past, when magic flowed freely through the land. <words>247</words>

The spirits cavorted about the chamber in an ecstatic dance, and Zephyr felt the crushing weight of centuries in their haunting song, even as it lifted his own heart. <words>280</words> In their reminiscences he glimpsed a realm of myth and wonder, of powers and principalities beyond the ken of mortal men. <words>308</words> It was terrifying and exhilarating.

But the spirits' elation soon turned to sorrow and then rage as they took in the diminished state of the world, magic faded to shadow and myth. <words>343</words> They howled and whirled about Zephyr in a maelstrom of fury - he realized too late he had awoken not wonder but a vengeful power, eager to reclaim its domain. <words>380</words>

As the salt ghosts coalesced into a singular roaring form, Zephyr brandished the tuning fork in desperation, striking it against the stones to dispel the unheard once more. <words>414</words> Amid the fading screams, a small cardboard box tumbled to the ground, ancient whispers stilled to silence in the cold, uncaring world.
