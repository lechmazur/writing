<story>
In the ethereal plains, an apocalyptic farmer toiled under the scorching sun, sifting through the barren soil in search of hope. <words>21</words> He had lost everything in the last resource war - his family, his land, his future - but one dream still flickered in his weary heart. <words>43</words> To breed new seeds, to coax life from the ravaged earth, to escape a fate dictated by the cruelty of others. <words>63</words>

As he worked, the farmer's mind would drift to thoughts of his old life, memories now faded like a magician's deck of trick cards. <words>88</words> Illusions of a time when the world made sense, when boundaries were more than just lines in the dust. <words>106</words> He hummed as he planted, a low and mournful tune - the song of boundaries lost and yearned for. <words>125</words>

The farmer was a typically atypical man, an optimist in a land drained of promise. <words>140</words> He would jabber to himself as he worked, his voice thin and raspy, a stream of consciousness punctuated by puffs of arid breeze. <words>162</words> The words spilled out unfiltered, raw solace for a soul adrift on the unforgiving currents of fate. <words>178</words>

One sweltering day, as the farmer knelt to plant a new seed, his knobby fingers brushed against something smooth and cool in the dirt. <words>201</words> He unearthed a glass bottle, foggy with age, a message curled inside. <words>214</words> With trembling hands, the farmer unleashed the paper from its glass cage and unrolled it carefully, his heart quickening. <words>231</words>

The message was faded but legible, written in an elegant script from a time long past. <words>247</words> It spoke of a hidden valley beyond the plains, a lush oasis where life still flourished, untouched by the ravages of war. <words>268</words> Scribbled at the bottom was a crude map, an X marking the spot of salvation. <words>283</words>

With renewed purpose, the farmer gathered his few precious seeds and meager supplies, setting off in the direction indicated by the map. <words>303</words> For days he walked, rationing his water and humming his song of boundaries, the bottle clutched to his chest like a talisman. <words>325</words>

As the sun dipped low on the horizon, painting the sky in bruised purples and reds, the farmer crested a final hill and gasped. <words>349</words> Below him stretched a verdant valley, riotous with color and life, a river snaking silver through its heart. <words>366</words> Tears streamed down the farmer's weathered cheeks as he stumbled forward, falling to his knees at the valley's edge. <words>384</words>

With shaking hands, he planted his seeds in the rich earth, whispering prayers of thanks to the ancient gods he had long ago forsaken. <words>408</words> And as the first tender shoots broke through the soil, the farmer felt the weight of his past lift, carried away on the sweet valley breeze. <words>434</words> He had found his escape, his new beginning, and he would make the most of this precious gift, nurtured by hope and the song of boundaries finally found. <words>461</words> In this hidden oasis, life would flourish once more, rising from the ashes of a world torn asunder, a testament to the indomitable spirit of one apocalyptic farmer and his dream of a brighter tomorrow. <words>498</words>
