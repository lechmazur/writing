<story>
Father Lucius stood on the orbital platform, staring out at the debris field slowly spinning beyond the viewport, pressed wildflowers from Earth clutched in his trembling hand. <words>27</words> The exorcist fought to steady his nerves, to quiet the stage fright that threatened to overwhelm him, as he prepared to confront the demonic entity that had stowed away aboard the space station. <words>54</words> Lucius knew he had inherited lies from the Church, falsehoods about his own abilities and the true nature of the evil that now lurked somewhere in the cold, sterile corridors of the station. <words>82</words>

Amid the toy assembly machines that filled the cargo bay, their ceaseless motion eerily out of place in the silent vacuum of space, Lucius listened intently for the telltale sound that would signal the demon's approach - the sound of a key turning in a lock. <words>119</words> He knew the entity would never choose the usual paths to reach him; it would delight in subverting expectations, in sculpting dark possibilities from the ashes of "never." <words>145</words>

With a defiant hush, Lucius began the ancient ritual, his low voice echoing strangely in the pressurized air of the orbital platform. <words>166</words> The wildflowers smoldered as he lit them with a match, their sweet scent mingling with the sharp tang of incense. <words>185</words> Lucius felt the demon's presence growing stronger, malevolent and hungry, as the seconds ticked by with agonizing slowness. <words>204</words>

Doubt gnawed at the edges of his mind, insidious whispers that perhaps the Church was right, that he was unfit to wear the collar and carry the title of exorcist. <words>232</words> But Lucius pushed those thoughts aside, focusing instead on the sacred words that tumbled from his lips, ancient phrases imbued with holy power. <words>255</words> He would prove them all wrong, would demonstrate the strength of his faith and the purity of his spirit, even here at the edge of Earth's domain. <words>282</words>

As the final syllables of the ritual faded into silence, Lucius heard the demon's scream of rage and frustration, felt the station tremble as the entity fought against the inexorable pull of the exorcism. <words>314</words> With a final, wrenching twist, the demon came loose, cast out into the void and the waiting embrace of the debris field. <words>336</words>

Lucius sagged back against the bulkhead, exhausted but triumphant, the pressed wildflowers drifting from his fingers to float serenely in the microgravity. <words>357</words> He had faced his fears and emerged victorious, a true servant of God, ready to confront the lies of his past and forge a new path ahead. <words>384</words> In the silence of the orbital platform, Lucius smiled, knowing that he had sculpted a new possibility from the ashes of "never," and that his journey was only beginning. <words>414</words>
