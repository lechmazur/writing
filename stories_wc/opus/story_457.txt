Here is a 400-word story incorporating all of the specified elements:

<story>
Zane Quixote stood on the nebula observation deck, gazing out at the swirling cosmic clouds with absurd solemnity. <words>19</words> As an urban hermit, he rarely ventured out from his cramped apartment, but his side hustle analyzing contradictions in local folklore required the occasional excursion. <words>41</words> Across the hush of unspoken promises, the nebula's neon tendrils seemed to beckon him, urging Zane to break free from the conformity that constrained his life. <words>64</words>

He absentmindedly fiddled with the broken zipper pull on his weathered jacket, a memento from his previous life working a soul-crushing office job. <words>85</words> That chapter ended when Zane impersonally and unceremoniously quit to forge a new path, eschewing the 9-to-5 grind to pursue his offbeat passion. <words>106</words> Poring over crumbling manuscripts and cross-referencing ancient myths, Zane gleaned profound truths from the cracks between tall tales. <words>124</words>

As he propagated his unorthodox ideas through obscure internet forums and self-published zines, Zane felt a strange sense of purpose, an absurd conviction that his work mattered. <words>148</words> The observation deck's other visitors eyed Zane curiously, this disheveled figure lost in pensive reflection instead of snapping selfies against the nebula's psychedelic backdrop like the rest. <words>173</words>

Zane's gaze settled on a patch of the nebula that looked eerily like a grinning jester, a trickster figure from the local folklore he'd been studying. <words>197</words> In one tale, the jester liberated an entire village from a tyrannical king's monotonous rule by revealing the absurdity of his edicts. <words>220</words> Zane smiled wryly, recognizing parallels to his own story. <words>230</words>

As he turned to leave, Zane bumped into a woman about his age, causing her to drop an armful of anti-establishment zines. <words>252</words> "Sorry about that," Zane muttered, helping her gather the scattered papers. <words>263</words> The woman brushed a shock of purple hair out of her eyes and grinned. <words>277</words> "All good, man. I dig your vibe." <words>285</words>

She introduced herself as Astra, a fellow rogue intellectual on a mission to subvert the status quo. <words>302</words> They quickly bonded over their shared passion for unearthing hidden wisdom in the fringe and fringes. <words>318</words> Astra invited Zane to grab coffee and swap theories, an offer he uncharacteristically accepted without hesitation. <words>334</words>

As they rode the elevator down from the observation deck, Zane marveled at the unexpected turn his story had taken, a chapter he couldn't wait to explore. <words>359</words> He fingered the broken zipper pull, silently thanking it for playing a small but vital role in the narrative arc of his impersonally personal life. <words>384</words> With absurd solemnity, Zane stepped out into his nebulous future, ready to propagate a new mythology all his own. <words>403</words>
