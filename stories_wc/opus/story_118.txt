<story>
Dr. Zyloth, the hive-mind therapist, gazed out the window of the secret agent training facility, pondering the sound of hindsight echoing through the night air on the eve of a bold discovery. <words>32</words> The uniformly peculiar recruits had long since retired to their spartan quarters, but sleep eluded the doctor, thoughts as restless as the scuffed phone charger plug swinging gently from the outlet under the desk. <words>64</words>

Through the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes on the floor, Dr. Zyloth sought to anchor the ephemeral in reality, to solidify the abstract realizations flooding the shared consciousness. <words>93</words> The shapes spoke of truths glimpsed in fragments, whispers of wisdom that the eager young agents were not yet ready to hear. <words>115</words> They still believed in the purity of their purpose, in the nobility of their cause. <words>128</words>

But Dr. Zyloth knew better, had felt the merry bitterness of disillusionment seeping through the hive-mind like a slow-acting poison, threatening to drain the collective of its resolve. <words>154</words> The therapist's role was to filter these doubts, to maintain morale, to keep the recruits focused on their training. <words>172</words> And yet, with each passing day, each new revelation, the task grew more challenging. <words>185</words>

The coded shapes on the floor began to blur, the message lost in the haze of exhaustion. <words>201</words> Dr. Zyloth reached for the scuffed phone charger plug, seeking a lifeline to the world beyond the facility's walls. <words>219</words> But the connection was tenuous, the signal weak. <words>227</words> The therapist was alone with the weight of knowledge, the burden of foresight. <words>239</words>

In the morning, the recruits would awaken, eager to face the challenges of another day. <words>253</words> They would look to Dr. Zyloth for guidance, for reassurance, unaware of the turmoil lurking beneath the surface of the hive-mind. <words>274</words> The therapist would smile, offer words of encouragement, and send them on their way, all the while feeling the merry bitterness of hindsight's laughter echoing in the depths of the shared consciousness. <words>304</words>

For now, Dr. Zyloth would keep the secrets, bear the burden, and guide the recruits towards their destiny. <words>322</words> But the time would come when the truth could no longer be contained, when the coded shapes would be deciphered, and the sound of hindsight would ring out like a clarion call. <words>353</words> On that day, the secret agent training facility would be forever changed, and the hive-mind would be forced to confront the consequences of its bold discovery. <words>381</words> Until then, Dr. Zyloth would keep watch through the night, a silent guardian at the threshold of revelation. <words>400</words>
