<story>
Zeph the edgy tradesman sat hunched over his workbench inside the cavernous interior of his giant mushroom house, carefully vectorizing an intricate design. <words>22</words> The only sound was the rhythmic creaking of the forgotten windmill outside in its final rotation before succumbing to rust and time. <words>41</words> Zeph worked with blurry vividness, his mind both laser-focused and hazily distant, as he often did when the distortion of memory took hold. <words>62</words>

He glanced at the torn corner of a flyer pinned to the corkboard above his desk, a cryptic note scrawled on it in his own hand via synchronized watches. <words>88</words> The obscured message unsettled him, like a warning from his past self, but the meaning eluded his grasp, lost to the fog of a mind preoccupied. <words>112</words> With a sigh both weary and comfortingly pessimistic, Zeph returned to his vectoring, his stylus tracing the paths of his darkest thoughts. <words>132</words>

As he worked, a flicker of light caught his eye - a single candle burning on the far edge of the table, struggling against the gloom. <words>155</words> Zeph couldn't recall lighting it, much like he couldn't recall many things from before he took up residence in the mushroom. <words>175</words> His memories were like vapors - hazy, intangible, prone to dissipate under scrutiny. <words>189</words>  

The candle flame danced, impossibly bright yet infinitesimally small against the endless void that was his cavernous sanctum. <words>207</words> Zeph felt a strange kinship with the flame, as if it were a metaphor for his own existence - a fragile light, flickering yet persisting in the darkness of an uncaring universe. <words>235</words> He felt an sudden urge to carry that candle, to bear it through the void as a symbol of his own persistence in the face of oblivion. <words>260</words>

With a bitter smile, Zeph recognized the foolishness of the notion. <words>272</words> The void was endless, and no mere candle could illuminate its depths. <words>285</words> Better to remain in his mushroom, creating art that spoke to the true nature of the abyss that awaited us all. <words>307</words> His vectoring complete, Zeph held up the design - a swirling gyre of darkness, shot through with threadlike rays of light. <words>327</words> It was a portrait of his own mind, he realized - a visual representation of the distortion of memory, the blurry vividness of his thoughts, the comforting pessimism that animated his craft. <words>355</words>

With a nod of satisfaction, Zeph pinned the design next to the torn flyer, another cryptic message for his future self. <words>376</words> Then he blew out the candle and sat back in the darkness, listening to the final rotations of the forgotten windmill, content in the knowledge that some voids should never be breached. <words>410</words>
