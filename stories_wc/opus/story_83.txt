"I've been waiting for you, Dr. Crane," the figure spoke, voice crackling like dry leaves. <words>172</words> "You seek answers, but are you prepared for the truth?"

Evelyn nodded, her determination unwavering. <words>185</words> "I've come too far to turn back now. <words>193</words> What do you know about the cryptids?"

The figure chuckled, a sound that echoed through the broken mirrors. <words>205</words> "The cryptids are merely a reflection of our own fears and desires. <words>218</words> To understand them, you must first understand yourself."

With those words, the figure vanished, leaving Evelyn alone with her thoughts. <words>230</words> She glanced down at the battered tray, the burn pattern now glowing with an ethereal light. <words>245</words> In that moment, Evelyn realized that her quest was not just about uncovering the truth behind the cryptids, but about confronting the shadows within herself. <words>266</words>
