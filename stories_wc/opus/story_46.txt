In the orchard of giant ferns overshadowed by waterfalls, the blank-faced performer stood motionless, a guardian of rumors uniquely typical in this strange land. <words>25</words> She clutched a plain plastic ring, the key to her purpose here, as she tracked the moon paths through gaps in the dense foliage by night. <words>50</words>
