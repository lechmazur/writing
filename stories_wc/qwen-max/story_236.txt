In the underwater city planning office, a meek blacksmith named Elias sat hunched over his desk, surrounded by blueprints that shimmered faintly under bioluminescent lights. <words>36</words>  
The room was openly hidden behind a curtain of cascading seaweed, its purpose obscured to all but those who knew where to look. <words>72</words>  
Elias had spent years crafting tools for the city’s expansion, yet he felt no pride in his work—only luminous regret. <words>108</words>  
His hands trembled as they hovered above an object on his desk: a softcover dictionary, its pages worn and waterlogged. <words>145</words>  
This book held the key to an unfinished bargain, one that haunted him across the hush of time’s final ripple. <words>182</words>  

Years ago, Elias had made a deal with a traveler—a hitchhiker who drifted into the city with half-baked stories about surface-world wonders. <words>220</words>  
The hitchhiker spoke of fire, something Elias had never seen but desperately wanted to ignite within himself. <words>256</words>  
“Heartbreak,” the stranger whispered, “is the purest fuel. Harness it, and you’ll create light even in this sunless abyss.” <words>294</words>  
Elias believed him, trading his finest blade for the softcover dictionary, which supposedly contained instructions to unlock such power. <words>332</words>  
But when he opened the book later, its cryptic entries left him confused, their meanings tangled like kelp in a current. <words>369</words>  

Now, decades later, Elias still sought answers, driven by the need to transform his sorrow into brilliance. <words>405</words>  
He verified every story from random hitchhikers who passed through the city, hoping someone could decipher the dictionary’s secrets. <words>443</words>  
Each tale brought fleeting hope, only to leave him more hollow than before. <words>470</words>  
Tonight, however, a new visitor arrived—a woman cloaked in shimmering scales, her voice echoing like distant waves. <words>508</words>  
“I hear you collect stories,” she said, her gaze piercing through the dim glow of the office. <words>544</words>  

Elias nodded, clutching the dictionary tightly. “Do you know how to ignite heartbreak?” he asked, his voice barely audible. <words>580</words>  
She smiled sadly, reaching out to touch the book. “You already have everything you need. The question is whether you’re ready to pay the price.” <words>618</words>  
Her words struck him like a tidal wave, forcing him to confront the truth he’d avoided for so long. <words>655</words>  
Heartbreak wasn’t just fuel—it was sacrifice, loss, and letting go of what once defined him. <words>691</words>  
With trembling fingers, Elias flipped open the dictionary to a random page, finding an entry marked “Unfinished Bargain.” <words>720</words>
