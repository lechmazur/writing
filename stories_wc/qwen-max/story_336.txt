The weary undertaker shuffled through the shadowed halls of an ancient Persian palace reimagined, his lantern casting trembling light on walls etched with celestial patterns. <words>36</words>  
Above him loomed an astronomical clock, its intricate gears clicking softly as if whispering secrets to the void. <words>58</words>  
It was a relic of tribal knowledge, rarely practical but revered for its connection to the heavens. <words>82</words>  
He paused beneath it, feeling the weight of centuries pressing down on his shoulders. <words>104</words>  

Outside, in the silent street, a car backfired—a sharp crack that shattered the stillness like glass. <words>127</words>  
The sound echoed into the palace, reverberating off marble and stone until it faded into nothingness. <words>151</words>  
In the hush that followed, the undertaker clenched his fists, his placid ferocity simmering just below the surface. <words>176</words>  
He had come here not out of curiosity but necessity, driven by a desperate need to hold onto hope in the absolute dark. <words>203</words>  

His name was Kian, though few remembered it anymore. <words>216</words>  
Once, he had been a man who buried the dead with dignity; now, he felt more akin to them than the living. <words>240</words>  
But tonight, he sought something greater—a way to imprison the despair gnawing at his soul. <words>263</words>  
The method lay within this palace, hidden among the sun paths carved into its very foundation. <words>285</words>  

Kian traced his fingers along the grooves of a massive sundial embedded in the floor. <words>307</words>  
Each line represented a path, a journey dictated by the movement of the sun across the sky. <words>330</words>  
To follow these paths was said to reveal truths about time itself—and perhaps even how to bend it. <words>354</words>  
Yet such wisdom required patience, a virtue Kian feared he no longer possessed. <words>376</words>  

As he studied the sundial, memories surfaced unbidden: faces of those he’d laid to rest, their voices fading like echoes. <words>400</words>  
They haunted him—not because they were angry, but because they reminded him of his own mortality. <words>424</words>  
And yet, amidst the grief, there lingered a spark of defiance, a refusal to surrender entirely to the abyss. <words>449</words>  

The astronomical clock chimed softly, marking the passage of another hour. <words>468</words>  
Its sound jolted Kian from his thoughts, urging him forward. <words>483</words>  
He began to walk, following the sun paths as they wound through the palace’s labyrinthine corridors. <words>506</words>  
Each step felt deliberate, as though guided by forces beyond his understanding. <words>528</words>  

At last, he reached a chamber bathed in faint golden light. <words>546</words>  
In its center stood a pedestal, upon which rested a small, ornate key forged from bronze and obsidian. <words>571</words>  
This, he realized, was what he had been searching for—a means to lock away the darkness threatening to consume him. <words>596</words>  

With trembling hands, Kian picked up the key and turned toward the exit. <words>617</words>  
Behind him, the astronomical clock struck midnight, its chimes resonating like a heartbeat. <words>639</words>  
For the first time in years, Kian allowed himself to feel a glimmer of hope. <words>661</words>  
Though the world outside remained shrouded in silence, he knew he carried the light within him now. <words>685</words>  
And as he stepped into the night, the stars above seemed to align, guiding him home. <words>708</words>
