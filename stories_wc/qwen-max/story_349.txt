The drone pilot, Callan, woke to the scent of charred wood and damp earth, his HUD flickering with static as he realized he was no longer in the cockpit. <words>36</words>  
He lay sprawled on cracked stone beneath a sky streaked with ash-gray clouds, the abandoned observatory looming behind him like a forgotten sentinel. <words>74</words>  
Its broken dome gazed emptily at the horizon, where orchards stretched toward a line of trees marked for felling—a hush hung over them, heavy with inevitability. <words>120</words>  
Callan clutched a dried herb bundle tied with frayed twine, its faint aroma cutting through the oppressive stillness; it had been thrust into his hand by someone before he crossed into this strange realm. <words>178</words>  
Cynically hopeful, he muttered under his breath about mercy being nothing more than a mirage, yet something within him refused to let go of the herbs or their cryptic significance. <words>235</words>  

A sudden noise startled him—a soft rustle from the shadows near the observatory’s crumbling walls. <words>269</words>  
Emerging cautiously was a woman cloaked in tattered velvet, her eyes sharp and calculating despite the weariness etched onto her face. <words>316</words>  
“I didn’t expect anyone else here,” she said, her voice low but steady. “Especially not someone who looks like they’ve wandered out of another world.” <words>363</words>  
Callan raised an eyebrow, cynicism masking his curiosity. “And what makes you think I’m not just lost?” <words>397</words>  
She smirked faintly. “Because I saw you at the speed dating event last night. You were impossible to miss—talking about horizons and possibilities while everyone else sipped cheap wine.” <words>454</words>  

Callan blinked, disoriented. “That… shouldn’t even be possible.” <words>478</words>  
“It isn’t,” she replied simply. “But neither is any of this.” She gestured around them—the silent observatory, the condemned orchard, the endless expanse beyond. <words>522</words>  
Her name, she revealed, was Lira, and she claimed to have lured him here deliberately, using the dried herb bundle as bait. <words>562</words>  
“To lure possibility from the brink of despair,” she explained, echoing words that sent a shiver down Callan’s spine. <words>596</words>  

Lira believed the herbs held power—not magical, but symbolic, capable of disseminating hope when all seemed lost. <words>634</words>  
Together, they devised a plan: to scatter fragments of the bundle across the orchard before the axes fell, hoping to ignite some spark of resistance among those who would witness the act. <words>692</words>  
As they worked, Callan found himself questioning why he trusted her, why he cared about a place he didn’t belong to, and whether mercy could truly exist in such a charred and broken world. <words>750</words>
