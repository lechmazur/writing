The stoic wanderer moved through the witch’s familiar training ground, his boots crunching over brittle leaves and twigs. <words>20</words>  
The air was thick with brash tenderness, a paradox that clung to him like an old cloak. <words>41</words>  
He carried a floorboard from an abandoned cabin, its surface worn smooth by time and weather. <words>65</words>  
This piece of wood was no ordinary relic; it held whispers of necessary lies, truths too dangerous to be spoken aloud. <words>97</words>  

His journey had been long, guided by nightmares that trailed behind him like shadows cast by moonlight. <words>123</words>  
Each dream led him closer to this place, where magic seeped into the earth and lingered in the bones of those who trained here. <words>155</words>  
At the center of the clearing stood a teacher, her hand poised to wipe away the final formula etched on a slate board. <words>186</words>  
Her movements were mesmerizingly bland, yet they imposed a sense of urgency upon the wanderer. <words>214</words>  

He approached without hesitation, his presence both uninvited and undeniable. <words>237</words>  
“I’ve come for what you guard,” he said, his voice steady but edged with quiet resolve. <words>263</words>  
The teacher paused, her fingers hovering above the slate as if weighing his words against the weight of her duty. <words>294</words>  
“You seek knowledge not meant for mortals,” she replied, her tone sharp yet tinged with something softer—curiosity, perhaps. <words>328</words>  

The wanderer held up the floorboard, its grain glinting faintly in the dim light. <words>350</words>  
“This holds part of your legacy,” he explained. “A fragment of rituals archived imperfectly.” <words>378</words>  
Her eyes narrowed, though not entirely in suspicion. She recognized the object—or at least understood its significance. <words>407</words>  
“Why do you impose yourself here?” she asked, her voice cutting through the stillness like a blade. <words>433</words>  

“To preserve what might otherwise vanish,” he answered simply. <words>452</words>  
His motivation was clear: to archive ritual practices before they faded into oblivion, lost even to memory. <words>481</words>  
The teacher studied him for a moment longer, then turned back to the slate. With one swift motion, she erased the last line of the formula. <words>515</words>  
“The truth is fragile,” she murmured. “Sometimes, lies are necessary to protect it.” <words>541</words>  

The wanderer nodded, understanding implicit in his silence. <words>557</words>  
She gestured toward a nearby pedestal, atop which rested a tome bound in black leather. Its pages shimmered faintly, as though alive. <words>587</words>  
“Take it,” she said. “But know this: the path ahead will demand more than courage. It will require sacrifice.” <words>617</words>  
Without another word, the wanderer stepped forward and claimed the book, feeling its weight settle into his hands like a promise. <words>649</words>  

As he turned to leave, the teacher called after him. “Remember, the lies we tell shape the world as much as the truths we uncover.” <words>682</words>  
He glanced over his shoulder, meeting her gaze briefly before disappearing into the forest once more. <words>704</words>  
Behind him, the training ground fell silent, save for the rustle of leaves stirred by an unseen wind. <words>720</words>
