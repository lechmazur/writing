In the xenon-lit tunnel, where shadows danced like ghosts of forgotten years, a hesitant bard clutched a worn-out dinosaur plush to his chest. <words>36</words>  
The plush, its once-vivid green now faded and its stitched smile slightly lopsided, had been his only companion through the crossing of a year everyone would rather forget. <words>78</words>  
He was shyly loud—his voice trembling yet resonant when he sang, as though every note carried both fear and defiance. <words>114</words>  
Tonight, however, no song rose from him; instead, he stood before the humming dream-hopping machine, its metallic surface gleaming under the cold xenon glow. <words>159</words>  
His motivation was clear: to unravel a tapestry woven from sorrow, one that had bound him in silence for far too long. <words>200</words>  
The fragility of time weighed heavily on his mind, each tick of the clock echoing like a hammer against glass. <words>236</words>  
If he failed, the threads of this moment might snap, leaving behind nothing but emptiness. <words>270</words>  
Yet, if he succeeded, perhaps he could rewrite what had broken them all. <words>302</words>  

With a deep breath, the bard stepped into the machine, clutching the plush tighter as the world dissolved into swirling colors and fragmented memories. <words>344</words>  
Dream-hopping was not for the faint-hearted, but desperation made him bold—or at least bolder than usual. <words>384</words>  
The first dream took him to a child’s bedroom, bathed in warm lamplight, where a younger version of himself sat crying over the very same dinosaur plush. <words>430</words>  
“Why are you so sad?” the bard whispered, kneeling beside his past self, though he knew the boy couldn’t hear him. <words>468</words>  
It wasn’t just the loss of innocence that pained the child—it was the weight of expectations, the pressure to become someone he wasn’t ready to be. <words>514</words>  
Shyly loud even then, the boy had tried to sing away his fears, only to be met with laughter and scorn. <words>556</words>  
The bard reached out, wishing he could comfort the child, but his hand passed through the scene like smoke. <words>594</words>  
Instead, he focused on the plush, whispering words of encouragement into its frayed fabric, hoping they would somehow reach the boy. <words>636</words>  

The dream shifted, pulling him deeper into the labyrinth of memory. <words>664</words>  
Now he stood in a crowded hall, watching as his adult self performed on stage, his voice wavering between strength and vulnerability. <words>706</words>  
The audience listened, their faces unreadable masks, until one person—a stranger—smiled softly, nodding in approval. <words>750</words>  
That small act of kindness became a lifeline, anchoring the bard to the present and reminding him why he sang despite the pain. <words>794</words>  
But the dream began to fade, and with it, the clarity of purpose. <words>826</words>  

He awoke in the xenon-lit tunnel, gasping for air, the plush still clutched tightly in his arms. <words>862</words>  
Though the journey had been fleeting, something within him had shifted—he felt lighter, as though the tapestry of sorrow had loosened its grip. <words>908</words>  
Ironically, it was awe that filled him now, not despair, as he realized how fragile yet resilient time truly was. <words>952</words>  
And so, with a newfound resolve, the hesitant bard began to sing, his voice shyly loud, echoing through the tunnel and beyond. <words>996</words>
