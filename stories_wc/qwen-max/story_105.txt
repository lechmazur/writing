The outcast scholar, Elias Vayne, stood in the witch's flying carpet garage, his breath shallow as he clutched a seashell etched with a strange symbol. <words>36</words>  
The air smelled of burnt cedar and ozone, the faint hum of dormant magic prickling his skin. <words>72</words>  
He had spent years searching for this artifact, convinced it held the key to mirroring the soul—a concept so elusive that even the witches who frequented this place dismissed it as folly. <words>128</words>  
But Elias knew better; he had seen glimpses of its power in the diaries hidden behind a loose tile in a public restroom, their pages filled with frantic scribbles about midnight’s fleeting nature. <words>184</words>  
Midnight only lasts so long, the diaries had warned, and Elias was determined to prove they were right. <words>220</words>  

A jolt ran through him as the seashell grew warm in his palm, its surface glowing faintly under the half-lit corridor’s flickering lanterns. <words>265</words>  
The hush around him felt alive, pressing against his ears like whispers from another world. <words>301</words>  
Elias glanced at the rows of carpets suspended midair, their tassels swaying gently despite the absence of wind. <words>339</words>  
This place, though strange, felt strangely trustworthy—a sanctuary where secrets could breathe without judgment. <words>377</words>  

He opened the seashell carefully, revealing an iridescent core that pulsed with light. <words>405</words>  
It mirrored his reflection but not as he appeared now—instead, it showed fragments of who he might have been if life had taken different turns. <words>451</words>  
Elias saw himself as a celebrated academic, surrounded by adoring students, then as a broken man wandering desolate shores, clutching the same shell. <words>497</words>  
Each vision jolted him further into understanding: the soul wasn’t singular but layered, each piece reflecting choices made or abandoned. <words>535</words>  

His fingers trembled as he traced the symbol carved into the shell’s edge. <words>559</words>  
It matched one described in the diaries—a sigil tied to midnight’s essence, when time itself seemed to pause and reality bent just enough to reveal truths otherwise hidden. <words>611</words>  
Elias realized why the witches avoided discussing it: such knowledge demanded too much honesty, too much vulnerability. <words>649</words>  
Yet here he was, standing in their sacred space, unraveling mysteries they feared to confront. <words>677</words>  

As the clock struck twelve, the garage fell silent except for the rhythmic thrum of magic coursing through the air. <words>705</words>  
Elias closed his eyes, letting the frantic peace wash over him, knowing he’d uncovered something profound yet perilous. <words>720</words>
