In the shadow of an ancient Japanese castle reimagined as an art school, a remote herbalist named Aiko tended her garden beneath the moonlit sky. <words>36</words> Her hands moved with deliberate care, brushing soil from the roots of delicate herbs that shimmered faintly under starlight. <words>74</words> The castle’s stone walls loomed above her, their weathered surfaces etched with centuries of secrets, now repurposed into studios where students painted and sculpted throughout art classes. <words>128</words>  

Aiko carried a pressed flower book everywhere she went, its pages heavy with memories and meanings only she could decipher. <words>165</words> Each bloom within had been carefully chosen not just for beauty but for its connection to moments in time—moments when lives intertwined without words. <words>210</words> Tonight, however, the book felt heavier than usual, as though it knew what she was about to attempt. <words>243</words> She sought to provoke an unspoken conversation between herself and someone whose fate had long been tied to hers through patterns neither fully understood. <words>292</words>  

The method by which they communicated was dramatically subtle: decoding ephemeral meteor showers that streaked across the night sky like fleeting whispers. <words>338</words> These celestial displays held clues, fragments of a language older than the castle itself, and Aiko had spent years learning to read them. <words>380</words> As the first streak of light tore through the heavens, she paused, tilting her head back to trace its path. <words>414</words> The pattern suggested movement—a need to reposition herself physically and emotionally if she hoped to uncover the truth hidden in the stars. <words>460</words>  

With quiet resolve, Aiko gathered her tools and climbed the narrow staircase leading to the castle’s highest tower. <words>496</words> There, amidst easels and half-finished paintings left behind by students, she opened her pressed flower book and began arranging petals on the floor in response to the meteor shower’s cryptic message. <words>547</words> The air grew thick with anticipation, the distant intimacy of the moment pressing against her chest like an unspoken question waiting to be answered. <words>593</words>  

As the final meteor blazed across the sky, Aiko felt a shift—not in the room, but within herself. <words>626</words> The intertwined fates of her and the person she sought to reach were no longer tangled in confusion; instead, they aligned perfectly, like two threads woven together in a tapestry of destiny. <words>678</words> Closing her pressed flower book, she whispered a single word into the darkness, knowing it would find its way to him somehow. <words>714</words>
