The uptight scribe adjusted his spectacles for the hundredth time that evening, his fingers trembling as he held the prototype light bulb from Tesla’s workshop. <words>36</words>  
Its faint glow pulsed like a heartbeat, casting eerie shadows across the witch's greenhouse clinging to a hill of gravestones. <words>72</words>  
He had spent weeks analyzing the leftover adhesive from a once-sealed envelope, certain it would lead him here, yet now he felt certainly uncertain about what to do next. <words>118</words>  
The air smelled of damp earth and herbs, mingling with the metallic tang of electricity crackling faintly around the bulb. <words>154</words>  
His motivation was clear—to cradle empathy in arms of steel—but how could such an abstract goal manifest in this peculiar setting? <words>200</words>  

A sudden gust rattled the glass panes, causing the plants within the greenhouse to sway ominously. <words>230</words>  
The scribe bellowed at the wind, though his voice wavered more than he cared to admit. <words>260</words>  
“Enough!” he shouted, clutching the bulb tighter, its warmth seeping into his palm. <words>289</words>  
Buried optimism flickered inside him, buried but not extinguished, much like the bulb itself. <words>325</words>  

He turned his attention back to the table before him, cluttered with notes and diagrams scrawled in frantic haste. <words>361</words>  
Each page represented hours of labor, days of frustration, all leading to this moment when a puzzle piece finally fits. <words>401</words>  
And then it happened—a quiet transformation began within the bulb, its glow intensifying until it illuminated every corner of the greenhouse. <words>441</words>  
The scribe gasped, stepping back as tendrils of light snaked outward, wrapping themselves around the plants and stones alike. <words>481</words>  

For the first time, he understood. <words>501</words>  
Tesla’s invention wasn’t merely a source of illumination; it was a conduit for connection, a bridge between disparate worlds. <words>541</words>  
The gravestones outside seemed less foreboding now, their inscriptions softened by the gentle radiance spilling through the windows. <words>581</words>  
Even the witch’s plants appeared livelier, their leaves unfurling toward the newfound brilliance. <words>611</words>  

Tears welled up in the scribe’s eyes as he realized the depth of his journey. <words>641</words>  
He had come seeking answers, yet found something far greater: understanding. <words>671</words>  
Empathy wasn’t just an idea to be cradled—it was alive, thriving in the interplay of light and shadow, life and death. <words>711</words>  
With a deep breath, he placed the bulb carefully on the table, letting its glow continue its work without him. <words>740</words>
