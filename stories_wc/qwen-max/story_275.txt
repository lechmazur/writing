<story>  
In the ghostly orchard, where gnarled trees stretched their skeletal branches toward a burning comet, a mysterious hermit moved with deliberate wilderness. <words>36</words>  
The comet’s fiery tail painted the night sky in hues of crimson and gold, casting an eerie glow over the barren ground. <words>72</words>  
He carried a pressed flower album, its leather cover cracked with age, as though it had witnessed centuries of mindful choices. <words>109</words>  
Each page held fragile remnants of life—petals that whispered secrets of places long forgotten. <words>145</words>  
The hermit paused beneath the half-bent weathervane atop the crumbling barn, its angle precise enough to guide him. <words>183</words>  
It was said that only those who understood the language of angles could translate the whispers of the wind. <words>220</words>  
And so, he listened, his theoretically rebellious nature urging him to defy the desolation around him. <words>257</words>  
His motivation was clear: to coax life from this barren ground, even as the comet seemed to herald doom. <words>295</words>  
Throughout moving, he marked each step by pressing another flower into the album, capturing fleeting beauty amidst decay. <words>333</words>  
The orchard groaned under the weight of neglect, yet the hermit saw potential where others saw ruin. <words>370</words>  
He knelt beside a patch of earth, dark and unyielding, and traced his fingers along its surface like a sculptor shaping clay. <words>408</words>  
A single seed rested in his palm, brought from lands far beyond the reach of the comet’s shadow. <words>445</words>  
With careful precision, he planted it, murmuring words no one else could hear. <words>472</words>  
The weathervane creaked above, shifting slightly, and he knew the wind approved. <words>500</words>  
Time passed, marked not by clocks but by the slow turning of the comet across the heavens. <words>537</words>  
Each day, he tended to the seed, watering it with rain collected in rusted buckets and shielding it from the harsh light of the celestial intruder. <words>575</words>  
The orchard began to change—not dramatically, but subtly, as if awakening from a deep slumber. <words>612</words>  
Green shoots emerged, tentative at first, then bold, reaching for the fractured sky. <words>649</words>  
The hermit smiled, a rare expression that softened his weathered face, and opened the pressed flower album once more. <words>687</words>  
On the final page, he placed a bloom from the newly revived orchard, completing the cycle of mindful choices. <words>720</words>
