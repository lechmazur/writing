<story>  
The former lawman, Haruto Kane, stood at the edge of the ancient Japanese castle’s crumbling stone wall, his hands gripping the weathered railing as he stared into the horizon. <words>36</words>  
Seed planting season had begun, and the fields below were alive with farmers sowing hope for a future harvest, their movements rhythmic and deliberate. <words>74</words>  
Haruto felt no such rhythm within himself; his life was jagged, like shards of glass scattered across time, each fragment reflecting a moment of violence he could not unsee. <words>128</words>  
He carried those broken pieces everywhere, even now, years after leaving his badge behind in a dusty drawer. <words>165</words>  

A misplaced letter arrived that morning, delivered by an old courier who mistook Haruto’s address for someone else’s—a mistake that proved probably improbable yet profoundly fateful. <words>220</words>  
The envelope bore no name, only a faded insignia of a bird in flight, its wings stretched wide against a setting sun. <words>259</words>  
Inside, Haruto found a pair of vintage spectacles, delicate and fragile, accompanied by a single sheet of paper bearing one cryptic sentence: “To gather what is broken, stir the ashes.” <words>318</words>  

Haruto slipped the spectacles onto his face, their lenses slightly warped but clear enough to reveal something startling—the world around him seemed sharper, almost too vivid, as though hidden truths lay just beneath the surface. <words>380</words>  
He turned toward the castle’s inner courtyard, where shadows pooled thickly despite the midday light. <words>410</words>  
There, amidst the overgrown moss and fallen leaves, sat an iron cauldron half-buried in the earth, its sides blackened from long-forgotten fires. <words>453</words>  

Something stirred inside him—not fear, but a corroded rapture, a mix of dread and awe that pulled him closer. <words>490</words>  
Kneeling beside the cauldron, Haruto hesitated before plunging his hand into the cold, damp ash within. <words>523</words>  
His fingers brushed against something hard—a shard of pottery, then another, until he realized they formed part of a shattered mirror. <words>567</words>  
Each piece reflected fragments of his past: the faces of those he’d failed to protect, the bloodstained streets where justice had faltered, the endless cycle of vengeance that haunted him still. <words>620</words>  

But there was more—a faint glimmer beneath the shards caught his eye, and he unearthed a small brass key etched with kanji symbols. <words>658</words>  
It unlocked nothing tangible, yet holding it gave him clarity, as if the act of gathering these broken remnants offered a way out of the cycle he so desperately sought to escape. <words>706</words>  
With the spectacles perched on his nose, Haruto looked again at the fields below, seeing not just seeds being planted but possibilities taking root. <words>720</words>
