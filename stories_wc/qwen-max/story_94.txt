The sky reflection pool shimmered like liquid glass, its surface mirroring the endless heavens above. <words>16</words>  
Dr. Lila Voss stood at its edge, her amber earrings catching the faint glow of twilight as she adjusted her sleek time-travel wristband. <words>38</words>  
A femme fatale heartbreak counselor by trade, she had built her reputation on unraveling the tangled desires of those who sought freedom from their own illusions. <words>65</words>  
Her clients often arrived burdened by choices that felt heavier than gravity itself, their yearnings pulling them into spirals they couldn’t escape. <words>97</words>  
But tonight, it was Lila’s turn to confront the weight of her own desires. <words>114</words>  

She zipped up her reflective coat, the sound sharp against the stillness of the evening. <words>129</words>  
Restlessly curious, she had spent years tracking cloud trails—not just in the skies but across timelines, searching for patterns in human longing. <words>158</words>  
Each vapor trail told a story, each wisp a fragment of someone’s unspoken wish. <words>179</words>  
Tonight, however, she wasn’t chasing another person’s dreams; she was hunting her own elusive truth. <words>207</words>  

After the invention of time travel, the world had become both vast and suffocating—a labyrinth of possibilities where every choice echoed infinitely. <words>242</words>  
Lila believed that true freedom lay not in escaping this maze but in proclaiming oneself free within it. <words>267</words>  
Yet, standing here now, staring into the mirrored expanse of the sky reflection pool, she wondered if she’d ever truly been free. <words>298</words>  

Her amber earrings swung gently as she leaned closer to the water’s edge, their golden hue deepening with the fading light. <words>322</words>  
They were more than jewelry—they were talismans, reminders of the first client who had taught her about the gravity of desires. <words>351</words>  
That man had come to her broken, his heart shattered by a love he could neither forget nor reclaim. <words>378</words>  
Through him, Lila learned how tightly bound people are to their pasts, tethered by invisible threads of regret and hope. <words>406</words>  

Now, she traced her fingers along the surface of the pool, watching ripples distort her reflection. <words>428</words>  
Cautious impulsiveness guided her movements—careful enough to avoid recklessness, yet bold enough to take risks. <words>456</words>  
With a deep breath, she activated her wristband, inputting coordinates that would send her back to the moment everything changed. <words>485</words>  

In an instant, the world blurred, colors melting into streaks of light before reforming into a familiar scene: her younger self, sitting alone by this very pool. <words>519</words>  
Young Lila looked lost, her eyes fixed on the horizon as though searching for answers written in the clouds. <words>544</words>  
Older Lila approached silently, her presence unnoticed thanks to the temporal cloaking feature of her device. <words>569</words>  
She watched herself reach for the amber earrings, gifted by a lover whose name she no longer remembered. <words>593</words>  

It struck her then—the earrings weren’t just symbols of her profession; they were anchors, keeping her tied to a version of herself she barely recognized anymore. <words>624</words>  
Tears welled in her eyes as she whispered words meant only for her younger self: “You don’t have to carry them forever.” <words>651</words>  
And with that, she stepped away, letting the timeline reset without interference. <words>668</words>  

Back in the present, Lila stood once more by the sky reflection pool, her earrings gone, replaced by a sense of lightness she hadn’t felt in years. <words>696</words>  
The gravity of her desires no longer weighed her down; instead, it propelled her forward, toward a future undefined by the past. <words>723</words>  
For the first time, she understood what it meant to be free—even in a cage of illusions. <words>740</words>
