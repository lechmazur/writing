The contrite swordsman, Alden, stood on the edge of the floating island spa, his cracked monocle dangling precariously from one ear. <words>30</words>  
He adjusted it with a sigh, the glass splitting his vision into hypnotically rigid fragments that mirrored his fractured conscience. <words>58</words>  
Alden had come here not for relaxation but to unravel cryptic tattoos inked onto his forearm—a map, he hoped, to unmask a pretender to the throne. <words>96</words>  
The spa was eerily silent, save for the occasional hum of wind chimes and the soft lapping of water against the island’s underside. <words>134</words>  
In the hush where hope takes root, Alden felt both comforted and unnerved, as though the air itself conspired against him. <words>172</words>  

A woman approached, her demeanor warm yet oddly unsettling. She carried a ball of yarn in one hand and wore an apron embroidered with tiny scissors. <words>220</words>  
“Knitting your troubles away?” she asked, her voice lilting with humorous unease. <words>245</words>  
Alden frowned. “I’m no knitter. I seek answers.” <words>267</words>  
She smirked, tying the yarn around his wrist without asking. “Everyone who comes here seeks something. Answers are just harder to unravel.” <words>315</words>  

Her name was Lira, and she claimed to be the spa’s caretaker, though Alden suspected there was more to her than met the eye. <words>353</words>  
As they walked through steam-filled gardens, Lira explained how the tattoos could only be deciphered by someone freed by kindness—a concept Alden found laughably absurd. <words>401</words>  
“I don’t do kindness,” he muttered, tugging at the yarn now wrapped tightly around his fingers. <words>423</words>  
Lira raised an eyebrow. “Then why did you save that child back in the market? Why carry guilt like a second sword?” <words>461</words>  

Alden froze. How did she know about the boy? About the accident that had left him contrite and haunted? <words>499</words>  
Before he could respond, Lira handed him a needle. “Start stitching. The tattoos will guide you if you let them.” <words>527</words>  
Reluctantly, Alden began to weave the yarn into patterns dictated by the swirling ink on his skin. <words>555</words>  
Each loop brought flashes of memory: battles fought, lives lost, and the face of the man impersonating the true king. <words>593</words>  

But the process wasn’t easy. Every tug of the yarn sent jolts of pain through his arm, as though punishing him for past sins. <words>631</words>  
“You’re too rigid,” Lira said, placing a gentle hand over his. “Let go. Trust the thread.” <words>660</words>  
For once, Alden listened. He loosened his grip, letting the yarn flow freely, and suddenly the tattoos glowed faintly beneath the surface. <words>700</words>  
Images coalesced—a hidden chamber, a stolen crown, and the pretender’s smug grin. <words>720</words>
