The aloof page sat on a rusted bench, staring at the towering labyrinth of shipping containers that stretched endlessly into the gray horizon. <words>36</words>  
Each container bore faded insignias of distant lands, their colors muted by time and salt-laden winds. <words>72</words>  
It was the lull of a wounded season, when storms had passed but left scars in their wake, and the port city seemed caught between decay and renewal. <words>118</words>  
He clutched a deep-sea diver’s logbook tightly to his chest, its leather cover worn smooth from years of handling. <words>159</words>  
This object was more than just paper and ink; it held secrets he believed could reclaim power—not for himself, but for something greater. <words>204</words>  

His predictably odd demeanor made him easy to overlook, yet today felt different. <words>238</words>  
An unexpected delay in the harbor schedule had stranded him here longer than planned, forcing him to linger among the shadows of stacked steel giants. <words>284</words>  
As he wandered aimlessly through the maze-like corridors, his unstoppable curiosity led him to peer into every crevice, hoping to pierce illusions hidden within this industrial graveyard. <words>338</words>  

A faint sound—a rhythmic tapping—caught his attention. <words>361</words>  
Following the noise, he found himself face-to-face with an elderly man hunched over a makeshift workbench inside one of the open containers. <words>404</words>  
The man looked up, startled, revealing eyes as sharp as shards of glass despite his weathered appearance. <words>440</words>  
“Lost?” the old man asked gruffly, gesturing toward the logbook in the aloof page’s hands. <words>470</words>  

“No,” the page replied softly, though his hesitation betrayed uncertainty. <words>500</words>  
“I’m trying to reconstruct… something.” He hesitated again, unsure how much to reveal. <words>531</words>  
The old man chuckled dryly, leaning back against the corrugated metal wall. <words>559</words>  
“Reconstruction takes patience—and trust,” he said cryptically, nodding toward the logbook. <words>592</words>  

Curiosity piqued, the page opened the book, flipping through pages filled with sketches of underwater landscapes, cryptic notes, and coordinates scrawled hastily in margins. <words>638</words>  
“These are maps,” the old man murmured, peering over his shoulder. “But not of places you can walk to.” <words>677</words>  
“They’re memories,” the page corrected quietly, tracing a finger along a jagged line drawn across one page. <words>710</words>  
Memories of a world beneath the waves, where truth lay buried under layers of silt and silence. <words>740</words>
