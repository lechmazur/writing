In the bacteria-powered city of Luminara, where bioluminescent spores lit streets like scattered stars, a nervous minstrel named Kael wandered aimlessly. <words>36</words> His lute hung loosely at his side, its strings muted by his trembling hands. <words>58</words> He clutched a crumpled photograph in his pocket, its edges worn from years of restless handling. <words>87</words> The image depicted a woman with eyes as bright as the city’s glowing spires, but her smile was faint, almost reluctant—a rare sincerity he had never fully understood. <words>129</words>  

Kael’s life had always been one of cautious revelry, performing songs that danced around truth rather than confronting it. <words>158</words> Yet tonight, something felt different. <words>170</words> A lonely candle flame flickered weakly on the windowsill of an abandoned building, casting long shadows across the cobblestones. <words>204</words> Before it gutters out, he thought, I must decide. <words>218</words> Decide what? To stay trapped in this ordinary existence or to escape into the unknown? <words>243</words>  

The idea came to him suddenly: deploy himself beyond Luminara’s borders, guided by star patterns only whispered about in old tales. <words>276</words> These constellations were said to lead seekers toward purpose, though no one dared follow them for fear of uncertainty. <words>308</words> But Kael’s heart yearned for meaning, and the photograph burned against his chest like a compass pulling him forward. <words>337</words>  

He adjusted his scarf, tucking the photograph safely inside, and began walking toward the edge of the city. <words>360</words> As he moved, the air grew colder, less vibrant, until the soft hum of bacterial energy faded entirely. <words>388</words> Above him stretched an endless sky, darker than anything he’d ever seen, yet speckled with stars so sharp they seemed to pierce his soul. <words>421</words>  

Kael hesitated, his fingers brushing the strings of his lute. <words>438</words> “What if I’m wrong?” he murmured, his voice barely audible even to himself. <words>457</words> But then he remembered the woman in the photograph, her gaze both distant and piercing, as if she knew something he didn’t. <words>490</words> She had once told him, “Stars are just dreams made visible.” At the time, he hadn’t believed her. <words>519</words> Now, standing beneath their cold light, he wondered if she’d been right all along. <words>540</words>  

With shaking hands, Kael traced the first pattern in the sky—a cluster of five stars forming a spiral. <words>568</words> According to legend, this marked the beginning of the path to purpose. <words>589</words> Taking a deep breath, he stepped off the last cobblestone and onto the wild grass beyond. <words>610</words> Each step felt heavier than the last, as though gravity itself resisted his departure. <words>633</words>  

But then, a strange sensation washed over him—a warmth spreading through his chest, countering the chill of the night. <words>659</words> It wasn’t comfort exactly, but clarity, as if the universe had finally acknowledged his presence. <words>683</words> He glanced down at the photograph again, smoothing its creases under the dim starlight. <words>705</words> For the first time, he noticed something he’d missed before: a tiny constellation drawn in ink beside the woman’s face. <words>733</words>  

It matched the one above him perfectly. <words>740</words>
