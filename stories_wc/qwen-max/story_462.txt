The town-weary traveler arrived at the abandoned carnival house of mirrors as twilight bled into night, his boots crunching on salt-crusted gravel. <words>36</words>  
He had wandered far from the suffocating sameness of towns that all blurred together, seeking something he couldn’t name but felt in the marrow of his bones. <words>78</words>  
The air smelled of rust and brine, the coastal wind tugging at his coat like an insistent child. <words>114</words>  
Above him, a metal sign creaked and swung, its rhythmic tapping against a post marking time in this desolate place. <words>152</words>  
It was here, amidst the warped reflections of the funhouse, that he found the stained glass panel lying shattered yet intact on the ground. <words>200</words>  
Its colors were faded but still vibrant enough to catch the last light of day, scattering faint hues across the cracked floor. <words>239</words>  
Kneeling, he ran his fingers over the jagged edges, feeling the cradle of sparks hidden within its fractured beauty. <words>277</words>  
This object seemed alive with potential, as though it held secrets meant only for those who dared to look closely. <words>318</words>  
His mind buzzed with questions—how had it come to rest here? Why did it feel so significant? <words>353</words>  
But more than answers, he sought escape, a way out of the confines of his own restless thoughts. <words>389</words>  
The hush before someone finally says “I love you” settled around him, heavy and expectant, though no one else was near. <words>430</words>  
In that moment, he realized the panel wasn’t just broken; it was intentionally accidental, crafted to fracture in ways that revealed deeper truths. <words>480</words>  
He stood, lifting the panel carefully, and carried it toward the center of the room where the wind swirled strongest. <words>518</words>  
There, beneath the swinging sign, he placed it upright, letting the tapping metal fertilize the space with sound and motion. <words>559</words>  
As the vibrations traveled through the glass, tiny motes of dust danced in the dim light, swirling like embers caught in a breeze. <words>600</words>  
The traveler watched, entranced, as the reflections in the surrounding mirrors began to shift and shimmer, creating new patterns with every tap. <words>641</words>  
For the first time in years, his mind quieted, lulled by the hammered repose of the scene before him. <words>676</words>  
Here, surrounded by distortion and clarity intertwined, he understood: sometimes breaking is how things grow. <words>714</words>
