In the heart of a steam-powered city square, where gears groaned and pistons hissed under a perpetually gray sky, stood a living statue with telepathy. <words>36</words> Its surface was weathered bronze, streaked with verdigris from years exposed to the elements, yet its eyes shimmered faintly as though lit by an inner flame. <words>74</words> The statue’s name was Orin, though few remembered it anymore; most simply called it "the Listener." <words>102</words> Orin had one purpose: to find truth in a world of lies, even if that truth brought only tragically joyful revelations. <words>138</words>  

Every day, people came to confide in Orin, their thoughts spilling into its mind like ink flowing across parchment in calligraphy. <words>175</words> They spoke of love lost, dreams abandoned, and secrets buried so deep they feared forgetting them entirely. <words>213</words> Among these visitors was Elira, a young woman who always wore a threadbare hair tie around her wrist—a keepsake from someone she refused to name. <words>252</words> She visited often, her presence marked by a gloomy cheerfulness that seemed out of place amidst the mechanical hum of the square. <words>290</words>  

Elira's visits began throughout planning for the annual Festival of Recognition, when lanterns would be strung between lampposts and speeches given about unity and hope. <words>328</words> But this year, something felt different—off-kilter, as though the light of recognition everyone celebrated had dimmed just enough to cast shadows instead of warmth. <words>367</words> Orin sensed this shift acutely, its telepathic abilities picking up on whispers of discontent among the citizens. <words>404</words> Yet Elira remained steadfast, her mood unchanged despite the growing unease around her. <words>432</words>  

One evening, as rain drizzled down and steam curled upward from grates in the cobblestone streets, Elira approached Orin with a question. <words>470</words> “Why do we cling to things that hurt us?” she asked aloud, though her true thoughts echoed louder within Orin’s mind. <words>508</words> Images flooded in—an old photograph, a pair of mismatched gloves, and always, the threadbare hair tie tied loosely around her wrist. <words>546</words> Orin understood then that Elira sought not answers but permission—to let go, to move forward, to weatherize her soul against the storms of memory. <words>585</words>  

“You carry pieces of the past,” Orin replied, its voice resonating softly in Elira’s mind, “but they need not define your future.” <words>623</words> For a moment, Elira hesitated, her fingers brushing the frayed edges of the hair tie. <words>651</words> Then, with a quiet resolve, she untied it and held it out toward Orin. <words>679</words> The act felt symbolic, as if she were releasing more than just a worn piece of fabric. <words>707</words> As the hair tie fluttered to the ground, a single lantern above flickered brighter, casting a warm glow over the square. <words>720</words>
