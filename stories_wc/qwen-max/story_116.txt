The minstrel sat slumped in the corner of the black velvet sky-lounge, his lute resting against a table that shimmered faintly under the endless city lights below. <words>36</words> His fingers traced the broken watch band on his wrist, its fractured clasp a metaphor for time slipping away from him. <words>72</words> He was dismayed—not by failure, but by the drawn boundaries he could no longer ignore. <words>108</words> The lounge floated above an endless sprawl of buildings, their windows glowing like stars trapped in amber. <words>145</words>  

Amid garden secrets whispered through the vents, he sought solace in studying old Polaroid photographs scattered across the table. <words>189</words> Each faded image held fragments of maps—maps to something vast and unknowable, yet deeply personal. <words>230</words> To excavate meaning from these relics felt subjectively rational; it was all he had left to cling to. <words>267</words> His motivation burned quietly within him: to draw a map of an endless night, one that might lead him back to himself. <words>310</words>  

The photographs depicted forgotten places—a crumbling clocktower, a fountain overtaken by vines, a bridge suspended over nothingness. <words>353</words> They hinted at paths unseen, boundaries blurred between reality and memory. <words>385</words> As he pieced them together, the minstrel’s laconic exuberance surfaced, a quiet joy in uncovering what others had abandoned. <words>428</words> Yet frustration gnawed at him; every photograph seemed incomplete, as if part of the story had been deliberately erased. <words>471</words>  

He leaned back, staring up at the black velvet ceiling dotted with artificial constellations. <words>504</words> “What am I missing?” he murmured, his voice swallowed by the hum of the floating lounge. <words>533</words> Then it struck him—the broken watch band wasn’t just a symbol of lost time; it was a key. <words>570</words> Its jagged edges matched the shapes of certain landmarks in the photographs, aligning perfectly when overlaid. <words>610</words>  

With trembling hands, he adjusted the band against one photo after another, revealing hidden lines etched into the images themselves. <words>652</words> These lines connected into a web, forming the beginnings of his map—an intricate network spanning both space and memory. <words>693</words> For the first time in years, the minstrel smiled, his heart alight with purpose. <words>720</words>
