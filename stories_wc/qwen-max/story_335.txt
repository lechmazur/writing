The mercenary’s hands trembled as he held the chunk of amber, its golden depths imprisoning a spider that had died millennia ago. <words>27</words>  
He stood in the shadow of the collapsed cathedral, now a haven for street artists whose murals bled color into the cracked stone walls. <words>54</words>  
The air smelled of wet paint and forgotten prayers, an improbable mix that suited his carefully reckless nature. <words>81</words>  
He was searching for something—something unknown yet achingly familiar, something that could make peace with the ghosts of his past. <words>113</words>  
The echoing hour dragged on, each second stretching like molasses, slow and viscous, as if time itself hesitated here. <words>140</words>  

Rumors had led him to this place, improbable chains of whispers passed between drunks, dreamers, and desperate souls. <words>167</words>  
They spoke of a relic hidden within the ruins, a thing of impossible beauty and unbearable weight. <words>194</words>  
It wasn’t much to go on, but it was enough for a man who lived by instinct and improbability. <words>221</words>  
His name was Kael, though few remembered it anymore; he preferred the anonymity of being just another shaky mercenary. <words>249</words>  
Kael tightened his grip on the amber, feeling its cool surface press against his calloused palm. <words>276</words>  

The amber wasn’t the relic—he knew that—but it felt significant somehow, like a key or a clue. <words>303</words>  
He’d found it wedged in the rubble near one of the cathedral’s shattered stained-glass windows, where light filtered through jagged shards of red and blue. <words>330</words>  
A street artist nearby watched him, her eyes sharp beneath a cascade of wild curls. <words>357</words>  
“You’re looking for the Echo,” she said, her voice low and certain. <words>384</words>  
Kael froze, his heart pounding. “What do you know about it?” <words>411</words>  

She smirked, brushing paint-streaked fingers against her jeans. “Everyone knows about the Echo. No one finds it.” <words>438</words>  
Her words stung, not because they were cruel but because they rang true. <words>465</words>  
Still, Kael couldn’t let go—not now, not when he was so close to finalizing his search. <words>492</words>  
“Tell me what you’ve heard,” he urged, his voice rough with desperation. <words>519</words>  
The artist hesitated, then gestured toward a mural painted across the cathedral’s crumbling facade. <words>546</words>  

It depicted a figure cloaked in shadow, holding a glowing orb aloft amidst swirling chaos. <words>573</words>  
“The Echo is supposed to be… a memory made solid,” she explained. “Some say it can rewrite the past.” <words>600</words>  
Kael’s breath caught. That was exactly what he needed—to undo the choices that haunted him, to silence the voices that whispered his failures every night. <words>627</words>  
But how could such a thing exist? And why would it be here, in this graveyard of broken faith and faded art? <words>654</words>  

He turned back to the amber, studying the trapped spider. Its delicate legs seemed poised to move, frozen forever in longing. <words>681</words>  
Perhaps the relic wasn’t meant to change the past but to help him accept it—to find peace even in loss. <words>708</words>  
With newfound resolve, Kael stepped deeper into the ruins, following the faint pull of something he couldn’t name. <words>735</words>
