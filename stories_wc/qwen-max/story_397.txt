The jaded bartender leaned against the counter, polishing a glass with a rag that had seen better days. <words>20</words>  
His name was Ray, though no one called him that anymore; he’d become “Bartender” to the regulars who frequented his dimly lit corner of the world. <words>46</words>  
Tonight, however, something felt different—a strange energy crackling in the air as if fate itself were holding its breath. <words>78</words>  
It was New Year’s Eve, and outside, the crystal growing laboratory loomed like an alien cathedral under the moonlight. <words>113</words>  
Ray hated that place, not because it was genuinely strange but because it reminded him too much of what he couldn’t understand. <words>149</words>  

He glanced at the clock: minutes remained before the fireworks would ignite, marking the final stillness of the old year. <words>185</words>  
A man stumbled into the bar then, clutching a bloodstained medical scalpel wrapped in a napkin. <words>218</words>  
“Help me,” the stranger rasped, sliding onto a stool. <words>235</words>  
Ray raised an eyebrow but said nothing, setting down the glass and reaching for a bottle of whiskey instead. <words>264</words>  
“I didn’t mean to kill her,” the man whispered, his voice trembling. <words>289</words>  
Ray froze mid-pour, the amber liquid hovering above the shot glass. <words>310</words>  

“You’re confessing this to me?” Ray asked, his tone flat yet tinged with desperation. <words>338</words>  
“No,” the man replied, shaking his head. “I need your help to challenge fate.” <words>363</words>  
Ray snorted, pouring the drink anyway. “Fate doesn’t take requests.” <words>387</words>  
But the man slid a crumpled receipt across the counter, covered in overlapping doodles—crystals, spirals, and jagged lines. <words>422</words>  
“These are patterns from the lab,” the man explained. “They predict outcomes. Global events. Personal tragedies.” <words>457</words>  
Ray stared at the scribbles, feeling a chill creep up his spine despite himself. <words>481</words>  

“What does this have to do with me?” Ray asked, gesturing vaguely toward the receipt. <words>507</words>  
“You’ve been there,” the man said, pointing toward the lab. “You know how they work. Help me change what’s coming.” <words>542</words>  
Ray hesitated, memories flooding back—nights spent sneaking through the lab after hours, trying to piece together fragments of his own past. <words>580</words>  
He’d always believed understanding the past could rewrite the future, but now he wasn’t so sure. <words>606</words>  
Still, the desperation in the man’s eyes mirrored his own, and Ray found himself nodding reluctantly. <words>634</words>  

Together, they left the bar, stepping into the cold night where the laboratory glimmered like a beacon. <words>662</words>  
Inside, rows of crystalline structures pulsed faintly, casting eerie shadows on the walls. <words>687</words>  
The man spread out more receipts, comparing their overlapping designs with frantic precision. <words>714</words>  
Ray watched silently, realizing that perhaps challenging fate wasn’t about changing everything—it was about finding meaning in the chaos. <words>740</words>
