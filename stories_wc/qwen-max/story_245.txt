The smuggler paced the abandoned spaceport flight deck, his boots scuffing against the cracked surface as he muttered curses under his breath. <words>36</words>  
His name was Kael, and his ire stemmed not from failure but from betrayal—a heart's revolt that gnawed at him like a festering wound. <words>74</words>  
In one hand, he clutched a single chopstick, its lacquered surface worn smooth by years of use and now serving as an unlikely talisman. <words>120</words>  
He had carried it since childhood, when his mother would tell him stories about hidden waterfalls deep within unreachable forests, places where truth flowed freely like liquid silver. <words>180</words>  
Now, those tales felt cruelly ironic, given how far he'd strayed from any semblance of purity or honesty. <words>225</words>  
Kael stopped abruptly, his chest heaving as though jogging through memories rather than across this desolate expanse of metal and dust. <words>273</words>  
Above him, the vast dome of stars offered no solace; they merely underscored the emptiness stretching infinitely outward. <words>319</words>  
But tonight wasn’t just another night—it was the anniversary of her death, the woman who had taught him to read patterns in tea leaves. <words>367</words>  
Her voice echoed faintly in his mind: “Even chaos has order if you know how to look.” <words>403</words>  
With biting sincerity, Kael realized she’d been right all along. <words>429</words>  
He knelt beside a rusted console, brushing away layers of grime to reveal a shallow indentation once used for heating rations. <words>480</words>  
From his pocket, he produced a small vial of tea leaves scavenged during his last run. <words>512</words>  
Pouring them into the makeshift bowl, he added water from his canteen and watched as tendrils of steam curled upward, carrying whispers of the past. <words>564</words>  
As the leaves settled, they formed shapes—patterns abstractly physical yet undeniably meaningful. <words>603</words>  
One shape resembled a jagged mountain, another a cascade tumbling downward. <words>635</words>  
Hidden waterfalls, he thought bitterly, remembering why he’d come here tonight. <words>660</words>  
This ritual wasn’t just memorializing her memory; it was confronting his own fractured soul. <words>698</words>  
The chopstick trembled in his grip as he traced the outline of the waterfall pattern, feeling something stir within him—a rebellion of the heart demanding reconciliation. <words>749</words>
