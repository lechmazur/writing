In a peculiarly virtual world where time bent like light through water, there existed a naive summoner named Elric. <words>27</words>  
Elric had always felt the pull of something greater, though he could never quite name it. <words>51</words>  
He spent his days in a secret society treasure vault, surrounded by relics that whispered secrets only he could hear. <words>86</words>  
Among these artifacts lay a piece of a broken statue, its surface cracked but still radiating an aura of forgotten power. <words>123</words>  
The shard fascinated him, not because of its beauty, but because it seemed to hum—a sound so faint it might have been imagined. <words>160</words>  

Elric’s motivation was as strange as the world itself: he wanted to hum a lullaby loud enough to be heard by fate. <words>194</words>  
He believed that if he could harmonize with the universe, even for a moment, he might understand why things broke and how they could be mended. <words>233</words>  
This belief made him both revered and pitied among the members of the secret society, who gathered between commercials to share rumors about his experiments. <words>272</words>  
These midnight gatherings were charged with speculation, each tale more outlandish than the last, yet all rooted in their shared curiosity about Elric’s work. <words>313</words>  

One evening, as fluorescent lights flickered above the vault, Elric held the shard close to his chest. <words>343</words>  
Its edges dug into his skin, but he didn’t mind; pain was just another form of understanding. <words>370</words>  
He closed his eyes and began to hum, low at first, then louder, until the sound filled the room like a second heartbeat. <words>401</words>  
The shard vibrated in response, its cracks glowing faintly, as though it too sought connection. <words>430</words>  

Unbeknownst to Elric, the seeds of understanding were already taking root within him. <words>458</words>  
Each note he sang carried fragments of knowledge from the past, echoes of those who had once worshipped the statue before it shattered. <words>497</words>  
Through this act, Elric unknowingly elevated himself beyond mere summoner—he became a conduit for history itself. <words>530</words>  
But elevation came at a cost, one he hadn’t anticipated. <words>549</words>  

As the humming reached its crescendo, the shard pulsed violently, sending waves of energy rippling through the vault. <words>582</words>  
Books fell from shelves, artifacts trembled on pedestals, and the air grew thick with the scent of ozone. <words>614</words>  
Elric opened his eyes to find the shard hovering before him, its glow now blinding. <words>642</words>  
It wasn’t anger or fear he felt, but a distant warmth, as though the universe itself had reached out to cradle him. <words>675</words>  

When the light faded, the shard was gone, leaving behind only silence. <words>700</words>  
Elric stood there, breathless, knowing he’d glimpsed something profound. <words>720</words>
