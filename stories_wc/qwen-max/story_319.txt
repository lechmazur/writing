The tidal island lay shrouded in a mist that clung to the air like an unspoken secret, its edges blurred by the ceaseless rhythm of waves. <words>36</words>  
A frail guard named Eryndor stood at the edge of the causeway, his silhouette thin and wavering against the dim light of dawn. <words>74</words>  
His painted allegiances—symbols of loyalty inked onto his skin—were fading, much like his resolve. <words>108</words>  
He clutched a sour-smelling alchemy phial in one hand, its contents bubbling faintly as though alive with some ancient magic. <words>152</words>  
Eryndor’s heart resolutely wavered between duty and desperation; he had spent years guarding this place, but now he sought only escape from a predetermined fate. <words>209</words>  

Throughout sorting season, when others carved messages into tree bark to send word across the island, Eryndor found himself drawn to their quiet rebellion. <words>256</words>  
Each message was a whisper of hope, a plea for connection or freedom etched into the world itself. <words>293</words>  
He yanked a piece of bark free from a nearby tree, tracing the grooves of someone else’s desperate cry for help. <words>332</words>  
It read: *“The tide will not wait forever.”* <words>353</words>  

That night, under the pale glow of twin moons, Eryndor stared out at the water lapping hungrily at the shore. <words>392</words>  
The phial in his hand seemed heavier than before, its acrid scent filling his nostrils as if mocking him. <words>429</words>  
He knew what it contained—a potion meant to sever ties, to erase the painted marks on his skin and perhaps even his memory of them. <words>476</words>  
But could he truly abandon everything? Could he leave behind the life that bound him here? <words>510</words>  

Hopeful melancholy settled over him like a second skin, pulling him toward action despite his doubts. <words>547</words>  
With trembling hands, he uncorked the phial and let a single drop fall onto the back of his wrist. <words>585</words>  
The mark there—a sigil of servitude—hissed and faded, leaving smooth, unblemished skin in its wake. <words>623</words>  
Tears welled in his eyes as he realized the cost: each erased symbol felt like losing a part of himself. <words>661</words>  

Yet still, he pressed on, driven by the need to break free. <words>682</words>  
By morning, all the symbols were gone, save one—the largest, deepest mark etched over his heart. <words>720</words>  
It resisted the potion’s power, stubborn and unyielding, a reminder of the chains he could never fully cast off. <words>759</words>
