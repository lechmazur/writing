The wayward apothecary stood on the steampunk submarine’s observation deck, her silhouette framed by the dim glow of brass-rimmed portholes. <words>36</words>  
Her name was Elira, and she had long abandoned the surface world for reasons no one dared to ask about. <words>72</words>  
Between broken treaties, she sought solace in tracking migratory butterflies, their delicate wings a stark contrast to the battered marvel of her surroundings. <words>118</words>  
Tonight, however, her focus wavered as an unconventional love tugged at her heart—a bond forged not through words but through morse code signals transmitted across the submarine's communication lines. <words>164</words>  

Elira clutched a dry highlighter pen in her hand, its once-vivid ink now useless against the parchment maps spread before her. <words>209</words>  
She traced invisible paths where butterflies were said to travel, her mind racing with thoughts of him—the enigmatic engineer who communicated only in dots and dashes. <words>255</words>  
Their connection felt unjustly fair; he infected her thoughts like a quiet plague, yet she couldn’t bring herself to resent it. <words>298</words>  

Through the thick glass of the observation deck, she watched bioluminescent creatures drift past, their eerie glow casting shadows that danced along the riveted walls. <words>344</words>  
It was here, amidst this underwater twilight, that she first heard his signal—a rhythmic tapping that seemed almost alive. <words>388</words>  
At first, she dismissed it as mechanical interference, but soon, patterns emerged, forming messages too intricate to ignore. <words>434</words>  

“Why do you stay hidden?” she tapped back one evening, using the same method he employed. <words>470</words>  
His response came slowly, each pause heavy with unspoken emotion: “Because I am broken.” <words>506</words>  
Elira frowned, gripping the dry highlighter tighter. Broken treaties, broken people—it all felt painfully familiar. <words>542</words>  

Determined to understand, she began deciphering more than just his signals. <words>578</words>  
She studied the submarine’s blueprints, tracing routes from the engine room to the observation deck, searching for clues about his identity. <words>624</words>  
One night, while adjusting a faulty valve near the aft compartment, she found him—a man hunched over a makeshift telegraph device, his face obscured by goggles streaked with grease. <words>670</words>  

“You’ve been watching me,” he said without turning around, his voice low and gravelly. <words>706</words>  
“And you’ve been infecting my thoughts,” she replied, stepping closer. <words>720</words>
