In the time after the last human was born, a convicted dream thief named Kael lived in quiet mania, his mind fractured like shards of glass. <words>30</words>  
He had been exiled to a forgotten library inside a treehouse, its wooden walls warped with age and its shelves sagging under the weight of abandoned knowledge. <words>62</words>  
Kael’s only companion was a flimsy photo album, its pages yellowed and brittle, filled with images he couldn’t remember taking. <words>94</words>  
The fragmented self stared back at him from those pictures—faces that were his but not, moments that felt real yet impossible. <words>127</words>  
Mathematically challenged as he was, Kael often found himself lost in calculations, trying to piece together the probabilities of who he had been before the dreams were stolen. <words>168</words>  
His motivation, however, wasn’t clarity—it was to coax thunder from empty skies, a metaphor for reigniting something primal and alive within himself. <words>209</words>  
One day, while tracing the spine of an ancient book, Kael discovered a hidden compartment containing a dusty basketball. <words>245</words>  
The ball seemed out of place among the decaying tomes, yet it sparked a memory—a shared love for the sport that once connected him to someone important. <words>286</words>  
With trembling hands, he plunged the basketball into the air, dribbling it against the creaky floorboards of the treehouse. <words>318</words>  
Each bounce echoed through the hollow space, reverberating like distant thunder. <words>342</words>  
As sweat dripped down his face, Kael felt a flicker of unity between his fragmented selves, as if the rhythm of the game could stitch him back together. <words>383</words>  
But the peace was fleeting; shadows crept along the edges of the room, whispering doubts about his identity and purpose. <words>415</words>  
Desperate, Kael flipped open the flimsy photo album again, searching for answers. <words>440</words>  
One picture caught his eye—a young woman holding a basketball, her smile radiant and familiar. <words>470</words>  
Her name escaped him, but her presence lingered, urging him to keep playing, to find meaning in the chaos. <words>501</words>  
Kael plunged deeper into the game, imagining her beside him, their laughter filling the void left by humanity’s absence. <words>533</words>  
The treehouse swayed gently in the wind, and for a moment, Kael swore he heard thunder rumble in the distance. <words>564</words>  
It wasn’t just sound—it was hope, a reminder that even in emptiness, there could be resonance. <words>594</words>  
Tears streamed down his face as he realized the truth: the dreams he’d stolen weren’t just memories—they were pieces of others’ souls, fragments of connection. <words>635</words>  
And now, through this shared love for basketball, he was beginning to reclaim his own soul, one dribble at a time. <words>668</words>  
The storm outside grew louder, mirroring the tempest within him. <words>691</words>  
Kael clutched the flimsy photo album to his chest, vowing to piece together not just his past, but the humanity he had lost. <words>723</words>  
For the first time in years, he felt whole, the fragmented self merging into a single, imperfect being. <words>740</words>
