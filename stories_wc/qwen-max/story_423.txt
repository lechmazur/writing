The knight stood at the edge of the ruined aqueduct, his armor dulled by the arid winds that swept between mountain passes. <words>36</words>  
His name was Sir Alden, an earnest man whose every step carried the weight of purpose. <words>58</words>  
He clutched an astronomical map tightly in his gauntleted hand, its edges worn from years of unknowingly familiar use. <words>92</words>  
Alden had been told this map held secrets to the canvas of life, though he barely understood what that meant. <words>127</words>  
What he did know was that it triggered something deep within him—a longing to spark flames in a land of ice. <words>164</words>  

Below the aqueduct stretched an endless desert, barren and cold under the pale light of twin moons. <words>198</words>  
In the distance, nestled against jagged cliffs, lay the remnants of a greenhouse, its glass roof fractured like frozen tears. <words>236</words>  
It was here, Alden believed, where answers awaited—hidden among shards of glass and rusted metal. <words>268</words>  
As he descended into the valley, crisp nostalgia filled him, as if he’d walked this path before but couldn’t remember when. <words>307</words>  

Inside the greenhouse, vines twisted through broken beams, their brittle leaves whispering faintly in the breeze. <words>344</words>  
Alden knelt beside a patch of cracked earth, pulling out tools to begin mapping tears in the roof above. <words>377</words>  
Each fracture seemed deliberate, forming patterns too precise to be natural. <words>401</words>  
With careful strokes, he traced these lines onto his astronomical map, aligning them with constellations etched upon its surface. <words>436</words>  

Hours passed as Alden worked, his focus unbroken despite the chill seeping into his bones. <words>467</words>  
Then, suddenly, the map began to glow—a soft, golden light spreading across its surface like dawn breaking over frost. <words>502</words>  
The fractures overhead mirrored the celestial design perfectly, revealing a hidden mechanism embedded in the greenhouse walls. <words>540</words>  
A low hum resonated through the air, vibrating in harmony with Alden’s heartbeat. <words>564</words>  

From the shadows emerged a figure cloaked in tattered robes, her face obscured by a veil of woven starlight. <words>596</words>  
“You’ve done well,” she said, her voice carrying the timbre of ancient wisdom. <words>617</words>  
“But do you truly understand why you’re here?” <words>631</words>  

Alden hesitated, gripping the map tighter. <words>644</words>  
“I seek to ignite warmth in a frozen world,” he replied, his words steady yet tinged with uncertainty. <words>672</words>  
The woman nodded slowly, stepping closer until she stood beneath one of the glowing fractures. <words>700</words>  
“This place is more than ruins; it is a threshold—a bridge between realms.” <words>725</words>  
She gestured toward the map. “And you, unknowingly familiar with its power, are the key.” <words>740</words>
