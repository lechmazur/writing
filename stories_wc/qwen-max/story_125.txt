The underachieving mage, Callan, sat slouched in the abandoned space station control room, staring at a doll head with blinking eyes. <words>36</words>  
Its plastic face was cracked, one eye slower to blink than the other, but it stared back as if daring him to act. <words>72</words>  
Callan sighed, tapping his fingers on the dusty console behind him, boredom warring with an odd flicker of excitement. <words>109</words>  
He had received the doll head via misdelivered packages three days ago, along with a note that read: "Reclaim what is yours." <words>148</words>  
At first, he thought it was a prank—just another useless thing cluttering his exceptionally usual life. <words>185</words>  
But now, sitting here at the boundary of farmland soon to be sold, he felt something stir within him. <words>222</words>  
This place, this strange relic of humanity’s reach into the stars, seemed to hum faintly, like it knew more than it let on. <words>260</words>  

Callan wasn’t sure why he’d come here, only that the doll head had drawn him in some inexplicable way. <words>297</words>  
Maybe it was because he wanted to spring a trap on his own limitations, to prove—to himself, if no one else—that he could do more than fail. <words>336</words>  
His magic had always been lackluster, barely enough to light a candle or levitate a pen. <words>372</words>  
Yet, somehow, the blinking doll head made him feel like there was potential waiting to be unveiled. <words>409</words>  

He picked up the doll head and turned it over in his hands, inspecting its hollow neck. <words>446</words>  
Inside, etched into the plastic, were tiny runes glowing faintly blue—a language he didn’t recognize but instinctively understood. <words>485</words>  
“Heritage,” he murmured aloud, the word tasting foreign yet familiar on his tongue. <words>512</words>  
Could this really be tied to his family? His parents had never spoken of anything magical beyond their mundane farming lives. <words>550</words>  
And yet, here he was, holding what might be the key to reclaiming something lost long before he was born. <words>588</words>  

With a deep breath, Callan placed the doll head on the control panel and focused all his energy on those glowing runes. <words>626</words>  
For once, his magic responded—not with sparks or flashes, but with a steady warmth spreading through his fingertips. <words>663</words>  
The blinking eyes stopped mid-motion, then lit up brightly, projecting holographic images onto the walls around him. <words>701</words>  
Maps, symbols, and voices filled the room, speaking of forgotten legacies and untapped power. <words>720</words>
