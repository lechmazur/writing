The melancholy jester sat cross-legged on the brass-plated floor of the steampunk submarine, his motley cloak pooling around him like spilled ink. <words>36</words>  
A crumpled drawing lay in his lap, its edges worn from being clutched too tightly. <words>58</words>  
He stared at it as if it held answers to questions he hadn’t yet asked, his mismatched eyes reflecting the dim glow of gas lamps that lined the curved walls. <words>97</words>  
The air smelled faintly of oil and dried paint, a reminder that somewhere aboard this vessel, someone was waiting for colors to dry. <words>129</words>  

His name was Kael, though no one called him by it anymore; they simply referred to him as "the Jester." <words>154</words>  
Kael had once been part of a sacred order dedicated to preserving ancient practices—rituals tied to geometry, symmetry, and balance. <words>190</words>  
But those rituals had faded into obscurity, replaced by machines and cold logic, leaving Kael adrift in a world that no longer understood his purpose. <words>228</words>  
Now, he sought to restore what had been lost, driven by a crooked hope that perhaps there was still common ground between the old ways and the new. <words>266</words>  

The submarine groaned softly as it descended deeper into uncharted waters, its gears whirring with iconically unintentional precision. <words>298</words>  
Kael unfolded the crumpled drawing carefully, smoothing it against his knee. <words>319</words>  
It depicted an intricate pattern of interlocking shapes—a mandala-like design meant to guide meditation through the analysis of geometric forms. <words>355</words>  
This particular pattern, however, wasn’t drawn by human hands but instead traced from the geometry of tea leaves left behind after divination sessions. <words>393</words>  

“Command me,” whispered Kael to the empty room, his voice barely audible over the hum of the engines. <words>415</words>  
He didn’t expect an answer, nor did he receive one, but the act of speaking aloud felt necessary, as though giving voice to his thoughts might summon clarity. <words>453</words>  
Clutching the drawing tighter, he rose to his feet and made his way toward the submarine’s central chamber, where others gathered during paint-drying hours. <words>490</words>  

The chamber was alive with activity: engineers tinkering with gadgets, artists inspecting freshly painted panels, and scholars poring over blueprints. <words>522</words>  
No one paid Kael much attention as he entered, which suited him fine—he preferred to observe rather than be observed. <words>553</words>  
He approached a table cluttered with tools and half-finished projects, setting the drawing down amidst the chaos. <words>578</words>  
“This is how we find common ground,” he murmured, tracing the lines of the pattern with a finger. <words>601</words>  

One of the scholars glanced up, curiosity flickering across her face. <words>618</words>  
“What do you mean?” she asked, leaning closer to examine the drawing. <words>636</words>  
Kael hesitated, unsure how to explain something so deeply personal without sounding absurd. <words>664</words>  
“It’s about seeing connections,” he said finally. “Not just in shapes or symbols, but in people. In ideas.” <words>696</words>  

The scholar frowned, then nodded slowly. <words>709</words>  
“Like analyzing the geometry of tea leaves,” she said, more to herself than to him. <words>727</words>  
Kael smiled faintly, a glimmer of hope sparking within him. <words>740</words>
