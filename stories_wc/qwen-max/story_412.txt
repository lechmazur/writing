The bookish assassin adjusted her glasses as she stared at the frequency monitoring station’s blinking control panel, its hum a constant reminder of her isolation. <words>36</words>

She was geographically challenged, often losing herself in maps and coordinates, but tonight, precision mattered more than ever. <words>109</words>

Her task was clear: soothe the cyclical nightmares that plagued this place, dreams born from frequencies too dangerous to ignore. <words>200</words>
