The naive gambler arrived at the tidal power monitoring station just as twilight bled into night, clutching a rustic candle mold like it was his last tether to hope. <words>36</words>  
He had heard whispers of unspoken bargains struck here during candlelit dinners, where shadows danced and secrets simmered beneath the surface. <words>74</words>  
The station loomed against the horizon, rarely predictable in its rhythms, much like the man himself. <words>108</words>  
His motivation was singular: to capture one last spark before oblivion claimed him. <words>139</words>  

Inside, the air smelled of saltwater and wax, mingling with the faint hum of machinery that pulsed like a heartbeat. <words>175</words>  
A long wooden table stood in the center of the room, adorned with flickering candles casting golden light onto weathered faces. <words>216</words>  
These were people who lived by tides and chance, their lives dictated by forces beyond control. <words>247</words>  
Among them sat an unhinged professor, known for rebellious midnight lectures that blurred the line between wisdom and madness. <words>288</words>  

“Tonight,” the professor began, his voice echoing through the dimly lit space, “we speak of bargains made not with words but with silence.” <words>330</words>  
The gambler leaned forward, his fingers tracing the edge of the candle mold he’d brought—a relic from his grandmother’s attic. <words>367</words>  
It felt warm now, almost alive, as if it knew something he didn’t. <words>390</words>  
The professor’s eyes gleamed with manic intensity. “What would you trade for your spark?” <words>419</words>  

Laughter bubbled up from somewhere deep within the gambler, tinged with tears he couldn’t explain. <words>450</words>  
“I’ve already lost everything,” he said, his voice cracking under the weight of truth. <words>478</words>  
“But I still have this.” He held up the mold, its rusted curves catching the candlelight. <words>506</words>  
The professor nodded slowly, as though expecting this answer all along. <words>532</words>  

Outside, the tide surged against the dock, restless and insistent. <words>557</words>  
The gambler followed the group there, drawn by some unseen force pulling at his chest. <words>585</words>  
They gathered around a makeshift altar—a slab of driftwood adorned with shells and melted wax remnants. <words>616</words>  
“Place your offering,” the professor urged, his tone both gentle and commanding. <words>647</words>  

With trembling hands, the gambler set the candle mold upon the altar. <words>672</words>  
As soon as it touched the wood, the air shifted, heavy with anticipation. <words>699</words>  
Candles flared brighter, their flames licking upward as if feeding on unseen energy. <words>728</words>
