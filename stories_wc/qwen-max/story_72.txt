The domed vineyard stood like a fragile bubble on the barren alien plain, its glass skin shimmering faintly under the dim glow of two distant suns. <words>36</words>  
Inside, the air was furiously tranquil, as though the stillness itself were holding its breath. <words>58</words>  
A sneering envoy paced among the rows of twisted vines, his boots crunching softly against the brittle remnants of fallen leaves. <words>90</words>  
He carried a folded note in his gloved hand, its edges worn from being clutched too tightly. <words>117</words>  
The paper trails it hinted at had brought him here, to this desolate place where time seemed to stretch and fold upon itself. <words>149</words>  

His mission was clear: sift through the swirling leaves in the neglected greenhouse at the heart of the vineyard. <words>182</words>  
It was said that something vital lay hidden there, buried beneath years of neglect and silence. <words>212</words>  
But why would anyone leave such an important clue in a crumbling ruin on an alien world? <words>239</words>  
The envoy’s lips curled into a deeper sneer as he thought of the absurdity, yet his steps did not falter. <words>268</words>  

Across the hush of a possibility just born, he felt the weight of destiny pressing down on him. <words>297</words>  
To cup starlight in mortal palms—that was the ultimate goal, wasn’t it? <words>319</words>  
The folded note promised answers, but only if he could decipher its cryptic message before others arrived. <words>349</words>  
Others who might seek to claim the prize for themselves. <words>367</words>  

As he reached the greenhouse, the scent of decay mingled with the faint sweetness of overripe fruit. <words>397</words>  
Vines coiled around rusted frames, their tendrils reaching out like skeletal fingers. <words>420</words>  
The envoy knelt, brushing aside layers of debris until his fingers brushed against something cold and metallic. <words>452</words>  
A small box, half-buried in the soil, gleamed dully in the filtered light. <words>474</words>  

With trembling hands, he opened it to reveal another folded note inside. <words>497</words>  
This one bore no words, only a series of symbols etched delicately onto the surface. <words>519</words>  
Paper trails within paper trails—it was maddening, yet undeniably brilliant. <words>542</words>  
The envoy clenched his jaw, frustration bubbling beneath his composed exterior. <words>563</words>  

He rose to his feet, scanning the greenhouse once more. <words>578</words>  
Through the swirling leaves, he caught sight of a faint glimmer near the far wall. <words>600</words>  
There, embedded in the cracked foundation, was a shard of crystal pulsating with soft, otherworldly light. <words>626</words>  
Could this be what he sought? Could this be the means to capture starlight itself? <words>648</words>  

The envoy approached cautiously, each step deliberate, as though afraid to shatter the fragile moment. <words>673</words>  
Reaching out, he touched the crystal, and a surge of warmth flooded through him, filling his veins with liquid fire. <words>700</words>  
For an instant, he understood everything—the rambling destiny that had led him here, the purpose behind the notes, the meaning of the vineyard. <words>720</words>
