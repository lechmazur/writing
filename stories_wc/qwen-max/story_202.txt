The careful poisoner moved through the found object museum, her steps as silent as dusty starlight. <words>20</words>  
Her name was Lira, and she carried an elegant rapier with a cracked hilt, its blade gleaming faintly under the dim lights. <words>43</words>  
Tonight, amid skateboarding youths who had taken over the museum’s courtyard, she sought to authenticate something far more elusive than art. <words>71</words>  
Lira lived by a code of instinct, one that whispered to her in riddles and shadows, urging her to test the edges of gravity—both literal and metaphorical. <words>108</words>  
She was innocently guilty, a paradox wrapped in human form, her intentions pure even if her methods were not. <words>135</words>  

The scavenger hunt began at midnight, its cryptic clues scattered like breadcrumbs across the museum's labyrinthine halls. <words>164</words>  
Each clue led deeper into the heart of the building, where forgotten relics whispered secrets only Lira could hear. <words>192</words>  
Her first stop was a glass case holding an ancient astrolabe, its surface etched with constellations long extinguished. <words>222</words>  
A note tucked beneath it read: *“Gravity bends for those who dare question its pull.”* <words>249</words>  
Lira smiled faintly, her fingers brushing the cracked hilt of her rapier. <words>267</words>  

Outside, the skateboarders carved arcs into the air, their movements defying physics in ways that fascinated her. <words>295</words>  
They reminded her of herself—young, reckless, yet bound by invisible rules they couldn’t fully articulate. <words>323</words>  
As she ventured further, the next clue awaited near a rusted suit of armor, its helmet askew. <words>351</words>  
It read: *“What breaks but never falls?”* <words>368</words>  
Lira paused, her mind racing until realization dawned. <words>385</words>  
“The hilt,” she murmured, gripping her rapier tightly. <words>402</words>  

Her journey culminated in the museum’s attic, a room bathed in moonlight filtering through grimy windows. <words>431</words>  
There, on a pedestal, lay the final artifact—a shard of meteorite encased in resin. <words>458</words>  
Its label read: *“From the stars to the earth, what once soared now rests.”* <words>486</words>  
Lira exhaled sharply, her breath fogging the air. <words>503</words>  
This was the moment she’d been waiting for, the culmination of her scavenger hunt and her personal quest. <words>531</words>  
With trembling hands, she raised her rapier, aligning its cracked hilt with the shard’s jagged edge. <words>559</words>  
For a fleeting second, the room seemed to tilt, gravity warping around her as though acknowledging her defiance. <words>588</words>  
Then, silence. <words>595</words>
