It was amid ghost stories shared by locals at the experimental weather station where he first felt the pull of his true purpose. <words>159</words>  

The weather station stood on the edge of town, surrounded by fields and whispering winds. <words>188</words>  
Its instruments hummed softly, their quiet tuning echoing through the air like a lullaby for machines. <words>224</words>
