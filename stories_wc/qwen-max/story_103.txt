<story>  
The weatherbeaten knight stood at the edge of the jagged reef, his armor dulled by salt and time. <words>20</words>  
Above him loomed the lighthouse prison, its beam slicing through the stormy night like a blade. <words>41</words>  
He clutched a brass door knocker in one hand, its weight both familiar and foreign. <words>63</words>  
It was said that within this forsaken place, choices became impossible—a truth he now faced. <words>87</words>  
His mission was grudgingly sweet: to hush the final cry of regret echoing from the lighthouse’s core. <words>115</words>  
Each step toward the structure felt heavier than the last, as though the air itself resisted him. <words>139</words>  
Yet, there was something oddly joyful in the agony of it all—a paradox he couldn’t quite explain. <words>165</words>  

Inside, the walls gleamed with mirrored reflections, each surface showing fragments of his past. <words>189</words>  
A broken sword, a child’s doll, a torn map—seemingly random items scattered across the floors. <words>214</words>  
But they weren’t random; they formed a pattern, one he had to decipher before dawn broke. <words>238</words>  
The knight paused, forcing himself to appreciate the significance of these relics. <words>259</words>  
They whispered stories of lives undone, decisions made too late, and paths never taken. <words>283</words>  
He recognized them not just as objects but as pieces of his own fractured soul. <words>307</words>  

As he ascended the spiral staircase, the cries grew louder, more desperate. <words>329</words>  
At the top, he found the source: a figure cloaked in shadow, bound by chains of light. <words>352</words>  
“You’ve come to silence me,” the figure rasped, its voice layered with sorrow and fury. <words>375</words>  
The knight nodded, though his heart clenched at the thought of what it would cost. <words>396</words>  
To free the spirit meant sacrificing his memories—the very essence of who he was. <words>419</words>  
But leaving it trapped would doom countless others to share its torment. <words>441</words>  

He raised the brass door knocker, its intricate design glowing faintly in the dim light. <words>463</words>  
“This is your key,” the spirit murmured, its form flickering like candlelight. <words>483</words>  
The knight hesitated, staring into the mirrors around him. <words>502</words>  
In their reflections, he saw moments of triumph and failure, love and loss—all tied to the items below. <words>528</words>  
If he used the knocker, those memories would vanish, leaving only emptiness behind. <words>551</words>  
And yet, wasn’t that why he’d come? To end the cycle of regret? <words>571</words>  

With a deep breath, he struck the knocker against the floor, its sound resonating like a bell. <words>594</words>  
The mirrors shattered, and the room filled with blinding light. <words>613</words>  
When the glow faded, the spirit was gone, and so were the relics. <words>634</words>  
The knight felt hollow, as if part of him had been carved away. <words>654</words>  
Yet, amidst the void, a strange warmth lingered—a grudgingly sweet reminder of what he’d done. <words>678</words>  
Outside, the storm had calmed, the jagged reef bathed in the first light of morning. <words>700</words>  
Though he remembered nothing, he smiled, knowing he’d given everything. <words>720</words>
