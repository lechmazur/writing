The naval officer stood at the edge of the crystal fortress, his boots clicking faintly against its translucent floor. <words>20</words>  
His face was pale, seasickness lingering even though he had left the ocean far behind. <words>37</words>  
In his trembling hand, he held a translucent ghost orchid bulb, its delicate form glowing faintly under the light of a crescent moon. <words>64</words>  
This bulb was no ordinary object; it carried secrets traded across centuries, whispered promises that bound him to this place. <words>95</words>  
Awkwardly charming, he adjusted his uniform and muttered to himself, “If only I hadn’t agreed to this.” <words>123</words>  

The fortress loomed around him, shimmering like an impossible dream at the end of a rainbow canyon. <words>148</words>  
Its crystalline walls refracted the moonlight into cascading hues, painting the air with colors that seemed alive. <words>177</words>  
He felt small here, dwarfed not just by the structure but by the weight of time itself. <words>202</words>  
Centuries of quiet longing echoed in every corner, as if the very stones remembered what he sought to forget. <words>231</words>  

His motivation burned within him: to confront the mirror before it lied again. <words>254</words>  
It wasn’t just any mirror—it was said to reflect truths too painful for mortals to bear. <words>280</words>  
Yet, each reflection came with distortion, twisting reality until one could no longer trust their own eyes. <words>310</words>  
He clenched the orchid bulb tighter, knowing its power would help him transform the mirror’s lies into clarity. <words>339</words>  

Tracking moon phases had been key to unlocking the orchid’s potential. <words>360</words>  
For months, he charted the celestial dance, aligning his actions with the waxing and waning light. <words>387</words>  
Now, standing beneath the precise phase required, he felt both hope and dread coil in his chest. <words>414</words>  
The method was risky, but failure meant losing himself entirely to the mirror’s deceitful gaze. <words>442</words>  

As he approached the central chamber, nostalgia mingled with defiance in his heart. <words>468</words>  
Memories of past lives flickered in his mind—lives where he had failed to see the truth, failed to act. <words>497</words>  
This time would be different. He vowed it silently, his resolve hardening like tempered glass. <words>522</words>  
The chamber door opened with a soft chime, revealing the mirror suspended in midair, framed by jagged crystal. <words>552</words>  

Its surface rippled like liquid silver, beckoning yet repelling him all at once. <words>576</words>  
“You’ve come far,” the mirror murmured, its voice low and melodic, almost kind. <words>600</words>  
“But are you ready to face what you truly fear?” it asked, its tone shifting to something sharper, colder. <words>628</words>  
He swallowed hard, raising the ghost orchid bulb between them. “I didn’t come to listen to your lies,” he said firmly. <words>658</words>  

The bulb pulsed in response, its glow intensifying as the moonlight bathed it fully. <words>683</words>  
A surge of energy coursed through the room, transforming the mirror’s surface from deceptive ripples to stark, unyielding clarity. <words>713</words>  
In its depths, he saw not lies but himself—flawed, awkwardly charming, and finally free. <words>720</words>
