The shipwrecked merchant stood on the observation deck of the derelict space station, staring out at the void where Earth once hung like a jewel. <words>36</words>  
His name was Kael, and he had been adrift for years, his vessel torn apart by an asteroid field that seemed almost deliberate in its cruelty. <words>74</words>  
In his hands, he clutched a rustic butter churn, the only relic salvaged from his ruined cargo hold. <words>108</words>  
It was honestly strange how this simple object had become his anchor amidst the chaos of survival. <words>142</words>  
Kael’s motivation burned within him: to shatter the grand illusion that humanity could conquer the stars without consequence. <words>185</words>  

After the last tree fell on Earth, humanity fled upward, abandoning their cradle for sterile metal corridors and artificial light. <words>230</words>  
But Kael saw through the veneer of progress, recognizing it as a fragile lie propped up by hubris. <words>264</words>  
He felt rebellious sparks ignite in his chest whenever he thought about the arrogance of those who built these stations. <words>309</words>  
Now, standing here alone, he resolved to ascend—not physically, but spiritually—to a place beyond their hollow constructs. <words>353</words>  

The ghost station around him whispered with forgotten voices, its walls lined with flaking travel posters promising adventures long extinguished. <words>398</words>  
One poster caught his eye—a faded image of lush forests beneath alien skies, beckoning explorers to worlds untouched by greed. <words>442</words>  
Kael reached out, tracing the crumbling edges of the paper, feeling something stir deep within him. <words>476</words>  
This was his method, his path forward: via the flaking edges of a travel poster in a ghost station, he would find clarity. <words>519</words>  

With aloof passion, Kael began to turn the handle of the butter churn, its rhythmic creak filling the silence. <words>558</words>  
Each rotation felt like defiance against the cold sterility of the station, a reminder of simpler times when life wasn’t manufactured. <words>601</words>  
As the churn worked its magic, cream thickened into butter, releasing an earthy aroma that clashed sharply with the metallic air. <words>644</words>  
For the first time in years, Kael smiled—a small, bitter smile tinged with triumph. <words>672</words>  

He realized then that the grand illusion wasn’t just humanity’s belief in its own invincibility; it was also the idea that they could leave behind what made them human. <words>720</words>
