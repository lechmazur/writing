The rooftop farm stretched endlessly under a bruised sky, its soil stitched together from salvaged earth and ash. <words>20</words>  
It was here that Callan, a late-blooming hero in his fifties, stood with a mariner’s spyglass pressed to his eye, scanning the horizon for something—anything—that might explain the collapse of the world below. <words>56</words>  
His hands trembled softly militant against the weight of what he sought: answers buried deeper than memory or regret. <words>87</words>  
Callan had spent years coaxing life from this desolate patch of concrete, but now it felt like tending graves rather than crops. <words>123</words>  

In the space between the first tear and the final sigh, he had resolved to dissect the architecture of cosmic balance, though the thought filled him with reluctant awe. <words>164</words>  
He believed that somewhere out there, beyond the skeletal remains of skyscrapers and the choking haze of dust storms, lay clues to why everything had unraveled. <words>210</words>  
And so, when not tending to the kale and radishes that clung stubbornly to life, Callan scoured dusty attics in abandoned buildings, searching for fragments of forgotten knowledge. <words>259</words>  

One day, while rummaging through an attic cluttered with yellowed maps and rusted tools, he found a journal bound in cracked leather. <words>298</words>  
Its pages spoke of celestial alignments and gravitational anomalies, theories written by someone who seemed as obsessed with loss as Callan himself. <words>338</words>  
The gravity of loss—it was a phrase repeated often in the journal, as if the author had been trying to pin down its meaning before their own time ran out. <words>380</words>  

Callan carried the journal back to the rooftop farm, where he pored over its contents late into the night. <words>412</words>  
The words resonated deeply within him, stirring memories of his wife and daughter, both lost to the chaos that consumed the cities years ago. <words>453</words>  
Their absence still lingered like a phantom limb, a constant reminder of all he could not save. <words>482</words>  

But the journal hinted at more than personal grief; it suggested a universal imbalance, one that humanity itself may have triggered. <words>520</words>  
Determined to understand, Callan began using the mariner’s spyglass to chart the heavens, noting patterns in the stars’ movements that defied conventional wisdom. <words>561</words>  
Each observation brought him closer to a truth too vast to comprehend fully, yet undeniable in its implications. <words>593</words>  

As weeks turned into months, Callan realized he needed help to complete his work. <words>617</words>  
Reluctantly, he coerced a group of scavengers passing through the ruins to assist him, promising them food harvested from his farm in exchange for their labor. <words>660</words>  
Together, they built a crude observatory atop the roof, piecing together scrap metal and shattered glass until it resembled a beacon reaching toward the void. <words>702</words>  

On the night of the autumn equinox, as the stars aligned in ways described in the journal, Callan finally understood. <words>734</words>  
The universe demanded equilibrium, and humanity’s unchecked greed had tipped the scales irreparably. <words>760</words>
