<story>  
In the heartbeat after a dream returns, a stubborn monk sat alone in an aerial gondola crossing mountains, his hands trembling as he clutched a creased shipping label. <words>36</words>  
The label was visually unappealing, its edges frayed and ink smudged, yet it held secrets he had spent years trying to unravel. <words>72</words>  
His name was Brother Kael, a man whose life had been shaped by the need to avenge a wrong that haunted him since childhood. <words>108</words>  
Kael’s dark reflection—both literal and metaphorical—had always been his greatest adversary, whispering doubts into his mind like a venomous serpent. <words>149</words>  
To outsmart this shadowy version of himself, he turned to harvesting the past, piecing together fragments of history buried beneath layers of time. <words>190</words>  

The antique flute resting on his lap seemed innocuous at first glance, but Kael knew better. <words>225</words>  
Its surface bore faint tooth marks, evidence of someone who had once played it with desperation rather than joy. <words>261</words>  
Through analyzing these marks, Kael hoped to uncover truths about the person who last held the instrument—a key figure in the tragedy he sought to avenge. <words>307</words>  
He traced the grooves with careful fingers, feeling the weight of centuries pressing down upon him. <words>342</words>  

Outside the gondola, jagged peaks loomed against a sky streaked with hues of amber and violet. <words>377</words>  
The setting exuded cautious enchantment, as if the world itself were holding its breath, waiting for Kael to solve the riddle before him. <words>418</words>  
Each sway of the gondola reminded him how precarious his journey was—not just physically, but spiritually. <words>454</words>  
Failure would mean succumbing to the darkness within, allowing his reflection to consume him entirely. <words>490</words>  

Kael closed his eyes, recalling the dream that had awakened him moments earlier. <words>516</words>  
It had been vivid, almost tangible—a memory of fire and screams, of a melody played on the very flute now in his possession. <words>557</words>  
That song had ended in betrayal, leaving scars deeper than any blade could carve. <words>588</words>  
But tonight, something felt different; the dream had revealed new details, subtle clues hidden in the cadence of the music. <words>629</words>  

Opening his eyes, Kael pulled a small magnifying lens from his robes and examined the flute again. <words>665</words>  
The tooth marks told a story of struggle, of lips pressed too hard against wood, of teeth biting down in anguish or defiance. <words>706</words>  
And then, clarity struck him like lightning—the pattern matched descriptions he’d read in ancient texts, pointing to a single name: Liora Veyne. <words>720</words>
