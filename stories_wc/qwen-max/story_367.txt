The sapped herbalist leaned against the glass wall of her ocean cliff observatory, staring blankly at the horizon. <words>27</words> Her hands trembled slightly, not from exhaustion but from the weight of perfection she had chased for years. <words>56</words> The blacksmith’s bellows sat in the corner, its leather cracked and useless now, a relic of her thoughtfully thoughtless decisions. <words>89</words> She cherished it still, though it no longer served its purpose, because it reminded her of what she had sacrificed. <words>123</words>  

Her motivation to study tide patterns had once been pure—a fervent indifference to anything but the rhythms of nature. <words>154</words> But that indifference had warped into obsession when she realized how much control she could exert over her craft by mastering every variable. <words>190</words> The tides dictated the growth cycles of rare herbs, and she believed understanding them would unlock the ultimate formula for her elixirs. <words>227</words> Yet, as time passed, the price of such precision became unbearable. <words>251</words>  

During napping hours, when the world seemed to pause, she often woke to the sound of waves crashing below. <words>282</words> It was during one of these restless breaks that she noticed the lone goose flying across the sky, its path unwavering despite the wind's chaos. <words>320</words> Something about its trajectory struck her—it moved with purpose, yet without strain, unlike her own relentless pursuit. <words>354</words> She began tracking its flight path obsessively, sketching diagrams on scraps of parchment scattered around the room. <words>388</words>  

The goose became her method, a way to measure not just the tides but also her own unraveling. <words>414</words> Each day, she compared its course to the shifting waters below, searching for patterns that might reveal some deeper truth. <words>449</words> But the more she studied, the more distant she felt from the simplicity she once cherished. <words>480</words> Perfection demanded too much; it drained her vitality like sap from a tree. <words>506</words>  

One afternoon, while adjusting the position of her telescope, she accidentally knocked over the blacksmith’s bellows. <words>537</words> As it hit the floor, a cloud of dust rose, carrying the faint scent of iron and fire. <words>562</words> For a moment, she froze, overwhelmed by memories of the forge where she’d first learned discipline. <words>593</words> Back then, she had been content simply to create, to let imperfections exist as part of the process. <words>624</words> Now, everything felt sterile, calculated, devoid of life. <words>648</words>  

She picked up the bellows, running her fingers along its worn surface. <words>672</words> Its presence here, in this glass-walled sanctuary, seemed absurd—a reminder of warmth in a place defined by cold observation. <words>704</words> Slowly, she placed it back in the corner, resolving to leave it there untouched. <words>730</words> Perhaps perfection wasn’t worth the cost after all. <words>740</words>
