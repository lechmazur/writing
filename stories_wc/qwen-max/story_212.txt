The ethereal plains stretched endlessly, a hauntingly beautiful expanse where the sky bled into the earth in hues of amber and violet. <words>36</words>  
Kael, an apocalyptic farmer with dirt-streaked hands and eyes like storm clouds, knelt among his crops, planting seeds that no one else dared to grow. <words>74</words>  
These were not ordinary seeds; they carried the hope of renewal after the last resource war had scorched the world bare. <words>112</words>  
Yet Kael’s work was more than survival—it was rebellion against a life dictated by another, a master who once owned his family’s labor and spirit. <words>150</words>  

In his pocket rested a magician’s deck of trick cards, their edges worn from years of handling. <words>182</words>  
He didn’t know why he kept them, only that they felt like talismans, reminders of a typically atypical childhood spent dreaming of freedom. <words>224</words>  
Each card bore cryptic symbols that seemed to hum faintly when held close to his ear—a song of boundaries whispered through time itself. <words>266</words>  

One evening, as twilight painted the horizon in streaks of fire, Kael jabbered to himself about the strange messages he’d found inside bottles washed ashore by the sea. <words>308</words>  
The bottles arrived unpredictably, carried across vast distances, each containing fragments of stories or warnings scrawled on brittle parchment. <words>350</words>  
Through these messages, Kael pieced together tales of others like him—people scattered across the remnants of the world, seeking solace and meaning amidst ruin. <words>392</words>  

Tonight, however, the bottle contained something different: a single playing card identical to those in his deck. <words>424</words>  
Its surface shimmered unnaturally, pulsing with a rhythm that matched the song of boundaries echoing in his mind. <words>460</words>  
Kael stared at it, feeling both dread and exhilaration coil within him. <words>484</words>  

The next morning, he set out toward the heart of the plains, driven by an unspoken pull. <words>512</words>  
There, beneath a sky fractured with light, he discovered a circle of stones etched with the same symbols from his cards. <words>550</words>  
They glowed softly, resonating with the card in his hand, and for the first time, Kael understood their purpose. <words>582</words>  

This place was a nexus, a boundary between worlds—or perhaps between times. <words>614</words>  
It offered escape, but at a cost: leaving behind everything he knew, including the seeds he had nurtured so carefully. <words>652</words>  
Kael hesitated, torn between the raw solace of starting anew and the weight of abandoning his creations. <words>684</words>  

Finally, he placed the glowing card atop the central stone, whispering a prayer to whatever forces governed such things. <words>720</words>
