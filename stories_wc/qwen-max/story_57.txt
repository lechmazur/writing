The submissive aristocrat, Lord Alaric, adjusted his gloves as he trimmed the hedges in his sprawling estate’s yard. <words>20</words>  
His unusually perceptive nature made him acutely aware of every rustle in the leaves and every distant echo from the manor behind him. <words>43</words>  
Today, however, something felt different—a subtle shift in the air that even his sharp senses couldn’t immediately place. <words>68</words>  
Amid the rhythmic snip of his shears, a faint metallic clink drew his attention to the ground. <words>91</words>  
There lay a dull letter opener, its surface scratched and unremarkable, half-buried in the soil near the rose bushes. <words>117</words>  
He picked it up, examining it with earnest curiosity, though his expression betrayed only flippancy. <words>141</words>  

Unbeknownst to him, this small object would soon become pivotal. <words>159</words>  
As he resumed his work, an unexpected sound reached his ears: muffled voices drifting through the open windows of the secret agent workshop hidden beneath the manor. <words>192</words>  
The workshop was rarely used now, but its thick walls and peculiar acoustics turned it into an accidental echo chamber when voices were raised inside. <words>223</words>  
Through unplanned eavesdropping, Lord Alaric caught fragments of conversation—urgent whispers about a vulnerable creature they intended to “liquify” for their experiments. <words>258</words>  
His stomach churned at the thought, yet he remained silent, processing the information with quiet resolve. <words>280</words>  

Lord Alaric had always been a man of silent empathy, preferring action over words whenever possible. <words>304</words>  
This time, though, the stakes were higher than ever before. <words>318</words>  
He knew exactly what—or rather, who—they were referring to: a tiny, injured bird he’d discovered days earlier while tending to the garden. <words>347</words>  
It had taken refuge in the ivy-covered trellis by the workshop entrance, its wing bent awkwardly, its chirps barely audible. <words>376</words>  
Though others might have dismissed it as insignificant, Lord Alaric saw beauty and resilience in the fragile creature. <words>401</words>  
Protecting it became his sole motivation, even if it meant confronting forces far beyond his usual comfort zone. <words>426</words>  

With the dull letter opener still clutched in his hand, he approached the workshop door cautiously. <words>449</words>  
The hinges groaned softly as he pushed it open, revealing a dimly lit room filled with gadgets, vials, and blueprints scattered across cluttered tables. <words>480</words>  
Two figures stood hunched over a containment unit, their backs to him, oblivious to his presence. <words>501</words>  
Inside the glass enclosure, the injured bird fluttered weakly, its movements sluggish and desperate. <words>523</words>  
Lord Alaric hesitated, weighing his options, then stepped forward with deliberate calmness. <words>544</words>  

“Gentlemen,” he said, his voice carrying just enough authority to startle them without betraying his inner turmoil. <words>567</words>  
They turned sharply, surprise etched on their faces as they recognized the aristocrat standing there, holding nothing more threatening than a tarnished letter opener. <words>598</words>  
“What business do you have here?” one of them demanded, attempting to mask his unease. <words>619</words>  
Lord Alaric tilted his head slightly, his tone light but firm. <words>636</words>  
“I believe that question is better directed at yourselves. Surely, such a delicate creature deserves better than your… creative endeavors.” <words>668</words>  
His words hung in the air, sharp and pointed despite their polite veneer. <words>686</words>  

For a moment, no one moved. Then, slowly, the agents exchanged glances, their resolve wavering under the weight of his unusually perceptive gaze. <words>710</words>  
Without another word, Lord Alaric crossed the room, opened the containment unit, and gently lifted the bird into his hands. <words>733</words>
