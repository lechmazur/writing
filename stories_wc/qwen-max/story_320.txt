The shy diviner adjusted her scarf as she descended into the forgotten underwater city market, its glass-domed structures shimmering faintly in the dim green light. <words>36</words>  
Her name was Lira, and though her gift allowed her to see echoes of regret, she rarely spoke of what she found. <words>58</words>  
Today, however, something compelled her—a cosmic imbalance that tugged at her like an invisible thread. <words>84</words>  
She carried with her a small satchel filled with vintage photographs, each one radiating a confusingly clear aura of loss. <words>117</words>  

Lira’s journey had begun weeks ago when she stumbled upon a trail of social media posts revealing a hidden truth. <words>142</words>  
The posts were cryptic, fragmented images of the underwater market overlaid with timestamps from parallel timelines. <words>170</words>  
At first, she dismissed them as digital noise, but then she noticed the recurring face in the background of every photo—a man who seemed both familiar and foreign. <words>209</words>  
His expression was always the same: a mix of longing and despair, as if he were searching for something just out of reach. <words>238</words>  

As Lira navigated the submerged corridors of the market, she felt the weight of time pressing against her chest. <words>265</words>  
Stalls lined the walkways, their wares encrusted with coral and barnacles, remnants of a civilization long abandoned. <words>294</words>  
Yet, amidst the decay, there was life—faint whispers carried by currents, fragments of conversations frozen in time. <words>321</words>  
It was here, among these echoes, that Lira hoped to find answers. <words>339</words>  

Her fingers brushed against the edge of a photograph in her satchel, its surface cool and smooth beneath her touch. <words>365</words>  
The image depicted a young woman standing beside the same man from the posts, their smiles radiant yet tinged with sadness. <words>396</words>  
Lira could feel the regret emanating from it, a palpable force that made her heart ache. <words>417</words>  
This was no ordinary artifact; it was a key, though to what, she wasn’t sure. <words>438</words>  

Suddenly, a flicker of movement caught her eye—a shadow darting between stalls, too quick to be human. <words>465</words>  
Lira hesitated, torn between curiosity and caution. <words>479</words>  
Then, without warning, the ground beneath her feet trembled, precipitating a cascade of debris from above. <words>503</words>  
She ducked instinctively, clutching the photograph tightly as shards of glass rained down around her. <words>528</words>  

When the shaking subsided, Lira rose slowly, her breath shallow but steady. <words>548</words>  
Before her stood the man from the photographs, his form translucent and wavering like heat haze. <words>573</words>  
“You shouldn’t have come,” he said, his voice echoing as though spoken through water. <words>593</words>  
“I didn’t choose this,” Lira replied, her tone marked by passionate disinterest. <words>612</words>  

The man sighed, his gaze drifting toward the photograph in her hand. <words>628</words>  
“That belongs to another timeline,” he murmured. “A reminder of what I failed to protect.” <words>653</words>  
Lira frowned, piecing together the fragments of his story. <words>667</words>  
“You’re trapped here because of regret,” she said finally. “But why does it affect the balance?” <words>692</words>  

He looked at her, his eyes filled with sorrow. <words>705</words>  
“Because my failure created a fracture—a ripple across timelines that threatens to unravel everything.” <words>732</words>
