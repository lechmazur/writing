The assassin moved silently across the jagged surface of the baroque asteroid, their silhouette blending with the fractured light of borrowed starlight. <words>36</words>  
Each step was deliberate, calculated, as though they were tracing the pattern of a spider’s web after rain—delicate yet unyielding. <words>74</words>  
Their target was not a person but an idea, something superficially profound that had taken root in the minds of those who dared to dream beyond the unforgiving road. <words>120</words>  
In one hand, they carried a paint-splattered camera lens, its once-clear surface now marred by streaks of color that seemed to pulse faintly under the dim glow of distant suns. <words>168</words>  
It was both weapon and relic, a tool for capturing truths too fragile to survive exposure. <words>205</words>  

The assassin paused at the edge of a crater, gazing toward the horizon where the bus driver completed the final route of their long journey. <words>249</words>  
The vehicle itself was ancient, its metallic frame groaning against the weight of time and gravity, yet it persisted like the dawn it carried within its trembling hands. <words>297</words>  
To cradle the dawn—that was the driver's motivation, a quiet defiance against the void that sought to consume all light. <words>336</words>  
But the assassin knew better; the dawn was fleeting, just as every passenger aboard the bus would soon discover. <words>374</words>  

A soft laugh escaped the assassin’s lips, echoing faintly against the asteroid’s ornate ridges. <words>403</words>  
It wasn’t mockery but acknowledgment—a recognition of the absurdity of clinging to hope in such a desolate place. <words>442</words>  
Still, there was beauty in the attempt, a kind of stubborn grace that even the assassin could not deny. <words>480</words>  
They adjusted their grip on the camera lens, feeling its uneven edges dig into their palm. <words>510</words>  

As the bus approached, the assassin stepped into the open, their presence announced not by sound but by the sudden stillness that fell over the scene. <words>553</words>  
The driver saw them immediately, their expression unreadable behind the cracked visor of their helmet. <words>591</words>  
For a moment, neither moved, locked in a silent standoff that felt both eternal and ephemeral. <words>629</words>  
Then the assassin raised the lens, angling it toward the bus as if framing a shot. <words>667</words>  

Through the distorted glass, the vehicle appeared blurred, almost dreamlike, its passengers reduced to indistinct shapes yearning for something beyond reach. <words>710</words>  
With a flick of their wrist, the assassin snapped the lens shut, sealing the image forever. <words>740</words>
