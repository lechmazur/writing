<story>  
The bruised fighter stumbled into the dusty attic, his body a map of old battles and fresh wounds. <words>20</words>  
Clockwork animals lay scattered across the floor, their gears rusted, their movements frozen in time. <words>41</words>  
He had come here seeking something he could not name, driven by a need to extinguish the last vestige of self-deception that clung to him like smoke. <words>76</words>  
His hands trembled as they brushed against the debris, searching for answers in the forgotten relics of another era. <words>108</words>  
Among the clutter, his fingers closed around a jagged shard of clay pot, its surface etched with an inscription too faint to read at first glance. <words>149</words>  

The shard felt heavier than it should have, as though it carried the weight of decisions long past. <words>175</words>  
He squinted at the faded letters, deciphering fragments of words: "stand," "truth," and "sacrifice." <words>203</words>  
It was then that the room seemed to shift, the air thickening with the hum of forgotten dreams stirring awake. <words>232</words>  
A clockwork bird twitched on a nearby shelf, its wings creaking as if testing their newfound freedom. <words>258</words>  
The fighter’s heart raced; he knew this place held secrets meant only for those who dared to stand for something greater than themselves. <words>294</words>  

At the moment a sculptor’s chisel first strikes marble elsewhere in the world, the attic resonated with a strange clarity. <words>326</words>  
The fighter realized he wasn’t alone—someone else was watching him from the shadows, skillfully incompetent in hiding their presence. <words>360</words>  
Before he could react, the figure lunged forward, attempting to abduct the shard from his grasp. <words>384</words>  
They wrestled amidst the broken remnants of clockwork creatures, each movement sending clouds of dust spiraling into the dim light filtering through cracked shutters. <words>423</words>  
The shard slipped from his hand, skittering across the floor until it came to rest near an ancient automaton shaped like a lion. <words>457</words>  

The attacker froze, distracted by the sight of the shard resting so close to the dormant beast. <words>481</words>  
Seizing the opportunity, the fighter grabbed a loose gear and hurled it at the intruder, striking them squarely in the temple. <words>512</words>  
As the figure crumpled to the ground, unconscious, the fighter retrieved the shard, feeling its rough edges bite into his palm. <words>544</words>  
He examined the inscription again, now clearer somehow, as though the struggle had awakened its latent power. <words>571</words>  
“Stand for truth,” it whispered, not in sound but in meaning, urging him toward a path he had avoided for far too long. <words>600</words>  

The clockwork lion suddenly whirred to life, its golden eyes glowing faintly as it turned its head toward him. <words>625</words>  
Its mechanical voice rasped, “You carry the burden of choice. Will you let it define you or destroy you?” <words>657</words>  
The question hung heavy in the air, echoing off the walls of the attic like a challenge. <words>678</words>  
For years, the fighter had drifted, allowing others to dictate his actions, never truly standing for anything beyond survival. <words>709</words>  
But now, holding the shard and facing the lion, he understood what he must do. <words>731</words>
