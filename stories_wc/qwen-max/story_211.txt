<story>  
In the hush of the unremembered future, an abandoned schoolhouse stood as a relic of forgotten lessons and faded dreams. <words>27</words>  
Its cracked windows whispered secrets to the wind, while dust motes danced in beams of pale moonlight that pierced through holes in the roof. <words>54</words>  
Inside, a lucky gambler named Elias sat at a splintered desk, his fingers tracing the cover of a botanical diary he had found earlier that day. <words>86</words>  
The diary was peculiar—its pages filled with sketches of plants that seemed both alien and familiar, their roots curling into shapes resembling human faces. <words>120</words>  
Elias chuckled softly, though there was no humor in it; cheerful despair was his constant companion these days. <words>143</words>  

He had come to this ghost town seeking refuge from the corruption of power that had consumed his old life. <words>170</words>  
Once, he had been celebrated for his uncanny luck, but when those in authority sought to exploit him, he fled, leaving behind everything except the clothes on his back and his unshakable defiance. <words>219</words>  
To defy the gravity of hopelessness was why he stayed here now, surrounded by echoes of what once was. <words>243</words>  

Tonight, however, something unusual stirred within him—a curiosity about the diary’s origins. <words>270</words>  
As he flipped through its brittle pages, he noticed faint handwriting beneath the illustrations: confessions written in looping cursive. <words>302</words>  
Each entry began with “I have sinned,” followed by admissions of greed, betrayal, or cruelty—all revealed through spin-the-bottle games played long ago. <words>338</words>  
Elias frowned, wondering how such personal truths could exist in a book meant for botany. <words>361</words>  

Suddenly, the air grew heavy, and the room seemed to tilt slightly, as if reality itself were shifting. <words>387</words>  
A voice, soft yet commanding, echoed around him: “Duplicate.” <words>403</words>  
Startled, Elias looked up, but the schoolhouse remained empty save for shadows stretching unnaturally across the walls. <words>431</words>  
“Duplicate what?” he asked aloud, clutching the diary tighter. <words>448</words>  

The voice did not respond immediately, but then the pages of the diary began to glow faintly, illuminating the room with an eerie green light. <words>482</words>  
Elias watched in awe as the sketches of plants shimmered and multiplied, their tendrils spilling off the page and onto the floor. <words>513</words>  
They writhed like living things, twisting together until they formed a mirror image of himself standing before him. <words>542</words>  
The duplicate smiled, though its expression lacked warmth. “You’ve summoned me,” it said simply. <words>565</words>  

Elias stepped back, heart pounding. “What are you?” <words>580</words>  
“I am your reflection,” the figure replied, gesturing toward the diary. “Born from the sins confessed within these pages.” <words>610</words>  
Confusion warred with fear inside Elias. “Why would anyone confess such things during a game?” <words>633</words>  

The duplicate tilted its head, eyes gleaming. “Because typically never do people reveal their darkest truths willingly. But under the guise of play, even the strongest resistances crumble.” <words>678</words>  
Elias swallowed hard, realizing the weight of what he held in his hands. This wasn’t just a botanical diary—it was a vessel for humanity’s hidden corruptions. <words>712</words>  
And now, somehow, he had unleashed them. <words>725</words>  

With a deep breath, Elias closed the diary, severing the connection between himself and the duplicate. <words>740</words>
