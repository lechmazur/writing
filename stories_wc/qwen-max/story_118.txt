The hive-mind therapist adjusted her scuffed phone charger plug with a sigh, its plastic edges worn smooth from years of use. <words>27</words>  
She sat in the dimly lit corner of the secret agent training facility, where shadows danced like coded whispers through the night air. <words>54</words>  
Tomorrow would bring a bold discovery, but tonight was for preparation—and for listening to the sound of hindsight. <words>83</words>  
Her work was uniformly peculiar, even by the standards of this place, where reality often blurred into something sharper and stranger. <words>116</words>  
Agents came to her not just to heal but to drain their minds of doubt, fear, and hesitation. <words>139</words>  
Tonight’s session had been particularly draining; she could feel it in the weight of her own thoughts as they pooled around her like molten wax. <words>170</words>  

On the table before her, a single candle flickered, its flame casting long, distorted shapes across the walls. <words>200</words>  
Through the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes, she sought to anchor the ephemeral in reality. <words>227</words>  
Each drop carried meaning—a language only she understood, born from decades of practice and intuition. <words>256</words>  
It was a merry bitterness that fueled her, the kind that comes from knowing too much yet never enough. <words>285</words>  

An agent entered the room unannounced, his silhouette sharp against the doorway’s glow. <words>310</words>  
“Still here?” he asked, his voice low and tinged with exhaustion. <words>328</words>  
She nodded without looking up, focusing instead on the wax pooling beneath the candle. <words>352</words>  
“You know why I stay,” she replied, her tone measured but firm. <words>375</words>  
He hesitated, then stepped closer, drawn by the peculiar pull of her presence. <words>400</words>  

“I’ve been hearing things,” he admitted, his words heavy with unease. <words>422</words>  
“The sound of hindsight,” she said, finishing his thought before he could. <words>445</words>  
“It’s loud tonight.” <words>454</words>  
He nodded, sinking into the chair opposite her. <words>470</words>  
“It’s always louder when you’re close to something big.” <words>493</words>  

She leaned forward, her eyes locking onto his. <words>511</words>  
“What do you hear?” she asked, her voice soft but insistent. <words>532</words>  
He paused, searching for the right words. <words>548</words>  
“Regret. Doubt. The echoes of choices I haven’t made yet.” <words>577</words>  
Her lips curved into a faint smile, one that held both understanding and sorrow. <words>602</words>  

“That’s what we’re here to fix,” she said, gesturing to the candle. <words>623</words>  
Its wax now formed a spiral, intricate and deliberate, a map of his psyche laid bare. <words>649</words>  
Together, they watched as the final drops fell, sealing the pattern into permanence. <words>675</words>  
For a moment, the room was silent except for the faint crackle of the wick. <words>700</words>  
Then, slowly, the agent exhaled, his shoulders relaxing as if a great weight had lifted. <words>720</words>
