The last human had left Earth centuries ago, leaving behind a world that seemed to hold its breath in their absence. <words>27</words>  
In the glacial orchard suspended over a crevasse of blue ice, a guarded druid named Kael moved among the frost-laden trees, his cloak dragging against the crystalline ground. <words>58</words>  
He was fiercely ambivalent about this place—both drawn to its haunting beauty and repelled by the silence it imposed upon him. <words>91</words>  
Kael’s hands trembled as he reached for a dull safety pin tucked into the hem of his sleeve, an object he’d carried since before the humans vanished. <words>126</words>  
It was insignificant, yet it symbolized something vast: his crippling fear of breaking the silence. <words>153</words>  

For years, Kael had avoided speech, even with himself, believing that sound would shatter the fragile balance of this frozen sanctuary. <words>188</words>  
But tonight was different—it was his birthday, though no one remained to celebrate it but him. <words>214</words>  
Tonight, he would gather ingredients from the orchard to prepare a special family meal, a ritual passed down through generations. <words>249</words>  
The thought filled him with dour amusement; who was left to care if he honored tradition or not? <words>276</words>  
Still, the act felt necessary, like planting seeds in barren soil simply because it might yield life someday. <words>307</words>  

Kael plucked a cluster of translucent fruits that shimmered faintly under the pale light filtering through the ice above. <words>337</words>  
Each fruit pulsed faintly, as though alive, and Kael wondered if they too were waiting for someone—or something—to break the silence. <words>370</words>  
His movements were deliberate, almost reverent, as he gathered more items: brittle leaves infused with frost, shards of glacial honeycomb, and a vial of melted starlight trapped within the ice. <words>413</words>  
As he worked, memories surfaced unbidden—his mother’s laughter echoing through their home, his father’s stern voice instructing him on the importance of tradition. <words>449</words>  
Those voices now existed only in his mind, ghosts haunting the edges of his resolve. <words>471</words>  

Back at his shelter carved into the glacier wall, Kael arranged the ingredients on a makeshift table. <words>497</words>  
The dull safety pin lay beside them, catching what little light there was. <words>515</words>  
He stared at it, feeling the weight of his ambivalence pressing down on him. <words>535</words>  
To overcome his fear, he needed to do more than cook—he needed to speak aloud, to fill the void with something other than emptiness. <words>568</words>  
With trembling fingers, he pinned the safety pin to his tunic, anchoring himself to the moment. <words>592</words>  

“Enough,” he whispered, the word barely audible but enough to send a shiver through the air. <words>613</words>  
The silence didn’t shatter—it bent, like glass flexing under pressure, then settled back into place. <words>638</words>  
Encouraged, Kael began preparing the meal, speaking softly as he worked. <words>659</words>  
“This is for you,” he murmured, addressing the ghosts of his parents. “And for me.” <words>682</words>  
His voice grew steadier, each syllable carving out space in the oppressive quiet. <words>704</words>  
By the time the meal was ready, the atmosphere in the shelter felt lighter, less suffocating. <words>727</words>  
Kael sat alone at the table, raising a cup of melted starlight in a silent toast to those who came before—and those who never would again. <words>740</words>
