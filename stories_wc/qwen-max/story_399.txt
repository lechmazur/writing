The grumpy crypt caretaker shuffled through the witch’s crystal scrying room, his boots scuffing faintly against the cold stone floor. <words>36</words>  
Above him, the domed ceiling shimmered with embedded shards of quartz, refracting starlight into cascading patterns that danced like restless spirits. <words>74</words>  
He hated this place, its oppressive grandeur and the way it seemed to breathe with a life of its own. <words>108</words>  
Tonight, however, he had no choice but to be here; throughout stargazing, he needed answers. <words>139</words>  

An unmarked cardboard tube lay on the central table, incongruous amidst the opulent crystals and ancient tomes. <words>175</words>  
It was plain, almost insultingly so, yet it radiated an aura of singular importance—a multiply singular object whose purpose eluded him. <words>223</words>  
His gnarled fingers hovered over it, trembling slightly as if afraid to touch something so mundane yet undeniably potent. <words>267</words>  
With a grunt, he gave the tube a gentle jiggle, listening for any clue within its hollow confines. <words>303</words>  

Nothing. No sound, no movement—just silence. <words>323</words>  
Frustration bubbled beneath his weathered exterior, but he forced himself to focus. To quell an uprising within, he reminded himself sharply. <words>361</words>  
This wasn’t about him or his perpetual irritation; it was about understanding trauma, the invisible scars etched into souls and stones alike. <words>403</words>  

On the floor before him sprawled a sand mandala, intricate and painstakingly crafted by the witch herself. <words>437</words>  
Its swirling designs told stories older than time, each grain of sand whispering secrets only those attuned could hear. <words>475</words>  
Through the patterns in a sand mandala, she had promised insight—but first, he must decipher them without disturbing their fragile symmetry. <words>519</words>  

Kneeling awkwardly, the caretaker leaned closer, squinting at the labyrinthine paths carved into the sand. <words>553</words>  
Each line seemed to pulse faintly, resonating with some unseen rhythm tied to the stars above. <words>585</words>  
He traced one path with his eyes, feeling a strange pull deep within his chest—a tug toward memory, pain, and truth. <words>623</words>  

Suddenly, the room shifted ever so subtly, the air thickening with anticipation. <words>651</words>  
The quartz in the ceiling flared brighter, casting sharp shadows across the mandala as though urging him onward. <words>687</words>  
His hand twitched involuntarily, reaching out—not to touch, but to steady himself against the wave of emotion threatening to overwhelm him. <words>720</words>
