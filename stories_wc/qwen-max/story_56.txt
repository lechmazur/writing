The orchard was an oddity, a reclaimed farmland nestled inside the husk of a toppled skyscraper. <words>16</words>  
Rows of fruit trees stretched where cubicles once stood, their roots threading through shattered concrete and forgotten office chairs. <words>37</words>  
It was here that Remy, a bluffing swindler with a knack for half-truths, found himself staring at a blank price tag dangling from an apple tree. <words>62</words>  
He plucked it off, turning it over in his fingers as if it might reveal some hidden meaning. <words>84</words>  
Remy had always been energetically lethargic, his body sluggish but his mind racing like a runaway train. <words>109</words>  
Today, however, he felt something different—a pull, almost magnetic, drawing him deeper into the orchard. <words>132</words>  

A dropped book interrupted his thoughts. <words>145</words>  
It landed at his feet with a soft thud, its cover worn and pages yellowed. <words>166</words>  
Remy bent to pick it up, only to find himself face-to-face with a woman who seemed equally startled. <words>192</words>  
Her name was Lila, and she carried herself with a quiet intensity that made Remy’s practiced charm falter. <words>218</words>  
“I didn’t mean to startle you,” she said, her voice tinged with gentle harshness. <words>240</words>  
“No harm done,” Remy replied, handing her the book. <words>256</words>  
But as their hands brushed, he felt it again—that strange magnetism, stronger this time. <words>280</words>  

Lila explained she was cataloging the orchard’s history, searching for invisible allies who had helped rebuild this place after the city fell. <words>312</words>  
Remy listened intently, though his motives were less noble; he sought to bare a truth no one dared to handle. <words>338</words>  
Years ago, he’d swindled people out of their savings using false promises of prosperity tied to this very land. <words>365</words>  
Now, haunted by guilt, he wanted to uncover the real story behind the orchard’s survival. <words>387</words>  

As they walked together, Lila spoke of how the orchard thrived despite the odds, nurtured by unseen forces—people working quietly, nature reclaiming what was lost. <words>421</words>  
Remy nodded along, clutching the blank price tag tighter. <words>437</words>  
He wondered if those invisible allies could forgive someone like him. <words>456</words>  

At the instant a frozen computer finally restarted in a nearby makeshift office, Remy stopped walking. <words>483</words>  
The hum of electricity filled the air, and Lila glanced at him curiously. <words>501</words>  
“What is it?” she asked, sensing his unease. <words>514</words>  
Remy hesitated before pulling the price tag from his pocket. <words>530</words>  
“This… this is why I’m here,” he admitted, his voice barely above a whisper. <words>550</words>  
Lila took the tag, examining it closely. <words>564</words>  
“It’s blank,” she observed, her tone neutral. <words>578</words>  
“Not entirely,” Remy countered. <words>588</words>  
To his surprise, faint letters began to appear on the tag: *Truth*. <words>606</words>  

Lila looked up, meeting his gaze. <words>616</words>  
“You came back because you want to make things right,” she said, more statement than question. <words>639</words>  
Remy nodded, feeling the weight of his past begin to lift. <words>655</words>  
Together, they decided to document not just the orchard’s history but also the stories of those who had shaped it—including Remy’s role, both good and bad. <words>690</words>  
In doing so, they hoped to honor the invisible allies who had kept the orchard alive. <words>710</words>
