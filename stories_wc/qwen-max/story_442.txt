The edgy tradesman sat cross-legged on the spongy floor of the giant mushroom house, his boots caked with spores that glowed faintly in the dim light. <words>36</words>  
A torn corner of a flyer lay crumpled in his palm, its edges frayed and ink smudged as though it had been through time itself. <words>72</words>  
He stared at it, trying to recall what it once said, but memory was a fickle thing—distorted, unreliable, like shadows dancing on the walls of an endless void. <words>118</words>  
His name was Kael, and he prided himself on being comfortingly pessimistic; if nothing good could be expected, then nothing could disappoint. <words>154</words>  
Yet here he was, clutching this fragment of paper as though it held answers to questions he didn’t even know how to ask. <words>200</words>  

Kael’s task was simple yet impossible: to carry a flickering candle through an endless void during the final rotation of a forgotten windmill. <words>246</words>  
The candle burned low, its flame wavering between existence and extinction, casting blurry vividness across the room's strange contours. <words>292</words>  
Above him, the bioluminescent cap of the mushroom pulsed rhythmically, synchronized somehow with the ticking of watches strapped to his wrists. <words>338</words>  
These watches were no ordinary devices—they were tools designed to vectorize time itself, aligning moments into pathways only he could navigate. <words>384</words>  

He exhaled sharply, leaning forward to inspect the flyer again. <words>410</words>  
It wasn’t just any flyer—it was part of a map, or so he believed, leading to something buried deep within the distortion of memory. <words>456</words>  
But every time he tried to piece together its meaning, the details shifted, slipping away like sand through fingers. <words>502</words>  
“Time doesn’t heal,” Kael muttered under his breath, quoting one of his many self-deprecating mantras. <words>538</words>  
“It just erases.” <words>554</words>  

The mushroom house groaned softly around him, its fibrous walls breathing in sync with the pulsing light above. <words>590</words>  
Kael checked his watches again, ensuring they remained synchronized via their delicate mechanisms. <words>626</words>  
If even one second fell out of alignment, the entire structure might collapse, leaving him stranded in the void forever. <words>672</words>  
And yet, despite the danger, there was a strange comfort in the predictability of decay—the inevitability of entropy. <words>718</words>  

With a heavy sigh, Kael stood, tucking the torn flyer into his pocket. <words>740</words>
