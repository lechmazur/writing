The insomniac poet sat cross-legged on the floor of a haunted attic, surrounded by meticulously messy piles of botanical samples. <words>36</words>  
Each jar and vial glinted faintly in the dim light, their contents whispering warnings only he could hear. <words>72</words>  
He had collected them over years, driven by an obsession to decode the language of plants, believing they held secrets to non-violence. <words>114</words>  
Between subway stops, his mind raced with fragmented thoughts, piecing together meanings from the murmurs trapped within the specimens. <words>158</words>  
Tonight, however, something felt different—a heaviness lingered in the air, as if the attic itself were holding its breath. <words>203</words>  

A sudden creak echoed through the room, pulling him out of his reverie. <words>229</words>  
He turned toward the source, his eyes landing on a dusty bottle labeled "Eryngium planum." <words>263</words>  
It wasn’t one he remembered collecting, yet there it was, glowing faintly like a beacon. <words>295</words>  
The whispers grew louder, more urgent, warning him of something unnamed but inevitable. <words>331</words>  
His heart pounded as he reached for the bottle, fingers trembling slightly against the cool glass. <words>367</words>  

The poet’s insomnia had always been both curse and gift, granting him endless hours to write verses no one would ever read. <words>410</words>  
But tonight, sleeplessness felt like preparation—for what, he didn’t know. <words>436</words>  
As he uncorked the bottle, a sharp scent filled the room, making his head spin. <words>463</words>  
Visions flooded his mind: drunken confessions at after-parties, faces blurred by shadows, words slurred but heavy with intent. <words>503</words>  
One confession stood out—a man admitting to eliminating someone not with violence, but with silence, erasing their existence entirely. <words>547</words>  

The memory jolted him back to reality. <words>563</words>  
Was this why the whispers had led him here? To understand the power of absence, of omission, of things left unsaid? <words>600</words>  
He stared at the glowing liquid, realizing that the true weight of non-violence lay not in action, but in restraint. <words>637</words>  
To eliminate without harm, to warn without force—this was the lesson the plants had been trying to teach him all along. <words>674</words>  
With shaking hands, he recorked the bottle and placed it back among the others, feeling a strange sense of resolution. <words>711</words>
