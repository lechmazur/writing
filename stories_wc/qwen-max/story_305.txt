The reticent scholar adjusted his glasses under the flickering lantern light, his silhouette blending with the shadows of the flooded opera house. <words>36</words>  
Water lapped gently at the edges of submerged seats, creating a haunting melody that echoed through the cavernous space. <words>74</words>  
He had come here during cake baking—a peculiar choice, but one dictated by necessity and timing. <words>112</words>  
In his satchel rested an ancient clay tablet etched with runes, its surface worn yet undeniably potent. <words>150</words>  
This artifact was central to his mission: to dethrone complacency in a world too eager to forget its past. <words>189</words>  

His fingers traced the edge of the tablet as he thought about the gathering of echoes—the voices of those long gone, trapped within these walls. <words>230</words>

Technically mischievous, he often found himself amused by how easily people overlooked the obvious. <words>306</words>  
But tonight, there would be no room for levity; the stakes were too high. <words>334</words>  

A soft knock reverberated through the chamber, startling him momentarily. <words>362</words>

More followed, each carrying fragments of knowledge like pieces of a shattered mirror. <words>554</words>  
Together, they formed an unlikely assembly, united not by camaraderie but by shared unease. <words>592</words>  
The scholar watched them silently, his pensive mirth masked behind a stoic exterior. <words>630</words>  

“Why have you brought us here?” one voice finally asked, breaking the tense stillness. <words>668</words>  
He didn’t answer immediately, instead lifting the clay tablet so all could see its intricate carvings. <words>706</words>  
“This,” he said softly, “is our key to unlocking what has been lost.” <words>740</words>
