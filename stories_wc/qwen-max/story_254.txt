The humorless comedic actor sat on a rusted swing in the deserted playground, its creak echoing through the hush of time’s unraveling tapestry. <words>36</words>  
He clutched an inkwell, dried out and useless, in his hand, its cracked surface reflecting the dim light of a fading sun. <words>72</words>  
It was one of many unwanted gifts he had received over the years, each more baffling than the last. <words>108</words>  
This particular object felt objectively personal, as though it carried the weight of someone else's forgotten dreams. <words>145</words>  
He stared at it, trying to decipher why anyone would give him such a thing. <words>179</words>  

Through persistent daydream loops, he imagined himself elsewhere—onstage, perhaps, or anywhere but here. <words>220</words>  
Yet no matter how far his mind wandered, he always returned to this moment, this place, this inkwell. <words>259</words>  
His motivation gnawed at him like an unscratchable itch: to bottle a star’s dying breath. <words>295</words>  
It wasn’t clear when the idea had taken root, only that it now consumed him entirely. <words>330</words>  
The wilderness beyond the playground seemed vast and unknowable, mirroring the emptiness within him. <words>367</words>  

He sighed, conceding defeat before he had even begun. <words>392</words>  
What did it matter if he failed? No one cared about his work anyway. <words>419</words>  
His performances were met with polite applause, never laughter, for humor required joy, and joy had long since abandoned him. <words>460</words>  
Still, something about the inkwell compelled him to stay seated, to linger just a little longer. <words>496</words>  
Perhaps it was the faint scent of ink lingering inside, or maybe it was the memory of the giver’s face—a distant cousin he barely remembered. <words>537</words>  

As twilight descended, shadows stretched across the playground, distorting the shapes of swings and slides into monstrous forms. <words>575</words>  
He closed his eyes, letting the cool breeze wash over him, imagining himself floating among the stars. <words>603</words>  
In his mind, he reached out, grasping at their fading light, desperate to capture even the smallest fragment. <words>639</words>  
But reality intruded, pulling him back to the present, where the inkwell remained stubbornly empty. <words>673</words>  
With a heavy heart, he stood, brushing dirt from his pants, ready to leave this place behind. <words>701</words>  
And yet, as he turned away, he couldn’t help but glance back one last time, wondering what might have been. <words>720</words>
