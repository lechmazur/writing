The skeptical minstrel wandered into the abandoned disappearing ink factory, his boots crunching on shards of glass and rusted machinery. <words>27</words>  
He clutched a scrap of dragon-scale armor in one hand, its iridescent surface glinting faintly under the fractured sunlight streaming through broken windows. <words>56</words>  
His other hand held a slingshot carved from bone, its elastic taut with readiness, though he wasn’t sure what he was preparing for. <words>89</words>  
At midday, when even the mailboxes stood empty and silent, the factory exhaled its secrets via the hiss of an ancient steam vent buried deep within its bowels. <words>124</words>  
It was here that the immortal trickster had promised to meet him—a meeting the minstrel neither trusted nor could afford to miss. <words>153</words>  
Reckless generosity had always been the trickster’s hallmark, but this time, the stakes were impossibly plausible: the fate of a kingdom balanced on a wager no one understood. <words>190</words>  

The minstrel paused near the vent, feeling its warmth against his skin like the breath of some long-forgotten beast. <words>216</words>  
“Why do I bother?” he muttered aloud, his voice swallowed by the cavernous space around him. <words>233</words>  
But he knew why—he’d seen the trickster’s schemes unravel lives before, leaving chaos in their wake. <words>258</words>  
This time, he vowed, would be different. This time, he would out-scheme the schemer himself. <words>281</words>  

A low chuckle echoed through the factory, bouncing off walls painted in peeling layers of forgotten colors. <words>306</words>  
“You’re late,” said the trickster, stepping into view as if conjured from shadow itself. <words>325</words>  
Dressed in garb too colorful for the grim setting, they carried an air of irreverent awe, as though life itself were a joke only they found funny. <words>358</words>  
“I’m not late; you’re early,” the minstrel shot back, gripping the slingshot tighter. <words>378</words>  
The trickster smirked, producing a small vial filled with liquid that shimmered like starlight. <words>400</words>  
“Disappearing ink,” they announced dramatically, holding it aloft. “Perfect for vanishing without a trace.” <words>423</words>  

The minstrel snorted. “And how does that help me win our little… arrangement?” <words>445</words>  
“Oh, dear minstrel,” the trickster purred, circling him lazily. “It doesn’t just vanish ink—it vanishes *problems.*” <words>472</words>  
The minstrel raised an eyebrow, unconvinced. “Like you?” <words>485</words>  
The trickster laughed, tossing the vial into the air and catching it deftly. “Now there’s an idea worth considering.” <words>508</words>  

With a flick of their wrist, the trickster hurled the vial toward the steam vent. <words>527</words>  
It shattered upon impact, releasing a cloud of glittering vapor that swirled around them both. <words>549</words>  
For a moment, everything seemed to pause—the hissing stopped, the light dimmed, and even the air felt heavier. <words>575</words>  
Then, with a sudden rush, the vapor condensed into a single, glowing arrow hovering between them. <words>600</words>  

“Take it,” the trickster urged, their tone uncharacteristically serious. <words>614</words>  
The minstrel hesitated, then reached out cautiously, plucking the arrow from the air. <words>633</words>  
As soon as his fingers closed around it, the factory began to dissolve—not crumbling, but fading, as though erased by an unseen hand. <words>660</words>  
“What did you do?” the minstrel demanded, clutching the arrow tightly. <words>675</words>  
“I gave you a choice,” the trickster replied, their form flickering like candlelight. “Use it wisely—or don’t use it at all.” <words>700</words>  

Before the minstrel could respond, the trickster vanished completely, leaving behind only the faint echo of laughter. <words>720</words>
