In the witch’s herb garden, where moonlight pooled like liquid silver, a jovial sellsword named Garrick stood with his boots caked in soil and his heart heavy with purpose. <words>36</words>  
The garden was alive with elegant mayhem—vines writhing like serpents, flowers blooming unnaturally fast, and herbs whispering secrets to the wind. <words>72</words>  
Garrick had come here not for gold or glory but to dethrone doubt from his mind, a vow he called "the withering vow." <words>108</words>  
He carried an astronomical telescope slung over his shoulder, its brass gleaming faintly under the stars, though it seemed out of place among the chaos of roots and petals. <words>154</words>  

Years ago, Garrick's family had started a tradition: every generation would bury a time capsule filled with treasures meant to inspire future kin. <words>200</words>  
But this year, Garrick hesitated. <words>206</words>  
His father’s capsule had contained only cryptic notes about fear and regret, leaving Garrick boldly reluctant to continue the practice. <words>242</words>  
Yet, as he stared at the witch’s garden—a place rumored to hold answers older than time—he felt compelled to dig deeper into both the earth and himself. <words>288</words>  

The treasure Garrick sought wasn’t gold or jewels; it was clarity. <words>314</words>  
Clarity that could only be found by confronting what haunted him most: the shadow of his own uncertainty. <words>350</words>  
With each step through the garden, the air grew thicker, laden with the scent of lavender and something metallic, like blood. <words>386</words>  
A figure emerged from the shadows—a crone cloaked in black, her eyes glinting like shards of obsidian. <words>422</words>  

“You’ve brought the telescope,” she croaked, her voice rasping like dry leaves. <words>458</words>  
Garrick nodded, adjusting the strap on his shoulder. <words>474</words>  
“I need to see beyond the veil,” he said firmly, though his hands trembled slightly. <words>500</words>  
The witch chuckled, a sound akin to shattering glass. <words>516</words>  
“Beyond the veil lies truth, boy, but also transformation. Are you ready?” <words>552</words>  

Garrick swallowed hard, his jovial demeanor faltering for just a moment. <words>588</words>  
Throughout the transformation, he would face trials no man should endure, yet he knew there was no turning back now. <words>624</words>  
Setting up the telescope beneath the gnarled branches of an ancient oak, Garrick peered through the lens, seeking answers hidden in the constellations above. <words>670</words>  
What he saw chilled him to the bone: visions of his ancestors, their faces etched with sorrow, holding fragments of the same doubts that plagued him. <words>716</words>  

Closing the telescope with a snap, Garrick turned to the witch. <words>734</words>  
“I’ll bury my capsule tonight,” he declared, his voice steady despite the storm raging within. <words>760</words>
