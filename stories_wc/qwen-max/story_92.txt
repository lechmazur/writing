The dog walker for the ultra-rich adjusted her scarf as she approached the wrought-iron gates of Blackthorn Manor, where color bled from day into night. <words>36</words>  
Her name was Evelyn, and though her profession might have seemed mundane to some, her clients trusted her implicitly with their prized companions. <words>72</words>  
Tonight, however, Evelyn wasn’t there for the dogs but for something far more peculiar—a botanical collection rumored to bloom only under moonlight. <words>114</words>  
She had been summoned by an unsigned note, written in careful cursive, which promised answers about her late mother’s mysterious past. <words>150</words>  
Evelyn stepped inside the mansion, its air thick with the scent of damp wood and forgotten memories. <words>186</words>  
In the dining room, a long table stretched like a shadow beneath a chandelier that swayed slightly, though no breeze stirred. <words>229</words>  
A silent agreement hung in the space, unspoken yet palpable, between Evelyn and the unseen forces that lingered here. <words>265</words>  
On the table lay a leather-bound journal, its pages filled with sketches of plants both familiar and alien. <words>301</words>  
Evelyn flipped through it carefully, her fingers brushing against dried petals pressed between the pages. <words>337</words>  
Each entry hinted at experiments conducted within these walls, blending science and superstition in ways that defied logic. <words>373</words>  
As she read, Evelyn felt a strange pull, as if the house itself were alive, watching her every move with quiet curiosity. <words>409</words>  
Suddenly, the sound of footsteps echoed down the hallway, breaking the loud silence that had enveloped her. <words>445</words>  
A man entered, his face pale and drawn, carrying a small cooler marked with a red cross. <words>481</words>  
“I didn’t expect anyone else to be here,” he said, his voice low and measured. <words>517</words>  
Evelyn recognized him immediately—he was the organizer of a blood drive she’d attended weeks ago, where they’d exchanged only a few words. <words>553</words>  
“Neither did I,” Evelyn replied, closing the journal gently. <words>579</words>  
He introduced himself as Dr. Alaric Crane, explaining that he’d come to retrieve samples stored in the mansion’s basement. <words>615</words>  
But Evelyn sensed there was more to his presence, something he wasn’t saying. <words>641</words>  
“You seem… carefully careless,” she observed, noting how his hands trembled despite his composed demeanor. <words>677</words>  
Dr. Crane hesitated before admitting he sought justification for his work—experiments meant to cure diseases but tainted by ethical compromises. <words>713</words>  
Evelyn realized then that the mansion wasn’t just haunted by ghosts but by the weight of choices made in pursuit of progress. <words>749</words>  
Together, they ventured deeper into the house, drawn by a shared motivation: to stand where fear dared not tread. <words>785</words>
