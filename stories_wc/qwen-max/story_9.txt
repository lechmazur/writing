The soothsayer adjusted her cracked goggles, squinting through the haze of neon lights that flickered like dying fireflies. <words>36</words>  
Her fingers trembled as she traced the water rings on a battered wooden bar top, each ripple magnifying into visions of futures both bleak and improbable. <words>74</words>  
“Probably unlikely,” she muttered under her breath, her tone dripping with molten sarcasm. <words>108</words>  
The bartender ignored her, too busy polishing glasses that hadn’t been clean in years. <words>132</words>  
She sighed, clutching the pocket puzzle box with its 13 intricate locks tighter to her chest. <words>165</words>  
It was heavy, not just in weight but in purpose—a relic from between lost years, when time itself seemed undecided about what came next. <words>210</words>  

Outside, the maze of billboards loomed over the desert like ancient monoliths, their glowing promises of consumer bliss long since faded into hollow echoes. <words>259</words>  
The soothsayer stepped out, her boots crunching against sand littered with plastic wrappers and rusted cans. <words>297</words>

One advertised a soda no one drank anymore; another promised vacations to islands swallowed by rising seas. <words>606</words>  
Kneeling, she placed the puzzle box on the ground and began working the first lock, her movements deliberate yet frantic. <words>649</words>  
Each click echoed louder than it should have, reverberating through the stillness of the neon-lit desert. <words>688</words>
