The stoic pirate radio operator adjusted his headphones as the band at the corner bar played their final note, a mournful chord that hung in the air like an unspoken regret. <words>36</words>  
He exhaled sharply, folding a paper plane from the receipt he’d found in his pocket—a relic of some forgotten transaction—and let it glide across the cluttered room. <words>74</words>  
It landed near the door just as he heard a soft gasp behind him. <words>98</words>  
Turning, he saw her: a beekeeper, her veil slightly askew, holding a wallet she must have retrieved from the bar’s lost-and-found. <words>135</words>  
“I believe this belongs to you,” she said, her voice tinged with an ironically earnest formality that matched his own pompous humility. <words>172</words>  
He took the wallet, his fingers brushing hers briefly, and nodded once, his expression unreadable but his pulse quickening. <words>210</words>  
Inside the wallet was nothing of value—no cash, no cards—but there was a folded note scrawled in untamed sincerity: *“Find me when the music ends.”* <words>254</words>  
The absurdity of it struck him, yet he felt compelled, as though the universe had consigned him to navigate uncharted emotional depths tonight. <words>296</words>  
“You’re not what I expected,” she admitted, gesturing toward the swarm of bees buzzing lazily around her sanctuary, a small garden tucked behind the bar. <words>338</words>  
“And you are?” he replied dryly, though his tone betrayed a flicker of curiosity. <words>362</words>  
She smiled faintly, leaning against a hive box painted in bright yellows and blues. “A keeper of secrets, perhaps. Like you.” <words>396</words>  
He raised an eyebrow, unsure whether to scoff or agree. Instead, he unfolded the paper plane and smoothed it out on his knee, revealing its blank surface. <words>434</words>  
“What do you write on something so empty?” she asked, tilting her head. <words>456</words>  
“Nothing,” he said after a pause. “Or everything. Depends on who’s reading.” <words>487</words>  
Her laugh was quiet, almost melodic, and for a moment, the world seemed smaller, more intimate. <words>514</words>  
They talked about trivial things—the weather, the peculiar habits of bees, the stubbornness of old radios—until the conversation shifted to something deeper. <words>556</words>  
“I came here because I needed to escape myself,” she confessed, her gaze distant. “But maybe I’m looking for someone else instead.” <words>594</words>  
He didn’t respond immediately, choosing instead to refold the paper into another plane, this time with deliberate care. <words>622</words>  
When he finally spoke, his words were measured, each one carrying the weight of unspoken truths. “Maybe we all are.” <words>654</words>  
She watched as he threw the plane into the night sky, where it disappeared among the stars. A single bee hovered nearby, drawn to the sweetness of possibility. <words>692</words>  
For the first time in years, he allowed himself to feel—not just hear—the silence that followed. <words>720</words>
