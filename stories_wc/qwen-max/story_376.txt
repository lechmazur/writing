In the heart of an ancient Viking longhouse reimagined, its timbered beams modestly flashy with intricate carvings and flickering firelight, a rogue fortune teller sat at her amber inkwell. <words>36</words>  
The inkwell glowed faintly, as though it held not ink but liquid sunlight trapped in resin. <words>57</words>  
She dipped her quill into it, tracing zigzag patterns on parchment that seemed to breathe with life under her touch. <words>84</words>  
Her name was Eira, and she had come here through the hush of an overlooked era, seeking something no one else dared to name: the unspoken offer. <words>119</words>  
Eira’s motivation was singular—to archive emotional patterns, those fleeting whispers of humanity that lingered like echoes after every decision, every betrayal, every bond forged over wine. <words>158</words>  

Tonight, the longhouse buzzed with quiet energy, its occupants drawn together by a shared love for wine tasting. <words>182</words>  
Barrels lined the walls, their staves darkened by age, while goblets clinked softly in hands calloused from years of labor and laughter. <words>215</words>  
Eira moved among them, her presence both fierce and poised, a repose that demanded attention without asking for it. <words>243</words>  
She carried her amber inkwell carefully, letting its glow catch the eye of anyone who dared meet her gaze. <words>270</words>  

A man approached her, his beard streaked with silver, his eyes sharp beneath furrowed brows. <words>293</words>  
“I’ve heard of you,” he said, his voice low, almost reverent. “They say you see what others cannot.” <words>319</words>  
Eira smiled faintly, her lips curling just enough to suggest mystery rather than amusement. <words>342</words>  
“What I see,” she replied, “is only what people bring to me. The rest is up to them.” <words>372</words>  
He hesitated, then slid a goblet toward her, filled with ruby-red wine. <words>392</words>  
“Tell me what this holds,” he challenged, though there was no malice in his tone. <words>413</words>  

Eira took the goblet, swirling the wine gently before setting it aside. <words>433</words>  
Instead, she reached for her quill and began to write, her hand moving in deliberate zigzag strokes across the parchment. <words>460</words>  
When she finished, she slid the paper toward him. It read: *You seek closure, but fear the cost.* <words>488</words>  
The man’s expression shifted, his bravado faltering as if she’d peeled back layers of armor he didn’t know he wore. <words>518</words>  
“How did you—” he started, but stopped himself, shaking his head. <words>538</words>  

Eira leaned closer, her voice barely above a whisper. <words>552</words>  
“The unspoken offer lies within you,” she said. “Will you accept it?” <words>575</words>  
He stared at the parchment, then at her, before nodding slowly. <words>593</words>  
As he walked away, another figure stepped forward—a woman draped in furs, her demeanor commanding yet curious. <words>621</words>  
“I want to know my future,” she declared, sliding a goblet of golden mead toward Eira. <words>645</words>  
Eira studied her for a moment, then dipped her quill once more. <words>662</words>  
This time, the zigzag lines formed words that shimmered faintly against the parchment: *Your strength will be tested, but your legacy will endure.* <words>700</words>  
The woman exhaled sharply, her composure cracking slightly before she masked it with a grateful smile. <words>720</words>
