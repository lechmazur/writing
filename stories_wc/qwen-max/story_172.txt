The unsettled guide stood at the edge of a deserted beach, staring at the giant seashell that gleamed under the moonlight. <words>27</words>  
Its surface was smooth and iridescent, as though it had been polished by centuries of secrets. <words>49</words>  
He clutched a wooden puzzle box in his trembling hands, its intricate carvings whispering promises he didn’t fully understand. <words>78</words>  
This was no ordinary artifact; it held architectural secrets that could reshape reality itself. <words>105</words>  
But tonight, it felt more like a curse than a gift. <words>118</words>  

The prophecy had found him hours earlier, after the last photo was snapped in a deserted hallway. <words>139</words>  
A camera flash, followed by silence, had marked the beginning of his flight from an unstoppable doom. <words>165</words>  
Now, here he was, miles away from civilization, trying to outrun fate with sharp gentleness guiding his every move. <words>196</words>  
He wasn’t sure why gentleness mattered when facing something so vast and inevitable, but it did. <words>224</words>  

The guide knelt before the seashell, placing the puzzle box on the sand. <words>243</words>  
His fingers traced the grooves of the carvings, searching for alignment. <words>262</words>  
If he could align the pieces correctly, perhaps he could reverse the wishes that had set this nightmare into motion. <words>293</words>  
It was a desperate hope, one born not of strategy but of accidental heroism. <words>316</words>  

As a child, he’d always been told he lacked purpose, drifting through life without direction. <words>344</words>  
Yet here he was, holding the key to undoing—or fulfilling—a destiny far greater than himself. <words>372</words>  
The irony wasn’t lost on him. <words>382</words>  

The wind picked up, carrying the faint scent of saltwater and decay. <words>403</words>  
He glanced over his shoulder, half-expecting to see shadows creeping toward him. <words>427</words>  
Nothing moved except the waves lapping against the shore, yet the unease in his chest grew heavier. <words>455</words>  
Time was running out. <words>465</words>  

With renewed determination, he focused on the puzzle box, twisting and turning its segments until they clicked into place. <words>496</words>  
A low hum emanated from within, vibrating through the sand beneath his knees. <words>518</words>  
The giant seashell began to glow brighter, illuminating the beach in hues of blue and silver. <words>544</words>  
For a moment, he thought he’d succeeded. <words>558</words>  

Then the voice came—a deep, resonant tone that seemed to echo from the shell itself. <words>583</words>  
“You seek to undo what has been done,” it said, neither accusing nor approving. <words>607</words>  
“I seek to survive,” the guide replied, his voice steady despite the fear clawing at his insides. <words>634</words>  

The shell pulsed once, then twice, before splitting open slightly to reveal a dark void within. <words>663</words>  
Inside floated fragments of reversed wishes—broken dreams and shattered hopes waiting to be realigned. <words>694</words>  
The guide hesitated, knowing that stepping closer might mean losing himself entirely. <words>717</words>  
But staying meant certain death. <words>728</words>  

Taking a deep breath, he reached into the void, feeling the weight of countless destinies pressing against his fingertips. <words>753</words>
