The tired swordsman leaned against the jagged edge of the floating rock monastery, his plain cloth bag slung carelessly over one shoulder. <words>30</words>  
His face bore the marks of countless battles, but his eyes held a fiercely apathetic glint, as though he had long since stopped caring about anything beyond survival. <words>62</words>  
Yet deep within him burned the spark of defiance, a quiet flame that refused to be extinguished no matter how heavy the weight of his past became. <words>98</words>  
He stood in the quiet breakroom of the monastery, where monks whispered solemnly after someone had resigned from their duties earlier that day. <words>134</words>  
The air was thick with knowing naivety, an unspoken belief that leaving would somehow bring peace to those who stayed behind. <words>170</words>  
But the swordsman knew better; he had seen too much to trust such fragile hopes. <words>195</words>  

Still, there was something here—a pull he couldn’t ignore. <words>218</words>  
It wasn’t just the monastery itself, suspended impossibly among the clouds, or even the meteor showers that streaked across the sky every night like celestial omens. <words>260</words>  
No, it was the promise he had made to himself years ago, hidden beneath layers of regret and failure. <words>290</words>  
A promise to overcome—not others, but himself. <words>310</words>  

The plain cloth bag at his side seemed heavier than it should have been, its contents pressing into his hip as if reminding him why he had come this far. <words>348</words>  
Inside was a single shard of obsidian, black as midnight, given to him by a dying friend during his last battle. <words>384</words>  
“Follow the meteors,” she had said, her voice barely audible over the clash of steel. <words>410</words>  
“They’ll show you the way when nothing else can.” <words>432</words>  
At the time, he hadn’t understood what she meant, but now, standing on this floating sanctuary, the pieces were beginning to fall into place. <words>474</words>  

Every evening, without fail, the monks gathered to watch the meteor showers, their faces illuminated by streaks of light that painted the heavens. <words>512</words>  
To them, it was a sacred ritual, a reminder of impermanence and grace. <words>538</words>  
To the swordsman, it was a map—a guide leading him toward whatever awaited at the end of his journey. <words>568</words>  
And so, each night, he followed their trails, tracing invisible lines across the sky until his legs ached and his mind grew numb. <words>606</words>  

Tonight, however, felt different. <words>620</words>  
As the first meteor blazed across the horizon, he noticed a faint hum resonating through the monastery’s stone foundation. <words>656</words>  
It vibrated in sync with the rhythm of his heartbeat, urging him forward. <words>678</words>  
Without hesitation, he grabbed his bag and stepped out onto the open platform, letting the wind whip around him as more meteors lit up the darkness. <words>716</words>  
One particular streak lingered longer than the rest, pointing directly toward a distant peak shrouded in mist. <words>740</words>
