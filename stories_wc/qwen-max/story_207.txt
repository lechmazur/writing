The forthright peddler shuffled through the dim corridors of the abandoned space station medical bay, his boots clicking softly against the cold metal floor. <words>36</words>  
In his hands, he clutched a dried flower bouquet, its brittle petals whispering faintly with each step he took. <words>72</words>  
He was meekly assertive, a man who spoke little but carried an air of quiet determination that could not be ignored. <words>109</words>  
His mission was clear: to divide the tangled threads of guilt and regret that bound him to an oath sealed in blood years ago. <words>148</words>  
As the universe hummed its secret song outside the cracked viewport windows, he sifted through rumor-laden gossip columns on an old datapad, searching for clues to guide him forward. <words>195</words>  

The medical bay loomed around him, its sterile white walls now streaked with rust and grime, a testament to time’s relentless march. <words>233</words>  
It had once been a place of healing, but now it echoed only with joyful loneliness—a peculiar blend of sorrow and hope that filled the peddler’s heart as he worked. <words>272</words>  
Each column he read brought him closer to understanding what he needed to do next, though the answers were buried beneath layers of half-truths and speculation. <words>311</words>  
He paused by a shattered examination table, placing the dried flower bouquet gently upon it. <words>340</words>  
The flowers had belonged to her—the one whose memory haunted his every waking moment. <words>370</words>  

Her name was Lira, and she had trusted him completely before everything went wrong. <words>400</words>  
Their bond had been unbreakable until the day they swore their fates together in blood, vowing to protect the secrets of the galaxy at any cost. <words>439</words>  
But when betrayal came—not from without, but from within—he found himself shackled to a promise that no longer made sense. <words>478</words>  
Now, redemption's path lay before him, winding through this forgotten corner of the cosmos where echoes of past mistakes lingered like ghosts. <words>518</words>  

With a deep breath, the peddler divided the information he had gathered into two piles: truths and lies. <words>557</words>  
The act felt symbolic, as if separating fact from fiction might also untangle the knots in his soul. <words>595</words>  
He glanced at the bouquet again, its faded colors still holding traces of her laughter, her kindness, her unwavering belief in him. <words>634</words>  
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, his voice barely audible over the hum of the universe beyond the station. <words>665</words>  

For the first time in years, tears welled up in his eyes, blurring the words on the datapad screen. <words>695</words>  
Yet even amidst the ache of loss, there was a strange joy—a sense that breaking the oath would finally set them both free. <words>734</words>
