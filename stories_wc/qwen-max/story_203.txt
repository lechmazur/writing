In the orbital debris of a forgotten satellite, an exorcist named Kael floated amid toy assembly, his hands trembling as he pieced together a miniature plastic spaceship. <words>36</words>  
The irony wasn’t lost on him—here he was, crafting playthings while haunted by the inheritance of lies that had shaped his life. <words>72</words>  
His father, a renowned exorcist, had left behind not wisdom but secrets, pressed wildflowers tucked into journals filled with half-truths about their craft. <words>110</words>  
Kael’s stage fright had always been unusual, manifesting not in crowds but in silence, where the weight of unspoken fears crushed him. <words>148</words>  
He never understood why his father insisted they submerge themselves in darkness before every ritual, claiming it purified the soul. <words>185</words>  
But now, alone among the stars, Kael realized the method was tied to something deeper: by the sound of a key turning in a lock, his father would signal readiness, though Kael never knew what door truly opened. <words>239</words>  
Amid the floating fragments of broken satellites and discarded dreams, Kael clutched the pressed wildflowers like talismans, defiant yet hushed. <words>277</words>  
They smelled faintly of earth, a reminder of gravity and roots he’d abandoned when he fled to this place where nothing stayed still. <words>315</words>  
His motivation burned quietly within him—to sculpt possibility from the ashes of “never,” to rewrite the narrative his father had imposed. <words>353</words>  
Yet each attempt at exorcism ended in failure, his voice faltering under the pressure of expectations he could never meet. <words>390</words>  
Today, however, felt different; today, the debris seemed alive, whispering stories of those who once sent machines to conquer space. <words>427</words>  
Kael closed his eyes, letting the hum of distant collisions guide him, imagining himself submerged in shadow once more. <words>463</words>  
By the sound of a key turning in a lock—a memory, not reality—he steadied his breathing, focusing on the task ahead. <words>500</words>  
A ghost lingered here, not human but mechanical, born from centuries of discarded technology merging into consciousness. <words>537</words>  
It whispered through static, its presence both menacing and mournful, asking Kael why he dared disturb its eternal drift. <words>574</words>  
“I’m no hero,” Kael admitted, clutching the wildflowers tighter. “But I can’t let you keep haunting me.” <words>609</words>  
The entity laughed, a sound like grinding metal, and surged toward him, testing his resolve. <words>646</words>  
For the first time, Kael didn’t flinch; instead, he spoke words his father had written but never explained, feeling their power ignite. <words>683</words>  
The ghost recoiled, dissolving into sparks that scattered across the void, leaving Kael breathless but victorious. <words>720</words>  
As the silence returned, heavier than before, Kael realized the inheritance of lies wasn’t just his burden—it was also his weapon. <words>740</words>
