<story>  
The underwater welder, Callan, surfaced from the depths with a vintage button box clutched in his gloved hand. <words>20</words>  
Its brass corners gleamed faintly under the moonlight, though its purpose eluded him entirely. <words>41</words>  
He had found it wedged between two sunken beams at the bottom of an abandoned observatory’s flooded foundation. <words>73</words>  
Callan was no stranger to moments of unraveling; they came to him like tides—patiently impatient, always pulling him toward something he couldn’t name. <words>115</words>  

That night, he carried the box to the broken planetarium, now reimagined as a nightclub pulsing with neon lights and distorted echoes of forgotten constellations. <words>158</words>  
It was here, at the crossing where two timelines should never meet, that Callan hoped to uncover the improbable power the box seemed to promise. <words>200</words>  
He moved through the crowd, feeling out of place in his salt-stained dive suit but driven by a motivation deeper than vanity or curiosity. <words>236</words>  

In the corner of the club stood a series of vintage store mirrors, their frames tarnished yet still reflective enough to catch glimpses of truths hidden beneath surfaces. <words>280</words>  
As Callan approached one mirror, the box trembled slightly in his grip, as if drawn to its own reflection. <words>312</words>  
Through the glass, he saw not himself, but fragments of another version of him—a man who wore tailored suits instead of welding gear, standing confidently before an audience. <words>359</words>  
This alternate self exuded authority, wielding influence like a conductor leading an orchestra. <words>388</words>  

Callan blinked, and the vision dissolved into the strobing lights of the club. <words>410</words>  
Yet the memory lingered, fueling his resolve to unlock whatever secrets lay within the button box. <words>441</words>  
He retreated to a quieter alcove, running his fingers over the intricate carvings on its surface. <words>471</words>  
Each detail whispered stories of inherited mystery, tales passed down through generations until they reached him. <words>504</words>  

A woman nearby noticed his fascination and sidled closer, her presence both intrusive and oddly comforting. <words>536</words>  
“You look like someone who needs pampering,” she said, her voice smooth as velvet. <words>560</words>  
Callan hesitated, unsure whether to trust her, but there was something about her gaze that reminded him of the ocean—deep, unknowable, and full of secrets. <words>602</words>  
She gestured for him to follow her behind a curtain draped across the back wall of the club. <words>626</words>  

Behind the curtain lay a small chamber filled with relics salvaged from shipwrecks and ruins. <words>657</words>  
“This might help you understand what you’re holding,” she murmured, handing him a magnifying lens encased in polished wood. <words>691</words>  
Callan examined the button box more closely, discovering tiny engravings that formed a map of celestial alignments. <words>720</words>
