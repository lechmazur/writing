The dejected knight floated in the zero-gravity dance hall, his armor glinting faintly under the fractured light of spinning chandeliers. <17></17> He clutched the trident prong from a sunken realm, its jagged edges humming with an energy both ancient and restless. <38></38> Around him, dancers moved in slow, spiraling arcs, their movements normally abnormal—graceful yet disjointed, as if obeying a rhythm no one else could hear. <66></66> The knight’s gaze was fixed on the old watchtower clock visible through the hall’s glass dome, its hands frozen for centuries until tonight. <94></94> When it struck an unexpected hour, the silence in the hall deepened, as though the universe itself had drawn a breath. <118></118>  

He had come here through forgotten paths, winding trails that only revealed themselves to those burdened by vows too heavy to speak aloud. <150></150> The trident prong had been his guide, its faint glow illuminating the way through shadowed corridors and collapsing stairwells. <176></176> Now, in this sacred disorder of floating bodies and fractured light, he felt the weight of his purpose pressing against his chest. <206></206>  

The vow was ancient, older than the sunken realm from which the trident prong had been torn. <226></226> It was a promise made not in words but in the silent resonance of a soul bound to something greater than itself. <254></254> The knight had carried it through lifetimes, each one a step closer to this moment, this place, where horizons deepened beyond comprehension. <286></286>  

The clock’s hands began to move, their grinding echo filling the hall as the dancers quickened their pace. <308></308> The knight felt the pull of the vow, a silent command urging him forward, his armored boots scraping against the polished floor. <338></338> He raised the trident prong, its glow intensifying, casting shadows that danced like specters across the walls. <364></364>  

Through the glass dome, the stars seemed to shift, aligning into patterns that whispered secrets only the vow-bound could understand. <392></392> The knight stepped into the center of the hall, where gravity seemed to falter entirely, and the dancers parted to form a circle around him. <426></426>  

He plunged the trident prong into the floor, and the hall shuddered as if the universe itself had been struck. <450></450> Light erupted from the prong, cascading upward in waves that dissolved the walls, revealing an endless expanse of stars and forgotten realms. <486></486> The vow, once silent, now echoed through the ages, a voice carried on the winds of eternity. <506></506>
