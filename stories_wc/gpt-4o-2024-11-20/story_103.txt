<story>  
The weatherbeaten knight stood before the lighthouse prison, its jagged reef slicing through the mirrored reflection of the stormy sea. <22>  
In his hand, he clutched a brass door knocker shaped like a lion’s head, its tarnished surface glinting faintly in the dim light. <44>  
He had come here not as a savior, but as a man burdened by impossible choices, each one heavier than the last. <66>  
The lighthouse loomed above him, its spiraling walls etched with the scars of time, a monument to both hope and despair. <88>  
Inside, he knew, lay the prisoner whose final cry of regret had echoed across the waves, haunting his every step. <110>  
The knight’s grudgingly sweet demeanor masked the turmoil within, a fragile balance between duty and the faintest flicker of compassion. <133>  
He raised the brass door knocker and struck it against the iron-bound door, the sound reverberating like a heartbeat through the stone. <157>  
The door creaked open, revealing a narrow corridor lined with mirrors, each reflecting a distorted version of his weary face. <179>  
As he stepped inside, the air grew heavy, and the mirrors seemed to whisper secrets he dared not understand. <198>  
In the center of the room, a table held a set of seemingly random items: a feather, a broken compass, a vial of sand, and a rusted key. <226>  
The knight hesitated, his calloused fingers hovering over the objects, sensing that their arrangement formed a pattern he could not yet see. <251>  
He appreciated the cruel elegance of the puzzle, even as it mocked his desperation to silence the cry that had shattered his peace. <275>  
The mirrored walls shimmered, and within their reflections, he saw fragments of his past—choices made, paths abandoned, lives altered. <298>  
Each decision had led him here, to this lighthouse prison, where the weight of his regrets threatened to crush him entirely. <320>  
The prisoner’s voice called out, soft yet piercing, from the top of the spiral staircase: “Will you free me, or will you condemn me?” <346>  
The knight’s heart clenched, for he knew that freeing the prisoner would unleash chaos, but condemning them would seal his own damnation. <372>  
He gathered the items from the table, arranging them instinctively, the pattern revealing itself like a melody long forgotten. <394>  
The feather balanced on the compass, the vial of sand poured into its broken glass, and the rusted key turned in an invisible lock. <419>  
The mirrors shattered, and the lighthouse trembled, the prisoner’s cry rising to a crescendo before falling silent. <439>  
In the stillness that followed, the knight stood alone, his reflection gone, his burden lifted, yet his soul hollowed by joyful agony. <464>  
He left the lighthouse prison, the brass door knocker heavy in his hand, knowing he had hushed the final cry but lost himself in the process. <491>
