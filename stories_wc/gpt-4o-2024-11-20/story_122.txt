The cyber-templar knelt at the edge of the sky burial site, his chrome-plated hands trembling as he adjusted the worn leather bridle strapped to his chest. <14> The bridle, a relic from a world long past, was the only thing grounding him to the illusion of safety he so desperately clung to. <34> Above him, the storm churned, its lightning fracturing the heavens into jagged shards of light. <48> He was here to prove something—not to others, but to himself. <59> The mirage of safety had always been his prison, and now, he sought to shatter it. <74>  

The prism in his hand caught the storm’s fury, refracting its light into a kaleidoscope of colors that danced across the burial site. <94> Bones, bleached by time and wind, glowed faintly under the fractured light, as if the dead themselves were watching. <110> His mind was a battlefield of euphoric agitation, a patient frenzy that urged him forward even as it whispered caution. <127> He had spent years running from the storm, but now, he would reflect its lightning back at it. <141>  

The bridle creaked as he tightened it, its leather worn smooth by countless hands before his. <154> It was a symbol of control, of taming chaos, but here, it felt like a noose. <167> The cyber-templar’s visor flickered, his augmented reality interface struggling to process the storm’s raw energy. <182> He could feel the storm’s power vibrating through the air, a force that demanded submission. <195> But submission was not why he had come. <202>  

He raised the prism, angling it carefully, his movements both frantic and deliberate. <214> The storm’s lightning struck, a blinding spear of energy that shattered against the prism’s surface. <229> The light refracted, splitting into a thousand beams that illuminated the burial site in surreal, shifting hues. <245> For a moment, the storm seemed to hesitate, as if confused by its own reflection. <258>  

The cyber-templar’s heart raced, his euphoria mounting as he realized he had done it—he had turned the storm’s power against itself. <276> But the storm was not defeated; it roared back, its fury redoubled, and the burial site trembled under its wrath. <292> The bridle snapped, the leather finally giving way, and the templar felt a strange liberation as it fell from his chest. <309>  

He stood, unbound, the prism still in his hand, and faced the storm with a clarity he had never known. <323> The mirage of safety was gone, replaced by the raw, unfiltered truth of his existence. <337> He was not here to tame the storm but to become one with it, to embrace its chaos and reflect its light. <354>  

As the storm’s lightning struck again, the prism shattered, its fragments scattering like stars across the burial site. <369> The cyber-templar laughed, a sound of euphoric defiance, as the storm consumed him in a blaze of refracted light. <384> In that moment, he was both the storm and its reflection, a collision of reality and illusion that could never be undone. <400>
