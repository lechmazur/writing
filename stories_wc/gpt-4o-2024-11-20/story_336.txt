The weary undertaker stood alone in the reimagined ancient Persian palace, his fingers tracing the intricate carvings of the astronomical clock before him. <14></14>  

The clock, a relic of forgotten eras, was said to hold the tribal knowledge of celestial movements, though its wisdom was rarely practical in the modern world. <38></38>  

Outside, the hush after a car backfired on the silent street seemed to stretch endlessly, as if time itself had paused to listen. <63></63>  

The undertaker’s eyes, shadowed by years of grief and toil, flicked to the sunlit patterns on the marble floor, cast through the palace’s stained-glass windows. <96></96>  

He had come here not for solace, but for a purpose—one born of placid ferocity, a quiet determination to hold onto hope in the absolute dark. <129></129>  

The palace, with its towering columns and golden domes, had been repurposed as a sanctuary for those who sought answers in the stars. <157></157>  

But for the undertaker, it was a prison of his own making, one he had entered willingly by following the sun paths etched into the palace’s design. <194></194>  

He had learned of these paths from an elder whose voice trembled with the weight of ancient stories, passed down through generations like fragile heirlooms. <230></230>  

The elder had spoken of a ritual, one that required the astronomical clock to align perfectly with the sun’s position at dusk, unlocking a hidden chamber. <268></268>  

In that chamber, it was said, lay the means to imprison despair itself—a concept the undertaker clung to with desperate resolve. <298></298>  

He adjusted the clock’s mechanisms, each movement deliberate, his hands steady despite the tremor in his heart. <323></323>  

The palace seemed to breathe around him, its air thick with the scent of aged stone and forgotten incense, as if it too awaited the outcome. <357></357>  

When the final gear clicked into place, a low hum resonated through the chamber, and a beam of light pierced the gloom, illuminating a hidden doorway. <396></396>  

The undertaker stepped forward, his breath shallow, and pushed the door open to reveal a room bathed in golden light, its walls inscribed with celestial maps. <439></439>  

At the center stood a pedestal, upon which rested a small, obsidian box, its surface smooth yet cold to the touch. <470></470>  

He hesitated, then opened the box, finding within it a shard of crystal that seemed to pulse faintly, as if alive. <499></499>  

The elder’s words echoed in his mind: “Imprison despair, and you may yet find hope.” <519></519>  

With a deep breath, the undertaker placed the shard against his chest, feeling its warmth spread through him, a fragile yet undeniable light in the darkness. <567></567>
