The abandoned spaceport hangar groaned under the weight of time, its skeletal beams arching like the ribs of a long-dead leviathan. <words>16</words>  

In the dim light, Maren adjusted her scarf, the fabric a shield against the chill and the memories that clung to this place. <words>33</words>  

She was a professional cuddler by trade, a job that required warmth and trust, but tonight she felt neither. <words>47</words>  

Her fingers brushed the phantom train ticket punch in her pocket, an artifact she had found at a farmer’s market just days ago. <words>65</words>  

The vendor had been peculiar, his eyes unusually usual—so ordinary they seemed to hide something extraordinary beneath their surface. <words>80</words>  

He had handed her the punch with a cryptic smile, saying, “This will take you where you need to go, but only if you listen.” <words>98</words>  

Maren hadn’t understood then, but the weight of the object now felt heavier, as though it carried the gravity of unspoken rules. <words>113</words>  

The hangar was silent, save for the faint hum of decay in the air, a sound more felt than heard. <words>126</words>  

She wasn’t alone. <words>128</words>  

Across the cavernous space, a man stood, his silhouette sharp against the faint glow of a distant, flickering light. <words>143</words>  

He was holding a piece of paper, its edges frayed, and Maren’s heart skipped when she realized it was a train ticket. <words>158</words>  

The man turned, his face lined with years of distrust, and Maren recognized him instantly—her estranged brother, Elias. <words>172</words>  

They hadn’t spoken in over a decade, their relationship fractured by a prejudice neither had been brave enough to confront. <words>187</words>  

“What are you doing here?” Elias asked, his voice low, carrying the weight of old wounds. <words>198</words>  

Maren hesitated, then held up the phantom train ticket punch. <words>206</words>  

“I think this brought me here,” she said, her voice trembling with the ancient novelty of the moment. <words>219</words>  

Elias studied her, his expression unreadable, before stepping closer. <words>228</words>  

“The unspoken rules,” he murmured, almost to himself. <words>236</words>  

“What rules?” Maren asked, her fingers tightening around the punch. <words>246</words>  

Elias gestured to the hangar around them. <words>253</words>  

“This place, this moment—it’s a crossroads,” he said. <words>263</words>  

Maren felt the truth of his words, the air thick with possibility and the ache of unresolved history. <words>277</words>  

“I don’t want to hate anymore,” she said, her voice breaking. <words>288</words>  

Elias nodded, his own walls crumbling as he extended the ticket toward her. <words>300</words>  

“Then let’s go,” he said. <words>306</words>  

Maren inserted the ticket into the punch, and the hangar shuddered as a spectral train materialized, its doors sliding open with a hiss. <words>324</words>  

They stepped aboard together, the unspoken rules of forgiveness guiding them into the unknown. <words>336</words>  

As the train pulled away, the hangar faded, leaving behind only the echo of a chance encounter and the promise of a new beginning. <words>354</words>  

In the hush before the acceptance speech began, Maren sat beside Elias, their journey far from over but finally shared. <words>369</words>  

The phantom train ticket punch rested in her lap, a relic of decay and renewal, its purpose fulfilled. <words>382</words>  

And for the first time in years, Maren felt whole. <words>391</words>
