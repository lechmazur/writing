The abandoned space station's medical bay echoed with the faint hum of the universe's secret song, a melody only the lonely could hear. <11></11>  

Among the rusted gurneys and shattered glass, a forthright peddler named Liora stood, her hands trembling as she clutched a dried flower bouquet. <33></33>  

The bouquet was not for sale, though everything else in her life had been; it was a relic of a promise she had sworn to break. <54></54>  

Years ago, she had sealed an oath in blood—a pact forged in desperation and regret—but now, redemption's path called her forward. <75></75>  

Her meekly assertive nature had always been her paradox: too timid to lead, yet too stubborn to yield entirely. <91></91>  

She had come to this desolate place not by chance but by sifting through rumor-laden gossip columns, each whisper guiding her closer to the truth. <115></115>  

The columns spoke of a man, a healer once stationed here, who had vanished after a betrayal that left scars on more than just his body. <138></138>  

Liora believed he held the key to breaking her oath, though she feared what his judgment might demand of her. <155></155>  

The medical bay was divided into two halves: one bathed in the pale light of distant stars, the other swallowed by shadow. <174></174>  

She stepped cautiously, her boots crunching on debris, as if the station itself might awaken and reject her presence. <191></191>  

The bouquet in her hands was a symbol of her guilt, each brittle petal a memory of the lives her oath had cost. <209></209>  

She had been a peddler of secrets, trading truths for coin, until one secret had spiraled into tragedy—a betrayal she could never undo. <232></232>  

Now, she sought the healer not for forgiveness but for a way to divide her past from her future, to sever the chains of her own making. <256></256>  

A faint rustling broke the silence, and from the shadows emerged a figure, his face lined with years of solitude and sorrow. <275></275>  

"You've come far," he said, his voice carrying the weight of someone who had seen too much and healed too little. <292></292>  

Liora held out the bouquet, her hands shaking. "I need your help to break an oath I should never have made." <311></311>  

The healer studied her, his gaze piercing yet kind. "Redemption is not given; it is earned. Are you ready to divide yourself from your sins?" <338></338>  

She nodded, tears slipping down her cheeks. "I am ready, even if it means losing everything I have left." <355></355>  

He took the bouquet, crumbling the dried flowers into dust, and whispered words that seemed to harmonize with the universe's secret song. <377></377>  

As the dust scattered, Liora felt a weight lift from her soul, replaced by a joyful loneliness—a bittersweet freedom she had never known. <399></399>  

The healer smiled faintly. "Go now. Your path is your own, but tread it wisely." <414></414>  

Liora turned and walked away, the hum of the universe growing louder, guiding her toward a future she could finally face. <432></432>
