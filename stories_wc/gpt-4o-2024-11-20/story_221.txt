The abandoned carnival shooting gallery creaked under the weight of memories, its wooden beams groaning like ghosts caught mid-sentence. <words>16</words>  

Elliot, a wreck-diver turned ghost whisperer, stood in the dim light, his fingers brushing the dust off a forgotten rifle. <words>31</words>  

The air smelled of rust and mildew, but there was something else—something alive, something waiting. <words>44</words>  

In his pocket, he carried a piece of amber with an insect trapped inside, a relic from his last dive. <words>59</words>  

The amber was warm against his palm, as if the tiny creature within still pulsed with life. <words>71</words>  

He had come here not for the ghosts, but for himself, to step out of the shadow of his family’s expectations. <words>88</words>  

For generations, the family tradition had been to attend the annual carnival together, a ritual of laughter and shared stories. <words>104</words>  

But the carnival had died years ago, leaving behind only this skeletal gallery and the echoes of forgotten joy. <words>118</words>  

Elliot’s father had been the ringleader of their traditions, a man whose booming laughter aroused both pride and resentment in his son. <words>135</words>  

Now, between the lines of a half-written letter to his father, Elliot sought the courage to say what he couldn’t voice aloud. <words>152</words>  

The amber in his hand seemed to hum, its trapped insect a metaphor for his own frozen heart. <words>165</words>  

He had always been joyfully melancholic, a contradiction his family never understood, their boisterousness drowning out his quieter rebellions. <words>181</words>  

The gallery’s targets, faded clowns and chipped stars, stared back at him, daring him to take aim. <words>194</words>  

He raised the rifle, its weight unfamiliar but grounding, and fired at the nearest target. <words>206</words>  

The sound shattered the silence, arousing a fleeting rebellion in his chest, a spark of something he hadn’t felt in years. <words>222</words>  

A whisper brushed his ear, soft and mournful, the voice of a ghost tethered to this place. <words>235</words>  

“You’re not trapped,” it said, its tone both a warning and a promise. <words>245</words>  

Elliot turned, but no one was there—only the amber in his hand, glowing faintly now. <words>258</words>  

He thought of the insect, preserved forever in its golden prison, and felt a pang of recognition. <words>271</words>  

The thawing heart, he realized, wasn’t about breaking free but about embracing the warmth of change. <words>284</words>  

He placed the amber on the gallery counter, a token of his decision to let go. <words>296</words>  

The rifle clattered beside it, its purpose fulfilled, as Elliot walked out into the night. <words>308</words>  

The carnival was gone, but its ghosts lingered, watching as he stepped into a future of his own making. <words>323</words>  

The half-written letter in his pocket no longer felt like a burden but a beginning. <words>335</words>  

For the first time, Elliot smiled—not with melancholy, but with the quiet joy of someone finally free. <words>350</words>
