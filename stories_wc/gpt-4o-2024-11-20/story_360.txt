In the underground city of the goblins, where the air hummed with the peculiar echoes of playground sounds, a meek necromancer named Elric sat cross-legged on the cold stone floor. <19></words> He clutched a fountain pen with a broken nib, its once-elegant design now marred by time and misuse. <35></words> The pen was useless for writing, but Elric believed it held a secret—one tied to the tangled tapestry of existence itself. <54></words>  

Elric’s peculiarly sincere nature had always set him apart, even among the goblins who tolerated his presence in their subterranean world. <74></words> He had no malice, no hunger for power, only an unyielding desire to decode the universal riddle whispered to him in dreams. <92></words> The riddle spoke of a pattern, a hidden truth woven into the fabric of all things, and Elric was determined to find it. <111></words>  

The goblin children’s laughter echoed through the cavern, their voices bouncing off jagged walls like shards of light. <126></words> Elric closed his eyes, letting the sounds wash over him, grounding him in the moment. <138></words> He held the broken pen aloft, its tarnished surface catching the faint glow of bioluminescent fungi clinging to the ceiling. <156></words>  

He had tried everything—spells, incantations, even blood magic—but the pen refused to yield its secrets. <170></words> It was only when he noticed the way light reflected off a dew drop on the pen’s nib that something shifted within him. <189></words> The dew drop refracted the light into a spectrum of colors, and in that fleeting moment, Elric saw a fragment of the tapestry. <208></words>  

The tangled threads of existence unraveled before his mind’s eye, revealing connections he had never imagined. <222></words> He saw the goblins’ underground city as more than stone and shadow; it was a living, breathing part of the pattern. <240></words> The children’s laughter, the fungi’s glow, even the broken pen—all were threads in the same vast weave. <256></words>  

But the vision faded as quickly as it had come, leaving Elric with a single, burning question: how could he regain what he had glimpsed? <275></words> He realized the answer lay not in force or intellect but in surrendering to the simplicity of the moment. <291></words>  

Elric rose, his movements deliberate, and walked toward the goblin children playing near a shallow pool. <305></words> He knelt beside them, his presence timid but sincere, and watched as they skipped stones across the water’s surface. <323></words> The ripples spread outward, intersecting and overlapping, forming patterns that mirrored the tapestry he sought to understand. <341></words>  

One of the children handed him a smooth stone, their small, clawed hand outstretched in an innocent gesture. <355></words> Elric accepted it, his heart swelling with gratitude, and cast the stone into the pool. <368></words> As the ripples danced, the light caught another dew drop on the pen’s nib, and the tapestry revealed itself once more. <387></words>  

This time, Elric understood: the riddle was not meant to be solved but lived. <399></words> The tangled tapestry was not a puzzle to decode but a story to embrace, thread by thread, moment by moment. <417></words> With a quiet smile, Elric tucked the broken pen into his robe and joined the children in their game, his heart at peace. <437></words>
