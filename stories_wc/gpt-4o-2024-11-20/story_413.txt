The endless corn maze stretched across the haunted plain, its stalks whispering secrets to a world where no creature yet knew how to listen. <13></words>  

Lord Alaric, a listless noble with a naively sophisticated air, wandered its labyrinthine paths, clutching a faded scarf that once belonged to someone he could no longer name. <38></words>  

He had come here not out of curiosity but because of an unexpected invitation to a spontaneous event—a rendezvous promised at the maze’s elusive heart. <63></words>  

The invitation had been scrawled on parchment, its ink smudged as though written in haste, and delivered by a courier who vanished before Alaric could ask questions. <91></words>  

The irony of his situation was not lost on him; a man who had spent his life avoiding purpose now found himself chasing the promise of intention. <118></words>  

The maze seemed alive, its paths shifting subtly when he wasn’t looking, as though mocking his aimless existence. <135></words>  

He paused to adjust the scarf around his neck, its faded threads a reminder of something he couldn’t quite grasp, and sighed. <155></words>  

“Why am I even here?” he muttered, his voice swallowed by the rustling corn. <167></words>  

As if in answer, a burst of laughter echoed through the maze, startling him. <179></words>  

It wasn’t a cruel laugh but one of shared amusement, as though the maze itself found his predicament entertaining. <197></words>  

Intrigued despite himself, Alaric followed the sound, his steps quickening as the laughter grew louder and more inviting. <213></words>  

He turned a corner and found a woman sitting on a makeshift throne of cornstalks, her eyes alight with mischief. <231></words>  

She wore a gown that shimmered like moonlight and held a goblet filled with something that glowed faintly. <247></words>  

“You’re late,” she said, her tone both teasing and regal. <256></words>  

“I wasn’t aware I was expected,” Alaric replied, his naively sophisticated demeanor masking his confusion. <271></words>  

“Few are,” she said, gesturing for him to sit on a nearby bale of hay. <283></words>  

He hesitated but obeyed, the faded scarf slipping from his neck as he sat. <296></words>  

“Do you know why you’re here?” she asked, her gaze piercing. <307></words>  

“To discover the power of intention, I suppose,” he said, the words surprising even himself. <322></words>  

She laughed again, the sound filling the maze with warmth. <333></words>  

“Intention is not something you find,” she said. “It’s something you create.” <347></words>  

As she spoke, the maze began to shift, its walls folding inward until they were surrounded by an open plain. <366></words>  

The scarf lay forgotten on the ground, its faded threads unraveling into the soil. <379></words>  

Alaric felt a strange clarity, as though the laughter had unlocked something within him. <393></words>  

For the first time, he understood that his listlessness had been a choice, and so too could be his purpose. <411></words>  

The woman raised her goblet in a silent toast before vanishing into the night, leaving Alaric alone beneath a sky untouched by sentient eyes. <435></words>  

He stood, the plain stretching endlessly before him, and began to walk—not aimlessly, but with intention. <451></words>
