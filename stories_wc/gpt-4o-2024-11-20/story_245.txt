The irate smuggler jogged across the abandoned spaceport flight deck, his breath coming in sharp bursts as he clutched a single chopstick in his hand. <14> He had no idea why he kept the chopstick—it was useless, absurd even, but it felt like a talisman against the void. <33> The deck stretched endlessly, its cracked tiles forming abstractly physical patterns that seemed to shift with every step he took. <53> He hated this place, hated its emptiness, but he couldn’t stop running. <66> Somewhere, hidden beyond the stars, were the waterfalls he had dreamed of since childhood. <81> They weren’t just waterfalls; they were freedom, a place where his heart could finally revolt against the chains of his smuggling life. <104> 

He slowed his pace, his boots scraping against the dust-covered floor, and crouched near a rusted tea kettle someone had left behind. <126> The smuggler wasn’t sentimental, but something about the kettle called to him, as if it held secrets he needed to uncover. <147> He poured the remnants of his water bottle into it, swirled it around, and stared into the liquid. <164> The patterns in the tea leaves that floated to the surface seemed to mock him, forming shapes he couldn’t quite decipher. <185> “What do you want from me?” he muttered, his voice echoing in the cavernous space. <199> 

The chopstick in his hand felt heavier now, as though it carried the weight of his failures. <214> He thought of the people he had betrayed, the cargo he had stolen, and the lives he had ruined to survive. <233> The waterfalls weren’t just a destination; they were a promise to himself that he could be more than this. <252> But the tea leaves offered no answers, only swirling chaos that mirrored the turmoil in his chest. <268> 

He stood and began jogging again, his movements mechanical, his mind racing faster than his legs. <283> The flight deck seemed to stretch into infinity, a cruel reminder of how far he still had to go. <300> He thought of the waterfalls again, their cascading beauty, their purity, and how they might cleanse him of his sins. <320> But could someone like him ever deserve such redemption? <330> 

Suddenly, he stopped, his eyes catching a pattern in the tea leaves he had left behind. <345> It was a shape, unmistakable now—a path winding through jagged cliffs, leading to a hidden paradise. <364> His heart pounded, not from exertion but from the biting sincerity of the revelation. <379> The waterfalls were real, and they were waiting for him. <391> 

He gripped the chopstick tighter, as if it were a compass pointing the way, and began to run with renewed purpose. <410> The smuggler would memorialize this moment, not in words or monuments, but in the act of finding what he had always sought. <432> The heart’s revolt had begun, and he would follow it to the ends of the universe. <448>
