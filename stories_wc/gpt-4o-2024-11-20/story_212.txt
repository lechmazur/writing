The ethereal plains stretched endlessly, a shimmering expanse of silver grass swaying under a pale, fractured sky. <13></words>  

Here, after the last resource war, Elias toiled as an apocalyptic farmer, his hands calloused from breeding seeds that could survive the poisoned earth. <36></words>  

He was a typically atypical man, his wiry frame and sunburned skin masking a mind that thrived on peculiar ideas. <54></words>  

In his pocket, he carried a magician’s deck of trick cards, a relic from a world that had long since crumbled. <73></words>  

The cards were useless for magic now, but Elias used them to mark his experiments, each suit representing a different hybrid seed. <95></words>  

He jabbered to himself as he worked, his voice a low hum against the haunting silence of the plains. <111></words>  

The song of boundaries echoed faintly in his mind, a melody he had heard as a child, sung by his mother to warn of limits never to be crossed. <141></words>  

But Elias had always been one to test those boundaries, driven by a desperate need to escape a life dictated by another’s rules. <166></words>  

The plains were littered with messages in bottles, carried here by the sea that had long since receded, leaving behind only whispers of its tides. <194></words>  

Elias collected these bottles, their contents often cryptic—fragments of poetry, maps to nowhere, or pleas for salvation. <213></words>  

One day, he found a bottle containing a single card from a magician’s deck: the Ace of Spades, identical to those in his pocket. <239></words>  

Scrawled on the back was a message: “The song of boundaries is not a warning—it is a key.” <259></words>  

Elias felt a raw solace in those words, as if they had been written for him alone. <275></words>  

He began to experiment with the seeds in new ways, guided by the cryptic message and the rhythm of the song that now consumed his thoughts. <305></words>  

The plains seemed to respond, the silver grass growing taller, denser, as if the land itself was awakening. <323></words>  

Elias jabbered more fervently, his words spilling out like incantations, blending with the melody in his mind. <340></words>  

One night, under a fractured moon, he planted the Ace of Spades in the soil, watering it with the last of his clean water. <364></words>  

By dawn, a tree had grown, its branches heavy with fruit that shimmered like glass. <380></words>  

Elias bit into one, and the taste was unlike anything he had ever known—sweet, bitter, and electric all at once. <402></words>  

The song of boundaries swelled, and the plains began to shift, the horizon folding inward as if the world itself was reshaping. <426></words>  

Elias realized the bottles, the cards, the song—they had all been guiding him to this moment, to a door hidden within the fabric of the plains. <459></words>  

With the magician’s deck in hand, he stepped through, leaving behind the poisoned earth and the life that had never been his own. <485></words>
