The reaver sat alone on the cracked bench in Kaleidoscope Park, his armor dull and pitted, his face a mask of charmingly grotesque indifference. <17></words>  

The park shimmered with shifting colors, as if the world itself couldn’t decide what it wanted to be. <34></words>  

In his gauntleted hand, he held a child’s drawing on crumpled paper, its stick figures smiling in a way he never could. <54></words>  

The reaver had found it tucked into the folds of his cloak that morning, though he had no memory of how it got there. <74></words>  

He turned it over, noticing scrawled poems in the margins, their jagged lines nagging at him with a mocking affection. <91></words>  

“Why do you haunt me?” he muttered, his voice gravelly, as if the words themselves had to claw their way out. <108></words>  

The drawing depicted a figure reaching for a star, its tiny hand outstretched, while another figure stood behind, arms crossed. <126></words>  

The reaver’s lips twisted into a sneer, though his eyes lingered on the star, its golden crayon glow almost too bright. <144></words>  

He had once wanted to taste the stars in a single kiss, but that was before the first lie was told. <160></words>  

Before he became what he was now—a closed-off reaver, a breaker of cycles, or so he told himself. <175></words>  

The park’s colors shifted again, the trees now a kaleidoscope of blues and purples, their leaves whispering secrets he refused to hear. <194></words>  

A child ran past, laughing, and for a moment, the reaver’s grip on the drawing tightened, his knuckles whitening beneath the metal. <211></words>  

He remembered another child, long ago, who had drawn stars for him, nagging him to look up instead of down. <227></words>  

But he had ignored her, just as his father had ignored him, and so the pattern repeated, each generation folding into the next. <247></words>  

The poems in the margins seemed to mock him now, their words looping back on themselves like the park’s endless colors. <264></words>  

“Reach,” one line read, “but never touch, for stars burn brighter than your heart can bear.” <277></words>  

He crumpled the paper further, as if destroying it could erase the weight of its truth. <290></words>  

The child’s laughter echoed again, and he looked up, his grotesque face softening for just a moment. <305></words>  

Could he break the pattern? Could he teach someone to reach without fear, to taste the stars without burning? <321></words>  

The reaver stood, the drawing still in his hand, and began to walk toward the child, his steps heavy but deliberate. <338></words>  

The park’s colors shifted once more, and for the first time in years, he felt something other than the cold. <353></words>  

“Hey,” he called out, his voice softer now, though it still carried the weight of a thousand regrets. <368></words>  

The child turned, wide-eyed, and the reaver held out the crumpled drawing, his grotesque face twisting into something almost like a smile. <387></words>  

“Here,” he said, “you dropped this.” <393></words>  

The child took it, beaming, and for a moment, the reaver thought he saw a star reflected in her eyes. <409></words>  

As she ran off, he stood there, the park’s kaleidoscope colors swirling around him, and wondered if he had just told his first truth. <429></words>
