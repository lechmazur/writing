The forgotten noble sat in the corner of the spontaneous combustion lab, his fingers trembling as he reassembled old ticket stubs into a fragile mosaic. <14></words> Each stub bore the faint imprint of a life he no longer recognized—concerts, train rides, and theater shows from a time when his name still carried weight. <38></words> The artificial hummingbird drone hovered nearby, its wings emitting a faint mechanical hum that filled the hollow silence of the room. <57></words> Between text messages from a number he didn’t dare block, he worked with a hollow recklessness, piecing together fragments of his past. <80></words> The lab smelled of burnt chemicals and scorched metal, a fitting backdrop for a man trying to fortify himself against the illusions that had consumed him. <106></words>  

The drone’s presence was mysteriously obvious, as though it had been designed to be noticed but never questioned. <123></words> Its tiny camera lens glinted in the dim light, capturing every movement of his hands as he pressed the stubs into place. <143></words> He paused, staring at a faded ticket from a masquerade ball, the ink smudged but still legible: “Admit One.” <161></words> The irony wasn’t lost on him—he had spent years hiding behind masks, only to find himself uninvited to his own life. <183></words>  

A text buzzed on his phone, breaking his focus. <190></words> “Still hiding?” it read, the words cutting deeper than he cared to admit. <203></words> He didn’t reply. <206></words> Instead, he reached for another stub, this one from a train ride to a city he barely remembered, and pressed it into the growing collage. <229></words>  

The hummingbird drone tilted its head, as if curious, and emitted a soft chirp. <243></words> “What do you want from me?” he muttered, his voice cracking under the weight of his own candor. <259></words> The drone, of course, didn’t answer, but its presence felt like a demand for honesty in the smallest of moments. <280></words>  

He thought of the lab’s purpose—spontaneous combustion, the study of things that burned without warning. <297></words> It felt poetic, almost cruel, that he had ended up here, surrounded by flames he couldn’t control. <314></words> The ticket stubs were his way of fortifying himself, a desperate attempt to reassemble a version of himself that might survive the fire. <338></words>  

Another text buzzed. <342></words> “You can’t keep running.” <349></words> He stared at the words, his chest tightening. <360></words> The drone chirped again, its wings fluttering as if urging him to respond. <375></words>  

With a deep breath, he typed back, “I’m not running. I’m rebuilding.” <392></words> He hit send and placed the final ticket stub into the mosaic, a patchwork of memories that, for the first time, felt whole. <417></words> The drone hovered closer, its lens focusing on the completed collage, as if to acknowledge his small victory. <436></words>  

In the flickering light of the lab, the noble sat back, his hollow recklessness replaced by a fragile sense of purpose. <457></words> The fire within him hadn’t consumed him yet. <467></words> And maybe, just maybe, it never would. <478></words>
