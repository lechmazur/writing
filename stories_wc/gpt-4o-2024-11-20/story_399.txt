The grumpy crypt caretaker, Elias, shuffled into the witch’s crystal scrying room, his boots leaving faint imprints on the dusty floor. <13></words> He carried an unmarked cardboard tube under his arm, its contents rattling faintly with each step. <27></words> The room was dimly lit, the glow of the witch’s crystals casting shifting patterns on the walls like constellations. <42></words> Elias had never liked this place; it felt too alive, too aware, as though the room itself was watching him. <57></words> But tonight, he had no choice—he needed answers. <65></words>

The witch, a figure draped in layers of black and silver, sat cross-legged before a half-finished sand mandala. <80></words> Her hands moved with deliberate precision, tracing intricate patterns that seemed to pulse with an otherworldly rhythm. <93></words> “You’re late,” she said without looking up, her voice carrying the weight of countless secrets. <105></words> Elias grunted, setting the cardboard tube on the floor with a thud. <114></words> “I’m here, aren’t I?” he muttered, his tone as jagged as the crypt stones he tended. <127></words>

The witch finally looked up, her eyes reflecting the faint glow of the crystals. <138></words> “What troubles you, caretaker?” she asked, her voice soft but piercing. <148></words> Elias hesitated, his fingers twitching as though they wanted to jiggle the tube but thought better of it. <162></words> “There’s… something inside me,” he admitted, his voice barely above a whisper. <172></words> “It’s like a storm, a rebellion I can’t quell.” <181></words>

The witch nodded, her gaze shifting to the mandala. <188></words> “Trauma,” she said simply, her fingers resuming their work on the sand. <198></words> “It multiplies singular moments of pain, turning them into patterns that consume us.” <211></words> Elias frowned, his grumpiness giving way to a flicker of vulnerability. <221></words> “Can you help me?” he asked, his voice tinged with desperation. <231></words>

The witch gestured for him to sit, and he reluctantly obeyed, lowering himself onto the cold stone floor. <245></words> “Place the tube in the center of the mandala,” she instructed, her tone leaving no room for argument. <259></words> Elias did as he was told, the tube seeming oddly out of place amidst the intricate sand patterns. <273></words> The witch began to chant, her voice weaving through the room like a thread through fabric. <286></words>

As the chant grew louder, the crystals’ glow intensified, and the patterns in the mandala began to shift. <300></words> Elias watched, mesmerized, as the sand rearranged itself, forming shapes that mirrored the constellations outside. <314></words> The room seemed to dissolve, and he found himself stargazing, the vastness of the cosmos reflected in the witch’s eyes. <329></words> “Through these patterns, we confront what lies within,” she said, her voice echoing as though carried by the stars. <344></words>

Elias felt the storm inside him begin to calm, the uprising quelled by the mandala’s silent wisdom. <357></words> The unmarked tube, now glowing faintly, seemed to hum with a newfound energy. <368></words> “What’s in there?” he asked, his voice steadier than before. <377></words> The witch smiled, enigmatic as ever. <383></words> “Only what you’ve carried all along,” she replied, her words heavy with meaning. <396></words> Elias nodded, understanding for the first time that his pain, though multiply singular, was part of a greater pattern. <411></words> He left the room, the tube under his arm, feeling lighter than he had in years. <424></words> The stars outside seemed brighter, their light a reminder that even the darkest nights held the promise of dawn. <439></words>
