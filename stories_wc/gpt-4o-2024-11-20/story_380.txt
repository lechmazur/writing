The forgotten library inside the ancient treehouse creaked as the wind whispered through its hollowed branches. <13></13> A convicted dream thief named Elara sat cross-legged on the warped wooden floor, her fingers trembling as they traced the edges of a flimsy photo album. <36></36> The album was falling apart, its pages curling like dead leaves, but it was all she had left of the fragmented self she used to be. <66></66> 

Elara had once been infamous for stealing dreams, slipping into the minds of others to plunder their most vivid imaginings. <92></92> But now, after the last human had been born and the skies had grown silent, there were no dreams left to steal. <118></118> The world had become a hollow echo, and Elara’s own mind was a shattered mirror, each shard reflecting a different version of herself. <150></150> 

She flipped through the photo album, though the images inside were blurred and nonsensical, like memories she couldn’t quite grasp. <179></179> One photo showed her holding a trophy from a sport she could no longer name, her smile radiant but unfamiliar. <204></204> Another depicted her standing beneath a stormy sky, her arms outstretched as if coaxing thunder from the heavens. <230></230> 

The library was her sanctuary, a place where forgotten knowledge and forgotten people converged. <254></254> Books lined the walls, their spines cracked and titles faded, but Elara couldn’t read most of them—numbers and equations always danced mockingly before her eyes. <296></296> She was mathematically challenged, a flaw that had once been a minor inconvenience but now felt like a cruel joke in a world where logic had unraveled. <336></336> 

Her quiet mania grew as she stared at the photo album, desperate to piece together who she had been and who she could still become. <370></370> The memory of the sport haunted her most of all, a shared love that had once connected her to someone she could no longer remember. <404></404> She clung to the idea that if she could recall the rules, the movements, the joy of it, she might find a way to mend herself. <442></442> 

Outside, the sky was a pale, empty canvas, devoid of clouds or storms. <462></462> Elara stood abruptly, the photo album slipping from her lap and scattering its fragile pages across the floor. <492></492> With a sudden, reckless determination, she climbed to the highest branch of the treehouse and plunged into the open air. <523></523> 

As she fell, she screamed—not in fear, but in defiance, her voice a jagged bolt aimed at the heavens. <552></552> And for the first time in years, the sky answered, a low rumble of thunder rolling across the horizon. <584></584>
