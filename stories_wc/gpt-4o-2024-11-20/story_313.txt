The sun hung low over the dystopian farm, its light fractured by the jagged remnants of a once-thriving greenhouse. <12></12> In the shadow of a rusted silo, a small-time con artist named Lyle sat cross-legged, fiddling with an empty tape dispenser. <30></30> The dispenser was cracked and useless, but Lyle’s fingers moved over it as if it were a talisman. <45></45> He was unusually normal for someone in his line of work—no flashy clothes, no exaggerated charm. <61></61> His face was plain, his demeanor unremarkable, but his mind was a labyrinth of schemes. <75></75> Today, however, he wasn’t scheming; he was waiting. <83></83>

The farm had been abandoned for years, its fields overrun with weeds and its barns hollowed by time. <98></98> Lyle had chosen this place for its isolation, but also for its ghosts. <110></110> He didn’t believe in them, not really, but he had heard the stories. <122></122> And tonight, during story time—the hour when the wind whispered through the broken windows—he intended to interrogate them. <140></140> Not for answers, but for comfort. <146></146>

The first apparition appeared as a shimmer in the doorway of the farmhouse. <157></157> It was a woman, her face blurred like a smudged photograph, her hands clutching a basket of invisible fruit. <173></173> “Why are you here?” Lyle asked, his voice steady but tinged with mild fervor. <186></186> The ghost didn’t answer, but her form flickered, as if considering his question. <198></198> “I’m here to taunt the jaws of defeat and grin,” he said, leaning forward. <211></211> “What about you?” <215></215>

The ghost dissolved, leaving behind only the faint scent of apples. <226></226> Lyle sighed, turning the tape dispenser over in his hands. <237></237> It had been his father’s, a relic from a time when their family had run a small office supply store. <254></254> His father had been a con artist too, though he’d called it “entrepreneurship.” <266></266> Lyle had inherited the trade, but not the charm. <275></275>

Another ghost appeared, this one a child clutching a stuffed rabbit. <287></287> “Do you regret it?” the child asked, her voice like the rustle of dry leaves. <300></300> Lyle hesitated, the weight of the question pressing against his chest. <312></312> “Regret what?” he countered, though he knew exactly what she meant. <324></324> The child tilted her head, her eyes hollow but piercing. <334></334> “Everything,” she whispered, before vanishing into the night. <344></344>

Lyle sat in silence, the tape dispenser cold in his hands. <355></355> The lull of remorse settled over him, heavy and inescapable. <366></366> He had spent his life running from it, masking it with schemes and lies. <378></378> But here, in the stillness of the farm, there was nowhere to hide. <390></390> The ghosts had given him no answers, only questions he had long avoided. <403></403> And yet, in their silence, he found a strange kind of comfort. <415></415> For the first time, he allowed himself to feel the weight of his choices. <428></428> The tape dispenser slipped from his fingers, landing softly in the dirt. <440></440> Lyle stood, the faintest grin tugging at his lips, and walked into the night. <454></454>
