The tired swordsman sat alone in the quiet breakroom, his calloused hands resting on the plain cloth bag beside him. <14></14>  

The room was still, save for the faint hum of the floating rock monastery’s levitation engines, a sound he had grown used to over the years. <37></37>  

Someone had resigned earlier that day, their absence leaving a hollow space in the air, but he felt no urge to care. <61></61>  

He was fiercely apathetic, a man who had long since stopped pretending to feel anything for the transient lives around him. <87></87>  

Yet, as he stared at the bag, his mind wandered to the promise he had made to himself long ago, a promise no one else knew. <118></118>  

The monastery drifted high above the clouds, its jagged rocks tethered together by ancient chains, a sanctuary for those seeking enlightenment—or escape. <151></151>  

He had come here not for peace, but to hide, to bury the weight of his past beneath the endless sky. <174></174>  

But the spark of defiance within him, though faint, had never fully died. <191></191>  

It was that spark that had brought him to this moment, sitting in the breakroom, waiting for the meteor showers to begin. <218></218>  

The monks believed the meteors were messages from the heavens, guiding lost souls toward their destinies. <241></241>  

He didn’t believe in destiny, but he had learned to follow the meteors anyway, their fiery trails cutting through the night like blades. <271></271>  

The bag at his side contained everything he needed: a map, a flask of water, and a single, well-worn sword. <296></296>  

The sword was a relic of his former life, a life he had sworn to leave behind but could never truly escape. <322></322>  

He had promised himself he would overcome the shadows of his past, not by fighting them, but by outlasting them. <348></348>  

And so, he waited, his eyes fixed on the horizon where the first streaks of light would soon appear. <372></372>  

When the meteors came, he would follow them, as he always did, letting their brilliance guide him through the darkness. <398></398>  

The monks would not notice his absence; they rarely noticed anything beyond their meditations and rituals. <421></421>  

He stood, slinging the bag over his shoulder, the weight of it both familiar and strangely comforting. <445></445>  

The tired swordsman stepped out onto the monastery’s edge, the wind tugging at his cloak as the first meteor blazed across the sky. <478></478>  

For a moment, he allowed himself to feel something—hope, perhaps, or the faint echo of purpose. <499></499>  

Then, with quiet resolve, he began to walk, the spark of defiance burning brighter with every step. <516></516>
