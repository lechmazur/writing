The stoic wanderer stood at the edge of the witch's familiar training ground, his face a mask of mesmerizingly bland indifference as he surveyed the chaos within. <words>22</words> The air shimmered with the remnants of spells, and the ground was littered with feathers, scales, and the occasional claw. <words>41</words> He had followed a trail of nightmares to this place, each dream a breadcrumb leading him closer to his goal. <words>59</words> In his hand, he clutched a splintered floorboard from an abandoned cabin, its surface etched with cryptic runes. <words>75</words> The floorboard was his key, though he had yet to understand how it would unlock the secrets he sought. <words>91</words>  

The teacher, a wiry figure with eyes like dying embers, stood before a blackboard smeared with arcane symbols. <words>106</words> With a brash tenderness, she wiped the final formula away, her movements deliberate, as if erasing history itself. <words>122</words> The wanderer stepped forward, his boots crunching on the brittle remains of failed spells, and spoke in a voice that imposed silence. <words>141</words>  

"I need what you erased," he said, holding up the floorboard like a talisman. <words>152</words>  

The teacher turned, her gaze piercing through his stoic facade. <words>161</words> "And why should I give it to you?" she asked, her tone sharp but not unkind. <words>175</words>  

"To archive ritual practices," he replied, his voice steady, though his fingers tightened around the floorboard. <words>189</words> "Some truths must be preserved, even if they are hidden beneath necessary lies." <words>201</words>  

The teacher's lips curled into a faint smile, one that held both approval and pity. <words>213</words> "You think you can carry the weight of these truths?" she asked, gesturing to the training ground around them. <words>229</words>  

"I've carried worse," he said, his tone as unyielding as the floorboard in his hand. <words>241</words>  

She studied him for a moment longer, then nodded. <words>249</words> "Very well," she said, turning to a cage where a raven with eyes like polished obsidian perched. <words>265</words> "But first, you must prove yourself." <words>273</words>  

The raven cawed, its voice a jagged shard of sound, and the ground beneath the wanderer's feet began to shift. <words>288</words> Shadows coiled around him, forming a labyrinth of nightmares that pulsed with malevolent intent. <words>302</words>  

He moved forward, his steps deliberate, the floorboard held like a compass guiding him through the dark. <words>316</words> Each nightmare he faced was a fragment of the lies he had told himself, each one demanding he confront his own truths. <words>334</words>  

When he emerged, the raven was waiting, its head cocked as if in approval. <words>345</words> The teacher handed him a small, leather-bound book, its pages blank but humming with potential. <words>360</words>  

"Write your truths," she said, her voice softer now. <words>368</words> "But remember, even the most necessary lies can become cages if you let them." <words>382</words>  

The wanderer nodded, tucking the book and the floorboard into his pack. <words>393</words> As he turned to leave, the raven took flight, its shadow passing over him like a benediction. <words>408</words>  

He walked away from the training ground, his steps lighter but his burden heavier, knowing the archive he sought would demand more than he had yet given. <words>429</words>  

The trail of nightmares stretched ahead, and he followed it without hesitation, his stoic resolve unbroken. <words>443</words>
