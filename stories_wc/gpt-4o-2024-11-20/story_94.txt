The sky reflection pool shimmered like liquid glass, its surface rippling with the faintest breeze, as Celeste adjusted her amber earrings, their golden hue catching the fractured light. <14></words>  

She was a heartbreak counselor, but not the kind who offered tissues and tea—her specialty was untangling the gravity of desires that bound people to their illusions. <37></words>  

Her restlessly curious nature had led her here, to this strange era after the invention of time travel, where emotions were as malleable as timelines. <57></words>  

The pool was her map, a tool for tracking cloud trails that revealed the emotional imprints of those who sought her help. <75></words>  

Today, her client was a man named Elias, whose cage of illusions had grown so intricate that he could no longer distinguish freedom from captivity. <96></words>  

He stood at the edge of the pool, his reflection fractured and distorted, his hands trembling as he zipped up his leather jacket against the chill. <118></words>  

“I don’t know why I’m here,” Elias admitted, his voice low, as if afraid the pool might overhear. <132></words>  

“You’re here because you want to be free,” Celeste replied, her tone a careful balance of caution and impulsiveness, like a tightrope walker daring the wind. <155></words>  

Elias glanced at her amber earrings, their glow almost hypnotic, and asked, “What do those mean to you?” <169></words>  

“They remind me that even the smallest desires can anchor us—or set us adrift,” she said, kneeling by the pool and gesturing for him to join her. <192></words>  

He hesitated, then crouched beside her, his reflection merging with hers in the shimmering surface. <205></words>  

“Look,” she instructed, tracing a finger through the water, disrupting the clouds mirrored within. <217></words>  

The trails shifted, revealing a kaleidoscope of memories—his first love, his greatest regret, the moment he chose ambition over connection. <236></words>  

“These are the desires that hold you,” Celeste explained, her voice soft but firm. <247></words>  

Elias stared, his restlessness growing as he recognized the patterns, the choices that had led him here. <261></words>  

“How do I escape?” he asked, desperation creeping into his tone. <272></words>  

“You don’t escape,” she said, removing one of her earrings and holding it out to him. <285></words>  

“You proclaim yourself free, even within the cage.” <293></words>  

He took the earring, its warmth surprising, and felt a strange clarity wash over him. <306></words>  

The pool’s surface stilled, the cloud trails fading, leaving only their reflections. <318></words>  

“Freedom isn’t about breaking the cage,” Celeste continued, standing and offering him her hand. <332></words>  

“It’s about realizing the cage was never real.” <341></words>  

Elias rose, the earring clutched tightly in his palm, and for the first time, he felt weightless. <355></words>  

As they walked away from the pool, the sky above seemed brighter, the clouds less heavy, their trails dissolving into the horizon. <374></words>  

Celeste glanced back once, her curiosity momentarily sated, before vanishing into the shimmering light, leaving Elias to chart his own path. <394></words>  

The amber earring glinted in his hand, a reminder that even the heaviest desires could be transformed into something luminous. <410></words>
