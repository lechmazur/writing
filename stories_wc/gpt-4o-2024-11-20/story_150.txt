The outlaw cowboy poet, known only as Calder, leaned against the brass railing of the steampunk observatory dome, his fingers absently rolling a pair of worn runic bone dice. <14></words> The dice, etched with symbols that seemed to shift under the flickering gaslight, were as peculiar as Calder himself—virtually peculiar, some might say. <33></words> He had come here not for the stars, but for the walls of the coffee shop below, which were infamous for their ever-changing text. <53></words> Calder had heard whispers that the walls held secrets, messages that could misalign the fates of those who dared to read them. <73></words> And Calder, with his saturated ambivalence toward destiny, was precisely the kind of man to take that risk. <88></words>  

The observatory dome was alive with the hum of gears and the hiss of steam, its mechanical heart beating in time with the city below. <108></words> Calder’s boots clicked against the iron floor as he descended the spiral staircase, the dice clutched tightly in his hand. <125></words> He had spent weeks rehearsing his plan, though he wasn’t entirely sure what he was rehearsing for—only that the dice had led him here. <146></words>  

The coffee shop was dimly lit, its walls a patchwork of brass panels and dark wood, the air thick with the scent of roasted beans and oil. <167></words> Calder ordered a black coffee and took a seat near the back, where the walls seemed to shimmer with faint, shifting words. <186></words> He sipped his drink, his eyes scanning the text as it morphed and twisted, forming phrases that felt both cryptic and deeply personal. <206></words>  

“Your destiny is not your own,” one line read, before dissolving into a swirl of letters. <217></words> Another appeared: “To spark unstoppable curiosity, you must first misalign the stars.” <233></words> Calder frowned, the dice in his hand growing warm, as if responding to the words. <246></words>  

He rolled the dice onto the table, their runes glowing faintly as they landed. <257></words> The symbols aligned in a pattern he had never seen before, one that seemed to echo the shifting text on the walls. <275></words> The room tilted, or perhaps it was his perception, as the walls began to pulse with light, the words now forming a coherent sentence: <296></words>  

“Your fate is intertwined with hers.” <303></words>  

Before Calder could question the meaning, the door to the coffee shop swung open, and a woman stepped inside. <318></words> She was dressed in a patchwork coat of leather and brass, her eyes sharp and curious, her presence virtually peculiar. <336></words> She glanced at Calder, then at the dice on the table, her expression shifting from confusion to recognition. <353></words>  

“You’ve been reading the walls,” she said, her voice low but steady. <364></words>  

Calder nodded, his ambivalence giving way to a spark of something he couldn’t quite name. <377></words>  

“So have I,” she said, pulling a similar pair of runic dice from her pocket. <390></words>  

The observatory dome above groaned, its gears grinding as if in response to their meeting. <403></words> Calder realized, with a clarity that felt both exhilarating and terrifying, that their destinies had indeed been intertwined all along. <423></words>  

And for the first time in years, he felt truly curious about what came next. <437></words>
