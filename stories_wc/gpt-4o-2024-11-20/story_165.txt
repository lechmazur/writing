At the break of a brittle branch in a silent forest, the gentle conjurer, Elowen, felt the first tremor of the underground city of the dwarves beneath her feet. <22></22> She clutched the stained glass butterfly in her hand, its fractured wings catching the faint light of dawn. <39></39> The butterfly was all that remained of the forgotten garden she sought to rebuild, a place of beauty lost to time and greed. <61></61> Justice, she thought, was not just for people but for the land itself, for the dreams buried beneath stone and shadow. <81></81>  

The entrance to the dwarves' city was hidden beneath a gnarled oak, its roots twisting like ancient fingers over a trapdoor. <101></101> Elowen whispered an incantation, her voice soft yet commanding, and the door creaked open, revealing a staircase spiraling into darkness. <122></122> She descended, her heart pounding with joyful terror, the kind that comes when one stands on the edge of the unknown. <141></141>  

The city was a marvel of craftsmanship, its walls carved with inscrutably obvious runes that seemed to shift and shimmer as she passed. <162></162> The dwarves, wary of outsiders, watched her with eyes like polished obsidian, their expressions unreadable yet curious. <181></181> "I come seeking justice," Elowen declared, holding up the shattered butterfly. <193></193> "Not for myself, but for the garden your ancestors destroyed to build this city." <207></207>  

A murmur rippled through the crowd, and an elder stepped forward, his beard braided with silver threads. <221></221> "Justice," he said, his voice a deep rumble, "is a heavy word. What do you offer in return?" <236></236>  

Elowen smiled, her joy tinged with the terror of her task. <245></245> "I will reassemble the garden," she said, "but I need your help to reverse the messages carved into these walls." <263></263> The elder's eyes narrowed, but he nodded, gesturing for her to follow. <275></275>  

They led her to a vast chamber where the runes glowed faintly, their meanings obscured by centuries of misinterpretation. <294></294> Elowen traced her fingers over the symbols, her magic unraveling their secrets one by one. <308></308> Each rune, when reversed, revealed a fragment of the garden's design: a fountain here, a grove of silver trees there. <328></328>  

As the dwarves worked alongside her, their initial skepticism melted into awe. <339></339> Together, they reassembled the garden, piece by piece, using the stained glass butterfly as their guide. <354></354> The butterfly's colors began to glow brighter with each step, as if the garden's spirit was returning. <370></370>  

When the final rune was reversed, the chamber trembled, and the garden bloomed anew, its beauty filling the underground city with light and life. <391></391> The dwarves wept, their joy mingling with the terror of realizing what they had lostâ€”and now regained. <407></407>  

Elowen stood in the center, the butterfly whole once more, its wings a testament to justice achieved through unity and understanding. <426></426> The forgotten garden was no longer forgotten, and the gentle conjurer's mission was complete. <440></440>  

As she ascended back to the forest, the brittle branch snapped again, this time under her foot, but the sound was no longer lonely. <460></460> The garden's memory would live on, a beacon of hope in a world that often forgot its roots. <475></475>
