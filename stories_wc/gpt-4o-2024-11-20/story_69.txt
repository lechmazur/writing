The uncertain druid shuffled into the hologram repair shop, his dented lunch tin clutched tightly in one hand. <14></14>  

The shop hummed with a lethargic excitement, its walls flickering with half-repaired projections of forgotten worlds. <31></31>  

He had wandered here after another fruitless morning spent drifting through back-alley theater auditions. <47></47>  

The auditions were his peculiar method of searching for meaning, though he rarely knew what he was looking for. <65></65>  

His druidic robes, uniquely common in their patchwork simplicity, marked him as both out of place and oddly fitting. <83></83>  

The shopkeeper, a wiry woman with holographic tattoos that shifted across her arms, glanced up from her work. <100></100>  

“Need something fixed?” she asked, her tone as tired as the flickering holograms around her. <113></113>  

The druid hesitated, his fingers brushing the dented surface of the tin. <123></123>  

“I’m not sure,” he admitted, his voice carrying the weight of someone bound by ties of obligation he couldn’t name. <141></141>  

The shopkeeper raised an eyebrow but said nothing, gesturing for him to continue. <153></153>  

“I’ve been wandering,” he said, his gaze drifting to a hologram of a forest that shimmered on the wall. <169></169>  

“Through auditions, through libraries, through places like this—trying to forge beauty from anarchy.” <183></183>  

The shopkeeper leaned back, her chair creaking. <189></189>  

“And how’s that going for you?” she asked, her tone dry but not unkind. <201></201>  

He opened the lunch tin, revealing a collection of small, broken objects: a cracked compass, a faded photograph, a chipped crystal. <220></220>  

“These are all I’ve found,” he said, his voice tinged with both hope and despair. <232></232>  

The shopkeeper studied the items, her fingers tracing the edges of the photograph. <243></243>  

“Looks like you’re trying to fix the world with scraps,” she said, a faint smile tugging at her lips. <258></258>  

“Maybe,” he replied, his uncertainty deepening. <264></264>  

“But isn’t that what we all do?” she asked, gesturing to the holograms around them. <276></276>  

“Patch things together, make them work, even if they’re never quite whole?” <288></288>  

The druid considered her words, his fingers tightening around the tin. <298></298>  

“Maybe that’s enough,” he said finally, his voice soft but resolute. <309></309>  

The shopkeeper nodded, her holographic tattoos shifting into a pattern that resembled a blooming flower. <324></324>  

“Sometimes, it’s all we can do,” she said, returning to her work. <336></336>  

The druid lingered a moment longer, then turned to leave, the lunch tin feeling lighter in his hands. <351></351>  

As he stepped back into the streets, the holograms behind him flickered, their fractured beauty a quiet reminder of his purpose. <370></370>  

He wandered on, uncertain but determined, the ties of obligation pulling him toward something he couldn’t yet name. <386></386>  

And though the path ahead was unclear, he felt, for the first time, that he might be moving in the right direction. <402></402>
