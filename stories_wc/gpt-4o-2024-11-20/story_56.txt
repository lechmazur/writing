The toppled skyscraper groaned faintly in the wind, its hollowed-out shell now home to an orchard that thrived against all odds. <words>17</words>  

Among the gnarled apple trees, a man named Callum leaned against a rusted beam, his energy both boundless and drained. <words>34</words>  

Callum was a swindler, a master of bluffing, but today he wasn’t here to con anyone—at least, not directly. <words>49</words>  

In his hand, he toyed with a blank price tag, its emptiness a symbol of the truth he sought to reveal. <words>65</words>  

The orchard was quiet, save for the occasional creak of the skyscraper’s skeleton and the rustle of leaves. <words>77</words>  

Callum’s invisible allies, unseen but ever-present, whispered encouragement in his mind, urging him to take the next step. <words>92</words>  

He had always relied on them, these intangible forces that seemed to guide his hand when his schemes faltered. <words>107</words>  

But today, their whispers carried a different tone—gentle, yet harsh, as if they knew the weight of his task. <words>122</words>  

Nearby, a woman named Elara crouched to pick up a book she had dropped, its pages fluttering like trapped wings. <words>137</words>  

The book had slipped from her grasp when her computer, frozen for hours, finally restarted with a triumphant chime. <words>152</words>  

Callum noticed her and, in a rare moment of genuine curiosity, approached, the blank price tag still in his hand. <words>167</words>  

“Trouble with technology?” he asked, his voice carrying the practiced charm of someone used to disarming strangers. <words>180</words>  

Elara looked up, her eyes sharp but weary, as if she had been magnetized to this strange man against her will. <words>195</words>  

“More like trouble with timing,” she replied, brushing dirt from the book’s cover. <words>205</words>  

Callum’s gaze flicked to the book, its title obscured by her fingers, and then back to her face. <words>218</words>  

“Funny thing about timing,” he said, holding up the blank price tag. “Sometimes it’s the only thing that matters.” <words>233</words>  

Elara frowned, sensing layers beneath his words, and stood, the book clutched tightly to her chest. <words>246</words>  

“What’s that supposed to mean?” she asked, her tone cautious but intrigued. <words>256</words>  

Callum hesitated, the whispers of his invisible allies growing louder, urging him to bare the truth he had long avoided. <words>271</words>  

“This orchard,” he began, gesturing to the trees around them, “it’s not just a place. It’s a lie we’ve all agreed to live with.” <words>289</words>  

Elara’s eyes narrowed, her grip on the book tightening. “What are you talking about?” <words>300</words>  

Callum sighed, his lethargy momentarily overtaken by a surge of energy. “The price tag is blank because no one dares to name its cost.” <words>316</words>  

He stepped closer, his voice dropping. “This orchard exists because of sacrifices no one wants to acknowledge. I’m here to change that.” <words>333</words>  

Elara studied him, her skepticism warring with a flicker of understanding. “And you think I can help you?” <words>345</words>  

“I think you already have,” Callum said, nodding toward the book in her hands. <words>355</words>  

She glanced down, finally revealing the title: *The Weight of Forgotten Truths.* <words>365</words>  

The whispers in Callum’s mind fell silent, as if waiting for her response. <words>375</words>  

Elara exhaled slowly, the gentle harshness of his words settling over her like a challenge. <words>387</words>  

“Alright,” she said, her voice steady. “Let’s see if we can handle the truth together.” <words>400</words>
