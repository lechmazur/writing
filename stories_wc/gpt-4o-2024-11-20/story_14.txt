The tidal power monitoring station stood at the edge of the world, where the ocean’s pulse dictated life. <13></13>  

Inside, during candlelit dinners, a naive gambler named Felix sat across from an unhinged professor named Dr. Lark. <30></30>  

Felix had come here chasing whispers of unspoken bargains, the kind that promised salvation at a cost. <45></45>  

Dr. Lark, rarely predictable, had agreed to meet him only after Felix docked his small boat at midnight. <60></60>  

The station’s walls groaned with the weight of the tides, and the air smelled of salt and melted wax. <75></75>  

Between them sat a rustic candle mold, its edges worn smooth by years of use and secrets. <89></89>  

Felix’s hands trembled as he reached for the mold, his voice cracking, “This is the key, isn’t it?” <103></103>  

Dr. Lark laughed, a sound both joyous and broken, as if the universe’s absurdity had finally won. <117></117>  

“You think bargains are made with words?” she asked, lighting a candle with a flick of her wrist. <131></131>  

Felix blinked, the flame’s glow dancing in his wide eyes. “Then how? How do I capture one last spark?” <147></147>  

Dr. Lark leaned forward, her face half-lit, half-shadowed. “Through action, Felix. Through rebellion against the void.” <162></162>  

Her midnight lectures had drawn him here, tales of defying oblivion with reckless, beautiful defiance. <175></175>  

But now, faced with her intensity, Felix felt the weight of his naivety pressing down like the tides. <190></190>  

“What do I have to do?” he whispered, his voice barely audible over the station’s rhythmic creaks. <204></204>  

Dr. Lark gestured to the candle mold. “Pour your intentions into it. Shape your gamble. Light it.” <218></218>  

Felix hesitated, then pulled a small vial from his pocket—a keepsake of his last lucky night at the tables. <234></234>  

He poured its contents—golden dust—into the mold, his heart pounding with a mix of hope and dread. <248></248>  

Dr. Lark watched, her eyes gleaming. “Now light it, and let the tides decide if you’re worthy.” <261></261>  

The flame sputtered to life, casting flickering shadows that seemed to dance with mocking laughter. <275></275>  

Felix stared into the flame, tears streaming down his face, unsure if they were from joy or despair. <289></289>  

The station shuddered as a wave crashed against it, and the candle’s light flared impossibly bright. <303></303>  

For a moment, Felix felt infinite—every gamble, every loss, every unspoken bargain laid bare before him. <318></318>  

Then the light dimmed, leaving only the sound of the tides and Dr. Lark’s soft, knowing laughter. <332></332>  

Felix slumped back, the weight of the moment crushing him. “Did I win?” he asked, voice trembling. <346></346>  

Dr. Lark stood, her silhouette framed by the candle’s dying glow. “You’ll know when the tide turns.” <360></360>  

As she walked away, Felix stared at the mold, now empty, and laughed through his tears. <373></373>  

The gamble was never about winning—it was about daring to play before the darkness claimed everything. <388></388>  

Outside, the ocean roared, and the station stood firm, a fragile beacon against the inevitable. <401></401>
