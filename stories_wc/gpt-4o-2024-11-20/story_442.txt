The giant mushroom house creaked under the weight of time, its spongy walls glowing faintly in the dim light of the final rotation of the forgotten windmill outside. <12></12>  

Inside, an edgy tradesman named Riven sat cross-legged on the floor, his calloused hands clutching the torn corner of a flyer. <27></27>  

The flyer’s faded text promised salvation, but Riven couldn’t remember where he had found it or why it mattered so much. <42></42>  

The air smelled of damp earth and decay, a comfortingly pessimistic reminder that nothing lasted forever. <55></55>  

Riven’s watch beeped softly, synchronized with another somewhere far beyond the mushroom’s walls, though he didn’t know whose. <70></70>  

He muttered to himself, his voice low and gravelly, “Memories are just lies we tell ourselves to make sense of the void.” <84></84>  

The void—he could feel it pressing against the edges of his mind, vast and endless, waiting to swallow him whole. <98></98>  

But he had a purpose, however fragmented: to carry a flickering candle through that void, though he didn’t know why. <112></112>  

The candle sat on the floor beside him, its flame trembling as if it, too, feared the emptiness beyond. <125></125>  

Riven traced the jagged edge of the flyer, trying to vectorize its meaning in his mind, to turn its chaos into clarity. <140></140>  

The words on the paper shifted, distorted by his failing memory, until they became nothing more than smudges of ink. <154></154>  

He stood abruptly, his boots sinking slightly into the mushroom’s spongy floor, and tucked the flyer into his pocket. <168></168>  

The windmill’s final rotation groaned outside, its forgotten blades casting warped shadows through the round windows. <181></181>  

Riven adjusted his watch, its synchronized ticking a small comfort in the blurry vividness of his surroundings. <194></194>  

He picked up the candle, shielding its fragile flame with his hand, and stepped toward the door carved into the mushroom’s stalk. <209></209>  

The void awaited him beyond, a swirling expanse of nothingness that seemed to hum with a soundless vibration. <222></222>  

As he opened the door, the windmill’s last creak echoed behind him, a farewell from a world that no longer remembered itself. <237></237>  

Riven hesitated, the flyer’s torn corner poking out of his pocket like a jagged tooth, a reminder of something he couldn’t grasp. <252></252>  

He whispered to the candle, “You and I, we’ll make it through. Or we won’t. Either way, it doesn’t matter.” <265></265>  

The void surged forward, its darkness licking at his boots, but the candle’s flame held steady, defiant against the nothingness. <279></279>  

Riven stepped into the void, his watch ticking in perfect harmony with another he would never see, guiding him forward. <293></293>  

The mushroom house disappeared behind him, swallowed by the void, leaving only the faint memory of its glowing walls. <306></306>  

Each step felt heavier, as if the void itself sought to pull him down, but the synchronized ticking urged him onward. <320></320>  

The flyer in his pocket seemed to grow heavier, its torn edge digging into his side, a weight he couldn’t explain. <334></334>  

He pulled it out, staring at the distorted text, and for a moment, he thought he saw a map, a path through the void. <349></349>  

But the image dissolved, leaving only smudges, and he laughed bitterly, the sound swallowed instantly by the endless dark. <363></363>  

Still, he walked, the candle’s flicker casting faint, blurry shapes in the void, memories of places he might have known. <377></377>  

The synchronized watches ticked on, their rhythm a heartbeat in the silence, as Riven carried the flame into the unknown. <391></391>  

He didn’t know if he would find an end, or if the void would consume him, but he kept walking, the candle trembling in his hand. <407></407>  

And somewhere, far away, the forgotten windmill stopped, its final rotation complete, as the void closed in behind him. <421></421>
