The dismayed minstrel sat alone in the black velvet sky-lounge, his lute resting against the glass wall that overlooked the endless city below. <17></17>  

The lounge floated above the sprawling metropolis like a forgotten star, its dim lights flickering against the void of the night. <37></37>  

In his hand, he held a broken watch band, its leather frayed and clasp bent, a relic of time lost and irretrievable. <56></56>  

He sighed, his subjectively rational mind telling him that the watch band was useless, yet his heart clung to it as if it held the key to his purpose. <82></82>  

The minstrel’s purpose, after all, was to draw a map of an endless night, a task as absurd as it was necessary. <101></101>  

He had been hired by a shadowy patron who spoke in riddles and left behind only a box of old polaroid photographs. <121></121>  

The photographs were faded, their edges curling, but they revealed fragments of a garden hidden somewhere in the city below. <141></141>  

Each image was a puzzle piece, a secret buried amid the chaos of the endless city, waiting to be excavated. <159></159>  

The minstrel spread the photographs across the table, their glossy surfaces reflecting the dim light of the lounge. <177></177>  

He studied them with a laconic exuberance, his fingers tracing the drawn boundaries of flower beds, stone paths, and shadowed alcoves. <200></200>  

The garden seemed to shift in each photograph, as if it were alive, its secrets guarded by the night itself. <217></217>  

The minstrel’s mind wandered to the broken watch band, a symbol of time’s fragility, and he wondered if the garden existed outside of time altogether. <243></243>  

He picked up his lute and strummed a single, mournful chord, the sound reverberating through the lounge like a question unanswered. <265></265>  

The endless city below seemed to respond, its lights flickering in patterns that mirrored the constellations above. <283></283>  

The minstrel realized that the city and the sky were one, their boundaries drawn not by walls but by perception. <302></302>  

He returned to the photographs, his eyes narrowing as he noticed a detail he had missed before—a faint inscription on the edge of one image. <326></326>  

The words read, “To find the garden, you must first lose yourself,” a cryptic clue that both dismayed and intrigued him. <348></348>  

He knew he would have to descend into the city, to excavate its secrets by following the trail left by the photographs. <368></368>  

The broken watch band, now a talisman of his journey, was strapped to his wrist with a makeshift knot. <385></385>  

As he prepared to leave the sky-lounge, the minstrel glanced once more at the endless city, its lights stretching into infinity. <406></406>  

He felt the weight of the night pressing down on him, but also the thrill of discovery, the promise of a map yet to be drawn. <428></428>  

With a final strum of his lute, he stepped into the elevator, ready to lose himself in the labyrinth below. <446></446>  

The garden’s secrets awaited, and the minstrel, dismayed yet determined, would find them amid the endless night. <464></464>
