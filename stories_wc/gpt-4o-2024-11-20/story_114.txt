The shared dream recording studio hummed faintly, its walls lined with mismatched empty frames that seemed to absorb the dim light. <11></words> The apathetic summoner, a man whose enthusiasm for life was as fleeting as a ripple in a still pond, sat cross-legged on the floor. <33></words> In his hands rested a rustic coffee grinder, its wooden surface worn smooth by years of use, though it had never ground a single bean in his possession. <61></words> He turned the handle lazily, not to grind coffee but to feel the rhythm of its motion, a task that suited his enthusiastically lazy nature. <89></words>  

The air in the studio was thick with the echoes of dreams, fragments of lives and stories that had been recorded here long before the last breath of the dying god. <122></words> That god’s final exhalation had scattered its essence across the world, leaving behind a strange wisdom that flowed like a river through the minds of those who dared to listen. <157></words> The summoner, however, had no interest in divine wisdom; he was here for something far more tangible. <179></words>  

He stood, the coffee grinder still in hand, and approached the nearest empty frame. <196></words> With a flick of his wrist, he unfolded a shimmering thread of light from the grinder, feeding it into the frame. <220></words> The frame flickered, revealing a vision of coral reefs, vibrant and alive, swaying gently in an unseen current. <243></words>  

The summoner sighed, his apathy momentarily pierced by a sharp pang of longing. <259></words> The reefs had been his home once, a place of beauty and balance, before they had been destroyed by the god’s death throes. <287></words> He had no great passion for the task ahead, but the memory of the reefs compelled him to act. <311></words>  

Through the matching empty frames, he began to weave a tapestry of dreams, each one a fragment of the river wisdom that now flowed through the world. <344></words> The dreams unfolded like petals, revealing secrets of restoration, of life reborn from ruin. <366></words> Each frame became a window into a possible future, a guide for rebuilding the coral reefs that had been lost. <392></words>  

The summoner worked with a gentle sharpness, his movements deliberate yet unhurried. <408></words> He was not driven by urgency but by the quiet understanding that some things could only be achieved through patience. <436></words> As the last frame filled with light, the studio seemed to exhale, the dreams within it settling into a harmonious stillness. <467></words>  

The summoner placed the coffee grinder on the floor and sat back, his task complete. <485></words> The coral reefs would rise again, not through his passion but through his quiet persistence, a testament to the wisdom of the river and the resilience of life. <514></words>
