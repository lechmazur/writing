The understudy sorcerer, a wiry young man named Elric, stood in the salt crystal growing chamber, his robes dusted with fine white powder. <13></13> He had been tasked with monitoring the chamber amid laundry cycles, a duty he found both tedious and oddly fascinating. <31></31> The chamber hummed with a faint, otherworldly resonance, as if the crystals themselves were whispering secrets too ancient to comprehend. <54></54>  

Elric’s obnoxiously polite demeanor often grated on his peers, but he wielded it like a shield, deflecting criticism with syrupy sweetness. <78></78> Today, however, his focus was elsewhere—on the small cardboard box tucked under his arm. <93></93> The box, unassuming and plain, contained a relic he had stumbled upon in the archives: a shard of bark from an ancient oak grove. <118></118>  

The shard was said to carry the whispers of the grove, a chorus of voices that could wake the unheard—spirits, memories, and truths buried by time. <144></144> Elric’s true motivation, however, was not spiritual enlightenment but a peculiar obsession with tracking cultural evolution through forgotten voices. <171></171>  

He placed the box on a crystalline pedestal, its surface shimmering like frozen starlight, and carefully opened the lid. <193></193> The shard inside seemed to pulse faintly, as if alive, and Elric leaned in, his ears straining to catch the whispers. <216></216>  

The voices were faint at first, a murmur of overlapping tones, but they grew clearer as he focused. <234></234> They spoke of rituals long abandoned, of songs sung to the moon, and of warnings etched into the bark of trees. <257></257> Elric scribbled notes furiously, his quill scratching against parchment, until a particular phrase made him pause. <278></278>  

“Beware the salt,” the voices intoned, their tone shifting from melodic to menacing. <292></292> Elric’s heart skipped a beat, but he forced a smile, his politeness reflexively kicking in even though no one was present. <316></316>  

“Thank you for the warning,” he said aloud, his voice trembling slightly. <330></330> He had no intention of stopping, of course; his curiosity was far too insatiable. <346></346> But as he continued to listen, he realized the whispers were no longer confined to the shard. <364></364>  

The salt crystals around him began to vibrate, their hum deepening into a guttural growl. <379></379> The chamber itself seemed to awaken, its walls shimmering with an eerie, pulsating light. <395></395>  

Elric tried to hinder the growing chaos by eavesdropping more intently, hoping to decipher a way to calm the grove’s wrath. <419></419> But the voices only grew louder, their warnings now a cacophony that drowned out his thoughts. <437></437>  

The laundry cycle’s timer dinged in the distance, a mundane sound that felt absurdly out of place amid the escalating dread. <461></461> Clutching the box, Elric bolted from the chamber, his notes fluttering to the floor like forgotten leaves. <482></482>  

Behind him, the salt crystals began to crack, their whispers rising into a scream that promised the unheard would not remain silent for long. <500></500>
