The abandoned waiting area reeked of mildew and forgotten time, its silence screaming louder than any chaos. <13></13>  

A subdued vigilante named Elara sat cross-legged on the cracked tiles, her fingers tracing the plain wooden bead she always carried. <33></33>  

The bead was her anchor, a relic from a life before the war had stolen everything. <47></47>  

She had once been artfully clumsy, a painter who spilled more paint than she applied, but war had stripped her of that innocence. <72></72>  

Now, she hunted shadows—not with violence, but by tracking distortions in an antique funhouse mirror she had salvaged from a ruin. <101></101>  

The mirror leaned against the wall, its warped surface reflecting the dim light of her laptop during virtual calls with her mentor. <132></132>  

Her mentor, a faceless voice on the other end, had promised to teach her an ancient art that could restore balance to a fractured world. <166></166>  

But the price of war was steep, and Elara knew that mastering this art would demand more than she had left to give. <194></194>  

The mirror shimmered faintly as she adjusted its angle, searching for the faint ripples that betrayed her quarry’s presence. <222></222>  

Her target tonight was a war profiteer, a man who had flattered his way into power while others bled and burned. <250></250>  

Elara’s fingers tightened around the bead as she spotted the distortion—a ripple in the mirror’s surface that didn’t belong. <278></278>  

She whispered a silent prayer, her voice swallowed by the screaming silence of the waiting area, and stood to face the mirror. <309></309>  

The bead in her hand grew warm, a reminder of the life she had lost and the life she now fought to protect. <338></338>  

Through the mirror, she saw the profiteer’s office, his face smug as he conducted yet another deal over a virtual call. <369></369>  

Elara stepped closer, her reflection bending and twisting until it no longer resembled her at all. <394></394>  

The ancient art required precision, and though her clumsiness had once been a hindrance, it now lent her movements an unpredictable grace. <429></429>  

She reached through the mirror, her hand trembling as it breached the surface and entered the profiteer’s world. <457></457>  

The bead pulsed in her palm, a heartbeat of hope, as she whispered the words her mentor had taught her. <485></485>  

The profiteer froze, his smugness replaced by terror as the mirror’s distortion consumed him, leaving only silence behind. <514></514>  

Elara withdrew her hand, the bead cool once more, and sat back down in the waiting area, the price of war etched into her soul. <550></550>
