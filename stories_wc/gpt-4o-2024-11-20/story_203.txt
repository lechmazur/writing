The exorcist’s hands trembled as he held the pressed wildflowers, their brittle petals whispering secrets of a life he never lived. <14></14>  

He was never usual, not in the way he spoke, not in the way he moved, and certainly not in the way he feared the stage more than the spirits he banished. <38></38>  

The orbital debris outside the station’s viewport glinted like shattered promises, a graveyard of forgotten ambitions circling the Earth. <57></57>  

Amid the scattered parts of a toy he was assembling for a child he’d never meet, he felt the weight of the inheritance of lies pressing on his chest. <84></84>  

The flowers had arrived in a sealed envelope, accompanied by a letter written in his father’s hand—a man he’d buried years ago. <105></105>  

“Submerge yourself in the truth,” the letter read, “but know it will come by the sound of a key turning in a lock.” <126></126>  

He had always known his father to be a liar, a man who sculpted possibility from the ashes of “never,” but this felt different. <148></148>  

The station’s artificial gravity hummed softly, a defiant hush against the chaos of the void outside, as he pieced together the toy’s final component. <171></171>  

The child’s laughter echoed in his mind, though he had never heard it; it was a phantom sound, a hope he clung to despite the lies. <194></194>  

He placed the finished toy—a small, mechanical bird—on the table and stared at the flowers again, their colors faded but their meaning sharp. <217></217>  

The key was in his pocket, cold and unfamiliar, though he had carried it for years without knowing its purpose. <236></236>  

He stood, his legs unsteady, and moved toward the station’s storage bay, where an old, locked chest waited—a relic from his father’s time. <261></261>  

The lock clicked open, the sound reverberating through the silent chamber like a gunshot, and he hesitated before lifting the lid. <283></283>  

Inside, he found a journal, its pages filled with diagrams of orbital stations, notes on exorcisms, and sketches of wildflowers. <305></305>  

The truth unraveled slowly: his father had been an exorcist too, but one who had used his craft to hide secrets rather than reveal them. <329></329>  

The lies were not just his inheritance; they were his legacy, a burden he had unknowingly carried into the stars. <348></348>  

He closed the journal, his stage fright momentarily forgotten, and whispered to the void, “I will not be like you.” <368></368>  

The toy bird chirped softly, its mechanical wings fluttering, as if to affirm his vow. <383></383>  

He gathered the pressed wildflowers, the journal, and the toy, and returned to the viewport, where the debris shimmered with possibility. <408></408>  

The lies had shaped him, but they would not define him; he would sculpt his own truth from the ashes of “never.” <428></428>  

And as the station drifted through the endless night, he felt, for the first time, the weight of his fear begin to lift. <448></448>
