The calligraphy master's courtyard was silent, save for the faint rustle of leaves stirred by a hesitant breeze. <11></11>  

An arrogant swordsman stood at its center, his hand resting on the hilt of his blade, his posture exuding a confidence that felt more like a mask than a truth. <34></34>  

In his other hand, he clutched a faded tapestry fragment, its edges frayed and its colors dulled by time. <53></53>  

The fragment bore the image of a phoenix, wings outstretched, though the details were nearly lost to decay. <72></72>  

He had come here not for calligraphy, but for something far more elusive: the spark to reignite a world that had grown cold. <96></96>  

The courtyard, with its meticulously raked gravel and ink-stained stones, seemed an odd place for such a quest. <116></116>  

Yet, the swordsman had been told that the master could authorize his journey, though the price would not be paid in coin. <138></138>  

The master emerged, his robes flowing like ink spilled across parchment, his gaze sharp enough to carve through the swordsman’s bravado. <164></164>  

"You carry doubt beneath your arrogance," the master said, his voice a blend of harsh tenderness. <181></181>  

The swordsman stiffened, his grip tightening on the tapestry fragment. <193></193>  

"I carry purpose," he replied, though the words rang hollow even to his own ears. <208></208>  

The master gestured for him to sit, and between breaths, the swordsman obeyed, lowering himself onto the cool stone. <229></229>  

"Show me," the master said, nodding toward the fragment. <239></239>  

Reluctantly, the swordsman unfolded it, revealing the faded phoenix in full. <252></252>  

"This belonged to my family," he said, his voice quieter now. <265></265>  

"At every wedding, we sang a traditional song beneath this tapestry, a promise of renewal and hope." <287></287>  

The master studied the fragment, his expression unreadable. <299></299>  

"And now?" he asked. <304></304>  

"Now, the song is forgotten, the family scattered, the light gone out," the swordsman admitted, his arrogance cracking. <328></328>  

The master nodded, as if he had expected this answer. <341></341>  

"Your potential is shackled by your need to prove yourself," he said. <358></358>  

"To deliver a spark, you must first let go of the chains you’ve wrapped around your own heart." <380></380>  

The swordsman frowned, his doubt warring with his pride. <392></392>  

"And how do I do that?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper. <407></407>  

The master smiled faintly and began to hum a melody, one that the swordsman recognized instantly. <426></426>  

It was the song from his family’s weddings, the one he thought lost to time. <442></442>  

The melody filled the courtyard, weaving through the air like ink on paper, and for the first time, the swordsman felt the weight of his arrogance lift. <472></472>  

Between breaths, he joined in the song, his voice unsteady but growing stronger with each note. <490></490>  

The master said nothing more, for the spark had already been lit. <504></504>
