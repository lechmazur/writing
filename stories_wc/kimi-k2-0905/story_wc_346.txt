The doomsday clock adjuster arrived at the hidden lighthouse at dusk, her satchel clinking with gears she no longer trusted. [23]  
She had followed the rumor of a pane of hush installed in the lantern room, glass that could silence the tick of the world’s last heartbeat. [38]  
Across the hush of time’s final ripple she walked, boots sinking into damp sand that remembered every footstep she would ever take. [55]  
Inside, spiral stairs carried her upward through nested patterns of salt-stained iron, each railing curl a smaller echo of the one below, as though the lighthouse folded itself inward to keep the sea out. [80]  
At the summit she found the pane set between cracked lenses: a fist-sized square of night so matte it drank the orange afterglow and gave back nothing. [99]  
Beside it lay a broken puppet head, chewed by tide and time, its painted smile flaked into a beautifully flawed crescent that still seemed to listen. [118]  
The adjuster’s fingers trembled; she recognized the mahogany cheek from the nursery of her first life, the life before the Council charged her with winding the apocalypse. [139]  
She had once sung that puppet to sleep in a cradle now drowned, promising lullabies she could never finish because the bombs kept falling outside the window. [160]  
The pane of hush pulsed, sensing memory like a tongue probing a sore tooth. [172]  
She understood then the method: to vouchsafe the lullaby she must thread it through nested patterns of every cradle she had rocked across a thousand lifetimes, letting the glass silence everything except the song. [198]  
So she knelt, pressed the broken puppet head to her collarbone, and began to whisper. [211]  
The first iteration was the lullaby she hummed in 1943 London, vibrating with flak and fear. [225]  
The second was the same melody slowed to a glacier’s heartbeat on a colony ship sliding toward a dark star. [243]  
Third: faster, tinny, broadcast from a toy radio in a city that existed only in a dream she had sold to survive another council audit. [264]  
With each recursion the pane of hush grew more transparent, revealing behind it the great gearwork of the doomsday clock, its hands bruised purple by the approaching midnight. [285]  
She felt the bruised awe of realizing the clock was not mechanism but organism, veins of mercury pumping beneath numerals that bled. [302]  
Her throat cracked; the puppet’s remaining eye, a cloudy marble, rolled to stare at her as if to ask whether salvation was worth finishing the song. [320]  
She answered by kissing the splintered forehead and looping the lullaby back through itself, nesting infant breaths inside dying breaths until the distinction vanished. [340]  
The pane began to sing back, not with sound but with hush, a silence so complete it circled around to music on the far side of hearing. [357]  
Midnight shuddered, hand retreating one tick, then another, each backward second carving a lifeline she had never lived yet suddenly remembered. [375]  
In one such line she stayed a girl who never became adjuster, who burned the Council’s summons and raised tulips instead of tallying endings. [393]  
In another she was the puppet, felt the adjuster’s cracked lips through carved wood, and forgave her for every cradle abandoned. [410]  
The nested patterns collapsed into a single moment suspended like a raindrop at the lighthouse window, dusk caught inside it and refracted into every possible color of almost. [430]  
She understood the bargain: the lullaby would cross the thousand lifetimes, but she would remain here, voice eternally whispering, body eroding like sandstone into salt. [450]  
Acceptance tasted of iron and lullabies; she smiled the same beautifully flawed crescent as the puppet and pressed her forehead to the cooling glass. [468]  
Below, the unseen sea applauded against rocks in slow, deliberate rhythm, counting backwards now, tide receding from villages that would wake tomorrow unaware they had nearly never been. [490]  
Her last clear thought was that imperfection was the only song worth singing, that a cracked mouth still shapes vowels of mercy. [510]  
Then thought dissolved into the hush, and she became the pane’s silvered backing, a ghost mirror in which every future child might glimpse the lullaby’s outline and know someone stayed awake so they could sleep. [535]  
The broken puppet head, released, rolled gently to the stairwell and began its long descent, clunking each nested curve like a heartbeat learning how to slow. [555]  
At the base it came to rest against the open door; outside, the first star pricked a sky no longer scheduled to end. [571]  
Somewhere in the spiral between, a voice still whispered, threading bruised awe through the quiet, a lullaby traveling across the hush of time’s final ripple, promising I am here, I am here, I am here. [600]
