The xenobiology research station hung above the violet cloud-sea of Kepler-9c like a patient spider, its corridors dimmed to twilight by the obliging sky mechanic who insisted that half-light kept the specimens calm. [35]
Every evening she walked the axial spine, palm brushing the magnetic nexus at twilight, a grapefruit-sized sphere of alloyed cobalt that pulsed with the same mechanically warm heartbeat she felt in her own prosthetic lungs. [50]
Tonight the nexus throbbed faster, as if the station itself were dreaming, and she paused inside the hush of beating wings at rest—the aviary module where the native moth-bats folded their glassy pinions and pretended to sleep. [70]
She had come here to prove that time moves sideways, that memory and prophecy are merely different wings on the same insect, and the holographic principles encoded in the nexus were her only witness. [90]
With a soft exhale she engaged the lever recessed into the bulkhead; it moved like chilled honey, and the air thickened into a prism. [105]
The moth-bats lifted as one, startled by the sudden icy warmth that spilled from the walls—projections of older skies, earlier versions of the station when the first crew still breathed oxygen and told jokes in languages now extinct. [125]
In those ghost corridors she saw herself, younger, gloved hands shaking as she signed the consent form to replace her failing lungs with the station’s own mechanically warm bellows, the bargain that made her forever obliging to the sky. [145]
The younger image reached toward the magnetic nexus, hesitated, then turned away; the present mechanic felt the subtle tug of sideways time as that hesitation rippled into her own muscles. [165]
She understood: if she could map the exact angle of that hesitation, chart it through holographic principles, she could fold the moment back on itself, let the younger self choose differently, perhaps keep the original flesh and never become the station’s willing organ. [185]
But the moth-bats began to sing, a subsonic hum that vibrated the titanium ribs of the aviary, and their wings beat in slow motion, painting interference patterns across the projections. [205]
The patterns matched the nexus’s pulse, three against five, a ratio she recognized from the xenobiology logs as the signature of subdued awakenings—when a chrysalis knows the world outside yet refuses to emerge. [225]
She realized the station was such a chrysalis, and she its reluctant imago, kept in perpetual twilight by her own refusal to finish becoming. [240]
Lowering the lever by degrees, she let the projections dim until only one hologram remained: the magnetic nexus itself, magnified, its core a lattice of light where every possible choice glimmered like frost. [260]
Touching the real sphere to its ghost, she felt time tilt sideways; the floor seemed to roll, not violently, but as a sleeper turns toward a familiar voice. [280]
In that tilt she stepped sideways with it, lungs humming in mechanical harmony, and found herself outside the station’s timeline, watching decades unfurl like a paper fan. [295]
She saw the moth-bats leave the aviary, evolve into sky-whales, saw the station bloom into a living city, saw herself—another version—die of old age on a green moon, lungs untouched by metal. [315]
Yet she also saw the version who stayed, who kept the nexus stable, who became legend among later crews as the obliging sky mechanic who whispered stations to sleep. [335]
Both futures felt true, which meant neither was inevitable, and the proof she had sought—that time moves sideways—was not a theorem but a doorway she could choose to close or enter. [355]
She stepped back into the twilight corridor, lever centered, nexus quiet, wings at rest. [370]
The icy warmth lingered in her chest, not discomfort but companionship, the mechanical lungs breathing with her instead of for her. [390]
She recorded no data, filed no report; the evidence lived in the angle of her next footstep, slightly offset from the path she had walked every evening before. [410]
Tomorrow she would come again, palm to sphere, but she would not pull the lever; she would listen to the moth-bats dream and let their subdued awakenings teach her how to open her own chrysalis when the moment was ripe. [435]
Until then she remained the obliging sky mechanic, keeping the station’s heart mechanically warm, proving sideways time not in equations but in the quiet repetition of choice, night after night, within the hush of beating wings at rest. [465]
And somewhere in the lattice of the magnetic nexus, the younger version of her turned back, hand outstretched, waiting for the next twilight when the lever might be moved one degree less, or
