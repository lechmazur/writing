The lantern maker’s hands still smelled of kerosene when she stepped onto the tea garden’s levitating stones, each slab hovering a finger’s breadth above the other, after the shadow detached from her heels like a reluctant twin. [35]
She carried no light, only a pocket of silence and the memory of her daughter’s last breath, a pale wisp she intended to fold into origami cranes before grief hardened into obsidian. [49]
Below the garden, the glass basilica drifted on its own island of basalt, a cathedral of prisms catching dawn even though dawn here was only replayed color from yesterday’s recorded dream. [71]
Inside that basilica, the oneiric engines copied every sleeper’s visions onto ribbons of living quartz; the maker had sold the Guild her finest lamp chimneys to pay for one ribbon—her daughter’s final dream. [94]
She had polished the dream’s container herself, a thumb-sized moonstone, using the same gem-polishing method she once used for lighthouse lenses: seven strokes water, seven strokes oil, whisper the name, turn, repeat until the surface becomes a mirror that looks back with your own eyes. [136]
Today she would transform the moonstone’s contents into paper birds, each crane a syllable of goodbye, but the path required her to descend while ascending, a paradox the floating islands demanded of every pilgrim. [169]
She chose the southern stair, which spiraled downward through clouds yet arrived at a higher altitude, each step erasing a day of sorrow from her face and adding a line of luminous torment to her eyes. [207]
Tea bushes glowed around her, their leaves steaming with distilled sleep; when she brushed them, they chimed like tiny bells and exhaled fragments of strangers’ dreams—lovers chasing buses, cats teaching geometry, red snow that tasted of cinnamon. [250]
She pocketed one leaf out of habit; a lantern maker never wastes fuel, and grief is only another kind of flame. [272]
At the stair’s summit—which was also its nadir—the basilica’s arched doorway stood open, breathing cold starlight that had been stored in dreamers’ memories of winter nights when they were seven. [312]
The threshold tasted of iron and lullabies; she crossed it, and her footsteps became glass beads rolling across the nave, each bead a syllable of her daughter’s laugh caught in perpetual echo. [348]
The oneiric engines hummed like imprisoned bees; between their crystal rods hovered the moonstone, now cracked along its equator, leaking silver images that puddled and reshaped into the silhouette of a girl folding paper by a hospital window. [385]
The maker knelt, lantern-maker’s knees accustomed to stone floors, and began the ritual: she breathed once, twice, then drew the leaking dream into her lungs until her ribs glowed from within, translucent ribs holding a galaxy of unfinished bedtime stories. [427]
With fingers that had soldered copper and cut cameo glass, she pinched the galaxy into a square of impossible paper, thin as grief yet stronger than justification. [460]
She folded while tears evaporated into minor constellations; each crease was a day she arrived too late at the ward, each tuck a promise that dissolved on the child’s tongue like sugar prayers. [501]
The first crane emerged, wings edged in starlight, and it flew a tight circle around her head, whispering mama in a voice made of wind chimes and heart monitors. [533]
One became seven, seven became forty-nine, the flock ascending-descending in the basilica’s vaulted air, orbiting the maker who stood motionless at the center of their luminous torment, each bird a small lamp carrying fire she could not bear to hold alone. [578]
When the final crane lifted off her palm, the moonstone crumbled to dust that smelled of lavender and antiseptic; the engines sighed and darkened, their quota of sorrow met for the season. [612]
She walked out backward, descending the upward stair, and every step erased a bead of glass from the floor until the nave was bare, the dream ribbon empty, the basilica ready for the next grief. [655]
Back in the tea garden, dawn replayed itself a second time, paler, like a memory forgetting its own ending; the cranes settled into the bushes, perching among steaming leaves, becoming living lanterns that would glow each night for anyone who needed light shaped like goodbye. [703]
The maker sat on the lowest hovering stone, took out the leaf she had stolen, and rolled it into a tiny chimney; she lit it with the last spark of her own dream, the one where her daughter runs ahead, turns, waves, does not fall. [747]
Smoke rose, carrying no image, only scent—bergamot and bandages—and she watched it rise, neither ascending nor descending, simply leaving, and for the first time since the shadow detached, her hands smelled only of tea. [783]
