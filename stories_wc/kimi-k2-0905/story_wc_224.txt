The mercury-glass seer pressed her mirrored palms to the labyrinthine bookstore's stone wall, feeling after-images of every reader who had ever touched it. [24]
She had come to the mountain that housed the endless shelves because remembering her own past had become painful, each memory a shard that cut deeper than the last. [38]
In the valley below, people spoke of the bookstore as a myth, but here among the towering stacks that spiraled upward through caverns and across bridges, she knew it was real—real enough to kill or cure. [58]
The lost language stone hung heavy in her pocket, a fragment of something larger that had called to her across decades of forgetting. [75]
She had substitutes reality nightly, crafting false memories to replace the ones that hurt, but the stone refused those fabrications, humming with discontent against her hip. [95]
Tonight, she would seed the truth back into herself, though the method terrified her. [105]
The texture of a feather lay waiting on a pedestal in the deepest section, where books gave way to raw stone and the mountain's heartbeat thrummed through her boots. [125]
An old man with ink-stained fingers had told her the feather belonged to the first phoenix, that it could write truth across any surface—including the mercury glass that coated her skin. [145]
She found him between shelves labeled "Cartography of Dreams" and "Histories That Never Were," his eyes reflecting the same silver as her own. [165]
"You seek to understand the shape of home," he said, not asking. [175]
The words struck her like physical blows, because home was the thing she'd buried most deeply, a talent for belonging that she'd traded away when the pain grew too large. [195]
The mercury-glass seer nodded, unable to speak around the sudden thickness in her throat. [205]
He led her deeper, past books that whispered in languages dead and unborn, until they reached a chamber where the mountain's bones showed through. [225]
Here, the air tasted of copper and storm, and hidden thunder rolled through the stone itself. [238]
The feather waited on its pedestal, black as void and light as breath, and she understood that touching it would require more courage than anything she'd done. [258]
Her buried talents weren't just memories—they were the ability to read the world as text, to speak in the language of place and belonging, to make any space into home through the sheer force of her attention. [285]
The lost language stone grew warm, responding to her proximity to the feather, and she realized they were two halves of the same whole. [305]
When she'd first found the stone in the ruins of her childhood home, it had shown her glimpses of what she'd been: a child who spoke to houses, who could seed warmth into cold walls and draw families together with words alone. [335]
The war had taken that from her, along with everyone she'd ever loved, and she'd wrapped herself in mercury glass to keep the world out. [355]
But the bookstore had called her, this impossible place that occupied an entire mountain, because it was built from the same buried talents she possessed. [375]
Every shelf, every corridor, every hidden room had been grown by someone who understood that space could be seeded with intention, could be made into a home for wandering souls. [400]
She lifted the feather, feeling its impossible weight—both nothing and everything—and pressed its barbs against the mercury glass of her forearm. [420]
The hidden thunder grew louder as the feather began to write, tracing words in a language she'd forgotten she knew. [435]
The lost language stone pulsed in her pocket, and she drew it out, pressing it against the words as they appeared. [450]
Reality fractured and reformed around her, the substitutes she'd created falling away like shattered mirrors. [465]
She saw herself as a child, speaking to empty houses, seeding them with the promise of family, of warmth, of belonging. [480]
She saw the moment she'd stopped, when the last house had burned and taken her family with it, when she'd decided that the talent for making homes was too dangerous to keep. [505]
The mercury glass began to crack, silver flakes drifting away like snow, revealing skin beneath that remembered every place it had ever touched. [525]
The labyrinthine bookstore shifted around her, corridors rearranging themselves into the shape of every home she'd ever made or lost. [545]
She understood now that the mountain wasn't just a repository of books—it was a home for homeless stories, for talents buried by grief, for the shape of belonging that persisted even after remembering became painful. [575]
The feather completed its writing, and she read the final words: "Home is not where you are safe—it is where you are necessary." [595]
The lost language stone crumbled into dust, its purpose fulfilled, and she felt her buried talents unfurl like
