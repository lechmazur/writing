The mercury-glass seer pressed her mirrored palm to the labyrinthine bookstore’s cold basalt wall, feeling titles shift beneath like eels in a sack. [24]
She had come after remembering became painful, when every recollection of the valley town rang like a cracked bell. [36]
Inside the mountain, corridors corkscrewed upward, shelves carved straight into stone, each level smelling of wet paper and thunder that refused to break. [53]
Long ago she buried talents here, seeding them between pages so no tyrant could harvest her foresight. [68]
Tonight she returned because home—its shape, its taste—had slipped from her like water, and only the lost language stone could redraw its outline against her mind. [90]
The stone, last seen sliding behind Encyclopedias of Extinct Verbs, pulsed with syllables older than air, syllables that named the smell of rain on the town’s single wheat field. [114]
She moved via the texture of a feather she kept tucked in her cuff, a crow plume stolen from her mother’s funeral pyre; when brushed across spines it whispered whether the book beneath held trapped weather, bottled grief, or her own dormant gift. [147]
At the ninth spiral she met the custodian, a shadow wearing spectacles of frost, who substitutes reality nightly by rearranging sections: History becomes Horticulture, Biography slides into Bioluminescence, so no story keeps its address. [183]
“Seeking?” he hissed, breath smelling of hidden thunder. [192]
“Something I buried,” she answered, letting the feather graze his lapel; it trembled, signaling buried talents beneath the cloth, but not hers. [213]
He stepped aside, yet his shadow clung to her heels, stretching like taffy, trying to learn her route so it could shift the shelves before she arrived. [236]
She recalled the day she left: soldiers hammering on doors, demanding prophecies; her mother pushing the crow feather into her hand, saying, “Seed yourself where they cannot name you.” [264]
So she had climbed the mountain that now houses the bookstore, back when it was bare rock and echo, and pressed her abilities—mirror-scrying, storm-tasting, heart-unraveling—into volumes no one catalogued. [294]
Memory hurt because every prophecy she gave had chained another friend; the town rewarded visions with cages, called her mercury-glass skin witch-metal, polished for display. [322]
To understand the shape of home she must reclaim those talents, not to wield but to fold them into a map she could burn once read, releasing the town from her guilt. [350]
The custodian’s distant cough reverberated, a storm clearing its throat; she quickened, letting the feather choose turns, its barbs vibrating like tuning forks. [374]
At last it stilled against a slim folio bound in storm-cloud suede: “Onomasticon of Forgotten Landscapes.” [395]
Inside, wedged within a hollowed-out chapter on lullabies, lay the lost language stone, no bigger than a sparrow’s heart, veined with scripts that crawled when stared at. [424]
Touching it, she heard wheat stalks brushing thighs, smelled clay stoves at dawn, felt the town’s single road curl like a root through her chest—home’s true shape, not the weaponized version soldiers wanted. [456]
But custody requires exchange; the custodian appeared, shadow folding into itself until it became a man-shaped void. [475]
“Reality is rearranged by subtraction,” he murmured, offering a quill made of her own mirrored scales. [493]
“Write your talents onto these shelves again, seed them anew, and the stone is yours to carry away.” [511]
She understood: if she reburied her gifts, the bookstore would grow larger, swallowing more mountain, more memory, until no outer world remained—his perfect, mutable cage. [538]
Instead she lifted the crow feather, drew its tip across her mercury-glass forearm; the surface clouded, reflecting not her face but the town as it might be—free of prophecy, free of her. [570]
She cracked the reflection with the quill, shards falling like silver rain; each sliver held a talent she refused to replant. [593]
Custodian lunged, but hidden thunder finally broke; lightning, long hoarded between pages, struck the shelves, spilling books in a cataract of burning alphabets. [618]
Clutching the stone, she spoke a word it revealed—an unpronounceable curl of sound meaning both “leave-taking” and “return”—and the labyrinth sighed open, corridors straightening into the single road of her childhood. [648]
She walked out as the mountain bookstore collapsed inward, custodian shrinking to a bookmark swept away by ink-black wind. [672]
Outside, dawn painted the valley; she held the stone to her ear, letting its lost language name each roof, each face, until the town’s shape settled inside her, no longer a wound but a weather she could carry without storm. [710]
Then, keeping the crow feather, she set the stone on the ground; it sank, sealing her buried talents forever, seeding instead the possibility that memory could belong to everyone, not seer nor soldier. [748]
She descended the slope, mercury-glass skin catching the rising sun, no oracle now—just a woman going home, thunder at last rolling quietly behind her eyes. [760]
