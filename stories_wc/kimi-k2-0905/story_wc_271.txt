The arboretum on the cliff had outlived the lighthouse; when the final keeper rowed away, the trees kept their own watch over the tide. [24]
I came here every dusk, carrying the crumpled photograph like a ticket to a show that had already ended. [37]
In the picture my cousin Nadia is laughing, her hennaed hands thrown skyward the instant before the drone’s shadow crossed the sun. [56]
I am the only one who survived the wedding strike, and survival feels like a clerical error I keep trying to correct. [75]
People say I am quietly talented because I can name every plant in this collection: mallee eucalyptus, dragon’s-blood pine, salt-stunted myrtle. [97]
They do not know I learned the names by mapping them against the hollow places in my body—somatic markers, the therapist called them—so that when grief spikes I can press a thumb to the scar on my rib and say Arbutus unedo, and the pain pauses, confused. [135]
Tonight the wind combs the cliff with a sound like tearing paper. [149]
I walk the outer path where the soil is thin and roots grip stone like desperate fingers. [168]
The photograph has been folded and unfolded so often that Nadia’s face has fractured into white creases; still, her joy remains intact, a pearl of stillness inside the wreckage. [198]
My motivation is simple and impossible: to anchor optimism in realism, to believe tomorrow matters without forgetting yesterday’s shrapnel. [225]
I stop at the iron railing that keeps no one safe, stare at the black water below, and practice the exercise I invented: freeze the moment, not to flee it but to dissect it for mercy. [259]
I breathe in salt, eucalyptus, my own cold sweat—three scents, three seconds, three somatic anchors. [280]
The freeze is not paralysis; it is a microscope. [290]
Inside it I see the drone as a distant heron, the blast as a red chrysanthemum opening, the screams as gulls quarrelling over fish. [315]
I see Nadia’s hand still reaching upward, not for help but for the bouquet she never caught. [333]
When the freeze thaws, tears come—reliable as tide—and I let them salt the soil. [348]
A low branch of the dragon’s-blood pine brushes my shoulder, leaving a smear of resin that smells like incense and iodine. [372]
I press the crumpled photograph against the bark, transferring a ghost of Nadia’s laughter onto the living trunk. [395]
Tomorrow the resin will set, and her image will be sealed there, facing the sea, becoming part of the arboretum’s quiet talent for outlasting us. [425]
I step back, count four heartbeats, then walk on. [437]
The path loops toward the abandoned lighthouse where the keeper’s vegetable patch has gone feral with kale and poppies. [463]
I kneel, snap a stem of sea lavender, tuck it behind my ear because Nadia always wore flowers in her hair. [485]
Somewhere below, waves detonate against basalt, but the sound is softer now, as though the cliff itself exhales. [506]
I think: grief is not a landmine to avoid; it is a coastline to learn by heart. [525]
I think: optimism without memory is just noise, but memory without optimism is a tomb. [545]
I stand, brush grit from my knees, and feel the somatic markers glow—eucalyptus at my collarbone, pine at my wrist, lavender at my temple—each a small lighthouse after the last lighthouse keeper. [585]
The sky has burned down to ember. [593]
I unfold the photograph one final time, hold it to the wind; it flaps like a wounded bird, then rips away, carried seaward. [618]
I do not watch it land. [625]
Instead I place my palm on the dragon’s-blood pine where her face now sleeps under resin, and I speak the new covenant: I will live as the trees live, damaged yet upright, drinking salt and light, keeping a pearl of stillness at the core. [675]
Behind me the arboretum exhales green oxygen into the dark, and for the first time the air tastes not of metal but of possible mornings. [705]
I turn inland, leaving the cliff to its ancient patience, carrying nothing but the somatic map that says: here grief ends its dictatorship, and diligence begins. [740]
The path is visible by starlight alone, and I follow it, one foot after another, a quietly talented survivor learning the arithmetic of continuation. [775]
