The sapphire viaduct stretched above the dry seabed, its arches glowing faintly as dawn crept across the horizon. [24]  
Kael stood beneath it, clutching the broken ship’s bell that once rang from the mast of the last fishing vessel. [38]  
He was a lukewarm mage—neither feared nor revered—whose spells fizzled more often than they flared. [53]  
But the oceans had vanished overnight, and with them, every fish. [65]  
The world’s balance had tilted, and Kael, earnestly naive, believed he could right it. [80]  

He pressed his palm to the bell’s jagged edge, feeling the salt-crusted metal pulse faintly. [96]  
It remembered the sea. [99]  
That was enough. [101]  

Kael had studied dripping rates in the Academy’s forgotten archives—how water, over centuries, could carve stone. [119]  
He applied the same principle now, not to stone, but to reality. [131]  
If he could understand the rate at which belief dripped from the world, perhaps he could rebuild what was lost. [149]  

He hung the bell from the viaduct’s lowest arch, where the first light of dawn struck it like a gong. [167]  
It didn’t ring. [169]  
It wept. [170]  
A single drop of water formed beneath it, clinging like a secret. [181]  

Kael sat cross-legged beneath it, counting the seconds between drops. [193]  
One every 47 seconds. [196]  
Then 46. [198]  
Then 44. [200]  
The world was remembering. [204]  

But memory alone wouldn’t rebuild an ocean. [212]  
He needed devotion. [215]  
Not the fiery kind that topples kingdoms, but the brittle kind that keeps a widow polishing her husband’s boots long after he’s gone. [235]  

He thought of the fishermen who had wept when their nets came up empty. [250]  
Of the children who had never seen a tide. [259]  
Of the whales that had sung themselves into silence. [269]  
He held those griefs in his chest, letting them drip into the bell. [282]  

The bell began to rust. [286]  
Not with decay, but with rebirth. [292]  
Each flake of rust fell like a scale, and where it landed, a minnow flickered into being. [307]  
They were transparent, impossible, and utterly real. [318]  

Kael wept. [320]  
His tears fell at the same rate as the bell’s. [329]  
47 seconds. [331]  
46. [332]  
44. [333]  
The viaduct began to hum. [337]  

He stayed for seven days. [343]  
Each day, the drip rate doubled. [349]  
By the seventh, the bell rang once—clear and true—and a wave crashed through the viaduct’s arch. [368]  
It was only ankle-deep, but it was enough. [378]  

Kael stepped into it. [381]  
The water was cold. [384]  
It tasted like iron and memory. [390]  

He walked until the viaduct was behind him, and the water rose to his knees. [405]  
The minnows followed. [408]  
Then came a dolphin, its skin stitched from rust and regret. [420]  
It looked at Kael with eyes like ship lanterns. [429]  

“You’ve rebuilt the sea,” it said, “but not the faith.” [442]  
Kael nodded. [444]  
He knew the devotion that had summoned this water was brittle. [456]  
One drought of belief, and it would all vanish again. [468]  

So he stayed. [470]  
He became the keeper of the drip. [477]  
Every morning, he walked the viaduct at dawn, ringing the broken bell. [492]  
Children came. [494]  
They brought offerings: shells from long-dead beaches, plastic lures, their grandparents’ tears. [513]  
They learned to count the seconds between drops. [524]  
They learned to believe in impossible tides. [533]  

Years passed. [535]  
The ocean grew. [537]  
Whales returned, their songs echoing through the viaduct’s arches like hymns. [551]  
Kael’s beard turned white. [556]  
His magic remained lukewarm, but his devotion held. [567]  

One morning, he didn’t wake. [573]  
The bell rang once more, then cracked in half. [583]  
The drip stopped. [585]  

But the ocean didn’t vanish. [591]  
The children—now fishermen, now mothers, now storytellers—kept counting. [607]  
They taught their children to count. [615]  
They taught them that the sea had once disappeared, and that a naive mage had rebuilt it, drop by drop, with a broken bell and a heart full of brittle devotion. [642]  

And every dawn, beneath the sapphire viaduct, someone still rings the bell. [660]  
Not because they must. [664]  
But because they remember. [667]  

The ocean listens. [669]  
It always has. [671]  
It just needed someone to understand the rate at which belief returns. [687]  

Kael’s bones rest beneath the viaduct. [697]  
His epitaph is a drip. [702]  
It falls every 47 seconds. [706]  
And every time it does, a fish is born. [715]  

Not because it makes sense. [720]  
But because it must. [723]
