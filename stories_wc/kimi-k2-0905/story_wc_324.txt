The mist-clad atrium at twilight swallowed sound the way old velvet swallows light, and Mira stood at its center with her decades-old hearing aid tuned to the frequency of the dead. [32]

She was a contact tracer for hearts, though the city council called her a grief counselor and the newspapers called her a fraud. [42]

When the dead call, they do not speak in words but in pulses—faint arrhythmic beats that echo the moment their living hearts last broke. [56]

Mira's hearing aid, salvaged from her grandmother's bedside table the night the old woman died, picked up these pulses like a Geiger counter picks up radiation. [75]

Tonight the air tasted of iron and lilies, the reeling hush before a storm or a revelation. [87]

She had come because the photograph arrived at her apartment that morning: a sun-bleached snapshot of two girls on a carousel, their mouths open in soundless laughter, the edges scalloped like a shell. [109]

On the back, in pencil gone silver with age: "Assure her I kept my promise." [125]

No return address, no stamp, just the weight of someone else's final breath pressed into paper. [139]

Mira's persistently curious nature had gotten her into this line of work; she could never walk away from an unfinished sentence, a door left ajar, a heart that had stopped mid-beat. [158]

She closed her eyes and let the hearing aid whisper its static lullaby until the pulse emerged—three short, one long, two short—the rhythm of a name being tapped against a wall. [178]

The atrium's glass roof dripped condensation onto the marble floor, each drop a small ghost. [190]

Following the pulse, Mira walked the perimeter where the mist was thickest, her fingertips grazing the names carved into the memorial wall. [206]

The hearing aid squealed when she reached "Eleanor Whitaker, 1952-2018, Beloved Sister." [218]

Eleanor's pulse carried the taste of penny candy and chlorine, summer afternoons when the world was still small enough to hold. [232]

Mira pressed the photograph against the cool stone and felt the connection snap into place like magnets aligning. [246]

Eleanor had been the older girl on the carousel, the one with the crooked ribbon, and she had spent the last six years of her life trying to find the younger girl—her sister's daughter, given up for adoption in 1969 when their parents died. [276]

The promise: to keep the sisters together. [283]

The failure: letting the baby go because Eleanor was only seventeen and afraid. [295]

The regret: a heartbeat that never quite recovered its rhythm. [305]

Mira's job wasn't to solve crimes or reunite families; it was to protect vulnerable voices from being lost entirely, to assure the dead that someone still listened. [328]

But tonight the pulse grew urgent, pushing her across the atrium to where a woman in a green coat stood staring at the same memorial wall. [348]

The woman's hearing aid was identical to Mira's, the plastic yellowed with decades of someone else's earwax. [364]

She looked up, eyes wide, and Mira knew without asking that this was the baby, now fifty-four years old, drawn here by the same pulse that had guided Mira. [385]

The photograph between them became a bridge, its faded colors brightening in the twilight as if the carousel had begun to turn again. [402]

"I've been coming here every Tuesday for a year," the woman whispered, her voice the reeling hush of someone who has just recognized their own face in a stranger's mirror. [425]

"She's been trying to find you longer than that," Mira replied, and pressed the photograph into the woman's hand. [443]

The hearing aids synchronized, their static resolving into a single steady beat—Eleanor's heart, finally at rest. [459]

In the incidental heroism of showing up, of listening, of carrying a message no one else could deliver, Mira had done what the living rarely manage: she had given the dead their closing parentheses. [490]

The mist began to lift, revealing the atrium's true shape—a carousel frozen mid-spin, its painted horses caught between galloping and flight. [512]

The woman clutched the photograph to her chest, tears falling in the same rhythm as the pulses that had brought them together. [530]

Mira stepped back, her work complete, the hearing aid now silent for the first time in six years. [545]

As she walked away, the atrium's lights flickered on one by one, each bulb a small star guiding the living back to their ordinary lives. [565]

Behind her, the woman spoke to the marble wall, her voice steady now: "I found
