The hedge maze designer pressed her palm to the living bridge garden's oldest arch, feeling the slow pulse of sap beneath bark. [19]
She had built this place to remember, but the photographs in her pocket were already fading, their emulsions surrendering color like breath on glass. [35]
Each lost image was a door slamming shut, so she stepped onto the bridge, letting the halo fragment tucked in her locket warm against her sternum. [54]
It was the last shard of the celestial circlet that once crowned the moon, and it hummed when time grew thin. [74]
She needed that hum now, because the garden's paths were shifting, loops folding back on themselves like Möbius ribbons, and she was retrocognitively trapped, able to taste every yesterday yet unable to change a single one. [98]
To discover the texture of time, she had planted yew and hornbeam in hyperbolic arrays, their growth vectors curved so sharply that walking the maze became a descent into earlier hours. [125]
She took the first turning, leaves brushing her cheeks with wet memories of rain that fell when she was seven. [145]
The second turning smelled of her teacher's chalk, the third of her mother's funeral lilies, and by the fourth she was kneeling, because the photographs had disintegrated into white dust that slipped through her fingers and blew into the ivy. [175]
The halo fragment flared, projecting a cone of pale light that revealed the garden's true anatomy: roots threading backward through years, branches corkscrewing into futures not yet chosen. [205]
She understood then that the maze was not a puzzle but a periscope, letting her peer down the helical well of causality. [228]
If she could map its curvature, she could step outside duration and feel time's grain the way a sculptor feels marble. [250]
She walked faster, following the halo's glow along asymptotic hedges that approached but never reached the bridge's center. [275]
With every stride her footprints filled with older versions of herself, children and crones staring up in mute recognition. [297]
They reached for her, and their fingers passed through her wrists like cold smoke; she was already a memory to them, a ghost they would become. [323]
At the maze's heart she found the living bridge's keystone: a single hawthorn grown into the shape of an hourglass, its trunk pinched so narrowly that sap barely dripped through. [354]
She pressed the halo fragment against the constriction, and the tree began to sing, a low quaking reverie that rattled her teeth with centuries. [382]
The bark softened under her hands, turning pliant as photographic paper, and she peeled it back to reveal rings that were not wood but images: every moment the garden had witnessed, laminated in celluloid. [418]
She lifted a ring to her eye and saw her own birth, the doctor's masked face haloed by surgical light, then her first kiss, then her future death, a quiet bedside at dusk. [450]
Time's texture was not smooth but serrated, each instant a tooth that bit into the next, leaving perforations she could tear along. [476]
She tugged, and the ring ripped free; the garden shuddered, and the bridge began to disintegrate, planks curling away like burning film. [503]
Hyperbolic geometry collapsed into Euclidean lines, the maze straightening into a corridor that pointed toward a door she had never built. [530]
Behind her, the photographs reconstituted themselves from dust, images brightening, colors saturating beyond reality, as if memory were taking revenge on forgetting. [558]
She stepped toward the door, but the halo fragment cooled, its light retracting into a single white point that hovered between her eyes. [583]
It showed her the price: if she crossed the threshold, she would become the garden's new keystone, roots replacing veins, leaves replacing hair, forever feeling the slow abrasion of years against her bark. [622]
She hesitated, tasting the salt of every future tear she would filter as sap. [639]
Then she smiled, because the texture of time was not to be observed but to be lived, and she slipped the fragment into the hawthorn's wound, sealing the hourglass shut. [675]
The door dissolved, the corridor spiraled back into maze, and she stood barefoot on moss, photographs once again fading in her pocket, their dissolution now a comfort rather than a terror. [713]
She would walk these paths again and again, each loss a new ring, each ring a new photograph, until the garden grew dense enough to hold every vanishing moment in its breathing walls. [757]
When the last picture turned to dust, she would kneel, press her ear to the soil, and listen to the quiet quaking reverie of time grinding itself sharp beneath her designs. [800]
