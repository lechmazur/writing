Under the soft hush of a distant morning, the frozen library above clouds shone like a prism of ice, its spires catching first light in hauntingly bright blades that made the sky itself look dim. [35]
Rowan, the lunar-eclipse locksmith, stepped from the lift-cage, coat crackling with rime, pockets rattling with the clockmaker's gear assortment he carried whenever destiny felt jammed. [52]
He had come here through scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner, folios someone had torn apart and shoved between frost-lamed atlases, lines that spoke of a lock which only ever clicked during totality. [78]
Rowan wanted, more than payment, to learn the rhythm of repair that kept moons and mechanisms from wobbling off their orbits; his own heart ticked irregular since the eclipse that took his mentor. [103]
The scrap said the lock lived inside the hall of mirrors beyond the astronomy aisle, so he walked there, boots squealing on crystal floors while auroras braided overhead through vaulted glass. [133]
Each breath unfurled as silver gauze, and the hauntingly bright reflection of his lantern floated beside him like a twin who already knew the ending. [155]
Mirrors rose in undulating panels, rimed yet clear, turning the corridor into a frozen wave that echoed every gesture a heartbeat late. [180]
At the center waited a door of black bronze, its keyhole shaped like a waning moon; frost beaded on the pins, and Rowan felt the familiar hush that precedes either revelation or breakage. [215]
He uncapped the brass tube strapped to his wrist, letting the clockmaker's gear assortment spill across his palm: crescent cogs, eclipse-shaped pawls, tiny planet gears still warm from another craftsman's dreams. [253]
The prophecy had warned that the correct piece would hum when lunar umbra kissed the door, so he held each gear near the metal, listening through thick gloves for a tremor against his pulse. [289]
None sang. [292]
Instead, the mirrors caught the gesture and repeated it in fractal chorus, a thousand locksmiths offering gears to doors that never opened, the hauntingly bright reflections mocking hope with flawless mimicry. [326]
Rowan's doubt hissed like thawing steel; if no gear fit, the rhythm of repair would stay a stranger, and moons would continue to slip their locks inside his chest. [357]
Then he noticed the mirrored Rowans were not perfectly synchronized: one held a gear reversed, another's eclipse-key was whole instead of chipped, each reflection showing the moment just before the mistake that had marred the original. [404]
Understanding settled like fresh snow: the hall did not echo the past; it stored better versions, drafts the universe discarded. [428]
He drew the flawed eclipse-key from his own lockpick strap—its tooth sheared years ago when his mentor's heart stopped—and placed it against the glass, aligning reflection with reality. [470]
The mirror chilled the metal, frost racing along the shank until the crack sealed, and when Rowan pulled the key back, it emerged whole, lunar-eclipse locksmith and hall of mirrors collaborating in silent forgery. [518]
This time the gear hummed, not in his palm but inside the door, a low tidal note that made the bronze swell as though breathing. [543]
He inserted the healed key, turned it counterclockwise like winding back a disastrous dawn, and the door sighed open on a chamber filled with driftwood nostalgia: cedar shards from wrecked clocks, moon-dials scorched by eclipses, and at the far end a single mirror reflecting not his image but his mentor's workshop the morning after the funeral. [617]
Rowan stepped through, because repair sometimes means walking into the picture that haunts you, and the door locked itself with a click that sounded exactly like a heart finding rhythm. [657]
Behind him the hall dimmed, reflections folding into darkness, content to let the living finish what the mirrors could only remember. [685]
In the workshop the air tasted of oil and thunderstorm; every halted clock on the walls began to tick, not forward but inward, teaching their cadence to the locksmith who finally understood that to mend the world you must first forgive the gear that slipped. [731]
Rowan set the clockmaker's gear assortment on the bench, opened the windows to the cloud-sea sunrise, and started adjusting, timing his own pulse to the restored escapements, apprentice no longer but custodian of every eclipse yet to unlock. [773]
When he next looked up, the doorway back had vanished, yet he smiled, hearing in the overlapping ticks a distant morning soft as hush, promising that somewhere above the frozen library a real moon was waiting for the locksmith who had learned its rhythm. [800]
