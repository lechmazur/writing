The wistful station pianist pressed the final chord of the day's last broadcast, letting the notes drift through the empty waiting room like reluctant pigeons. [24]  
Below the bench, the broken anniversary clock lay on its side, its cracked face reflecting the ceiling's flickering fluorescent bars—each stutter a reminder that time itself had once promised forever and then reneged. [46]  
She had carried the clock from city to city, winding it long after its hands froze, because it had played the chime that first night he said he would return before the seventh moon. [72]  
Tonight the moon was already high, yet the horizon still held a thin blade of rose, and she had until the horizon invites night to decide whether waiting was still a form of playing. [98]  
Across the marble floor the station's antique departure board clattered like restless castanets, destinations blinking in and out—flickering compasses that could not settle on a direction for her. [123]  
She lifted the clock, cradling its brass corpse, and walked past the ticket counter toward the forgotten storage alcove where the porter kept reels of black-and-white safety film nobody watched anymore. [150]  
There, behind a warped sheet of plywood, she discovered a narrow hatch; its hinges sighed open to reveal a ladder climbing into a shaft smelling of ozone and wet cedar. [175]  
Hand over hand she ascended, the clock strapped to her back with a silk scarf, until the shaft widened into a greenhouse of air roots and bonsai pines suspended between cumulus pillows—a tidal arbor above the clouds that rose and fell on slow atmospheric breaths. [210]  
In that sky-garden she met the caretaker, an old projectionist with strategically creative fingers, who spliced memories the way gardeners graft cherry onto hardier stock. [240]  
He told her that every regret is merely an undeveloped frame, and offered her refuge inside a continuous loop he was editing: a 1947 travelogue whose hidden sections in a black-and-white film reel could be entered like a train whose tracks circle the planet without ever reaching a terminus. [285]  
To step through, she must trade a sound; the pianist offered the frozen chime of the broken anniversary clock, striking it once against a silver rail so its muted bell became the soundtrack of the opening scene. [320]  
The instant the tone vanished into grainy light, she stood onscreen upon a dusk-lit platform where passengers wore her own face at different ages, each carrying luggage labeled with names she had almost chosen. [355]  
The flickering compasses appeared here as station clocks without hands, their numerals drifting like iron filings around an invisible magnet, pointing not north but toward whatever tomorrow frightened her most. [390]  
She understood then that the film was not escape but rehearsal: every time she surprised fate with an unplanned encore—a melody improvised after the score said finis—the reel advanced one frame closer to the version where he steps off the train still smelling of sea salt and unfinished sentences. [435]  
So she sat at the station piano planted on the platform between illusion and afterimage, and began to play the chord she had feared to resolve for seven years, letting it wander into minor modulations that tasted of steely longing. [475]  
The tidal arbor above responded, its cloud-roots tugging the greenhouse downward until fog poured through the perforations of the film, dissolving the boundary between viewer and vista. [510]  
Passengers turned translucent, exposing sprocket holes rimmed with moonlight; even the pianist saw her own edges celluloid-thin, fluttering like a flag that has forgotten its country. [540]  
Yet the broken anniversary clock, now part of the scene's architecture, began to tick in sync with her heartbeat, each pulse projecting a new possible exit onto the mist. [570]  
She realized she could stay looping forever, safe among maybes, or climb back down carrying the reclaimed sound of time, ready to meet the real night when it finally crossed the horizon. [605]  
Choosing the latter, she stood, pressed the final unresolved chord once more—this time ending it—and walked toward the fading glow where the shaft reopened like an iris. [640]  
The last thing the projectionist captured on film was her silhouette stepping offscreen, the clock ticking audibly in her arms, its hands still immobile but its chime now free to summon whatever arrival she dared compose. [680]  
When she emerged into the station, the departure board had settled on a single destination: "Onward." [702]  
Outside, night had finally accepted the horizon's invitation, but inside her the compass had steadied, pointing not to where he might be, but to where the next unplanned encore could begin. [742]  
She set the broken anniversary clock on the bench, opened the lid, and let the first new chime ring across the empty tiles, confident that surprise, like music, only needed one fearless note to rewrite everything after. [782]
