In the hush after the birds fly south, when the palace’s broken colonnades echoed only with wind and distant traffic, Mila first noticed the creeping normality: every week another shop on Rue des Aubes displayed a “Remodeling—Back Soon” sign that never came down. [42]

She was a creeping normality noticer by trade, hired by nervous guilds to spot the moment when “temporary” became forever; her gift was to feel the city’s drift before the rest felt the ground vanish. [63]

One gray dawn she passed the vanished bakery whose awning still read “Pain d’Amande,” though the interior was gutted and dusted with flour ghosts. [85]

On the sill lay a single loaf of bread from vanished bakery, uncut, unblemished, still warm as if the ovens had exhaled it into impossible existence. [107]

Mila wrapped it in her scarf, heuristically gentle, sensing that harsh hands might make whatever miracle this was reconsider. [127]

The city’s absolution felt tenuous; entire blocks were forgetting themselves, and she feared that eating the loaf might seal the amnesia. [149]

Instead she carried it like evidence through alleys that narrowed each night, until vines parted to reveal a secret tea house in an overgrown palace courtyard, a place spoken of in commuter legends. [178]

Paper lanterns floated above cracked marble, and a woman with soil under every fingernail poured steaming cups without asking names. [198]

Mila offered the bread; the gardener studied its crust, nodded toward plots where roses grew through mosaic gods, and said, “Guilt rises like yeast; plant it.” [223]

The method she proposed was guerrilla gardening: bury the loaf at intersections where memory erasure had been smoothed over by new asphalt, let fermenting crumbs uncloak what had been paved. [254]

Together they moved by moonlight, heuristically gentle, slicing the sanctified loaf into seven pieces, each piece an apology for a loss the city refused to name. [283]

At every chosen scar they dug thumb-sized holes, slipped in dough, covered it with rescued seedlings, and whispered street names that maps had already erased. [310]

By the fourth site Mila tasted crumbs on her lips and understood the sacred in the ordinary: bread is daily resurrection, and absolution is not granted but cultivated like thyme between cobblestones. [344]

Morning after morning she returned, finding tiny green shoots wearing flakes of crust like name tags; commuters stepped around them without seeing, yet their eyes lingered a fraction longer, as if some dream had leaked into the commute. [378]

The gardener warned that tenuous absolution wilts under scrutiny, so they spoke only in tea-steam sighs, letting the palace courtyard keep their confessions safe among camellias. [405]

Weeks lengthened; bread-born herbs grew bold, spelling old shop names in basil and marjoram, and Mila noticed the “Remodeling” signs beginning to curl, revealing older paint beneath. [432]

On the first frost night she sat alone in the tea house, lantern flickering like a pulse, when the palace stones themselves began to uncloak: mosaics brightened, showing bakers kneading suns into dough, the vanished bakery alive inside the artwork. [466]

She pressed her palm against the picture and felt ovens breathe; the creeping normality recoiled, unable to swallow a story rooted in living earth. [489]

At dawn the gardener brought fresh rolls, normal ones, from a reopened storefront whose bell rang like a confession. [507]

Mila tasted ordinary bread, tears salting the crust, realizing the sacred had not returned but revealed itself as continuous, needing only someone gentle enough to plant a memory before it rotted. [536]

The city still shifted, shops still disappeared, yet now each guerrilla garden grew a bench where strangers rested, telling one another rumors of loaves that remember streets. [566]

Her job as noticer remained; creeping normality never sleeps, but each time she passes a shoot wearing breadcrust armor she feels the palace courtyard’s tea steam rise inside her, a private liturgy against forgetting. [599]

When the birds fly back north she will stand in the courtyard, soil under nails now hers, and scatter seed saved from the sacred herbs, heuristically gentle, knowing absolution stays tenuous only if left unleavened. [632]

She pockets a final crust, not relic but reminder, and walks into the widening morning, every ordinary doorway possible altar, every commuter a potential gardener waiting to uncloak the world beneath the world. [661]

In the hush after the birds return, shoots will greet them, spelling the names of bakeries yet to vanish, and Mila will brew tea among ruins that refuse to forget, cultivating the sacred that was always ordinary, always enough. [698]
