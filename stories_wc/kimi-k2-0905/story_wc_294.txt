The abandoned circus train had sat on the siding since the startup’s collapse, its scarlet paint now the color of dried blood in the dusk. [24]
I stepped between the tilted cars, boots crunching on broken bottle glass, carrying my father’s canvas satchel—his collection of foreign paper money pressed flat inside like pressed flowers from every border we’d ever fled. [45]
He had been the highway robber who never fired a shot, dissuading travelers simply by standing in the road with the calm of a man who already knew the ending; tonight I needed that same polished calm to understand why my own life kept circling back to this spot. [73]
The startup had promised to stream live circus acts to phones, and for one bright year the rails sang with venture capital, acrobats, and code; then the money evaporated faster than applause, leaving the train and me orphaned beside the same rusted track. [108]
I walked the length of the caravan, fingers brushing territorial markers left by others who’d camped here after the fall: a stripe of orange spray paint, a feather stuck into tar, a child’s plastic ring hanging from a lion cage door—each a quiet warning, each a greeting. [139]
Inside the dining car, moonlight dripped through holes in the roof onto tables still set with molded fiberboard plates, and I spread the foreign notes across one like a tarot of exile: lire, francs, pesos, dinars, every portrait eye staring up at me with the same perceptively calm question—where do you think you’re going that you haven’t already been? [175]
My father taught me to read the watermark of a nation’s panic; he said people hand over what they no longer believe in, and I had believed in the startup’s pitch the way pilgrims believe in relics, pouring years into servers that now serve only pigeons. [208]
A breeze carried the smell of popcorn turned to mildew, and I caught my own reflection in the cracked mirror behind the bar—older, thinner, still wearing the thief’s son face I never asked for, the face that investors trusted right up until the money vanished. [240]
I laid my palm on the rusted bar rail and felt the dusky harmony of the place settle over me: the low hum of crickets outside, the soft clink of metal contracting as night cooled, the hush of a story trying to finish itself without applause. [270]
Suddenly I understood the territorial markers not as claims but as signatures on a collective letter—each color, each trinket, a sentence saying, “I was here, I tried, I left something behind so the next traveler knows the curve of the circle.” [300]
I opened my father’s satchel wider and began to place my own markers: a Kenyan shilling on the windowsill, a Vietnamese dong slipped behind a seat cushion, a torn Bolivian note folded into the mouth of a brass trumpet still aimed at an audience of shadows. [335]
With every placement the polished calm inside me grew, the way lake water stills when the wind finally tires; I was not abandoning the money, I was releasing it so the next wanderer could feel the same hush and recognize the pattern. [365]
Footsteps scuffed outside—another pilgrim, maybe a coder I once fired, maybe the ghost of the lion tamer—whoever it was paused at the orange stripe, read the territory, and chose to move on without entering, dissuaded not by threat but by the quiet declaration that this circle already had a witness. [395]
I sat alone then, listening to the faint metallic lullaby of the cooling rails, and realized the startup had never been the track forward; it had been another loop in the spiral my father started the night he first stepped onto a highway with empty pockets and a smile that asked for everything. [430]
The foreign notes fluttered whenever wind found a hole in the wall, and I let them; they were maps of countries that no longer existed, just as my equity was a map of a future that would never arrive, both equally beautiful, equally worthless, equally necessary. [460]
At last I gathered what I needed: one crisp Mongolian tugrik for the road, a memory of polished calm, and the certainty that some paths circle back not to trap but to teach the traveler how to walk them with lighter feet. [490]
I stepped down from the dining car, left the satchel half-open on the threshold like a mouth still telling the story, and walked into the indigo night while the abandoned circus train settled behind me, exhaling rust and dusky harmony, a territorial marker for whoever came next. [525]
Behind me, the notes rustled like applause delayed by years, and ahead the track curved away into darkness, but I carried the perceptively calm knowledge that every circle has an exit if you stop trying to
