The meteor hush fell over the harbor as Jin, late-shift pier lamplighter, struck his first match to signify the nightly ritual of guiding lost boats home. [28]  
Each lamp he kindled cast a copper echo onto the water, and Jin listened, trying to discover the color of sound in the hiss of kerosene meeting wick. [45]  
Tonight, though, the sky bloomed with paper lanterns released for the Festival of Drifting Vows, their collective glow hiding behind truth the way old letters hide between pages of forgotten books. [71]  
Among the crowd, a woman pressed a hotel skeleton key tag into Jin’s palm, whispering, “It opens the drowned reading room; there, vows stay luminous long after voices die.” [104]  
She vanished into the meteor hush before Jin could ask why she wore the same salt-stained uniform as the sailors who never returned. [129]  
Her instruction felt like a vow itself, so Jin left his lamp-ladder leaning against the pier and began to wander purposefully along the tide line, following the lanterns’ reflections toward the half-submerged wreck of the galleon *Mercy’s Log*. [173]  
Locals claimed the ship had become a forgotten library when it slid beneath the waves during the last eclipse, swallowing its cargo of hymnals and love letters. [213]  
Jin believed every story hid a frequency; if he could step inside the sunken shelves, the resonance might let him discover the color of sound he had hunted since childhood. [258]  
He tied the hotel skeleton key tag around his neck, the brass cold against his throat like a muted bell, and dove. [285]  
Underwater, the meteor hush thickened into velvet; above, the sky lanterns’ fire strobed through the hull’s broken ribs, turning each drowned page into pale, luminous vows. [322]  
Jin’s boots found the tilting deck; air pockets shimmered between beams, and he breathed them cautiously, knowing one wrong exhale could collapse the delicate archive. [360]  
Row after row of books stood bolted to floorboards, their spines fanned like sleeping gulls; he opened one, and a pressed lily drifted out, its petals still whispering the promise of a wedding that never happened. [404]  
The lily’s brittle sigh struck Jin’s ears as a soft vermilion flare—finally, a hue he could name—yet he needed more chords to map the full spectrum. [440]  
He wandered purposefully deeper, past atlases whose continents had bled together, until he reached the iron safe the woman’s key was rumored to fit. [475]  
The hotel skeleton key tag slid home with a click that tasted of green, and the door sighed open, releasing a bloom of bioluminescent plankton that clung to the air like star-smoke. [515]  
Inside lay a single glass shell holding a phonograph cylinder labeled “Luminous Vows—Final Recording, Captain to Mate, Night Before Drowning.” [548]  
Jin set the cylinder on the corroded player; the stylus dropped, and out poured a slow chord of overlapping voices—marriage oaths, lullabies, apologies—each note igniting a different color inside the plankton cloud. [588]  
Crimson arced where love was declared, indigo pooled where regret pooled, and at the crescendo the whole safe became a lantern itself, hiding behind truth the revelation that every human sound is merely light still searching for an eye to see it. [637]  
Jin realized he had not come to discover the color of sound; the sound, patient as the tide, had waited to paint him into its spectrum. [666]  
The cylinder ended with the captain’s final sentence: “If these words glow, guide the one who listens back to the surface to signify that vows survive every sinking.” [703]  
Jin sealed the safe, leaving the luminous vows echoing inside, and rose through the hatch as the last sky lantern drifted west, its reflection merging with the plankton trail he brought up like a comet tail. [746]  
He broke the surface, inhaled the meteor hush, and climbed his lamp-ladder anew; every wick he lit now burned with a different tint, and sailors swore the pier lights sang the harbor awake in colors they could almost hear. [790]
