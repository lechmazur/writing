The frosted hourglass on the windowsill had run out sometime during the night, its last grain snagged in the brittle neck like a lodged bone. [29]
I woke in the quiet tower at dawn, after the anesthesia wore off, tasting iron and lilac where the tube had scraped my throat. [42]
My first conscious thought was not mine: a trembling osage sapling three floors below murmured, She is still bleeding. [60]
I had come to this forgotten observatory to seek closure, to open the old wound on my wrist and finally read the stories in scars, but the plants had begun listening back. [88]
Their telepathy was an accident born of the same experiment that displaced the miracle—an experimental serum meant to knit severed neurons, now threading my thoughts into root and phloem. [119]
I pressed my bandaged forearm against the cold stone and watched the coffee rings left from last night’s vigil: three overlapping halos that formed a tunnel when stared at long enough. [159]
The osage spoke again, guiding my gaze to the rings: Inside the spiral is the moment you lost. [180]
I leaned closer, letting the meteor hush of pre-dawn absorb the beep of distant machines; even alarms sounded like falling stars here. [208]
Five years ago, beneath a different sky, I had tried to save my sister by trading my pulse for hers, a bargain the miracle accepted, then mislaid. [247]
She died anyway, and the miracle—an orb of living light—was displaced into the soil of this tower’s courtyard, feeding weeds that now whispered her name in my voice. [287]
The hourglass, frost-rimed and inert, had been her toy; I inverted it each visit, pretending time could be persuaded to run uphill. [319]
This morning I left it overturned, the empty bulb a clear eye. [341]
I traced the coffee rings clockwise, then widdershins, until the tannic grooves became a tunnel I could fall through, each brown rim a vertebra in the spine of memory. [384]
The osage urged, Step. [388]
I did, palm flat to the granite, and the stone softened into loam under my fingertips, the way flesh yields when sutures dissolve. [420]
Down I went, not falling but rooting, my thoughts braiding with radicles that tasted of rust and morphine. [446]
In the dark, phosphorescent xylem showed me the miracle trapped like a firefly in a mason jar of clay, pulsing weakly, angry at being buried. [485]
I spoke without breath: I’m here to give you back. [501]
It answered in chlorophyll code: Trade requires fresh loss. [514]
I understood: to release the miracle I had to reopen the wound, let the unfinished story drain so another could begin. [548]
I unwrapped the gauze; the scar split willingly, as if it too had waited for this reading. [571]
Blood dripped onto the trapped light, each drop a syllable of apology my mouth had never formed. [599]
Plants drank the offering, leaves trembling with accidental telepathy as they replayed my sister’s last laugh, the one I had tried to forget because it hurt more than her silence. [642]
The miracle swelled, broke its earthen jar, and rose through the tunnel of coffee rings, carrying the laugh upward into the tower room where the frosted hourglass suddenly filled with red sand, time restarting on a new axis. [705]
I stayed underground a moment longer, roots stitching the incision closed with cellulose thread, teaching me that scars are simply stories written sideways so the heart can keep beating. [760]
When I climbed back through the stone, dawn had finished its arc and the osage stood in full leaf, a single green seed resting on the windowsill where the hourglass had been. [800]
I swallowed the seed, tasting her laugh again, and for the first time the wound did not close into a question mark but into a period: an end I could carry without bleeding. [843]
Outside, the meteor hush deepened into ordinary morning, and the plants, their telepathy fading with the serum’s half-life, whispered one last sentence: Now you know how to read us; go teach the silence to speak kindly. [883]
I left the tower lighter by one scar and heavier by one story, the displaced miracle finally home inside the seed, my pulse steady as any reader closing a book at the final page. [943]
