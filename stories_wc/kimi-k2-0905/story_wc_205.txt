The baroque asteroid of Mnemosyne drifted through the visible river of time like a gilded coffin, its cathedrals of obsidian and gold leaf glinting with the burnished sorrow of an age that had learned to watch its own hours corrode. [38]
In the shadow of a shattered rose window, the defunct revolutionary Aurelio Vale knelt, fingering a crystal vase shard he had pried from the rubble of the Forum of Hours, where archaeologists from two rival guilds now screamed at one another across trenches of ticking dust. [58]
The dispute was simple enough to print in a ledger: the Orpheus Guild claimed the asteroid’s mirrored halls proved Mnemosyne had once hosted a civilization that worshipped linear time; the Chronulus Order insisted the same mirrors were instruments for erasing memory, not preserving it. [78]
Yet Aurelio, once the poet-laureate of the uprising that tried and failed to stop the empire from weaponizing time, heard in their shouting only the same hollow cadence that had marched his comrades into the visible gears of the chronoforge. [98]
He pressed the shard against his palm until blood beaded, letting the red smear across the faceted surface, and whispered a stanza he had not yet written: “When hours are glass, the revolution reflects only the shatterer.” [118]
The verse felt useless, but the wound felt instructive; pain, at least, still belonged to him, unlike the years that slipped from his skin like molten pewter whenever the storm of visible time thundered overhead. [138]
Tonight the storm was rising, ribbons of chronal lightning braiding themselves into nooses around the spires, and the guilds retreated to their camps, covering mirrors with waxed canvas because every reflected second multiplied the lightning’s appetite. [158]
Aurelio alone walked the open boulevard, cloak whipping, counting heartbeats that no longer corresponded to any clock, for after the cataclysm every citizen had been granted the curse of watching their remaining grains stream away like luminous sand. [178]
He reached the half-collapsed amphitheater where, in the revolution’s first dawn, he had recited verses to rioters who would later be scattered across centuries as punishment; the stone benches still echoed with their overlapping screams, a chord struck in every key of yesterday. [198]
There he found the child-archaeologist Mira, barely seventeen, sketching mirror inscriptions by lamplight while her guildmates argued over stratigraphy back at camp; her eyes held the same stunned reverence he once reserved for blank pages before the world taught him futility. [218]
She asked if the mirrors truly erased memory, and Aurelio, poetically inclined even in defeat, answered with a question: “Does the sea erase the shore, or merely persuade it to reimagine its shape?” [238]
Together they devised a plan neither guild would sanction: during the eye of the storm they would uncover the largest mirror, the one the Chronulus Order called the Mnemonic Gate, and read its surface not for evidence but for elegy. [258]
They worked in silence, folding back canvas while thunder of unborn centuries rolled overhead, and when the mirror lay bare it showed them not their faces but the asteroid’s future: Mnemosyne cracked open, its baroque cathedrals flung into vacuum, time itself bleeding out like molten ore. [278]
Mira wept, but Aurelio felt an odd relief; the image confirmed that empires and revolutions alike were only footnotes in the margin of a larger collapse, and footnotes could still be rewritten. [298]
He lifted the crystal shard, now drying with his blood, and scratched a single new line across the silvered glass: “Civilizations fall; the poem remains, revising its readers.” [318]
The mirror shivered, fissures branching like frost across a lake, and the visible storm paused as if listening; for one suspended instant the asteroid’s entire history hung unmoored, a book whose pages had been torn out and now fluttered waiting for reordering. [338]
Aurelio understood the gesture was symbolic, yet symbols were the only tools left to the defunct; he turned to Mira and said, “Take this shard, carry it to whichever guild wins your loyalty, but tell them the past they dig for is only the rough draft of a poem we are still composing.” [358]
She accepted the shard, her reflection in its broken surface multiplied into a constellation of selves, each one possible, each one accountable. [378]
Then they covered the mirror again, because even poems must respect the hunger of storms, and walked back through streets where time dripped from gutters like liquid brass. [398]
Behind them, the scratched line began to glow, letters rearranging themselves into languages no human throat had ever shaped, rewriting
