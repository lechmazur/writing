The gloom-hill coachman arrived at the blooming jetty at twilight, his carriage wheels grinding coral dust that had once been alive. [24]
He carried no passengers, only a cedar box of dried seed pods harvested from the last inland grove before the reef died. [37]
Below the planks, the submerged concord of barnacles and bleached bone clicked like distant drums, a language he understood because he spoke dead languages the way fishermen speak storms. [58]
Every dusk since the cease-fire he had come to fertilize the memory of battle, hoping to let a garden reclaim the battlefield before the narrow vastness of grief widened and swallowed the island. [84]
Tonight the terns wheeled overhead, crying in dialects extinct since the first cannon cracked the reef. [101]
He tilted his head, listening; by understanding bird calls he parsed their warning: tide turning, blood salt thinning, time shortening. [120]
He stepped onto the jetty’s flowering planks where morning-glories had already wound through bullet holes, purple throats open to the sky like surprised mouths. [143]
Opening the box, he chose the largest pod—mahogany, rattling with moon-moth wings—and crushed it against the war-splintered rail so seeds scattered into the foam. [171]
The seeds sank, weighted by memory, and the submerged concord answered with a sigh of fractured shell, accepting the offering. [192]
He whispered to the water in pre-war merfolk idiom, “Grow where iron slept.” [206]
A lone tern landed on the carriage roof, eyeing him; it carried in its beak a rusted uniform button, gift or accusation. [226]
He accepted the button, tucked it beside the remaining pods, and felt the narrow vastness inside him—thin as a reed, wide as horizon—quiver. [249]
The battlefield had been the reef itself, where ships met and tore the coral into graveyard shards; now only the jetty remained, built from that wreckage, blooming because children of both sides had planted vines in secret. [283]
Each night he fertilized the site with seeds and stories, believing vegetation could metabolize gunpowder, turn battle-cry to pollen. [309]
He pressed another pod until it split, releasing helical seeds that spun like propellers, drifting toward the dark water where the submerged concord hummed. [335]
Wind carried the smell of rotting kelp and regret; he translated it into a lullaby in the tongue of the island’s first mothers, singing so the seeds would recognize home. [360]
The tern chorus shifted, and by understanding bird calls he knew they spoke of dawn patrols, of bodies once floating like swollen fruit, now replaced by drifting blossoms. [385]
His voice cracked on a word that meant both “bury” and “birth,” and the narrow vastness trembled again, a tide inside his ribs. [405]
He scattered the last handful, then climbed onto the carriage roof to wait, boots dripping. [420]
Below, the reef’s ghost stirred; phosphorescence rose, outlining the garden that had already begun—sea-grass threading through rifle barrels, anemones blooming on helmet domes. [448]
He felt the moment the submerged concord accepted the truce encoded in chlorophyll, and the jetty creaked as roots took hold beneath, tightening warped timber into something like prayer. [475]
The terns lifted as one, circling, and in their spiral he read the future: vines would strangle the last markers of territory, flowers would obscure regimental colors, fruit would sweeten the air until no tongue could taste salt without tasting forgiveness. [515]
He spoke dead languages to the sky, promising the fallen that their names would be pronounced by bees. [535]
When the moon cleared the horizon, its light revealed the first shoot breaking through a plank beside his foot, green blade pushing apart splinters with slow certainty. [560]
He knelt, touched it, and felt the narrow vastness inside him finally widen enough to let breath move without pain. [580]
The coachman descended, closed the empty box, and turned the carriage toward the dark hills, leaving the jetty to its blooming, the reef to its dreaming, the garden to its quiet reclaiming. [620]
Behind him, seeds kept falling in the minds of birds, and the submerged concord sang back in languages newly alive. [645]
At the crest of the gloom-hill road he stopped, looked seaward, and saw the jetty’s flowers glowing like low stars, proof that even after the reef dies something can still choose to grow. [685]
He flicked the reins, not toward home—there was none—but toward the next battlefield that needed forgetting, carrying only the tern-given button and the certainty that every narrow vastness could, with enough seed and song
