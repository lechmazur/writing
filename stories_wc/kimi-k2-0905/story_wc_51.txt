After the first snowmelt, when the mountain streams still carried the taste of winter, the fractal weaver descended into the bronze grotto under starlight. [28]  
The shingled hush of the cavern pressed against her ears like whalebone reverie, each metallic tile on the wall overlapping in perfect silence. [45]  
She carried only a kerosene lamp burner strapped to her chest, its glass chimney cracked but still capable of cradling a single steady flame. [70]  
The grotto had no edges; it curved back into itself until every direction felt like forward, boundary-lessly trapping her in recursive reflections of her own silhouette cast in burnished copper. [100]  
She had come to collect the weights of different burdens, the invisible stones people strapped to their hearts: guilt for words never spoken, grief for hands never held. [130]  
Each burden had a density, and only by gathering them could she re-weave the fractal lattice that kept the valley above from folding in on itself like crumpled paper. [165]  
She knelt beside a pool of rainwater that had dripped through the bronze seams and oriented properly, aligning her breathing with the sevenfold symmetry etched into the floor. [205]  
The burner hissed; she tilted it so the flame kissed the metal tile, and a low auric note rang out, calcifying the air into thin translucent sheets that floated like moth wings. [245]  
On each sheet appeared a memory: a farmer lamenting the ox that died mid-plow, a child mourning the kite swallowed by a storm, an old woman tallying the years since her daughter left. [285]  
The fractal weaver touched each sheet with her forefinger, and it folded itself into a smaller and smaller square, denser than lead yet weightless, until it became a single thread of dark amber. [325]  
She strung the threads across her loom of antler and starlight, weaving them into a pattern that repeated forever inward, a mandala of sorrow balanced by the equal weight of release. [365]  
But the grotto resisted, tightening its shingled hush until the silence itself grew heavy, pressing the air from her lungs. [390]  
The kerosene lamp burner sputtered; without its flame the bronze walls would cool and seize, locking her inside an eternal now where every burden she collected would rebound back into her own chest. [430]  
She remembered the teaching: only by giving weight to her own burden could the lattice hold. [455]  
So she spoke aloud the one story she never wove: the day she left her sister at the cliff’s edge, arguing over who would carry their mother’s last letter, and how the wind took the paper, and her sister’s hand with it. [505]  
The grotto listened; the shingled hush rippled like a whale’s flank breaking the surface of a dream. [525]  
The confession calcified into a sheet heavier than all the others, black as obsidian, and when she touched it the edges cut her finger, letting a single drop of blood fall onto the burner’s wick. [570]  
The flame flared violet, illuminating the bronze tiles so that every reflection showed her sister’s face, not accusatory but forgiving, repeating into infinity. [605]  
The boundary-lessly trapped space unfolded, walls peeling back like petals until a shaft of real starlight pierced the roof and landed on the completed weave. [645]  
The weave rose, buoyant, and she felt the valley above settle as if a giant had exhaled. [665]  
She left the kerosene lamp burner behind, its glass chimney now filled with solidified light, a small sun to guide whoever next descended after the snowmelt. [705]  
Climbing out, she carried no threads, only the memory of their weight, balanced evenly against the hollow where her own burden had been. [740]  
Behind her, the bronze grotto sealed itself with a soft metallic sigh, the shingled hush restored, waiting for the next weaver who must learn that to collect the weights of different burdens one must first surrender the heaviest stone nestled against one's own heart. [800]
