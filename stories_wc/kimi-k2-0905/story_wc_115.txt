The hush that followed Father Mallory’s confession clung to the abandoned train tunnel like damp wool, and I—Jules, reckless explorer of condemned mills—stood frozen, flashlight trembling. [32]
He had just admitted that the 1987 “ghost shift” at Saint Anne’s Valve Works—when machines ran themselves after midnight—wasn’t folklore; he’d locked the workers inside to test their faith, and thirty-one souls never clocked out. [45]
My own faith, long ago corroded into religiously skeptical iron, rang hollow as I appraised the beaded valve wheel he’d pressed into my palm: brass, cold, its rosary-like beads worn smooth by palms that had prayed while dies stamped and cutters screamed. [58]
“Find the weight of what we swallowed that night,” he whispered, voice crumbling like tunnel brick, before retreating into darkness that smelled of creosote and unspoken sin. [71]
I needed numbers, not prayer, so I tuned my pocket radio to the only station the tunnel’s steel ribs would carry: WLIT, “Night Light with Madame Vega,” where frantic callers begged psychics to interpret clanking dreams. [84]
A woman sobbed that her dead husband kept turning a valve in her kitchen, each bead clicking like a decade of the rosary; the host murmured hydraulic metaphors for purgatory. [96]
I mapped her cadence—three clicks, pause, five—against the wheel’s beads: exactly the sequence stamped on the side of every Saint Anne’s relief valve, lot #87-31. [108]
Drowsy alertness overtook me, that gauzy consciousness where shadows elongate and every echo feels prophetic; the tunnel seemed to inhale, preparing to speak. [120]
I walked deeper, soles crunching on coal dust communion wafers, until the rails ended at a rusted bulkhead door stenciled “GHOST SHIFT ONLY—NO EXIT.” [132]
The wheel fit its spindle like a skeleton key; when I turned it, beads clacked the woman’s code back to me, and the door sighed open on pneumatic memory. [144]
Inside lay the factory floor preserved under tunnel rockfall: lathes still humming with residual magnetism, timecards fluttering like moths, and thirty-one pairs of boots standing empty, laces tied. [157]
On the central control panel a single green bulb pulsed—an eternal all-clear for workers who would never leave—casting sickly light over a ledger open to the final tally: “Net weight of truth: 1,887 lbs.” [171]
I understood then that the swallowed truth wasn’t metaphor; it was physical, ingested in the coolant mist they breathed, the metallic taste they joked was “the body of industry.” [183]
My radio crackled again; this time my own voice came through, delayed by seven seconds, asking Madame Vega how heavy guilt must be before it collapses a soul. [195]
I spun the wheel harder, hoping to bleed pressure from the past, but every revolution tightened the air, compressing confession into something measurable on the scales of conscience. [207]
The bulb flared white; the boots filled with translucent shapes shouldering tools, and they turned to me with eyes like caliper marks—precise, unforgiving. [219]
They did not speak; they only offered their open mouths, each tongue holding a tiny brass bead, and I knew I was meant to weigh them, one by one, against the wheel in my hand. [232]
I placed the first bead on the rim; the tunnel’s hush deepened, as if the confession had been merely the opening prayer of a longer liturgy. [244]
With each bead added, the wheel grew heavier, but my arms, animated by recklessness, kept lifting, counting, appraising, until the thirty-first bead clicked into place and the wheel sank, suddenly massless. [258]
The green bulb burst; darkness swallowed the scene, and when my flashlight flicked back on I was alone outside the bulkhead, door sealed, wheel gone, palms tattooed with bead-shaped burns. [271]
I staggered toward daylight; the radio now played only static, but within its snow I could still hear the rhythm—three clicks, pause, five—like a heartbeat learning the weight of its own continuation. [284]
At the tunnel mouth dawn exhaled diesel-pink light; I stepped into it feeling both emptied and ballasted, as if the truth had been transferred from their lungs to mine, its mass precisely 1,887 lbs of reckoning. [297]
I would spend future nights in other abandoned places, but no mill would ever feel as haunted as my own chest, where thirty-one brass beads click against my ribs whenever I breathe. [310]
Father Mallory’s final confession had ended, yet mine had begun, transmitted
