The rain-beaded skylight loft hummed with the soft percussion of water on glass while the kettle boils. [22]
Mara, the lion tamer's widow, set the ash wood carving blank on the workbench beside the cold iron cage latch she had removed from the wagon the night Emil died. [46]
Its surface smelled of sawdust and thunder, hauntingly practical, the way Emil’s voice used to cut through sawdust and roar alike. [69]
She needed to contain the memory of his last performance, the one where the lion paused instead of leaping, and time crystallized into a single held breath. [97]
She traced the blank with a thumb calloused from years of gripping safety ropes, feeling the grain swirl like the mane she once braided with scarlet ribbons. [130]
Here and gone, Emil had laughed that morning, kissing her beneath this same skylight while storm clouds gathered; now only the echo of his boots remained, caught in the warp of the floorboards. [171]
The kettle clicked off, and in the sudden hush she lifted the blank, angling it so rain-light pooled across its untouched face, a mirror for everything she refused to forget. [211]
She would harvest lessons from loss the way Emil taught her to harvest trust from predators: move slow, speak softer, never blink first. [247]
With a chisel ground from an old tent stake, she began the first cut, following the line where Emil’s shoulder had blocked the lion’s charge, letting the wood remember the shape of courage. [292]
Each curl that fell carried rust-hued peace, the color of the sawdust that soaked up blood without complaint the night the lion’s claw found Emil’s artery. [332]
She worked while the kettle cools, steam ghosting the loft like the breath of animals waiting in the dark, and she felt the room tilt into the past. [368]
Through crystallized time she saw Emil’s gloved hand slip into hers after the funeral, promising he would stay if she just kept the cage door closed; but cages were made to open, and promises to scatter. [417]
The carving grew: a miniature ring, a stool, a man mid-bow, all contained within the curve of a sleeping lion whose eyes were closed in mercy or grief—she could no longer tell. [463]
She sanded the man’s smile until it matched the photograph she kept tucked in her apron, the one where he’s holding her above his head like a trophy, rainbows from the misting tent prismed across their skin. [518]
Outside, the storm moved on, leaving only the drip of gutters and the scent of wet asphalt climbing the fire escape. [549]
Mara set the finished piece on the windowsill so morning would strike it first, a sentinel of here and gone, its surface already warming under her palm as if Emil’s pulse had transferred into the grain. [604]
She whispered the three commands he used inside the cage: wait, watch, come; the lion had obeyed, but death had better hearing. [642]
The loft felt larger now, the way a tent does after the audience leaves, stakes loosened and canvas sighing. [671]
She swept the shavings into a jar labeled “Manes & Mettle,” tucked it beside the others: “Ropes & Reasons,” “Crowds & Quiet,” each season of marriage distilled to sawdust and labeled like spices. [719]
When the next kettle boils she will carve again, this time the lion’s face, eyes open, to teach herself that memory can be both cage and key. [760]
She lifted the latch from the bench, hung it on a nail beside the skylight, and let the rust-hued peace settle over her like a cloak the color of sawdust at sunset, while the rain-beaded glass above reflected both her face and the empty ring below, here and gone in the same breath. [800]
