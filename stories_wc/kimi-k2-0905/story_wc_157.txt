The charming rogue scholar Arlo Finch adjusted his cracked spectacles inside the entomologist's greenhouse, where orchid bees droned like tiny tax auditors. [24]
After thoughts became taxable, every unmonitored synapse was a rebellion, and Arlo's mind still owed back-taxes on three unauthorized dreams. [37]
He shook the gourd rattle seed he always carried; inside its dried shell, a single seed clicked like a clock counting down to chaos. [55]
That seed was his ticket into the secret language club that met beneath this very greenhouse, a society whose members spoke only through living patterns. [75]
Tonight the club would warp the municipal grid by planting message-glyphs across community gardens, spelling out a candidly cryptic warning the surveillance drones could not parse. [98]
Arlo’s motivation was simple: to stand guard over your own spark of defiance before the Revenue Bureau snuffed it with a surtax on hope. [120]
He knelt between rows of passionvine, pretending to inspect a caterpillar while palming the seed into a pot of moonlit soil. [143]
The greenhouse glass shimmered; the air felt like converging chaos pressurized inside a jar. [162]
A voice behind him spoke in the club’s vegetal code: three snapped orchid stems, two wilted petals placed left, one right. [185]
Arlo replied by twisting a tendril into a question mark, asking whether the warp sequence was ready. [205]
The answer came as a beetle crawling clockwise around a fig—affirmative, but sentries near. [225]
He exhaled, tasting nectar and nerves, then pressed the gourd rattle seed two knuckles deep, exactly where the club’s cartographer had calculated the first glyph. [254]
Above, a drone’s lens swept like a scythe; Arlo smiled the charming rogue scholar’s smile that had once talked a librarian into torching overdue records. [285]
Thoughts rippled outward—each one declared on Form 1099-IDEA—yet he let them bloom anyway, defiance fertilized by risk. [310]
The seed pulsed, drinking his taxed imaginings; a miniature warp opened in the soil, a curled green comma rewriting the sentence of reality. [337]
Through that comma he glimpsed the club’s future: rooftops quilted with flowering sentences, bees carrying subversive pollen, citizens waking to find their dreams refunded. [370]
Footsteps crunched; Inspector Voss, badge glinting like a beetle’s shell, stepped between the benches. [390]
“Late for horticulture, Finch,” Voss said, voice candidly cryptic as always, meaning every syllable might indict you or invite you to tea. [415]
Arlo shrugged, letting the gourd rattle seed’s empty husk dangle from his fingers like a spent bullet casing. [437]
“Just auditing my own thoughts,” he replied, “making sure none escape untaxed.” [456]
Voss scanned the pot, but the warp had sealed, leaving only innocent loam. [473]
Still, the inspector’s presence signaled converging chaos: one more minute and the nightly satellite pass would photograph any unregistered growth. [498]
Arlo needed to plant the remaining six seeds across the city’s community gardens before dawn, weaving the full candidly cryptic sentence that would wake sleepers’ sparks. [535]
He bowed slightly, scholarly charm dialed to maximum, and recited a line of Lucretius on the swerve of atoms—harmless classicism to Voss, activation passphrase to the club. [575]
Hidden speakers among the orchids clicked: the greenhouse’s own ventilation system began puffing clouds of invisible pollen, each grain a syllable in the secret language. [608]
Voss sneezed, eyes watering, surveillance momentarily blurred; Arlo used the warp residue to slip sideways, reappearing outside the greenhouse gate, seed pouch lighter by one. [648]
He sprinted down alleys where moonlight taxed itself for the privilege of existing, heading toward the next garden, the next glyph, the next spark to guard. [680]
Behind him, the greenhouse dome shimmered again as the planted seed germinated overnight into a vine spelling “Resist” in cursive only fireflies could read. [720]
By sunrise, seven gardens would bloom with that single candidly cryptic word, and every citizen walking past would feel an untaxed thought unfurl—Arlo’s gift, the charming rogue scholar’s ransom for freedom. [800]
