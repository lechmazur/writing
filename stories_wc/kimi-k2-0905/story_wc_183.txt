The fog over Blackwater Bay was thick enough to chew when Cassia spotted the derelict carnival ship listing like a drunkard between the rocks. [24]
She had come here chasing rumors of a chimera twin discoverer—someone who could peel back the skin of memory and show you the sibling you never knew you’d eaten in the womb. [42]
Her own dreams had been bleeding green ever since she touched the emerald swatch card at the thrift store, a paint-sample square that hummed with someone else’s nostalgia. [60]
Now the card pulsed against her palm, guiding her across the gangplank the tide had slammed against the hull, its edges softened by salt and time. [78]
Inside, the ship’s funhouse corridors still stank of popcorn butter and rust; prize plushies floated in ankle-deep bilge like drowned idols. [95]
Cassia whispered the name she was hunting—"the garden of forgotten names"—and heard it echo back in three voices that were almost hers. [112]
She found the discoverer in the big-top tent that had once been the ship’s cargo hold, a woman whose body braided lion, goat, and serpent so seamlessly that the seams themselves looked like silver embroidery. [133]
The chimera sat on a throne of cracked mirrors, tail idly sketching spirals in sawdust that glittered with broken glass. [149]
“I don’t give solace,” the creature said before Cassia could speak, “only the unkindled kind—the comfort that never caught fire, so it can’t burn you.” [168]
Cassia held up the emerald swatch; under the tent’s torn canvas roof it projected a hologram of a playground at dusk, children swinging in slow motion until their faces blurred into initials. [188]
“That green is the first thread,” the chimera said, eyes dilating until they became keyholes. [200]
She explained that memories are not erased but displaced, stitched into carnival attractions by people who could not bear their weight; to find the garden, Cassia would have to recapture her own threads and weave them into a map. [225]
The chimera bit her own wrist; golden blood dripped onto the sawdust and spelled coordinates that rearranged themselves every time Cassia blinked. [245]
Time on the ship obeyed different gravity: each sentence spoken aged the air by a season, and Cassia felt her childhood drop away like a coat she had outgrown without noticing. [267]
Together they walked the midway where games still offered prizes: a rubber duck whose squeak replayed a mother’s last lullaby, a shooting gallery where every tin rabbit wore the face of a friend who had ghosted her. [295]
With each recovered thread Cassia felt the blissfully aberrant sensation of becoming more herself by becoming less certain who that was. [315]
She watched her own reflection in a funhouse mirror fracture into twins: one who had stayed home to care for a sick parent, one who had fled to sea; the glass refused to say which was original. [340]
The chimera collected these shards on her tongue, swallowing them until her own roar began to sound like Cassia’s unanswered prayers. [358]
At the ship’s stern they found a carousel horses frozen mid-gallop, manes braided with name-tags fallen off campers who had learned to answer to anything. [378]
Cassia climbed onto a horse the color of oxidized copper; the emerald card fit perfectly into a slot on its pole, and the ride lurched forward, not spinning but unspooling, gears turning into handwriting. [403]
Around her the fog condensed into pages, each paragraph a night she had slept under a different name given by strangers who wanted to keep her. [423]
The chimera ran beside the horse, claws clicking on metal, reading aloud so Cassia could hear the narrative threads braiding into a living lasso. [442]
When the ride stopped they stood at the prow where the ship’s name had once been; now only barnacles spelled letters that rearranged themselves into the word EXIT. [462]
Cassia understood: the garden of forgotten names was not a place but a moment—this moment—when memory finally lets go of the body that kept trying to outrun it. [485]
She touched the chimera’s mane and felt the creature shiver into her own silhouette, two outlines overlapping like Venn diagrams that decided the middle was enough. [506]
The emerald card crumbled into green dust that smelled of cut grass and first-day-of-school nerves; the dust settled on the water, writing a path of stepping-stones made of initials that dissolved as soon as she trusted them with her weight. [532]
Cassia walked back across the gangplank; behind her the ship folded itself into a pop-up book, pages flapping like wings trying to remember how to be
