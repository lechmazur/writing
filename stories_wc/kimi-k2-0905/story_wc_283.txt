The hourglass turner arrived at the amber warehouse beneath the cliffs when the sky was the color of old copper. [22]  
Inside, resinous beams filtered dusk into fossilized honey, and every footstep sounded like a secret being swallowed. [36]  
She carried no luggage except a mason jar sealed with black wax, its label reading “Canyon Echo: 3 oz, unfiltered.” [53]  
For three cycles she had turned the great glass in the monastery tower, watching sand measure out lives like a miser, but yesterday the lower bulb cracked and prophecy began to leak. [82]  
The Abbott declared the future broken; she chose to unscramble it instead. [96]  
Her method was cataloging lost buttons, because buttons are witnesses—snipped off at the throat, the wrist, the heart—and they remember whose fingers fumbled them. [119]  
In the warehouse she found generations of them: horn toggles that once closed a sailor’s coat during a typhoon, jet beads from a mourning dress that absorbed a widow’s hiccupped sobs, a brass uniform disc still warm with the name of a boy who never came back from the cliffs. [156]  
She laid them out on a pine plank, grouping by material, by century, by the pitch of the grief that loosened them. [178]  
With each classification the jar quivered, the echo inside negotiating its own release. [194]  
At dusk she uncorked the wax; the warehouse inhaled a wind that tasted of iron and sage. [210]  
The canyon echo spilled out not as sound but as silence—an unearthed silence that settled over buttons like dust that had waited centuries to decide where to land. [237]  
In that hush she heard every story the buttons guarded, spoken simultaneously without a single syllable. [255]  
The prophecy had claimed: “When the final grain falls, the world will narrow to a thread.” [274]  
But threaded through these discards was a counter-pattern: people keep shedding, keep fastening something new. [292]  
Shared wisdom rose not as revelation but as scent—turpentine of cut pine, salt of dried tears, metallic tang of hope. [312]  
She felt quietly inspired, the way a librarian feels when an unmarked atlas falls open to the exact map a stranger needs. [334]  
Working through the night she restrung buttons into a spiral on the warehouse floor, each circle a generation, each gap a lesson learned too late or too early. [363]  
As the truth unravels, dawn’s first blade slid between cliff and horizon, igniting amber walls into molten glass. [386]  
The hourglass turner stepped into the center of the spiral, boots crunching on plastic four-hole squares and carved nacre. [407]  
She lifted the empty jar; the canyon echo, now fed with stories, rushed back inside willingly—no longer raw noise but refined possibility. [432]  
She sealed it, feeling weight return—not of sand but of choice. [446]  
The prophecy could spin itself into fear, or into thread for anyone brave enough to sew. [464]  
She pocketed two buttons: one carved from walrus ivory etched with a polar bear, one red Bakelite chewed by a child during an air raid. [493]  
Reminders that every ending is fabric awaiting reassembly. [507]  
Outside, the cracked monastery tower glinted like a needle; she would go there next, not to turn the glass but to offer the jar, so the monks might hear how silence teaches when it is listened to collectively. [553]  
The path climbed between cliff shadows, each footstep echoing the warehouse hush, softer now, a lullaby of unscrambled futures. [579]  
Behind her, the amber warehouse stood quiet, buttons gleaming like constellations that had finally agreed on a story they could all inhabit. [604]  
Ahead, the horizon widened, not narrowed, and every grain of possibility—once condemned to fall—hovered, waiting for fingers willing to spin prophecy into raw, rebuttoned possibility. [650]  
She walked on, hourglass heart inverted, no longer measuring loss but gathering beginnings. [674]  
When the first villager met her on the cliff road, she simply opened the jar a crack; the shared wisdom drifted out as warm silence, and without a word they understood: the future is a garment we button together, one recovered scrap at a time. [730]  
So the hourglass turner continued, canyon echo at her side, cataloging the world’s discarded fasteners, teaching any who listened how to unscramble the end until it became an open collar, breathing. [773]  
And beneath the cliffs, the amber warehouse kept its unearthed silence glowing, a hearth for anyone whose story had come undone, a place where lost buttons waited to be chosen again. [800]
