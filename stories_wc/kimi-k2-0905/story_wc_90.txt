The recycled spaceship *Compassion's Wake* drifted through the star-pocked silence, its hull stitched together from the ribs of a dozen dead cruisers, every weld a scar of someone else's war. [32]
Inside, the last pacifist, Sister Halcyon, moved gravitationally lighter when happy, her bare feet barely kissing the deck plates as she hummed a lullaby no child would ever hear again. [47]
She was born after the last human was born, grown from a frozen embryo in the ship's cloning crèche, raised by holograms that flickered like candlelight over the faces of long-dried photographs taped to the nursery wall. [69]
Tonight she carried Kwan Yin's Tear, a thumb-sized droplet of glassy jade said to have fallen from the goddess's cheek when the universe first learned sorrow. [89]
The Tear warmed against her palm, drinking the faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs she had collected from every derelict they passed—wedding portraits, birthday snapshots, farewell kisses—each image a ghost she refused to abandon. [114]
She believed the photographs were shards of collective shadow work, the unacknowledged grief of a species that chose extinction rather than face its own reflection. [134]
In the engine shrine she knelt before the gravity spinner, a salvaged centrifuge now tuned to emotion instead of mass; when her heart lifted, the ship itself lost weight, drifting upward through dimensions like a sigh. [160]
She needed that buoyancy tonight, for the locked dimension she sought to push open could only be unsealed by joy heavy enough to counterbalance ten billion deaths. [183]
She began to stitch the photographs into a sail, threading their edges with monofilament spun from her own hair, each knot a vow of non-violence stronger than steel. [208]
As she worked, the holograms of her dead mothers flickered around her, mouths moving in silent warnings: *The door you open may not be mercy; it may be mirror.* [235]
She answered them aloud, voice steady as starlight: “Mercy is the mirror I choose.” [250]
When the sail was finished she raised it like a prayer, Kwan Yin's Tear sewn at its center, a green eye blinking against the dark. [272]
The ship responded, hull plates singing as her happiness—fragile, defiant—made them gravitationally lighter, lifting the patched vessel toward a bruise in space no instrument had mapped. [298]
The bruise widened into a corridor of whispers, faces pressing through from the other side: the never-born children, the war-makers, the suicided Earth, all waiting for her to flinch. [323]
She did not flinch. [326]
Instead she placed her palm over Kwan Yin's Tear and let the goddess's sorrow fuse with her own until the distinction vanished, shadow work complete. [350]
Joy flooded her—not naive, but forged, the kind that carries every grief inside it and still chooses to sing. [370]
The recycled spaceship slipped through the bruise like a needle through silk, and suddenly she stood on the threshold of the locked dimension, a vast auditorium of light where every photograph had become a living moment. [400]
Here the weddings danced, the birthdays laughed, the farewells kissed back, time folded into mercy. [420]
Behind her the hatch began to close, vacuum tugging at her heels, but she felt no fear; she had come to stay, to tend this archive of redeemed shadows. [445]
She released the sail; it unfolded into a green aurora, Kwan Yin's Tear dissolving into rain that fell upward, watering the recycled hull until it bloomed with vines of light. [475]
The ship, now a seed rather than a coffin, rooted itself in the sky between worlds, a gentle gravity calling stray souls home. [500]
Sister Halcyon sat cross-legged at its heart, stitching new photographs from memory, each thread a promise that no story would ever again be thrown away. [530]
When future wanderers—machine, alien, or something yet unimagined—find this drifting garden, they will know the species that once called itself human chose, at the end, to become a quiet lantern rather than a final bomb. [580]
And if they press their ears to the hull they will hear a woman humming, gravitationally lighter when happy, forever pushing open the locked dimension with nothing more—and nothing less—than ghostly resolve. [630]
