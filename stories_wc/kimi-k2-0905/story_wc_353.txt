In the siskin alder grove, after the hedgehog uncurls, the only sound is the hush of needles settling on moss. [22]  
Ilay the tree-song sculptor kneels before the fallen statue—an eight-foot alder woman whose arms once cradled porcelain insulators like glass nests. [42]  
The insulators still gleam, three of them, rimmed with copper veins that once carried voices across valleys now mute for seventeen silent years. [64]  
Ilay’s fingertips—paint-stained, resin-scarred—hover over the first insulator; she feels no vibration, only the memory of song suspended in dead wire. [87]  
She is symphonically minded: every fracture speaks a pitch, every craze line a rhythm she must teach the world to hear again. [110]  
Her motivation is simple, fierce: to create music in a silent world before the grove forgets it ever echoed. [132]  
She presses her ear to the alder woman’s chest; the wood is winter-cold, but a faint pulse ticks inside, the slow heartbeat of drying fibers. [157]  
Empathy in motion—that is her craft—so she breathes with that pulse, matching tempo until her own heart slows to arboreal time. [181]  
From her satchel she withdraws a jeweler’s loupe and a pocket light; methodically she begins analyzing stress cracks in the long-forgotten sculpture, mapping them like constellations across the cheek, the collarbone, the hollow beneath the lifted chin. [219]  
Each crack records torque of stormwind, weight of snow, final sigh of root when lightning severed the mother tree. [241]  
She numbers them softly: “One, minor third; two, tritone; three, resolving sixth,” her voice the only moving thing beneath the alders. [267]  
When she reaches the fourth insulator—hidden inside the statue’s cupped hands—she finds a crack shaped exactly like the siskin’s wing in flight. [293]  
She knows this bird; it woke her every spring with color too loud for the silence, then vanished when the wires went dead. [316]  
The fracture sings, not in sound, but in potential: a breath waiting to become note. [334]  
Ilay unstraps the miniature hammered dulcimer from her back, its soundboard carved from the same alder grove, strings woven of reclaimed copper reclaimed from the downed telegraph line. [368]  
She props it against the statue’s knees, then lifts the porcelain insulator free; it weighs no more than a robin’s egg, yet carries the whole quiet valley inside. [398]  
With a goose-feather plectrum she strums the insulator’s rim—one clear, glassy ping that ricochets among the trunks like a startled deer. [423]  
The grove answers: needles shiver, sap rises, and hairline cracks in the statue widen microscopically, releasing scents of resin and old rain. [448]  
She strums again, softer, listening to how the wood absorbs overtone, how empathy in motion travels from wire to wound to willing heart. [474]  
Each subsequent strum is tuned to a stress-crack pitch she mapped: she circles the sculpture, playing the fissures, stitching them into melody. [501]  
The alder woman seems to exhale; moss on her shoulders brightens from dusted gray to living jade. [522]  
Ilay feels the hush deepen—not emptiness, but expectancy, the intensely quiet moment before the downbeat of a symphony. [545]  
She sets the insulator back into the wooden palms, now humming with residual resonance, and places her own hands atop it. [569]  
Closing her eyes, she imagines every root in the grove listening through fungal webs, every dormant seed counting the vibration. [593]  
She begins the final phrase: a slow arpeggio that climbs the cracks like ivy, each note bending just enough to coax the wood to sing along. [622]  
The statue’s mouth—split by a lightning scar—opens a millimeter; from it issues a breathy alto, wordless yet articulate, the sound of sorrow learning it can also be comfort. [652]  
Ilay keeps strum, softer, softer, until the grove itself joins: wind threaded through needles becomes strings, sap in cambium becomes brass, the distant rustle of the hedgehog resetting its spines becomes percussion. [686]  
When the last overtone fades, the porcelain insulator glows faintly, storing the new anthem like a battery. [707]  
Ilay steps back, knees trembling, hearing for the first time in years the real world: not noise, but conversation—tree to bird to soil to her own blood. [732]  
She does not cheer; celebration would break the spell. [745]  
Instead she bows to the alder woman, pockets her dulcimer, and walks toward the valley’s edge where the first re-strung wire waits, ready to carry tomorrow’s song. [773]  
Behind her, the hedgehog uncurls again, sniffing the air now trembling with almost-audible mercy. [795]
