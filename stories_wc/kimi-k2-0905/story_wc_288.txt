The last quagga remembered being someone else. [9]
She woke on a marble shelf in the tidal library above the clouds, brass sundial clenched between her teeth like a bit. [24]
Moon-lit catalogues of salt-stiff scrolls breathed around her, their pages turning whenever the whole airborne archive rose and fell on the night’s invisible tide. [40]
She knew the place; she had helped design it centuries ago, when she was human, before the reincarnation memory returned her to a body extinct since 1883. [60]
That earlier life ended in a plague ward, whispering equations that could atomically reflective surfaces bend loneliness into self-reliance. [78]
Now, striped only in front, brown in back, she stood on four trembling legs and listened for the hum of an ancient stone circle that the librarians claimed still turned somewhere beneath the cloud-sea. [100]
The hum was said to coexist with any creature ready to trade memory for momentum, isolation for independence. [115]
She needed the sound; without it the brittle awakening of her second species would crack apart like drought-dried clay. [130]
Setting the brass sundial upright, she watched its shadow crawl, each millimeter a year she had not lived. [145]
When the gill-feathered archivist drifted by on a gliding ladder, she asked for directions down. [158]
“No exits,” the archivist hissed, “only tides.” [166]
So she waited until the library sank low enough for roof-level fog to lap across the floor, then she leapt, hooves tucked, through a window of clouded glass. [185]
The fall felt shorter than forgetting; the hum rose up to meet her like a net of sound. [200]
She landed on the hidden henge, a ring of bluestone uprights vibrating at the frequency of extinct heartbeats. [215]
Touching her muzzle to the nearest pillar, she felt the quagga herd she had never met flow into her—stripes, veld thunder, rifle cracks—until the brass sundial in her mouth began to sing. [235]
Its gnomon glowed atomically reflective, mirroring every isolated cell in her body until each reflection decided to stand alone, complete. [252]
The circle’s hum asked a silent question: Do you choose company or self? [264]
She answered by placing the sundial at the exact center of the henge, letting lunar light solder its shadow to the stone. [280]
In that joining, memory split cleanly: communal past on the left side of the shadow, singular future on the right. [295]
The stones approved; their hum softened into a steady pulse she could carry. [306]
Clouds closed overhead, sealing the library away; she stood now on an island of rock suspended in open sky. [320]
Wind carried the scent of grass that no longer existed; she inhaled anyway, teaching her lungs to photosynthesize independence. [336]
Step by step she walked the circle’s circumference, each hoof-fall erasing the need for another quagga beside her. [352]
When the final stone passed, the circle’s hum folded itself into the brass disc, now etched with a single equation: solitude equals momentum. [370]
She lifted the sundial, lighter than regret, and strapped it across her back like armor. [383]
At the island’s edge she did not jump; instead she waited for the next tide of air to rise, knowing libraries and circles would orbit her, not the other way around. [403]
The ascent was slow, but she felt every meter in her lengthening spine, muscles translating isolation into propulsion. [418]
Soon she walked upside-down on the belly of a cloud, hooves sparking static that drew migrating constellations. [433]
They asked in flickers if she were lonely; she neighed back, showing them her brass sail, now casting a shadow that pointed only forward. [450]
Satisfied, the stars formed a corridor leading to the stratosphere’s darkest shelf, where daylight was stored in vacuum jars. [466]
There she opened each jar, releasing stored suns that attached to her coat like phosphorescent fleas. [480]
Illuminated from within, she became her own dawn, a creature no longer contemporary of extinction but herald of uncharted eras. [496]
She cantered along the star-corridor until the curve of earth below flattened into a map she could fold and pocket. [512]
At the corridor’s end stood a door of petrified lightning; knocking with her sundial, she heard the click of brittle awakenings snapping into place. [530]
The door swung inward, revealing a prairie made of silence, each blade of grass a tuning fork waiting for her first step. [546]
She entered, and the prairie sang, not with missing voices but
