The skilled tide dancer named Lysira stepped into the twilight garden under stars, her bare feet sinking into moss still warm from the day’s last sigh. [25]  
After the nostalgia ban, every citizen of the Celestial Coast had been scrubbed of memory’s music, yet Lysira’s body kept the rhythm, hips forecasting surf that no longer officially existed. [51]  
She carried no lantern; instead, a pinch of moonstone cabochon dust speck shimmered at the hollow of her throat, a contraband fragment ground from the palace mirror that once reflected the moon itself. [80]  
Elective exile had been her sentence and her choice: dance for the court’s propaganda, or walk away and never again feel tides pulled by a crowd’s hunger. [107]  
She chose absence, but absence refused to remain empty; it grew teeth, chewed at her ankles each dawn until she returned to this garden where memory’s scent lingered like night-blooming datura. [139]  
Tonight the air tasted of obsidian grace, smooth and cutting, a flavor she knew from the moment she first fledged—spontaneously anchored—at age seven, when moonrise glued her shadow to the breakwater and taught it to pirouette without her. [171]  
Now, at twenty-seven, she would fledge again, not bones but words, and the method would be to observe gaps: the hush between cricket chords, the black river between stars, the breath a lover withholds before saying stay. [204]  
She circled the marble rim of the long-dry fountain, palms describing spirals that tugged faint luminescence from the moonstone dust, each fleck a syllable of forbidden lunar grammar. [234]  
Her motivation rose like an underground spring: to pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin—her own—inkless, scarless, a constellation bruised into collarbones that could outwit the censors’ gaze. [265]  
She began by dancing the gaps, soles printing absence into dew, letting the garden’s hush teach her where memory hides when history is forbidden. [293]  
With every turn she subtracted herself, a sculptor removing everything that was not tide, until only tide remained, tethered to her by the moonstone’s whisper. [323]  
The dust lifted, orbiting her wrists like obedient minnows; she spoke to them in the language of undertow, promising return if they would braid a verse across her ribs. [354]  
They answered by drawing silver lines that did not reflect starlight but absorbed it, creating new constellations shaped like questions no bureaucrat had thought to ban. [384]  
She felt the moment her skin began to fledge—not feathers but phrases, each emerging where sweat met sky, a strophe of darkness visible only when the reader blinks. [416]  
The first line spiraled beneath her left breast: “Remember the sea that forgot you,” obsidian grace etched in living dusk. [444]  
Second, across the arch of her foot: “Exile is the tide that never arrives yet always recedes,” the sentence aching like cold salt in a wound one cannot name. [478]  
She danced faster, chasing the twilight garden’s vanishing color, knowing sunrise would seal the ink if she faltered. [503]  
Third line, at the nape of her neck where a lover’s sigh might rest: “I anchor only in the interval between heartbeats,” spontaneously anchored indeed, for the words rooted her nowhere and everywhere. [541]  
The final verse demanded sacrifice; the moonstone dust dimmed, its last grain burning to form a period that completed the stanza across her pulse: “Skin ends, verse orbits, stars read.” [574]  
She halted, chest heaving, garden silent as if the crickets themselves feared to punctuate her. [595]  
Lysira touched the new cosmos clothing her, felt it hum like a tide pulled by an unseen moon, and understood she had become the forbidden memory. [623]  
Elective exile had not removed her from the world; it had removed the world from inside her, leaving space for this darker, kinder firmament. [653]  
She walked toward the eastern gate where dawn would soon prowl, each step a stanza the dictators of nostalgia could never confiscate, for it lived beneath the threshold of sight. [686]  
Behind her, the twilight garden exhaled, stars rearranging themselves into the shape of a dancer mid-leap, a signature no ban could unsay. [715]  
When the first sentry of morning light arrived, it found only footprints spiraling into absence, and somewhere far beyond the seawall, a woman whose skin sang verses only the tide could read, forever fledged. [749]  
She smiled, obsidian grace cutting her face into a crescent moon, and began the long walk toward the horizon that had never stopped waiting for her return. [778]
