The loop pedal priest stood at the dimensional anchor, his fingers hovering over the silver switches that could trap sound between seconds. [24]  
Before the possession completes, he needed to plumb the congregation’s unspoken fears, not with sermons but through rhetorical devices that decorated with silence. [39]  
He pressed RECORD; the first layer was a heartbeat, his own, muffled clarity against the marble nave. [52]  
Second layer: a cough from the back pew, dry and nervous, caught and released like a bird testing stained glass. [67]  
Third: the faint scrape of an artist’s palette with one color—ultramarine so deep it looked wet even when dry—carried by the woman who arrived early every dusk. [86]  
She always sat beneath the cracked fresco of the fallen star, knees together, palette balanced on her lap as if she meant to paint the air itself. [104]  
Tonight the priest felt the stillness unraveling; it slid down the pillars in slow coils, thick as incense yet odorless, dimming the candle flames without moving them. [123]  
He knew the signs: when silence begins to echo, something else is learning to speak. [134]  
So he looped the heartbeat, the cough, the scrape, weaving them into a rope of sound he could lower into the void beneath their collective tongue. [149]  
Between cycles he asked, “What color is doubt?” [155]  
No one answered; the loop supplied their hesitation, a fourth layer now, a hush that grew teeth. [166]  
The woman lifted her palette, tilting it so the single blue caught the nave’s last true light. [178]  
Blue like the hour before possession, he thought, when the soul’s hinges squeak but have not yet opened. [190]  
He stepped down from the chancel, cassock brushing dust that also preferred not to settle. [202]  
Each footfall became a fifth layer: soft leather on stone, a sound that apologized for existing. [214]  
He stopped before her and whispered into the pickup, “If we frame the question rightly, will the answer still need us?” [228]  
The loop played it back at half speed, vowels sagging until the sentence sounded like surrender. [239]  
She dipped a finger into the ultramarine, then drew a small cross on the back of the pew, pigment bright against dark oak. [252]  
The cross began to sink, wood accepting color the way flesh accepts memory—slowly, then all at once. [264]  
He recognized the method: she was painting negative space, letting the object define the absence around it. [276]  
In that absence he heard what they all assumed: that faith was a wall, not a door. [286]  
He pressed OVERDUB, adding their assumption as a sixth layer, a low hum pitched just below human hearing. [299]  
The congregation swayed, unaware they were listening to themselves not believe. [309]  
The unraveled stillness tightened, threading through the hum, pulling color from the cross until the pew looked untouched and the woman’s fingertip was blank. [324]  
Time thinned; he felt the possession reach the narthex, brushing the font, tasting holy water that could not burn it because doubt had diluted it. [338]  
He had one loop left. [342]  
He knelt, microphone against his sternum, and recorded the sound of his own doubt: a single swallow that tasted of iron and evening. [356]  
He set the playback to infinite reverse. [361]  
The swallow became a tide, pulling every layer back into his chest—heartbeat, cough, scrape, hesitation, footfall, hum—until the nave was acoustically naked. [376]  
In the sudden vacuum the woman spoke, voice unamplified yet perfectly audible: “The wall is only blue because we agreed not to touch it.” [392]  
The priest smiled, tasting blood where the iron had been. [400]  
He stood, switched off the pedal, and the dimensional anchor released its hold; the silence that remained was whole, not hiding. [414]  
The possession, deprived of unanswered questions, passed through the open door of their newfound clarity and kept walking. [427]  
Outside, dawn rehearsed its colors, but inside the ultramarine had dried into an ordinary chip of paint, no longer enough to anchor a dimension. [443]  
The woman tucked the palette into her satchel; the priest noticed she had added a second color—barely a fleck—of raw sienna, the shade of earth after rain. [459]  
Together they walked out, leaving the loop pedal on the altar like a confession that had nothing left to confess. [474]  
Behind them the church exhaled, walls settling into a
