The loop pedal priest stood at the dimensional anchor, his fingers hovering over the silver switches that could trap sound in endless circles. [24]  
Before the possession completes, he needed to plumb the depths of the congregation’s unspoken fears, to illuminate hidden assumptions that pulsed like bruises beneath their hymns. [42]  
The sanctuary had been built on a fold in space where echoes lingered longer than lungs; its vaulted ribs were struts of unraveled stillness, a place that decorates with silence the way other temples gild their rafters with gold. [68]  
He pressed record, and the first footstep became a rosary of clicks, each repetition softer, as if walking away from itself into fog. [84]  
With rhetorical devices he sculpted the loop: a question that swallowed its own tail, an anaphora that begged forgiveness for existing, a chiasmus that crossed belief and doubt like strangers on a bridge at dusk. [107]  
Between phrases he left pockets of null air, teaching the assembly that absence can be ornament, that what is withheld may illuminate hidden assumptions more starkly than any sermon. [130]  
An artist’s palette with one color—an ultraviolet no eye can hold—rested on the altar rail; the priest had traded his final sunrise for it, promising to mix a hue that would reveal the stains left by secret sins. [161]  
He dipped the brush in silence, painted the edges of the loop, each stroke subtracting sound until the nave felt cupped under water. [180]  
Congregants arrived expecting thunderous organs; instead they stepped into muffled clarity, their heartbeats suddenly foreign instruments. [198]  
He invited them to speak, then captured those syllables, played them back slower, reversed, stretched until meaning dissolved and only texture remained, a skin of doubt they could not name. [225]  
A widow heard her condolence become a lullaby for the child she never had; a banker heard his apology turn into the jingle of coins he once stole from the poor box. [254]  
Each revelation was a knot loosened in the net that held them to the coming possession; the demon fed on certainty, and the priest starved it with ambiguity. [279]  
When the first tremor of otherworldly cold brushed their ankles, the priest raised the palette; the single color leaked into the air like ink in water, tinting the silence with unseen light. [305]  
Under its influence, the loops began to overlap, forming chords of contradiction: I believe, I believe not, I believe. [323]  
The dimensional anchor groaned, its geometry stressed by the weight of so many simultaneous truths; stone ribs flexed like whale bones around a swallowed sea. [348]  
He spoke the final rhetorical device, a paradox whispered directly into the feedback: “What possesses you if not the need to be possessed?” [374]  
The demon, half-entered, hesitated, tasting the vacancy carved for it; it required a host who knew what they wanted, and the congregation now knew only questions. [398]  
In that suspended instant before the possession completes, the priest stepped into his own loop, letting his voice circle forever: “I illuminate hidden assumptions, I illuminate hidden assumptions.” [428]  
The colorless color drained from the palette, soaking the loop until the words became transparent, a prism that split silence into unheard spectra. [452]  
Congregants felt the demon slip past them like wind through a net, drawn instead into the spinning phrase, chasing its own tail around the nave. [477]  
With each revolution the entity shrank, folded, a Möbius strip of intent without object, hunger without name. [495]  
The priest’s body slackened; he had become the anchor, the still point around which unraveled stillness rotated, a living axle in the mechanism of doubt. [521]  
The loops slowed, stretched, finally lay flat like waves frozen at midnight; the sanctuary exhaled, decorates with silence once more, but now the ornament was alive, watching. [550]  
They left him there, a statue ears could see, a reminder that faith is safest when it questions its own pulse. [573]  
On quiet nights, townsfolk return to sit in the back pews, listening for the faint revolutions of his vow, a muffled clarity that keeps their certainties politely starved. [600]  
And somewhere in the circuits of the loop pedal, the demon spins, forever trying to answer a question that will not settle, illuminating hidden assumptions it cannot grasp, while the single color waits on the altar, ready to bleed again should anyone crave the comfort of unseen light. [656]
