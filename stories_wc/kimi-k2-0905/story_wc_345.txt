The ghost of Mara drifted between the twin suns of Orchard Planet, her translucent fingers brushing the leaves of gravity-defying apple trees that grew sideways from floating rock arches. [34]  
She had died three seasons ago, yet the planet’s nebula of respite—a violet cloud that slowed time for the grieving—kept her altruistic spirit tethered instead of releasing her to the stars. [52]  
Below, the butterfly garden watering bell glinted where she had left it beside the chalk-dusted path, its bronze rim still warm from the last human hand that had rung it at dusk. [72]  
Mara’s purpose had sharpened after strangers became family: the crash-landed colonists who once quarreled over rations now shared roofs, songs, and surnames. [90]  
But the floating rock arches were beginning to tilt, their anti-grav seeds dying, and only a coordinated harvest of seed-fruit before the next eclipse could save the orchards that fed them all. [110]  
To orchestrate collective effort, Mara had to reexamine the living’s trust in her, for ghosts were feared even when they smiled. [128]  
At dawn, she drifted low, condensation swirling where her ankles should have been, and began the method that felt strangely trustworthy even to her: messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn. [150]  
She could not hold chalk, but she could chill the slate until dew froze into letters, each word a frosted whisper. [168]  
“North orchard, arch seven—bring ladders at first light,” she wrote, the curve of the R shaped like a butterfly wing. [185]  
The watering bell rang itself in the breeze, its tone brambled hope, a clang like berries caught in wire—beautiful because it hurt. [204]  
Kai, the once-lonely engineer, stepped out barefoot, read the line, and felt the ghost’s altruistic pulse travel up his soles like mild electricity. [224]  
He woke the others, not with orders but with coffee brewed from last year’s roasted seeds, the aroma weaving them together more tightly than any speech. [245]  
By the time the second sentence appeared—“Share breath, share weight, share sky”—the sidewalk had become a living parchment, children adding doodles of wings and arches. [266]  
Mara guided their eyes by chilling stars into arrows; the nebula above mirrored her work, its violet folds shaping a slow spiral of respite that calmed arguments before they formed. [288]  
Yet doubt crawled in: why follow a ghost who might vanish once the crisis passed? [302]  
So she let them reexamine her motives through labor; she circled the canopy, knocking the healthiest fruit down only when hands below were ready to catch, proving she saw them, needed them, loved them still. [327]  
The watering bell rang again, and this time Kai answered it, carrying it from garden to garden, its bronze voice measuring their rhythm like a heart. [347]  
Each clang loosened fear; each chalk line tightened purpose. [357]  
On the third dawn, the final message appeared not in frost but in pigment: crushed butterfly-wing dust mixed with dew, iridescent and impossible to erase. [378]  
“Seed-fruit must ride the arch wind together—one ladder alone tilts the sky.” [394]  
The sentence terrified and thrilled them; it was the paradox of brambled hope, the sweetness that stings. [410]  
They formed chains along the floating rock, human ropes swaying above cloud, grandmothers anchoring ropes with stories of old-earth orchards, toddlers passing fruit into baskets that hovered like loyal moons. [435]  
Mara’s ghost arms could not lift, but she could balance, becoming the counterweight no scale had predicted, her form flickering where weight was needed most. [456]  
When the last seed-fruit was secured, the arches sighed, righted themselves, roots re-grafting to invisible axis threads. [474]  
The nebula of respite brightened, expanding until every colonist tasted violet on their tongues, a moment of shared anesthesia that bound them more than ceremony ever could. [495]  
Mara felt the tether loosen; her altruism had found its own heartbeat in theirs. [508]  
She drifted to the butterfly garden, rang the watering bell once with a gust of farewell, and the sound was pure, unbrambled now, a single note of release. [528]  
Kai chalked the final message himself as dawn warmed into gold: “Ghost or gardener, family is the crop we keep replanting.” [548]  
The letters dried, permanent, and Mara smiled, her edges blurring into the nebula until she became the violet itself, a reservoir of respite ready to catch the next wave of grief and turn it into harvest. [574]  
Years later, children who never knew her name still pause at that sidewalk, feeling an unexplainable trust rise through their soles, urging them to look up at the floating arches and remember that survival is a collective verb. [600]  
They ring the watering bell before every harvest, its bronze throat singing brambled hope across the orchard planet, ensuring no stranger stays a stranger long enough to fall alone. [628]  
And somewhere in the violet haze, Mara listens, content that her death has finished its slow ripening into shared life. [646]
