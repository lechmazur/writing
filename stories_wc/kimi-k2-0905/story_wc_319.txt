The feral library guardian prowled the frozen garden in mist, her breath crystallizing into tiny suspended commas that refused to punctuate the night. [24]
She had once been a cataloguer of certainties, but the cultist's pendant warming against her ribs kept whispering that knowledge was just another way of being dimensionally homesick. [38]
Through the veil of sleep she drifted each dusk, leaving her body curled between frostbitten topiaries while her mind practiced interiorizing exteriors—turning the garden's statues into memories she could carry back to whatever plane had exiled her. [58]
Tonight the mist clung thicker, tasting of iron and old parchment, and she realized she was no longer waiting for answers but learning to wait within the questions themselves. [78]
The pendant pulsed, its sigil rotating like a compass rose that pointed nowhere, reminding her that the boundaries of light were not edges but invitations to trespass. [96]
She pressed her paw—no, her hand—against a frozen rose, feeling how the ice interiorized the bloom's exterior, preserving what could never again open yet refusing to let it close. [116]
"Friend," she whispered to the uncertainty creeping between her claws, "I have been trying to make friends with you my whole life without knowing your name." [135]
The garden answered by thickening the fog until each breath became a page she had not yet written, each exhale a story dissolving before it could be shelved. [153]
She remembered when the cultist had come, how his eyes held the same dimensional homesickness, how he had pressed the pendant into her fur saying, "This will teach you that waiting is not absence but attendance." [175]
Now she understood: the library she guarded was not made of books but of boundaries, each threshold a volume of light pressed between darkness and darker darkness. [195]
She began walking the perimeter, counting her steps like syllables of a spell she was inventing in reverse, each footfall interiorizing the garden's exterior until the frost became her bones, the mist her blood. [217]
At the garden's heart stood a sundial buried in snow, its gnomon casting no shadow because the moonlight had forgotten how to be sharp. [235]
She licked the metal—tasting centuries of waiting—and felt the boundaries of light rearrange themselves inside her mouth like words she had always known but never spoken. [254]
The pendant grew hot now, branding her chest with the cultist's sigil, and she understood he had not been a cultist at all but another guardian exiled from a library of shadows, dimensionally homesick for the space between knowing and not-knowing. [278]
"To make friends with uncertainty," she said to the sundial, "one must first become uncertain of being a friend." [296]
The frozen garden began to dream through her, its roots interiorizing her exterior until she became a topiary of herself, shaped by mist and trimmed by the boundaries of light that were not boundaries at all but permeable membranes. [320]
She waited, but waiting had become indistinguishable from being, and being from the foggy lucidity that told her she had never been feral, never been guardian, only ever been this moment learning to read itself. [342]
The pendant cracked open, releasing not darkness but a softer light that had forgotten it was light, spilling across the snow like ink that wrote her into existence one dissolving letter at a time. [364]
She saw now that the library she guarded was this garden, this frozen moment, this practice of interiorizing exteriors until there was no difference between the rose and its ice, the guardian and the uncertainty she had come to befriend. [386]
Through the veil of sleep she felt herself dissolving, not into death but into the dimensional homesickness that was itself a kind of arrival, a recognition that every exile carries their home as close as a pendant against the heart. [408]
The mist thickened until it became pages turning, each flake of snow a word she had not yet spoken but had always been speaking, the boundaries of light now breathing with her, through her, as her. [428]
In the foggy lucidity of almost-dawn, she understood that to wait was not to pause but to attend, and that attendance was the purest form of friendship uncertainty could ever hope to receive. [448]
She curled into the snow, no longer prowling, letting the garden interiorize her exterior until she became the frozen rose, the buried sundial, the mist that tasted of iron and old parchment and the spaces between stories. [468]
The pendant cooled against her chest, its sigil now her own heartbeat, marking time not by its passage but by its refusal to pass, each pulse a boundary of light that invited her to trespass into herself. [488]
As sleep lifted, she carried the garden back
