The carousel ground to a halt at 03:17, its brass poles still humming like trapped hornets. [19]
I stepped off the platform and onto the only solid cloud in the kinetic lagoon, feeling the spongy vapor compress under my scavenger boots. [34]
Above me the moon was a disposable camera wheel, each sprocket hole leaking a different year: 1998, 2003, 2011, 2045. [50]
I am chronologically confused; the years arrive as rotating snapshots instead of a line, so I pocket whatever frame feels heaviest. [68]
Tonight the heaviest is 2011, the year I died but kept breathing. [80]
My ghost waits on the far bank of the lagoon, sitting cross-legged atop the carousel’s brass hub that flew here after the ride froze. [99]
He wants to negotiate, and I have nothing to trade except eroded ambitions, the ones I scraped from the bottom of every story I ever overheard. [120]
I collect fragments the way children collect seashells: a bartender’s sigh about medical school, a bride’s whispered doubt at the altar, an old man’s apology to a dog he hit in 1979. [149]
Each fragment is a shard of mirror; together they almost make a face. [162]
I snap the moon-wheel forward one click; 2003 clicks into place and the lagoon stirs, revealing submerged neon horses galloping in slow motion beneath the cloud-surface. [185]
My ghost lifts a hand, palm up, demanding payment for the years I borrowed from him. [200]
I offer the bartender’s sigh first; it floats across like a dandelion seed, but the ghost only inhales it and grows an inch taller, more solid. [221]
The bride’s doubt is next; it tastes like copper and makes his smile crooked, the way mine used to be before the accident. [241]
I feel the first stab of regret, not for dying but for surviving incomplete. [253]
The carousel’s music box core tries to restart, hiccups, then subsides into fractured stillness, the kind of silence that rings in broken teeth. [276]
I step onto the next cloud; it deflates slightly, exhaling a child’s voice saying, “I thought rockets were bigger.” [295]
That fragment is small, but I give it anyway because small regrets are sharp. [308]
The ghost pockets it behind his translucent ribs where a heart should tick. [320]
He speaks for the first time, voice like filmstrip rattling through plastic sprockets: “You owe me the rest of the wheel.” [340]
I look at the moon-camera; four frames remain: 1998, 2015, 2045, and one unlabeled white square. [356]
Each frame I surrender will erase the corresponding year from every memory I ever touched. [370]
1998 is my mother teaching me to tie shoes; I let it go first because learning to walk only taught me to run away. [390]
The ghost grows lips the color of old receipts and kisses the air; the lagoon shivers, and the neon horses slow to a funeral march. [412]
2015 is the year I almost became a photographer; I hesitate, thumb on the sprocket, because that ambition is the only one not fully eroded. [435]
The ghost leans forward, patient as rust. [443]
I release it; the camera wheel jams, then rips the year away with a sound like duct tape torn from skin. [461]
My hands forget the weight of a Nikon; the ghost gains a camera-shaped scar over his heart. [477]
Only 2045 and the blank frame remain. [485]
2045 is the year I was supposed to finally die properly, no ghosts, no negotiations. [500]
I bargain: “Take the blank instead; it’s potential, anything you want.” [513]
The ghost considers, flickering like a bad projector. [522]
He agrees, but only if I stay to watch the blank expose itself. [534]
I nod, because scavengers always stay to see what the trash becomes. [547]
The blank frame develops into a mirror; the ghost steps through and becomes me, solid, while I turn translucent, weightless as overheard sighs. [570]
Regret washes over, not like waves but like fog: cold, slow, filling every fold. [585]
The new-me smiles the crooked smile, pockets the moon-camera, and walks back toward the silent carousel. [603]
I remain, a fragment collector without pockets, listening to the kinetic lagoon whisper stories I no longer have hands to gather. [625]
The carousel starts again, its music box repaired by ambition it never earned. [642]
I drift above the clouds, chronologically confused, eroded, yet oddly
