The bewildered curator, Dr. Mara Quell, drifted through the astral orchard blossoming on lonely asteroid K-77, her gloved fingers brushing starlight-laden petals that chimed like tuning forks. [35]
Between the first and last page of her life’s log she had recorded every anomaly, yet none unsettled her like the pistachio shell cameo blank she now turned over in her palm, its inner face etched with a spiral that refused to stay in one rotation. [58]
Nonlinear inheritance, the archivists called it: memories, debts, and talents arriving out of sequence, so that a great-grandson might be born knowing his ancestor’s dying thought while the ancestor still lived. [80]
Mara’s own inheritance had arrived yesterday in a sealed envelope that opened itself inside her stomach while she vomited among the zero-g roses, revealing the command to pursue forbidden knowledge or forfeit her sanity page by page. [110]
She had tried to inquire of the orchard’s sentient trees, but they only repeated the same brightened disquiet in their rustling: “What is grafted cannot be ungrafted.” [140]
So she entered the small titanium bathroom pod orbiting the orchard’s southern root, the only place where the trees’ telepathy dampened, and stared at her reflection until the mirror fogged with existential steam. [175]
There, between toothpaste globules and phosphorescent moss, she experienced the first philosophical breakthrough: the cameo was not blank but waiting, its emptiness a mold shaped exactly like the question she feared to ask. [210]
She pressed the shell to her lips and whispered, “What knowledge is so forbidden it inherits itself?” [230]
The mirror answered by peeling backward into a corridor of books whose spines were written in her own future handwriting, each volume titled with a year she had not yet lived. [255]
Stepping through, she found herself in the orchard again, yet every fruit was a miniature galaxy and every seed a black hole softly humming lullabies in her grandmother’s voice. [285]
Time folded like origami; she saw herself as a child planting this very grove, then as an elder harvesting it, then as an unborn infant tasting its light. [315]
The simply complicated truth dawned: the orchard was her family’s nonlinear inheritance, each blossom a memory that bloomed before its roots existed, and the cameo was the grafting tool. [350]
To inherit out of order was to become curator of one’s own unlived life, pruning futures that refused to stay future. [375]
But forbidden knowledge demands tuition; for every galaxy-fruit she plucked, a page vanished from the book of her past, erasing a kindness she had done. [400]
She raced back to the bathroom pod, stomach lurching as pages tore away, and locked the door against the rustling trees that now sounded like overdue library books demanding their stories returned. [435]
Second breakthrough: the bathroom was never a refuge but a chrysalis, its plumbing connected to the orchard’s xylem, flushing her erased deeds as fertilizer for new blooms. [465]
She stared at the drain swirling with lost birthdays and apologies, realizing the only way to keep her past was to stop pursuing the future’s fruit. [490]
Yet the command burned hotter: pursue forbidden knowledge. [500]
She lifted the cameo, pressed its spiral to the drain, and inscribed the question she now understood: “What inherits the inheritor?” [525]
The porcelain cracked, releasing a sapling of light that grew into a door labeled “Index.” [540]
Beyond lay a single page floating in zero-g, the first and last page of every life, blank except for one sentence written in her own hand: “The curator is the catalog.” [570]
She stepped through, merging with the page, and felt every memory she had lost return as footnotes blooming in the margins of the orchard. [595]
The trees sighed, no longer demanding, their brightened disquiet softened into lullaby. [610]
Mara, now both book and librarian, understood the final symmetry: nonlinear inheritance is simply complicated love arriving early, and forbidden knowledge is the reader who realizes she authors herself. [645]
She tucked the pistachio shell into the spine of the sky, where it germinated into a new asteroid, ready for the next bewildered curator to inquire among blossoms that remember you before you arrive. [685]
Between the first and last page, she had become the orchard’s footnote, a gentle warning printed in starlight: “Knowledge is not forbidden; it is inherited backwards by those who remember to forget.” [720]
And somewhere on a lonely asteroid, a bathroom door drifts open, waiting for the next stomachache of revelation. [745]
