The bewildered curator, Dr. Lira Voss, drifted through the astral orchard blossoming on lonely asteroid K-17, her gloved fingers brushing starlight-dappled petals that hummed like tuning forks. [35]
Each tree grew memories instead of fruit, and she had been sent to catalog which recollections belonged to her vanished predecessor, the infamous Archivist Quell. [47]
Between the first and last page of Quell’s incomplete index, Lira was supposed to locate the single pistachio shell cameo blank rumored to unlock nonlinear inheritance, a secret bloodline of thought that skipped generations, eras, even dimensions. [70]
She paused beneath a copper-leaved graft labeled “Regret, aged 42,” feeling the brightened disquiet that had dogged her since departure: excitement sharpened by dread, like sunlight on a scalpel. [86]
Quell’s final note, discovered taped to the inside of a bathroom stall back at the Interstellar Athenaeum, had read: “Truth is simply complicated; seek it where you flush your failures.” [104]
Lira, who had experienced three philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms over her scholarly life, understood the instruction as both joke and map. [118]
She entered the translucent outhouse the orchard kept for visitors, its walls swirling with nebulae, and sat, inhaling ozone and rosewater, waiting for the familiar vertigo. [135]
When it came, she did not resist; instead she inquired of the mirror, “What did Quell steal from the future and plant here?” [148]
The glass liquefied, revealing a spiral staircase of light descending into the asteroid’s hollow core where roots of every tree tangled like optic fibers. [165]
Following, she found a chamber walled in parchment; each sheet bore a descendant’s name written in ink that dried before the parent’s birth—nonlinear inheritance made visible. [182]
At the chamber’s center floated the pistachio shell cameo blank, no bigger than a thumbnail, its surface an untouched cream that refracted tomorrow. [196]
Lira’s motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge surged; if she carved the shell with her own question, legend claimed the answer would graft itself into her lineage, wisdom flowing backward to ancestors and forward to children unborn. [216]
But the air flickered, projecting Quell’s image—an older woman wearing the same curator insignia, eyes bright with identical disquiet. [230]
“You arrived between my first page and my last,” Quell’s projection said, voice echoing from the toilet stall far above. [243]
“I wrote myself into the orchard’s plumbing because only there does the mind admit it is both vessel and waste.” [256]
Lira, heart hammering, asked, “Did carving the shell free you or chain you?” [266]
Quell smiled, simply complicated, like a Möbius strip tied by a child. [276]
“I carved too greedily; now I am pruned into every tree you touched. My memories hang as fruit. Your curiosity will graft you here too, unless…” [294]
The image glitched, offering a loophole: leave the blank uncarved, exit the orchard, and forget the index—preserve linear life. [307]
Lira weighed the choice inside the bathroom of her mind, tiles gleaming like starlight. [317]
She recalled her first bathroom breakthrough at age seven, realizing death was a door she would walk through alone; the second at twenty-one, understanding love was the same door walked through together; the third at thirty, admitting knowledge was a door that walked through you. [350]
Now, at forty, she faced a fourth: inheritance could be pruned, redirected, refused. [363]
She lifted the shell, felt its potential quiver like a seed, then slipped it, uncarved, into the hollow of her cheek, a smooth impossible nut. [380]
Climbing back up the light-stairs, she emerged into the orchard where petals drifted like torn pages. [393]
Instead of cataloging, she uprooted every memory labeled “Quell,” stacking them into a pile that smelled of wet ink and regret. [408]
She set the pile ablaze with her plasma lighter, flames neon pink, the color of correction fluid. [420]
As fire consumed the fruit, the trees began to blossom new buds bearing Lira’s own face, but younger, older, sideways in time—possible selves unchained from ancestry. [440]
The brightened disquiet softened into ordinary twilight; she felt the shell dissolve on her tongue, leaving a faint salt-sweet taste of unmade choices. [457]
She exited the orchard, leaving the index between its first and last page deliberately blank, a cameo of silence. [472]
On the return shuttle, she visited the lavatory, not for revelation but to spit out
