The glass-orchid caretaker, Lira, climbed the spiral of white marble that rose from the opal library above clouds, each step echoing like a dropped pearl. [25]  
She carried the wind chime bamboo tube cracked during the last storm of voices, its fissure leaking faint chords that still tried to pronounce names no longer spoken. [46]  
Across the museum of extinct feelings, the hour was twilight, a colorless breath between diaphragms of sky and memory. [62]  
Her duty, gently systematic, was to light the chandelier of hollow bulbs where every extinct name was once stored as vibration. [82]  
If the bulbs darkened entirely, the deserted marvels below—cities of uncried tears, gardens of ungiven apologies—would sink into mute white nothing. [105]  
Tonight the bulbs guttered, starved for resonance, and only the cracked bamboo tube still held a frayed filament of song. [125]  
Lira set the tube on the reading lectern carved from fossilized sighs and bowed until her forehead touched the cool stone, listening. [148]  
From the split green shaft came the echo of a long-forgotten song, a lullaby once hummed by mothers who feared their children might be erased by tomorrow. [172]  
The melody arrived in wisps, like silk scarves pulled through needle eyes, and she caught each wisp with the glass-orchid petals she wore in her hair—translucent, resonant, thirsty for sound. [198]  
One by one the petals glowed, drinking the syllables: “Elias,” “Sanna,” “Por—” the last cracked, unfinished. [216]  
Lira’s heart, shaped like a foxglove, closed in regret; she had loved a Por who became a footnote in an unindexed grief. [236]  
To preserve the sound of forgotten names, she needed to amplify the lullaby before the final bulb dimmed. [255]  
She walked the mezzanine that ringed the library’s dome of opal, opening drawers labeled with emotions filed in reverse alphabetical order: Wrath, Vulnerability, Tenderness, Serenity. [285]  
In the drawer marked Serenity she found a silver tuning fork struck by the first laugh of creation; in the drawer marked Wrath she found a quill made from the last shout of extinction. [312]  
She lashed the quill to the cracked bamboo tube, converting fracture into reed, and struck the tuning fork against the lectern. [334]  
The note rang, met the lullaby, and the tube exhaled a plume of audible light that drifted upward like phosphorescent plankton. [356]  
The chandelier’s bulbs inhaled the light, filaments braiding the names into visible strings of letters that clung to the glass like frost. [378]  
But the chandelier demanded payment: one memory sacrificed for every name saved. [393]  
Lira, gently systematic, opened the foxglove chambers of her heart and selected the memory of Por’s kiss beneath a rain of glass-orchid pollen, the moment she first understood love could be lethal. [423]  
She fed the kiss to the chandelier; the bulbs flared, sealing “Por” complete. [438]  
Another bulb flickered, crying for “Elias”; she surrendered the scent of her mother’s cedar chest where she hid as a child during thunder. [460]  
Name after name, memory after memory, she paid, feeling herself hollow into a translucent silhouette, a glass-orchid paper cutout. [482]  
When the final bulb burned steady, the deserted marvels below stirred: tear-cities exhaled, apology-gardens bloomed crimson, and the museum exulted in a hush almost like music. [510]  
Lira, now almost weightless, lifted the cracked bamboo tube; its fissure had widened into a mouth. [527]  
From that mouth her own name escaped—“Lira”—a soft ascending note she had never heard spoken by another. [545]  
The chandelier demanded the last payment: the memory of herself. [557]  
She understood the gently systematic cruelty of preservation: the caretaker must become the final extinct feeling. [575]  
She smiled, foxglove regret sweet on her tongue, and offered her silhouette. [588]  
The bulbs drank her, brightened to sunrise, and the opal library above clouds rang with all the names at once, a choir of revenants. [610]  
The cracked bamboo tube, empty, fell, spinning like a green comet down through cloud decks, past the museum, past tear-cities, past apology-gardens, until it landed in a valley where a child who had never heard music picked it up and, curious, lifted it to his lips. [650]  
A single note—part lullaby, part Lira—escaped the crack and traveled the world, teaching every listener the sound of the glass-orchid caretaker who lit the forgotten so the living might remember to speak names before they vanish. [690]  
Across the museum of extinct feelings, the bulbs still burn, but if you stand at the opal railing at twilight you can hear the faintest echo of a long-forgotten song, a foxglove regret that keeps the sky from forgetting how to hold us. [730]
