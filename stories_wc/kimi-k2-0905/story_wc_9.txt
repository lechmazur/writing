The onyx-ink cartomancer climbed the midnight glade above clouds, her boots leaving no print on the silver moss that grew only where starlight could not reach. [29]
She carried a dolls’ tea set saucer crack in her left palm, the hairline fracture glowing faintly with the memory of every sip of imaginary tea her daughter had never tasted. [42]
After the birth, time had begun to pool in strange places—behind the mirror, inside the chimney, beneath the fingernails of the dying—so she had come willingly perplexed to the one altitude where minutes fell upward instead of down. [63]
The family custom of tracing hands on birthday tablecloths had taught her that every life leaves a grease outline that never completely washes out; she had traced her newborn’s hand once, then the cloth had been folded away before the ink dried, and the print had vanished with the afterbirth. [89]
Now she knelt, unfasten the leather strap that kept her cards bound tight against her heart, and spread the deck across the saucer’s cracked porcelain as though the fracture were a river and each card a boat searching for the sea. [111]
The first card she turned was the Cloudbound Repentance, a card she herself had painted years ago after dreaming of a sky that apologized for raining. [130]
Its ink bled upward, forming a spiral that tasted of iron and lullabies, and she understood that lost time did not disappear but condensed into these very clouds, heavy with the weight of every skipped heartbeat, every postponed goodbye. [155]
She began to read: the saucer crack widened, becoming a canyon through which tiny porcelain voices rose, asking why Mommy never finished the tea party. [172]
Each doll’s voice carried a different minute—3:42 a.m. when labor began, 4:17 when the heartbeat stopped, 5:03 when the doctor spoke the word “choice”—and they arranged themselves around her like guests seated for a sorrowful picnic. [198]
The cartomancer’s throat filled with choking beauty; the moonlight tasted of sugared milk gone cold, and she realized the glade was not above clouds but inside one, a cathedral of vapor and regret. [220]
She laid her own hand flat on the moss, fingers splayed, and performed the family custom of tracing hands on birthday tablecloths upon the cloud itself, her nails leaving trails of black ink that spelled the name she had not yet spoken aloud. [250]
The cloud shuddered, remembering every birthday it had ever rained on, and began to descend, carrying her downward toward the world where clocks ticked forward again. [270]
Halfway down, the saucer crack detached from the porcelain and floated free, a lightning bolt of memory that struck her chest, unfasten the clasp of grief she had worn like a necklace since the birth. [295]
Time rushed back into her body in a single inhale—years of lullabies, first steps, skinned knees, graduation tears—all the moments that had pooled elsewhere now flooding her lungs until she laughed and wept simultaneously. [325]
She landed softly in her own backyard at 3:42 a.m., the exact minute labor had begun, but the sky was clear, the cloud having emptied itself of every stolen second. [348]
In her hand lay the dolls’ tea set saucer, whole again, its crack healed into a faint silver seam that resembled a closed eye. [368]
She set it on the grass, filled it with moonlight, and invited the night to tea, speaking aloud the name she had traced in the sky, offering the cloudbound repentance her heart had finally learned to pronounce. [398]
The cartomancer remained willingly perplexed, knowing now that lost time accumulates wherever love refuses to end, and that every fracture is only a doorway shaped like a question mark. [430]
She left the saucer in the glade that was no longer above clouds but inside her, a midnight place where tea stays warm and daughters never finish growing up. [460]
Years later, when other mothers climb searching for where their minutes went, they find her outline traced in ink that never fades, a family custom expanded into a constellation, guiding them home to the moment they thought they lost but had only misplaced inside a crack no wider than a heartbeat. [520]
And the cartomancer, older but not finished, continues to deal cards onto porcelain rivers, teaching the clouds to forgive themselves for raining, showing every grieving parent how to unfasten grief without forgetting love, how to sip imaginary tea with children who exist forever in the choking beauty of almost.
