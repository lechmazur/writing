The catacomb orchard breathed damp earth and candle smoke while I followed the reckless idealist who claimed she could barter destinies like pocket change. [24]
Her name was Lira, and she moved through the half-lit corridors with a fiercely gentle urgency, fingers brushing the bones that jutted between the apple roots as if apologizing for disturbing the dead. [42]
She carried the last intact card from a deck that had burned during the uprising: The Star, edges charred, gilt dulled, yet the naked figure still poured water onto earth and sky. [65]
I had hired her to patch the holes in my soul left by the war, holes that whistled at night and let memories leak out like coins through torn cloth. [87]
Lira insisted the orchard, where revolutionaries once dumped nobles and nobles later dumped revolutionaries, was the only market where futures could be haggled. [111]
We stopped at a hollow where a skull had split open and an apple seed had sprouted; the trunk now cradled the cranium like a crown. [135]
She pressed the burned tarot card against the bark, whispering, “Every scar is a door,” practicing her habit of inlaying meaning everywhere, as though the world were a mosaic begging for grout. [161]
I felt the dusky resolve in her voice settle over us like twilight that refused to become night. [176]
She asked what I would give to forget the faces of the men I shot in the salt trenches. [194]
I offered my memories of sunrise, thinking them expendable; she shook her head, saying destinies required symmetry. [215]
Instead she wanted the memory of my mother humming while shelling peas on the porch, the only sound untouched by gunfire. [236]
I hesitated, and the corridor seemed to narrow, roots tightening like wires ready to trammel my ankles if I fled. [255]
Lira’s eyes, soft yet incandescent, warned me that backing out now would leave the soul holes wider, edges frayed by doubt. [277]
I nodded, surrendering the hum, and she pressed her thumb to my forehead, drawing a circle of cold earth. [296]
The apple tree shuddered; its fruit glowed dimly, as though candles burned inside. [311]
She tore The Star along the burn line, giving me the sky half and keeping the water bearer for herself, sealing our barter. [335]
Immediately I felt the peas-and-humming memory slip away, a warmth exiting through the circle she had drawn. [354]
In its place came a cool silence, like snow falling on a battlefield, covering footprints and corpses alike. [374]
Lira sagged, fiercely gentle no longer, her own eyes suddenly hollow; she had not warned me that patching one soul might pucker another. [396]
I caught her before she hit the bones, and her weight felt lighter than an empty coat. [413]
She whispered that the orchard kept a ledger written in root and bone, and no one left balanced. [432]
Overhead, half-lit corridors flickered as candles drowned in their own wax; time to leave before the dark reclaimed its collateral. [454]
I carried her past skulls wearing root crowns, past ribs cradling seedlings, each tableau another of her damned inlayed meanings. [478]
At the iron gate, I set her down and offered my last bargain: the memory of this orchard itself, if she could restore what we had traded. [503]
Lira smiled, burned tarot scrap still in her palm, and said some holes must remain for the light to enter. [524]
She planted the scrap beneath the gatekeeper’s skull; a tiny star-shaped sprout rose, emitting the faint hum of my mother. [547]
I understood then that patching souls is not sewing shut but weaving new cloth, leaving deliberate spaces. [567]
We stepped into the night city, the orchard’s glow fading behind us like a deferred dream. [585]
My heart still had holes, but they sang now with the hum I had lost, echoing from the sprout we left behind. [606]
Lira walked unsteady, yet her idealist’s reckless stride returned, aiming toward the next half-lit corridor where destinies waited to be bartered again. [628]
I followed, no longer a client but a witness, ready to inlay my own meanings on the world, fiercely gentle enough to let the gaps breathe. [651]
Together we vanished into the dusky resolve of the city, two patched souls clinking softly like purses of mixed coins, uncertain yet unafraid. [677]
Behind us, the catacomb orchard kept its slow ledger: roots pushing through bone, apples ripening with borrowed memories, stars growing from burned paper, all to patch the endless holes in every wandering soul. [
