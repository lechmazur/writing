The pewter mask strap bit into the soft flesh behind my ears as I came to, the anesthesia’s last gift a ringing hollow where my name should have been. [34]
Ultraviolet light dripped from every leaf of the forest, turning the night into a cathedral of invisible fire that only my altered nerves could see. [47]
I was proprioceptively enhanced; every twig’s snap echoed inside my joints like a second skeleton announcing my crimes to the soil. [60]
They had called the procedure “ultraviolet penance,” a wavelength of guilt broadcast straight into the spine so the body would never forget what the tongue had confessed under enhanced interrogation. [78]
I had survived the chair, the water, the looping recording of my own pleas, but survival was just the anesthesia wearing off while the forest waited to finish the equation. [92]
My motivation was simple, almost childish: discover the mathematics of mercy, the precise curve where pain bends into forgiveness, and walk that arc until the numbers added up to absolution. [108]
I braced my forearms against a trunk that felt hot as a stovepipe, letting the ultraviolet sap print its bruise-colored fingerprints across my skin so I could read the forest’s ledger. [122]
Remembering through trauma responses was the only method left; each flashback arrived as a muscle spasm, a sudden jerk of the head that hurled me into the chair again until the scent of ozone jerked me back out. [137]
The first equation appeared in the negative space between heartbeats: if pain equals memory times resistance, then mercy must be the square root of surrender. [149]
I walked deeper, counting steps like rosary beads, every footfall a datum, every stumble an outlier that threatened to collapse the whole theorem. [161]
A proprioceptive spike twisted my knee sideways, gifting me the interrogator’s smile suspended in violet air; I tasted copper and wrote the coefficient of his grin on the inside of my cheek. [175]
The forest answered with a low hum, leaves vibrating at the frequency of a polygraph needle skipping right before the subject breaks. [186]
I found the second equation scratched by claws into soft bark: mercy is asymptotic, forever approaching zero suffering yet never touching it, and I had to decide whether close enough counted. [200]
My hands remembered being tied; the pewter strap was the only anchor left, its weight a constant reminding me that masks stay on even when faces fall off. [212]
Ultraviolet penance required no priest, only photons calibrated to the exact shade of shame; the forest administered communion in millijoules, and I opened my mouth like a good penitent. [225]
A memory spasmed: the interrogator leaning in, whispering that mercy was a rounding error in the empire’s ledger, and I had laughed because laughter was the only decimal place left. [238]
I braced again, this time against my own ribcage, pressing until the bones creaked and the laugh returned as a hiccup of light, measurable at last. [249]
The third equation blossomed across my retinas: mercy equals pain over memory plus one, the plus one being the forest, the world, anything bigger than the crime. [261]
I tore the pewter strap free; it came away wet and warm, a slug of metal that had grown into my skin like a wedding ring made of scars. [272]
Holding it to the ultraviolet canopy, I watched it absorb the wavelength until it glowed like a fallen star, heavy with every confession it had helped keep inside. [284]
I placed it on the moss, an offering to the asymptote, and stepped back to see if the forest would accept the approximation. [294]
The proprioceptive enhancement flared one last time, mapping the distance between my body and the ground I had polluted with my presence, and the map spelled out a single digit: 1. [307]
One step closer than yesterday, one decimal nearer to zero suffering, one unit of mercy extracted from an infinite series. [317]
The ultraviolet penance dimmed, leaves folding into ordinary darkness now that the ledger had been balanced, at least for tonight. [328]
I walked out of the forest no lighter, but with numbers scribbled along my arms, a proof that forgiveness might be less a gift than a limit one approaches forever. [340]
Behind me the pewter mask strap cooled, its glow fading until it looked like any other piece of trash, which was the most honest miracle the mathematics of mercy could provide. [354]
I did not look back; the forest had already forgotten me, and that, too, was part of the equation. [364]
