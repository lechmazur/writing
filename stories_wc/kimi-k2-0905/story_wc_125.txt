The terra-cotta grotto breathed beneath starlight, its clay walls still warm from the energy beings' arrival. [19]
I pressed my palm against the curved surface, feeling the pulse of something ancient and electric. [31]
Three days they'd been here—three days since the sky cracked open and they poured through like liquid starlight. [47]
Now I wandered these grottos, a drifting roadside poet with ink-stained fingers and a head full of impossible choices. [69]
The rope lay coiled beside a fallen column, its fibers frayed from some prisoner's desperate flight. [86]
I recognized the pattern immediately: the same braided hemp I'd seen in the county jail six months ago when I'd visited Marcus. [106]
He'd escaped three nights past, they said, though no one understood how he'd gotten past the energy fields. [127]
I knelt, fingers tracing the rope's texture, wondering if time itself could be touched like this—rough where it broke, smooth where it held. [150]
The energy beings had no texture, no weight, only presence that made the air shimmer like heat above summer asphalt. [173]
They'd offered us a choice: transcend our physical forms and join their collective consciousness, or remain bound to Earth's slow decay. [199]
Impossible choices, the kind that split communities, families, souls. [212]
My neighbor Mrs. Chen had gone first, stepping into their light with her vegetable garden still half-weeded. [232]
Her husband stayed behind, watering tomatoes that would never fruit again. [249]
I picked up the rope, feeling its weight—the weight of Marcus's choice to run, to remain flesh in a world dissolving into light. [276]
The energy beings didn't understand why we hesitated. [290]
To them, death and transformation were the same river flowing different directions. [309]
But I needed to discover the texture of time itself, how it felt to choose and choose again, each decision leaving its mark like rope-burns on skin. [340]
In the grotto's deepest chamber, I found where Marcus had hidden. [355]
Clay walls bore the impressions of his fingers, dug in while he decided which way to run. [373]
The energy beings had been here too—I could feel their residue, like the memory of perfume in an empty room. [396]
They'd offered him the same choice: transcendence or capture, freedom or form. [413]
I sat where he'd sat, rope in my lap, and began to write. [426]
Not poems this time, but patterns—unraveling the layers of choice that brought us here. [444]
Each word was a knot in the rope, each line a decision that could have gone another way. [463]
The starlight filtered through cracks in the grotto roof, painting everything the color of dried blood. [483]
I thought about Marcus running through these hills, about Mrs. Chen's tomatoes, about my own hands that had never quite grasped what they reached for. [514]
The energy beings gathered at the grotto's mouth, their collective presence asking without words: have you decided? [538]
I stood, rope coiled around my waist like a belt, like a question. [553]
Some choices aren't about staying or leaving, dying or transcending. [569]
Sometimes they're about the texture of the moment before choice, the weight of possibility in your palms. [592]
I walked past them into the starlight, still flesh, still poetry, still discovering. [610]
Behind me, the grotto held its breath. [619]
Ahead, the road stretched like a poem whose ending hadn't been written yet. [637]
I would walk it with Marcus's rope around my waist, feeling time's texture with each step—rough where it broke, smooth where it held, impossible and perfect and mine. [674]
The energy beings followed at a distance, curious about this creature who chose the weight of choice itself over their weightless eternity. [708]
I sang as I walked, my voice echoing off clay hills, weaving new patterns from old ropes, uncovering layers of time with each footfall. [738]
Some roads you walk because you must. [748]
Others you walk because stopping would mean pretending the choice was ever simple. [766]
I walked because the rope told me to, because Marcus's fingers had left their heat in its fibers, because even impossible choices deserve witnesses. [795]
