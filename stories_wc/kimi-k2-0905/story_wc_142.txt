The perpetual carnival drifted three kilometers off the drowned coast, its raft city lashed together from pontoons, freight pallets, and the painted prows of forgotten ferries. [31]  
Every dawn, calliope music ricocheted over the water like gulls fighting for bread, and every dusk, strings of bulbs flickered on to keep the dark from remembering land prices. [47]  
Lina stood on the sundeck of the old riverboat cinema, fingertips pressed to a foundation stone chip she wore on a cord around her neck; it was a splinter from the first pier her grandfather helped sink, and she stroked it whenever the city felt ready to scatter. [82]  
She had been born here, among jugglers and oyster poachers, but last month the Offshore Development Syndicate sent negotiators in linen suits to measure the decks for privatization, and the carnival’s laughter began to sound like a countdown. [107]  
Lina’s role, self-declared, was culture shock absorber: whenever newcomers arrived wide-eyed and nauseous, she translated the chaos into stories they could stomach, buying time for the old-timers to decide whether to stay or jump ship. [139]  
Tonight, however, she needed more than tales; she needed a map, and the only cartographer she trusted was the city itself. [157]  
She descended the cinema’s gangplank into the midway, where barkers still shouted “Try your luck!” even though everyone knew the games were rigged by uncertainty. [178]  
Under the popcorn smoke, she walked orderly yet intuitive, counting her breaths in fours while letting her eyes snag on colors that felt wrong—fresh enamel, corporate teal, surveyors’ orange. [201]  
Those hues belonged to the Syndicate’s stealth branding campaign: posters of smiling families sliding down plastic slides that would replace the tarot tents. [225]  
Lina’s dual allegiance prickled: part of her wanted the city to survive unchanged, part of her wanted it to survive at all, even if that meant wearing a price tag. [251]  
She slipped into an alley of stacked shipping containers that served as dormitories for the fun-house crew, pulled a tin of spray paint from her satchel, and began to reorganize the wall. [281]  
Through messages encoded in graffiti art, the resistance spoke; a harlequin face weeping musical notes meant “meet at the calliope at midnight,” while a roulette wheel with eight ball slots instead of numbers meant “bring one tool that can fix or break.” [323]  
She added a new symbol: a cracked stone cradled by two open palms, the palms angled so the stone looked simultaneously lifted and dropped. [352]  
It was the signal for “foundation questioned,” a call to debate whether the raft itself should be scuttled before it was sold. [374]  
As she painted, children crept close, offering her stolen candy in exchange for stories; she told them about the time the whole city tilted thirty degrees during a storm and the clowns learned to walk on walls, so gravity became negotiable. [420]  
They giggled, and their laughter felt like ballast. [432]  
At midnight the calliope wheezed its chord, and figures converged beneath its gold-toothed pipes: riggers, stilt-walkers, the bankrupt baker who still made sunrise bread for whoever queued barefoot. [468]  
Lina held up the foundation stone chip; under the gaslight its grain looked like tiny waves frozen mid-crash. [490]  
“We can refuse to sign,” she said, “but refusal floats only until the first tugboat arrives.” [510]  
An old fire-eater spat a plume that spelled the word “reclaim” in burning cursive, and the assembly murmured, hopeful desperation flickering across their faces like投射的火花. [545]  
They decided to reorganize the carnival’s layout overnight: swap the gaming barges with the libraries, turn the luxury restaurant into a free soup circle, and paint every new corporate logo into a grotesque carnival mask so investors would see their own grins mocked. [600]  
By sunrise, the Syndicate’s inspectors stepped onto a deck that looked identical yet felt unrecognizable; the games still dinged, but the prizes were poems printed on dissolving rice paper, and the children who sold them spoke only in riddles. [638]  
The inspectors retreated to their speedboat, radios crackling with confusion, while Lina leaned on the railing, necklace thumping against her heart. [665]  
She knew privatization had merely been postponed, that capital would return with bigger barges and sharper contracts. [685]  
Still, the city had rehearsed a new choreography, one that treated change as another act, not the closing curtain. [705]  
Lina released the stone chip, let it dangle between her collarbones like a bell that tolled only for her, and began to invent tomorrow’s graffiti, searching for the symbol that could mean “we are still becoming.” [742]  
The perpetual carnival sailed on, bright, rickety, and unreadable to anyone who needed to own what they loved. [764]
