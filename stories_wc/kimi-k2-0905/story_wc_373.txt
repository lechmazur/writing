The tide slapped the barnacled pilings as I slipped under the pier, the pirate market already humming below deck. [24]
Lanterns swung from rusted chains, throwing gold across crates of contraband and faces that forgot their own names. [37]
I am the moonshine runner’s daughter; my father taught me to move like liquid night, but he never taught me how to stand still when trust begins to fracture. [58]
Tonight I carried his antique watch fob, a silver mermaid whose tail once ticked against his vest while he hummed lullabies to the jars of white lightning. [82]
The fob was our truce of hush—whoever held it could ask one unspoken favor and receive silence instead of betrayal. [104]
I needed that silence to stretch until sunrise so I could capture the exact moment it tore. [122]
At the far end of the market, Jonah Reef, the curiously steadfast smuggler who never left this pier, tuned a cracked phonograph that supposedly recorded feelings instead of songs. [150]
They said he once bottled the laugh of a dying captain and sold it to the captain’s widow for the price of a single tear. [175]
I believed the story because I had seen the widow wear that tear like a diamond ever after. [195]
Jonah’s price for one recording was the mermaid fob, and I had come to trade, but the favor I wanted was darker than any jar of shine. [218]
I wanted him to record the sound of trust breaking—my own trust in my father—when the fob changed hands at dawn. [240]
Father had sworn the fob would never leave our family, yet here I was, ready to surrender it for proof that love can corrode. [265]
I stepped through false starts of courage, each stride dying halfway, until the phonograph’s horn stared at me like a black moon. [289]
Jonah’s eyes were calm lighthouses in the comforting unease of the market, guiding me toward wreckage I chose myself. [312]
He nodded, recognizing the fob, and set a blank wax cylinder spinning without a word; the truce had already begun. [335]
Around us, pirates bargained in whispers, as if the air itself were guilty of listening. [353]
I told Jonah I would hand over the fob at first light, but until sunrise the mermaid stayed against my palm, her tail digging half-moons into my skin. [382]
He agreed, placing the phonograph’s horn so close to my chest that the cylinder caught the tremor of my heartbeat. [405]
We waited. [407]
Hours dilated like pupils in the dark; every creak of the pier overhead sounded like my father’s truck approaching, engine idling with illegal patience. [432]
I rehearsed betrayals: Father arriving to thwart me, snatching the fob, forbidding the trade, proving love still clung to the silver. [457]
Each imagined rescue felt like a false start, a door that opened onto another door. [475]
Instead, the market itself began to sink a fraction as tide rose, water licking the bottoms of crates, and still no sign of him. [499]
The comforting unease deepened; I realized I wanted him to stop me, to care enough to stop me, so the trust between us could survive. [525]
But the pier remained empty except for the echo of my own hope dying in slow ticks of the antique fob, which had no gears yet sounded louder every minute. [553]
Jonah’s eyes never left the cylinder; he was recording the hush stretching thin, the moment before glass shatters. [574]
Finally, the eastern sky bruised lavender, and I knew sunrise was a breath away. [592]
I opened my fist. [594]
The mermaid dropped into Jonah’s palm, tail flicking once like a fish gutted on deck. [612]
The phonograph’s needle scratched, caught a sound too soft for ears—a small wet click, like a photograph of my father slipping from my locket heart. [638]
Jonah lifted the cylinder, labeled it “Trust of the Moonshine Runner’s Daughter,” and tucked it beside bottles of other broken things. [663]
I walked back through the market as daylight speared through cracks in the pier, illuminating floating shine jars that looked like fallen stars. [692]
The truce of hush dissolved with the night; pirates began shouting prices again, but their voices felt kinder, as if they knew I now carried a silence no one could sell back to me. [726]
Above, gulls screamed news of my betrayal to the whole waking town, yet I felt lighter, emptied of a weight I had mistaken for love. [753]
I pressed my ear to the wind, listening for the sound of trust breaking again,
