The hanging orchard in the ravine had survived the empathy virus, but only barely; its roots clung to the cliff like a man gripping a ledge with torn fingernails, and every storm since had tried to pry them loose. [38]
I came here after the plague, a rational truffle forager who no longer trusted the ground beneath cities where people spoke their feelings aloud like weather reports. [56]
The orchard’s trees dangled upside-down, branches reaching into mist, fruit glowing pale as moonlit bones; locals said the storms kept them honest, stripping leaves until only truth remained. [78]
I wasn’t seeking truth—I wanted safety, the kind you can’t catch like a cold, the kind that lets you sleep without dreaming other people’s nightmares. [94]
Yet the orchard gave me the antique glass eye instead, rolling it across moss like a marble when I overturned a fistful of soil for winter truffles. [113]
The iris was hand-painted, flecked gold, and the hollow back still held a curl of parchment: “Smuggled relic of Saint Verecundus, patron of guarded tongues; wearer becomes involuntarily truthful.” [135]
I laughed, a rational woman who trusted spores and rainfall, not saints; I pocketed the eye to trade for supplies downriver. [150]
That night the storms returned, wind threading through trunks like piano wire, and every time lightning struck I spoke things I had sworn to occlude: how I once let my sister board the last ferry without warning her the virus had already bloomed behind her eyes; how I foraged alone because crowds hummed with borrowed grief. [188]
My voice carried across the ravine, fruit shivering overhead; I felt the orchard listening, roots drinking confession. [205]
By morning I understood the curse: the eye’s presence within ten paces loosened every secret I had armored in rationality; if I threw it into the torrent below, the current would carry it to villages where words could still wound. [230]
So I climbed deeper into the storm-battered ravine, searching the rumored cures in discredited textbooks I had once burned for warmth—pages that claimed relics could be muted by wrapping them in truffle skins and burying them where nothing grows. [258]
The texts were half-mad, ink blurred by rain I let drip from my hair as I read; they spoke of psychological safety as a garden you fence with silence, prune with selective forgetting. [278]
I dug a grave beneath the oldest tree, its bark scarred by lightning calligraphy; but when I unwrapped the glass eye, it stared up at me, pupil dilated like a mouth waiting to be fed. [298]
I could not bury it; instead I planted it, pressing the sphere into soil the way one plants a bulb, hoping whatever sprouted would be mute. [315]
Days folded into weeks; I foraged, spoke cautiously to the wind, and waited for the tree to bear something other than fruit. [330]
The first bloom appeared at winter’s edge: a translucent sphere swelling where branch met trunk, inside it a darker orb—an eye learning to see. [348]
Each storm polished it clearer; I felt my own vision blur, as though the tree were borrowing my sight to weep. [362]
One dawn I woke to find the orchard floor carpeted with tiny glass eyes, dew-filled, blinking awake as sunlight struck; they reflected me multiplied, mouths open, every confession looping. [385]
I understood then the relic had not cursed me; it had cultivated psychological safety by turning the orchard into a confessional no human could enter without surrendering narrative control. [405]
The ravine became a borderland where truth grew wild, pruned only by lightning; travelers who braved the storms left lighter, stories uprooted like weeds. [423]
I stayed, rational still, but no longer foraging alone; the trees spoke in creaks and resin, and I answered, knowing my words would be absorbed, composted, made into next year’s fruit. [445]
When my sister’s ghost arrived one fog evening, ferry rope still around her wrists, I did not apologize; I offered her a truffle slick with soil, and she ate it without tasting my guilt. [468]
Together we harvested the glass eyes, threading them on storm-knocked vines to hang like lanterns; their collective gaze taught us fractured grace—the art of holding broken things up to the light so they refract, not cut. [495]
The antique original remained in the mother tree, pupil dilated forever; I visit it before each storm, press my forehead to bark, and let whatever needs saying fall out like loose seed. [518]
Some nights I dream the empathy virus never left, that it merely mutated into roots and rain; I wake grateful, because here the only feelings I catch are those the orchard has already
