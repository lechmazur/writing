The mirror maker stepped carefully between the gnarled apple trunks, their silvered bark slick with twilight frost that shimmered like powdered glass across the ruined orchard district. [32]
Centuries of thick fog had swallowed this place whole, turning orderly rows into a maze of phantom trees that emerged and vanished with each breath of mist. [45]
In his coat pocket, the astronomer's broken sextant clinked against his ribs—a brass skeleton of angles and dreams that had once measured the distance between stars. [59]
He had found it three nights ago beside the river, where dreams sometimes crystallized into tangible things before dissolving back into possibility. [72]
Tonight, upon the shimmer of twilight frost, he would recreate what the city had lost: the boundary between waking and sleeping, between what was real and what might be. [87]
The mirror maker's motivation was simple yet impossible—he needed to capture a runaway dream that had escaped through the crack in his workshop wall, a dream of glass mountains that sang when the wind passed through their translucent peaks. [104]
Without it, his mirrors reflected only what stood before them, never what could be. [115]
He moved firmly grounded through the fog, each footfall deliberate, breathing in rhythm with the orchard's slow respiration of decay and renewal. [129]
The sextant's broken arc caught the dying light, casting fractured shadows that danced across his palms like star maps. [142]
He had spent years erasing boundaries in his craft—between reflection and reality, between observer and observed—but this was different. [155]
This boundary was the one that kept dreams from bleeding into the waking world, and it had grown thin as old silk. [167]
At the orchard's heart, where four ancient trees formed a natural chamber, he knelt and began to arrange his tools: shards of mirror salvaged from abandoned mansions, mercury pooled in a clay bowl, and the sextant's brass remains. [185]
The fog thickened, pressing close as if curious, and he felt the familiar weight of being watched by something that had no eyes. [198]
Through synchronized breathing, he matched his lungs to the orchard's rhythm, inhaling the fog's cold metallic taste, exhaling warmth that turned frost to momentary diamonds in the air. [213]
Each breath was a stitch in the torn fabric between worlds. [220]
The mirror maker worked quickly now, fitting the sextant's broken pieces into a circle of mirror shards, creating a lens that could focus not light but possibility. [235]
His hands moved with the certainty of someone who had done this before, though he never had—this particular magic existed only in the space between his heartbeat and the next. [250]
The runaway dream was close; he could feel it trembling in the fog like a moth against glass. [260]
When the final shard clicked into place, the makeshift device began to hum, a sound like glass mountains singing in a wind that existed only in the space between sleeping and waking. [276]
The boundary thinned to transparency, and through it he saw the glass mountains of his runaway dream, their peaks catching starlight that fell from a sky that wasn't there. [291]
But capturing a dream meant giving it form, and form meant limitation. [300]
The mirror maker hesitated, his hands hovering over the device that would trap the infinite in brass and glass. [312]
In that moment of indecision, the dream spoke—not in words but in the language of reflection, showing him what he had become: a man so busy erasing boundaries that he had drawn one around himself, firmly grounded in the ruins of what could never grow again. [332]
Understanding came like frost forming on glass, slow and irreversible. [342]
He dismantled the device piece by piece, returning the sextant to its broken state, scattering the mirror shards like seeds across the frost-rimed earth. [356]
The dream, freed from the threat of capture, settled over the orchard like fresh snow, turning each dead branch into a prism that caught and held the last light of day. [371]
Tomorrow, his mirrors would reflect this place differently—not as ruins but as a garden where boundaries grew wild and beautiful, where dreams could come and go as they pleased. [387]
The mirror maker walked back through the fog, no longer hunting but simply walking, his pockets lighter by one broken sextant and heavier by the weight of understanding. [403]
Behind him, the orchard breathed with new life, its trees beginning to hum the song of glass mountains, a melody that would echo through the ruined district for centuries more, firmly grounded in the space between what is and what might be. [425]
In his workshop, he would build no more mirrors that captured dreams, but ones that released them, each reflection a doorway rather than a wall. [440]
The astronomer's broken sextant he
