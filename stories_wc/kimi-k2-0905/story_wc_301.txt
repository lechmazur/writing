The ivy had swallowed the station whole, green fingers prying apart brick and memory alike. [17]
I stepped over the rusted rails, my notebook damp with river mist, and felt the last pill dissolve into yesterday. [31]
They said I should keep taking the blue capsules to keep the visions quiet, but visions were the only maps I trusted. [47]
Every bend of the Wren River I had sketched, dated, and cross-referenced, chasing the moment when its silver surface might mirror the thing I could not name. [69]
Tonight the disused platform smelled of wet coal and fox musk; it was the perfect place to begin again. [84]
I set down the accordion I carried like a penitent's cross, its bellows patched with fraying tape that once held my father's cigarettes. [104]
He had played polkas on this beast while mother sang, until the night he drowned trying to ford the Wren during spring flood. [125]
I was twelve and watched the water take him, too shocked to throw the rope that lay coiled at my feet. [143]
Since then I have chronicled every eddy and snag, daringly methodical, as if measurement could resurrect the man. [163]
The ivy rustled; a late train of wind arrived without passengers. [174]
I opened my notebook to the page where map references blurred into confession. [187]
Latitude of regret, longitude of silence. [194]
Underneath, in red pencil, I had written the graffiti I found last week in the station's ruined lavatory: "Forgiveness is a bridge you build by walking backward with your eyes closed." [230]
The sentence had stalked me, repeating whenever the river slapped the aluminum hull of my skiff. [250]
I sat on a bench whose slats had become a nursery for moss, laid the accordion across my knees, and drew a slow, buckled chord. [276]
The reeds answered, hissing that my father's bones were not the river's fault, that the rope had been slick with April rain. [300]
I played another chord, letting the taped bellows wheeze like a punctured lung. [316]
Between notes I began to allude to the night itself, speaking softly to the empty platform as if it were a jury. [335]
I told how the current sang his name, how my hand froze on the coil, how the moon watched and did nothing. [355]
The ivy leaves trembled, translating my words into green whispers that crawled up the waiting room walls. [372]
When the final chord died, I opened the notebook to a fresh page and drew the station as it was: a heart overgrown, still beating. [395]
Beside it I copied the bathroom graffiti, then added new coordinates— not of water this time, but of the moment when playing became apology. [425]
I tore the page out, folded it into a paper boat, and walked to the edge of the platform where the rails disappeared into blackberries. [452]
Kneeling, I set the boat among the vines, a fragile craft meant for no river but the one inside me. [472]
The taped accordion rested against my chest as I stood, lighter now, as if the bellows had exhaled my father’s last breath on my behalf. [498]
I did not look back. [502]
The path back to the skiff was lit only by starlight and the phosphorescent grin of foxfire, yet every root stepped aside. [525]
At the river I launched the little boat; the current accepted the offering without judgment. [543]
I watched until the page vanished, then pressed the accordion’s air release, letting silence finish the song. [562]
Tomorrow I would chronicle again, but the entries would begin with today: the night the map referenced not where water went, but where I chose to stay. [595]
I switched off my headlamp, felt the withdrawal tremor steady into heartbeat, and forgave the twelve-year-old who feared the rope more than the loss. [625]
The river carried on, polishing stones and stories alike, while I walked home daringly methodical, carrying an instrument patched with tape and absolution. [655]
Somewhere behind me, ivy continued stitching the station into the hillside, a green testament that even abandonment can be soft. [680]
I hummed the beginning of a polka, let it dissolve into night, and stepped onto the path that was no longer his, but mine. [705]
In my pocket, the empty pill case rattled like a tiny bell, ringing in the first hour of the rest of my life. [730]
When I reached the cottage, I did not light a lamp; I simply sat on the stoop, accordion across my knees, and listened to the Wren sing itself toward dawn. [760]
For the first time, the
