The canyon of endless echoes carried every footstep back to Lira as a whispered accusation. [17]
She pressed her palm against the pale spire that rose from the mist like a needle stitching sky to stone, its surface warm despite the dawn chill. [35]
Bone towers flanked the path ahead, their hollow sockets humming with the memory of every word ever shouted into the chasm. [53]
Before the ritual began—before the priests arrived with their bronze bowls and their demands—she had one hour to make the spire sing. [75]
Lira was a defiant artist, exiled from the capital for painting the queen’s portrait with cracks of light leaking from her eyes, and she had come here to refract a single truth into many. [104]
The truth: the queen had begged her for forgiveness the night the palace burned, and Lira had walked away. [125]
Now that refusal echoed in her ribs louder than any canyon could manage. [141]
She needed to break the truth open, scatter it like white light through a prism, so no single color of blame could settle on her alone. [168]
The method her mentor once mocked—impromptu poetry sessions—was the only tool left that felt sharp enough. [188]
She climbed the spire’s base, fingers finding holds between carved vertebrae, until she balanced on a ledge where the wind sounded like held breath. [213]
From her satchel she drew a shard of mirror stolen from the palace wreckage; its silver backing flaked like old skin. [237]
Lira angled the shard so the first ray of sun struck the spire, splitting into seven pale ribbons that painted the opposite tower with ghost sentences. [262]
Each ribbon carried a syllable of the queen’s plea: for-give-me-Li-ra. [277]
The canyon caught the words, tossed them back and forth, multiplying until the air itself seemed to beg. [295]
She spoke over the echo, voice innocently mischievous, the tone she used as a child when stealing apricots from the monastery wall. [318]
“Forgiveness is a coin with two faces,” she recited, improvising, “one side minted by the forgiver, one by the forgiven—spend it carelessly and both palms bleed.” [350]
The spire responded, bone vibrating like a plucked wire, sending her own words back rearranged: both palms bleed, both palms bleed. [375]
Lira laughed, a sound bright enough to wound, and continued. [388]
“I walked away because your fire felt warmer than your regret, Majesty.” [405]
The mirror shard heated; the mist began to swirl into shapes—first the queen’s silhouette, then Lira’s younger self, then a crowd of faceless citizens clutching burning ledgers. [435]
Each figure repeated her line in a different pitch, refracting the confession into a chord that rattled the towers. [455]
Still, the weight did not lift. [462]
She understood then that the price of forgiveness was not the speaking but the listening. [483]
So she stopped reciting and started hearing. [492]
The canyon fed her every echo she had ever flung: her mother’s goodbye, her lover’s lie, her own brush snapping in rage. [515]
The forged hush between sounds grew heavier than any sentence. [529]
Lira pressed her forehead to the spire and whispered, “I accept the cost.” [545]
The bone drank the words, absorbed the heat of the mirror, and the pale spire cracked vertically, a seam of light opening like an eye. [570]
From the fissure drifted a single white feather that floated into her hand, weightless yet sufficient. [590]
Below, bronze bells began—the priests approached. [599]
She tucked the feather behind her ear, climbed down, and stepped into the mist. [616]
The towers quieted, having spoken enough for one lifetime. [629]
When the priests arrived they found only the split spire and seven fading ribbons of light that spelled nothing, blame scattered into dawn. [655]
Lira walked the canyon’s rim, her shadow now doubled: one dark, one made of echo. [675]
She would paint the queen again, this time with the feather dipped in her own blood, and the cracks would be bridges, not wounds. [700]
The ritual would go on without her, but the truth—refracted, shared, borne—would never again belong to only one throat. [725]
Behind her, the pale spire hummed a new note, softer than forgiveness, sharper than regret: the sound of a story learning to breathe. [750]
