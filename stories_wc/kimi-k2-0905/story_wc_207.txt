The factory had exhaled its last shift-whistle three weeks ago, and the town above the cliffs now slept under a quilt of petrichor no one had ordered. [29]  
Ivy Quell, sensibly eccentric in a patched waistcoat sewn with tiny glass vials, walked the empty pier at dawn, catching the scent of first rain on stone inside each corked tube. [46]  
She called herself a petrichor collector, but what she truly gathered were beginnings—those mineral sparks that rise just before memory turns the corner. [65]  
When the final rivet was punched and the gates chained, the workers dropped their stories like oily rags; Ivy pocketed them as vapour, promising she would locate the place where explanations fail. [90]  
That promise required an object, and the object found her: a brass expedition compass washed into the storm-drain, its glass cracked like a wink. [111]  
Its needle still twitched, but toward no pole known to cartographers; instead it quivered toward the limestone cliffs, where folklore placed a subterranean lagoon reachable only after the factory shut down. [143]  
Ivy felt the metal grow fever-warm—her signal that psychometry might work—and she pressed the compass to her sternum, letting residual longing seep through skin. [175]  
Images slammed shut almost as quickly as they opened: booted feet on iron rungs, a collective gasp when torchlight struck water below the world, then silence thick as felt. [208]  
The vision hinged; it awakened not in her mind but in her knees, buckling her onto the wet planks until the tide of someone else’s awe passed. [240]  
She secured the compass in the safest vial, corked it with wax, and began the only rational response: to delve. [259]  
At the cliff base, night shift graffiti still bled neon; she traced the outline of a lantern someone had painted over the word TOMORROW, then pushed the rock that had always been rumored to push back. [300]  
The stone door exhaled, revealing a spiral stair hammered into ancient reef, each step showering her with fossil confetti. [330]  
Downward, the air warmed, carrying a hush so resonant it rang like a bell in the hollow of her throat. [354]  
She counted vials on her coat—twenty-seven scents of rain from twenty-seven shutdowns—until the compass tugged its tether, yanking her forward like a hound. [389]  
The stair spilled onto a beach of powdered shell glowing faintly, and beyond it the lagoon stretched black and glossy, mirroring nothing. [419]  
Ivy opened the waxed vial; the compass leapt into her palm, needle spinning until it stopped dead, pointing at the water’s centre where a single ripple disobeyed the stillness. [459]  
She knelt, pressed two fingers to the wet stone, and initiated the psychometry reading the way a potter lifts clay—slow, certain, willing to be reshaped. [492]  
The lagoon answered with hinged awakenings: each memory folded open along its spine, revealing the next. [515]  
She saw the lost expedition—engineers seeking a silence pure enough to measure the heartbeat of machines—wade fully clothed into this same mirror, following the compass they had since dropped. [559]  
One by one they disappeared, not drowned but translated, their breaths becoming the hush that now saturated the cave. [584]  
The final image was a hand—her own—letting go of the compass, a gesture she had not yet performed. [608]  
Terror arrived, then politeness excused it; Ivy understood that explanations would fail here because the lagoon required tribute, not testimony. [639]  
She uncorked every vial along her coat, releasing decades of first-rain scent into the cavern; the petrichor coalesced into a small storm above the water, cloud forming though no sky governed it. [682]  
Rain fell upward, each droplet climbing her skin, filling the vials again with something older than rain—possibility unmoored. [709]  
The compass dissolved into brass-coloured light, seeping into her ribcage where the metal settled as a second heart, ticking toward horizons that rotated like seasons. [743]  
Ivy stepped back, no longer collector or delver but hinge herself, the place where above and below swing open without a sound. [771]  
When she ascended the spiral, the factory whistle greeted her, echoing from inside her chest, perpetual yet weightless, and the town smelled forever on the verge of rain. [800]
