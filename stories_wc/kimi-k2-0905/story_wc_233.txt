The disenchanted queen stood at the edge of the cobalt grotto above clouds, her silk slippers soaked with dew that never touched earth. [28] After the final warning from the astronomer's cracked glass, she had climbed the ridge alone, following the bleeding starlight that seeped from the sky like a wound no bandage could staunch. [45] Each night for three moons the same dream had speared her sleep: a voice softly commanding her to find the ember grotto on the ridge before the fireflies appeared, or the kingdom would forget her name by dawn. [72] She had laughed at the prophecy until her own reflection began to blur in every mirror, until courtiers addressed the empty throne as if she were already a ghost. [98] Now, fingering the torn map drawn from memory of the dream, she began to climb the basalt steps carved by no human hand, their edges glowing faintly with residue of fallen constellations. [130] The air thinned into lace, a lacy menace that wrapped her lungs with threads of ice, each breath a stitch sewing her closer to whatever waited above. [160] Halfway up, the bleeding starlight pooled in her palms, warm as a child's fever, and she understood it was not sky-liquid but memory escaping the world, her subjects' memories of her reign dripping away into night. [200] She pressed forward, driven by the need to unravel the mystery of recurring dreams before the last drop of remembrance left her veins. [233] At the ridge crest the ember grotto on the ridge yawned, a mouth of black glass lined with slow-burning stones that pulsed like coals in a dying hearth. [268] Inside, the temperature inverted; warmth cradled her skin while frost flowered on her eyelashes, a paradox that felt like forgiveness wrapped inside betrayal. [305] On the grotto's heart-dais lay a single obsidian shard reflecting not her face but the dream itself: the softly commanding voice belonged to her own mouth ten years hence, aged and hollow, chanting the curse backward to warn the younger queen who still believed in choices. [360] Trembling, she realized the recurring dreams were not prophecy but memory looping, a knot tied by future desperation to prevent a catastrophe she had already caused. [400] The bleeding starlight thickened, coagulating into the shape of a crown that hovered above the shard, its points dripping molten silver that hissed against the stone. [440] To climb back down would seal the fate she foresaw; to stay would burn the last of her living memory into the crown, feeding the ridge with the heat required to keep the sky from tearing further. [485] She inhaled the grotto's coppery air, tasting iron, tasting endings, and heard the first fireflies of summer flicker into existence outside, their green lights blinking like cautious eyes opening after a long sleep. [530] With a shared exhale between her present and future selves, she stepped onto the dais, letting the bleeding starlight crown settle onto her hair, its weight both coronation and erasure. [575] The ember stones flared, the cobalt grotto above clouds sighed, and every mirror in the kingdom cracked at once, releasing a wind that carried her name back to the people who had forgotten it. [625] The disenchanted queen smiled, feeling the lacy menace dissolve into simple truth: mystery unraveled not by answers but by accepting the loop, becoming the softly commanding voice that would send the next dream backward through bleeding starlight. [685] Outside, fireflies drifted in silent applause, their tiny lanterns guiding the first of many climbers toward the ridge, toward the ember grotto, toward the shared exhale that keeps the sky from bleeding out completely. [750] And though no chronicle would record her final warning, the summer nights grew warmer each year, as if a hidden crown burned gently somewhere above clouds, remembering for everyone what they were doomed to forget.
