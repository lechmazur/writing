The funhouse mirrors still sweated condensation when I arrived, the resuscitation sirens fading behind me like a half-remembered lullaby. [24]  
I clutched the opera cloak clasp I’d torn from the ambulance blanket—silver talon frozen mid-snatch—because it was the only thing that still held heat. [38]  
My whispering advisor, the one who had ridden shotgun in my sternum since the flat-line, hissed that fear had a throat and I could coax it to speak. [57]  
To trick fear into revealing its weakness, I must first let it taste mine, so I stepped through the yawning clown mouth whose painted grin had peeled into something closer to a leer. [80]  
Inside, the lingering luminance of forgotten bulbs pulsed like dying fireflies, smearing color across warped plywood corridors that smelled of candied apples and wet copper. [103]  
Each flash coated the funhouse in repulsive allure, the way roadkill can look jeweled beneath headlights, and I followed that glamour deeper, clasp tight in my fist. [128]  
At the tilted heart of the maze waited the photographically cursed photo booth where my parents had posed the night the ride collapsed—its curtain now a tongue of mildewed velvet. [157]  
Every strip it ever spat out still hung inside, images twitching when no breeze moved; I saw myself age seven, eyes blacked out by the same silver clasp I now carried. [183]  
The whispering advisor urged me to unbosom the memory, to speak the moment the beam snapped and the car plummeted, but words clogged like sawdust in my throat. [208]  
Instead I opened the dream dictionary I’d shoplifted from the hospital gift shop, its pages already folded into paradoxical notes that rearranged themselves under the strobing glow. [240]  
Tonight the entry for “resuscitation” cross-referenced “carnival,” “clasp,” and “mirror,” suggesting I reverse the order of reflection if I wished to step outside my own dread. [270]  
So I pinned the opera cloak clasp through the glossy strip of my seven-year-old neck, skewering the image to the booth wall, and watched the paper bleed light. [299]  
The bleed became a corridor, brighter than the dying bulbs, lined with every fun-house reflection that had ever distorted my face into a scream. [325]  
I walked it, feeling the advisor’s breath sync with mine, until we reached the final panel: a mirror intact yet hollow, frame agape like a mouth awaiting confession. [356]  
There I saw fear—not monstrous, only a gray child wearing my features, fingertips chewed raw, eyes flickering with the same lingering luminance that guided me. [386]  
To trick fear into revealing its weakness, I offered it the paradoxical note I’d torn from the dictionary: “The thing that kills you is already saved.” [414]  
The child took it, and the opera cloak clasp snapped open of its own accord, falling between us like a silver verdict. [440]  
In that instant I understood: the photographically cursed images, the funhouse, the advisor, even the resuscitation itself, were just mirrors arranged to make me look long enough to forgive the reflection. [478]  
I knelt, pressed the clasp into the child’s palm, and let the mirrors collapse inward, glass turning to salt that dissolved under the distant sound of calliope music restarting. [512]  
When I stumbled back through the clown mouth, dawn was scrubbing the sky the color of fresh canvas, and the whispering advisor had gone quiet, replaced by the steady drum of my own unfrightened heart. [556]  
Behind me the funhouse exhaled a last gust of cotton-candy rot, then settled into itself, abandoned once more, its job finished. [589]  
I left the opera cloak clasp on the ticket booth counter for the next dreamer who might need to trade a nightmare for a mirror, and walked away carrying only the lingering luminance—no longer a lure, but a light I finally recognized as mine. [650]
