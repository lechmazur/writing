The port never slept, but it breathed with the tides, and I breathed with it, a death certificate error survivor whose pulse still startled dockhands at midnight. [35]
Inside the towering labyrinth of shipping containers, I carried a label torn from a poison bottle, its skull half scratched away so it looked more like my own blurred face in rain-puddled sodium light. [52]
Every wall of rusted metal here filters reality differently; some reflect me whole, others splice my silhouette with strangers who never finished their journeys. [70]
I walk these corridors to discover the texture of memories, because the clerks ashore stamped me deceased and filed the ink that proved I ever loved, feared, or had a name. [90]
Without that ink, I am a nameless identity, a gap the city whistles through, so I layer myself nightly with fragments of overheard stories, glueing rumor to heartbeat to stay three-dimensional. [113]
Tonight the moon hangs low enough to snag on crane cables, and the spring tide drums a bass line under metal floors, urging me deeper into the maze before the water retreats and exposes smugglers’ footprints. [140]
I pause at a container whose door is ajar, breathing out frost that curls like old cassette ribbon, and inside a woman counts ampoules by flashlight, her lips moving: “One for the husband who vanished, two for the child they said I never carried.” [175]
Her voice is a shard I pocket, feeling it settle beside the poison label in the lining of my coat, another layer to thicken the ghost of me. [195]
Further along, a boy in a hoodie sketches the skyline on corrugated steel with a nail, each scrape a caption to a life he insists existed before the port expanded and swallowed his neighborhood. [225]
He doesn’t see me, but I take his sentence, “The bakery steam smelled of cardamom,” and press it to my skin where the death stamp should be. [248]
Across the rhythm of tides I have wandered for months, collecting such fragments, and the containers have begun to echo them back, a chorus of erased histories reverberating through hollow walls. [275]
Sometimes I find whole crates of silence, seals unbroken, and when I crack them there is only darkness that smells of ocean and paper shredder, the scent of official forgetting. [305]
I slice open a carton marked “Archive,” expecting emptiness, but inside are reels of surveillance tape labeled by date, each one crossed out with fresh marker, as though time itself had been redacted. [335]
I feed a reel into an abandoned projector balanced on a pallet; the beam hits the container’s inner wall and shows the dock during a storm, workers hurrying, and there—frozen between frames—my own face looking up, alive, waving at a camera that should not have recorded me because I was already certified dead. [375]
The image flickers, dissolves into static, and I feel the poison label burn against my palm as if demanding loyalty to chemical endings rather than this endless middling. [395]
I pocket the tape, another layer, and step outside as the tide turns, water sucking at the pylons like a reader closing a book too quickly. [418]
At the far edge of the labyrinth, containers are stacked ten high, forming a narrow canyon where wind plays flute on loose rivets; here an old stevedore sits on a folding chair, eyes milky yet aimed at the horizon. [455]
He says, “I remember when these boxes were painted with company colors, when cargo had origin and destination, before everything turned the same rust and went nowhere.” [485]
I kneel, ask him for a memory, and he tears a corner from his lunch bag, writes: “The whistle at shift change used to sound like my wife calling me to supper.” [515]
I swallow the sentence like communion and feel it descend, stitching esophagus to emptiness. [535]
The moon slips behind cloud, tide at its lowest ebb, and the metal city groans, settling its weight on the stories trapped inside; I realize the labyrinth is not a maze but a press, compressing voices into laminate skin. [570]
If I gather enough layers, the accumulated texture might calcify into a new name, one the clerks cannot white-out, a name spoken by the tide itself when it returns at dawn to erase footprints and begin again. [605]
I press the poison label, the bakery steam, the whistle call, the projector reel, and the woman’s ampoule count against my chest, sealing them with duct tape torn from a broken crate, fashioning an armor of overheard existence. [645]
When the first horn of morning ships sounds, I walk toward the harbor mouth, each step clinking with borrowed recollections, and the containers no longer reflect strangers but a single figure stitched from many mouths, shimmering yet solid. [680]
