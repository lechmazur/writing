Maya descended into the glacier shrine each night, carrying the weight of other people's sleep. [14] The candles she lit reflected off walls of ancient ice, casting borrowed starlight across surfaces that had never seen the sun. [33] She was a wreck-diver by trade, but her true work happened here, where the boundary between the drowned and the dreaming grew thin as frost. [56]

The melted snow globe sat on the ice altar, its glass warped by fire, the miniature ship inside permanently tilted in dried glycerin turned amber. [79] She had pulled it from the Katerina, a research vessel that went down forty years ago in waters so cold they preserved everything—wood, metal, memories, souls. [106] 

Most wreck-divers sought treasure or closure for grieving families. [116] Maya sought something else: windows of connection, those rare moments when the dead could touch the living world again. [135] She had learned long ago that ghosts don't haunt places—they haunt the edges of consciousness, slipping into strangers' dreams like uninvited guests at a dinner party. [160]

The Katerina's ghosts had been appearing. [166] A woman in Portland dreamed of drowning in her bathtub, but the water tasted of diesel fuel. [184] A child in Oslo woke screaming about a man with frozen eyelashes who sang Russian lullabies. [201] A professor in Toronto kept dreaming of a snow globe, always just out of reach. [217]

Maya weaves truth carefully, never rushing to conclusions. [225] Each dream report that found its way to her—forwarded by sleep researchers, scattered across obscure forums, whispered by those who sensed she might understand—became a thread. [250] She mapped them, analyzed the cameo appearances in strangers' dreams, searching for patterns in the static. [267]

Tonight, seventeen candles burned. [271] Seventeen dreams, seventeen fragments of the Katerina's final moments. [281] The ghost who owned this snow globe was speaking, but in a language of symbols and borrowed neural pathways. [300]

Maya closed her eyes and let the dreams flow through her memory like cold water. [316] The Portland woman: drowning, but also falling—the sensation of a ship listing. [329] The Oslo child: the Russian lullaby was a crew member's last song. [342] The Toronto professor: reaching for the snow globe, desperate to save something, anything. [356]

She opened her eyes and looked at the melted artifact. [366] Its ship was the Katerina itself, a replica. [375] Someone aboard had carried this, a talisman of the journey they were on, studying arctic currents, climate change, the slow violence of warming seas. [399]

"You were the captain," Maya whispered to the empty shrine. [410] Her breath crystallized in the air. [417] "You went back for the data. [424] The ship was going down, but you went back for the research logs." [438]

The candles flickered, though no wind reached this deep into the glacier. [451]

"You wanted to salvage something pure from the wreckage," she continued, her voice soft with understanding. [467] "Not your own life. [472] The data. [475] The proof of what was happening to the ice." [485]

She had to expose this truth—not for sensation, but because it mattered. [498] The Katerina went down before its research could be published. [509] The world believed it was lost to mechanical failure. [519] But the dreams told a different story: a captain who chose to drown rather than abandon evidence of a dying planet. [541]

Maya picked up the ruined snow globe, feeling its strange warmth against her diving-callused palms. [556] Tomorrow, she would contact the archives, tell them where to dive again, where to find the waterproof containers the captain had secured before the end. [580]

"I'll make sure they know," she promised the silence. [590] "Your windows of connection—I found them. [597] The truth doesn't have to stay buried with you." [607]

The candles burned steady now, and Maya felt the familiar sensation of a ghost departing, satisfied, moving toward whatever waited beyond the dreams of strangers. [633] She sat in the shrine carved into glacier ice, surrounded by the gentle glow of flame on frozen water, holding a melted testament to everything worth saving. [660]

Outside, the aurora began its dance—borrowed starlight indeed, solar wind caught in magnetic fields, making beauty from things that had traveled impossible distances to arrive here, now, visible only in reflection. [691]

Like ghosts. [693] Like truth. [695] Like the small, fierce love that makes someone choose to drown with their conscience intact. [710]

Maya extinguished the candles one by one, carrying their smoke and the captain's peace back up toward the surface. [730]
