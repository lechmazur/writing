The antique watch fob hung from Della's neck on a leather cord, its tarnished silver catching fragments of lamplight as she descended the barnacle-crusted ladder. [27] Her father had given it to her the night the revenue men shot him, pressing the heirloom into her palm with bloodied fingers. [52] Now it led her into the pirate market beneath Gallow's Pier, where stolen goods and silence were traded in equal measure. [73]

The marketplace sprawled through a network of rotting timber supports, each vendor's stall illuminated by oil lamps that created pockets of amber warmth in the salt-thick darkness. [100] Della moved through the crowd with curiously steadfast determination, her fingers wrapped around the recording device hidden in her coat pocket. [122] She had come to capture something more valuable than any contraband: the sound of trust breaking. [139]

For three months, she'd been planning this. [146] Her father's moonshine operation had thrived on the truce of hush that governed the underground economy—everyone kept everyone else's secrets, and the system survived. [173] But someone had broken that silence, whispered to the authorities, sent her father into an ambush. [190] Tonight, she would identify the traitor and record their confession, preserving the moment when loyalty shattered into betrayal. [208]

She'd started with false leads, deliberately, methodically. [215] Each false start had been calculated to flush out the informant. [227] She'd told Marcus the sailmaker that she was running shine from the north caves. [242] She'd whispered to Old Chen that a shipment would arrive at the dock at midnight. [258] She'd confided in Vera the fence about a cache hidden in the church basement. [273] Each lie was different, tagged, traceable. [279] Whichever falsehood reached the revenue men would reveal her father's killer. [291]

The watch fob grew warm against her chest as she approached the back of the market, where the pier's foundation met the rocky shore. [314] Here, in the deepest shadows, the most dangerous dealers conducted their business. [327] Nathaniel Kern sat on a throne of lobster traps, his face half-hidden by the upturned collar of his coat. [347] He'd been her father's oldest friend, his most trusted partner. [358]

"You're looking for answers in dark places, Della girl," Kern said without preamble. [371] His voice carried the comforting cadence of her childhood, stories by the fire, lullabies that smelled like copper and grain alcohol. [391]

"I'm looking for truth," she replied, and pressed the record button in her pocket. [406]

Kern's eyes flickered to the watch fob at her throat. [417] "Your daddy loved that piece. [422] Said it kept better time than any man's word." [432]

"Funny thing about time," Della said, moving closer. [440] "The revenue men knew exactly when to find him. [450] Down to the minute." [454] She had told Vera about the church at midnight. [464] She had told Chen about the docks at two. [474] But she had told only Kern about the north caves at dawn—and that's where they'd shot her father as the sun rose. [498]

The unease between them thickened like fog. [505] Kern's hand drifted toward his belt. [512]

"Don't," Della said. [515] "I just need to hear you say it. [524] I need to know why." [530]

The comfort in his expression curdled into something desperate. [539] "They had my daughter. [543] The revenue men, they took Sarah, said they'd charge her as an accomplice unless—" His voice cracked. [561] "I tried to thwart them, sent them to wrong places, but they knew I was lying. [577] They gave me one last chance. [583] Him or her, Della. [587] What would you have chosen?" [592]

The device in her pocket captured every word, the tremor, the breaking. [604] Della's hand touched the watch fob, felt its steady weight. [614] Outside, beyond the rotting timber and dark water, the first gray fingers of sunrise were reaching across the harbor. [633] Her time was almost up. [638]

She had what she came for: the sound of trust shattering, preserved forever. [651] But standing in the comforting unease of the moment, listening to a father's confession justify another father's death, she understood that some truces of hush existed not from cowardice, but from mercy. [683]

Della reached into her pocket and stopped the recording. [692]

"Go get Sarah," she said quietly. [698] "Be gone before sunrise." [702]

The watch fob swung gently as she climbed back toward the dying stars. [715]
