Maren held the fragrance chemist's blotter petal between her fingers, watching amber light filter through the grotto's resinous walls. [19] The paper-thin petal, stained with a thousand emotional essences, trembled as she brought it toward her client's temple. [37] Dusk painted everything in honeyed tones, softening the edges of what she was about to do. [53]

"This will feel like remembering," she said, her voice kind but measured. [65] A half truth, technically accurate—the counterfeit emotions she dealt did mimic memory's gentle arrival. [79] What she didn't mention was how they'd subsume his authentic feelings entirely, replacing grief with manufactured contentment. [95]

Her client, a middle-aged man named Thomas, nodded with desperate hope. [106] He'd lost his daughter six months ago and couldn't bear the weight anymore. [119] Maren understood, in her professionally thorough way, cataloging his trembling hands and hollow eyes alongside hundreds of others she'd helped. [138] She'd built her reputation on precision, on never promising what she couldn't deliver, on being exactly what her clients needed her to be. [161]

She pressed her fingertips to his forehead, sensing through static electricity the chaotic signature of his raw anguish. [178] Every genuine emotion carried its own electrical frequency, crackling against her specially-trained nerve endings like distinct voices. [194] His pain registered as jagged purple lightning, earthing itself through his body in waves. [208] The counterfeit she'd prepared hummed differently—smooth, regulated, a gentle amber current that would gradually subsume the purple chaos. [226]

"Tell me about her," Maren said, applying the blotter petal to his skin. [239] The fragrance molecules began their work immediately, but she'd learned long ago that her true service wasn't chemical—it was this witnessing. [260] Her motivation had always been to fuse insight with empathy, to understand precisely what she was taking from people while offering something bearable in return. [283]

Thomas spoke haltingly of his daughter's laugh, her terrible singing voice, her fierce intelligence. [297] Maren listened with affectionate detachment, caring genuinely while maintaining the professional distance that allowed her to do this work. [315] She'd loved clients before, in her way—loved them the way a sculptor loves clay, shaping their emotional landscapes into something survivable. [336]

As the transformation completed, she felt the shift through her fingertips—his jagged frequencies smoothing into amber regularity. [353] The static electricity told her everything: grief becoming nostalgic fondness, sharp absence becoming gentle melancholy. [367] Counterfeit, yes, but functional. [371] Bearable. [372]

Thomas's face relaxed, tension draining away. [378] "I can see her clearly now," he whispered. [386] "But it doesn't hurt anymore." [391]

Another half truth forming in his mind, Maren thought. [400] He'd remember his daughter, certainly, but through a gauze of manufactured peace. [413] The real memory—the one that burned and breathed and destroyed—would remain locked beneath the counterfeit layer, preserved but inaccessible. [432]

"Will it last?" he asked. [437]

"As long as you need it to," she replied, the most honest thing she'd said. [452] The counterfeits eventually degraded, forcing people back toward authentic feeling or toward her services again. [467] She'd designed them that way deliberately, professionally thorough in building her business model while allowing clients eventual escape routes. [485]

She walked him to the grotto's entrance where evening had deepened into twilight. [498] The amber walls glowed from within, lit by bioluminescent deposits she'd cultivated specifically for this liminal atmosphere. [515] Everything in her practice served dual purposes: beauty and function, truth and omission, empathy and commerce. [531]

After Thomas left, Maren returned to her worktable, pressing the blotter petal against her own wrist. [547] She inhaled deeply, sensing through static electricity the residue of his pain mixed with her careful craftsmanship. [564] Her fingertips tingled with the memory of his transformation, purple lightning becoming amber current. [578]

She'd tell herself she was helping people, which was true. [589] She'd tell herself they came willingly, which was also true. [600] What she wouldn't tell herself, at least not tonight, was that each counterfeit emotion she dealt carved away a small piece of her own authenticity. [624] But that was the nature of half truths—they protected you from complete darkness while never quite reaching the light. [643]

Maren filed the blotter petal in her collection and prepared for the next client, professionally thorough as always. [660]
