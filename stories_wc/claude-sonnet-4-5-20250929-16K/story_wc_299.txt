Marcus held the torn speaker grille cloth between his fingers, feeling the familiar weave that had once covered a Marshall stack at Red Rocks. [23] The fabric smelled like dust and decades, carried into his quarry office trailer by a woman claiming her father played Woodstock. [47] He didn't look up, didn't meet her eyes, just examined the threads under his magnifying lamp and stated facts. [66] "Synthetic fiber, not introduced until 1971," he said, his voice flat as the limestone outside his window. [84] "The weave pattern matches Peavey, not Fender or Marshall, common from the mid-seventies." [99]

Two months ago, he'd said similar words on PBS, authenticating a Stratocaster in front of three million viewers. [117] Confidently uncertain, the producers had called his style—that particular blend of expertise and humility that made good television. [136] Except the guitar had been fake, a detail a grad student discovered the next day, and Marcus learned that public humiliation echoes longer than any encore. [163]

The woman shifted her weight, making the trailer creak. [172] "So it's worthless?" [176]

"I didn't say that," Marcus replied, still hiding behind his loupe. [187] "I'm saying your father wasn't at Woodstock with this." [197] He turned the cloth over, looking for the truth he'd failed to find before, trying to wrest meaning from fibers and facts. [220] After the applause ended, after the lights went dark, this was what remained—fragments that demanded interpretation, stories that begged to be believed. [243]

He'd spent seven years hauling equipment for bands nobody remembered, wrapping cables in darkness while musicians bathed in stage light. [263] He knew what came after the applause: the empty venues, the long drives, the morning light showing every crack in the paint. [285] When his back gave out in Tulsa, he'd traded roadie work for antiques, channeling his knowledge of vintage gear into something stationary, something that felt like expertise. [311]

"My father never lied," the woman said, and Marcus heard the tremor underneath. [324]

He set down his tools and finally looked at her face—fifty-something, daughter trying to protect a ghost. [343] He understood that impulse, that desperate need to preserve the story even when facts suggested revision. [360] "The cloth is real vintage," he offered, retreating again into data, insulating himself against her disappointment and his own lingering shame. [381] "Late seventies Peavey, probably from a club amp, well-used." [391] He paused, picking his words carefully. [397] "Your father played somewhere, for someone, and people listened." [407]

She nodded slowly, accepting this smaller truth. [414]

After she left, Marcus sat in the cooling trailer, watching dust motes drift through the afternoon light streaming across his desk. [434] The quarry beyond his window had been excavated down to nothing, then abandoned when the good stone was gone, leaving only this hollow place where sound traveled strange, every noise returning changed. [469]

He picked up the grille cloth scrap she'd left behind, payment for his honesty. [483] In his hands, it felt like a piece of stage, a fragment of the place between performance and silence where he'd spent his youth. [508] Those late-night load-outs, the smell of blown speakers and spilled beer, the particular texture of road-worn equipment—he'd known that world completely, moved through it with purpose. [534]

Now he lived in facts because they required no faith, but facts couldn't tell him what to do with the rest of his life. [557] The public failure had stripped away his confidence, left him here among the stones and echoes, trying to appraise his own worth. [579]

He tacked the speaker cloth to his trailer wall, above his authentication certificates, above the framed backstage passes from tours nobody remembered. [600] Maybe discovering purpose after loss meant accepting that every expert was confidently uncertain, that truth was something you had to wrest from uncertainty each time, that meaning wasn't found in being right but in continuing to look. [638]

Outside, the quarry held its silence, that echo valley longing for the voices that once filled it. [656] Marcus turned on his desk lamp against the gathering dusk, pulled another estate box toward him, and began again, searching through remnants for whatever truth they'd consent to yield. [684]
