The truffle forager named Mara worked the hanging orchard with methodical precision, her boots finding purchase on rope bridges that swayed above the ravine. [25] After the empathy virus had swept through three years prior, most people had fled to the cities where emotional dampeners were distributed freely. [50] But Mara remained here, among the storm-battered apple trees that clung to cliff faces, their roots wrapped around ancient stone. [70]

The virus had left her involuntarily truthful—every question demanded an honest answer, every greeting became a confession. [87] She'd learned to work alone, where silence was possible. [96]

Today, she'd found something besides truffles. [102] Wrapped in oilcloth beneath an oak's exposed roots: an antique glass eye, pale blue with gold flecks that seemed to swim in the light. [126] Mara recognized it immediately from the smugglers' codes she'd memorized—a pre-virus relic, one of the old "occluders" that supposedly let wearers hide their emotional broadcasts. [151]

During the virus's height, when everyone felt everyone else's pain and joy in crushing waves, such objects had been banned. [170] Empathy was meant to unite humanity, the authorities said. [179] Hiding from it was criminal. [184]

But Mara understood what the authorities didn't: constant empathy was its own torture. [197] Without psychological safety, without the ability to occlude one's inner world, people had fractured. [211] Some had grown beautiful in their vulnerability, yes, but that grace came at the price of selves shattered beyond repair. [230]

She pocketed the glass eye carefully. [236]

The storms came that evening, as they always did, howling through the ravine with rain that struck horizontally. [254] Mara retreated to her cabin—little more than a shelter wedged between two ancient trees—and lit her oil lamp. [273] From beneath her cot, she pulled the stack of discredited textbooks she'd collected from abandoned libraries: pre-virus psychology texts, banned neurological studies, treatises on privacy and personhood. [298]

The authorities had declared these obsolete after the virus. [307] Why need boundaries when all could feel each other's hearts? [317] Why require solitude when connection was compulsory? [324]

But the textbooks spoke of rumored cures, methods to rebuild the walls that made a self coherent. [341] Mara had been searching for years, reading by lamplight while storms battered her hanging orchard. [356]

Tonight, she examined the glass eye beside the open pages. [366] One text described "emotional prosthetics"—devices that filtered the empathic broadcast, allowing wearers to choose what they shared. [383] The eye wasn't meant to restore vision but to occlude the involuntary transmission of feeling. [398]

Mara's rational mind catalogued the risks: the relic might be broken, might make things worse, might attract the authorities who still patrolled for such contraband. [422] But when a neighbor had visited last week and asked, "Are you happy here?" [436] Mara had been unable to stop herself from answering: "No. [447] I'm lonely enough to scream, but screaming would only broadcast my loneliness to the valley below, and I couldn't bear everyone feeling it." [470]

The neighbor had wept with her pain. [477] Another fracture, another piece of grace broken off and scattered. [487]

She held the glass eye up to the lamplight. [497] According to the textbook, it should be placed against the temple, where it would somehow interface with the virus's changes to her neural pathways. [519]

The rational part of her noted this was likely superstition. [529] But rationality hadn't saved anyone from the virus. [537]

She pressed the cool glass to her skin. [545]

For a moment, nothing—then a sensation like a door closing softly inside her mind. [560] Not locking, just closing. [565] Able to be opened at will. [571]

When the next storm came, Mara stood on her rope bridge and felt her fear without projecting it across the ravine. [590] She felt her own heart, whole and private, hers alone to share or keep. [604]

It was a fractured kind of grace, this rebuilding. [613] But it was hers. [617]

She descended to search for truffles, for more relics, for others who might need their doors returned. [634] The hanging orchard swayed in the wind, resilient and storm-scarred and surviving. [647]

Like her. [649]
