Mira had always painted with light, projecting brilliant images onto crumbling walls that lasted only as long as her batteries held charge. [23] In the ruined orchard district, where fog had pooled for centuries like spilled milk, permanence seemed beside the point anyway. [44] The mist devoured everything eventually, even memory. [51]

She'd come here following whispers from the knowledge network—that loosely connected web of historians, urban explorers, and romantics who traded secrets about forgotten places. [76] Someone had posted coordinates and a single cryptic phrase: "Joy grows in the oldest soil." [91]

Now, threading between skeletal apple trees whose bark had long since turned to silver-gray stone, Mira wondered if this was all happening within the fold of a daydream. [116] The fog made everything uncertain, dreamlike. [122] Her footsteps seemed to echo before she took them. [131]

The fresco fragment stopped her cold. [137]

It jutted from a collapsed wall, perhaps once part of a merchant's house or community gathering place. [153] Despite centuries of moisture, the colors sang: a child reaching toward painted fruit, her expression caught between concentration and delight. [172] Mira recognized that look. [176] She'd worn it herself once, before art became work, before her murals became merely impressive rather than joyful. [194]

She set down her equipment with the careful reverence of someone handling exposed film—that was how she thought of this place, actually. [216] The whole district felt like a photograph developing in reverse, light slowly stealing the image rather than revealing it. [234] Every moment here exposed the past a little more, risking overexposure, the whites bleeding out until nothing remained but fog. [253]

"Well," she said to the painted child, "let's see if we remember how this works." [268]

Mira unpacked her projectors, those instruments that made her a mural artist of the ephemeral age. [284] But tonight—today?—she did something different. [291] Instead of imposing new images, she traced the fresco's lines with light, amplifying what already existed. [306] Her beams followed the child's reaching hand, then spread outward, imagining the rest of the orchard as it must have been. [327]

Trees bloomed in projected light, their blossoms pink and white and perfect. [339] She painted fruit in impossible colors because why not, because joy didn't follow rules. [353] Apples glowed gold, pears shimmered purple, and strange hybrid fruits she invented on the spot dangled from branches like edible stars. [373]

The fog became her canvas, accepting the light, diffusing it into something magical. [386]

Through the knowledge network, she started streaming the display, not for fame but for connection. [401] Comments flowed in like birds returning: "I remember joy looking exactly like this." [413] "My grandmother's orchard was in this district—thank you." [422] "This is the feeling I've been trying to describe for years." [433]

Mira found herself laughing, a sound she hadn't heard from her own throat in months. [448] The absurdity of it struck her—projecting light into fog in a dead orchard while strangers across the network wept with recognition. [468] Pensive mirth, her old teacher would have called this mood, that particular cocktail of melancholy and delight that made the best art possible. [490]

She adjusted the projectors, and the painted child seemed to pluck a light-fruit from a light-tree. [507] In the fresco fragment, the girl's hand remained eternally outstretched, wanting. [518] In Mira's amplification, the hand closed around abundance. [526]

"There," Mira whispered. [529] "That's what it feels like." [534]

She stayed until dawn threatened, until the fog began to thin and her batteries dimmed. [549] The knowledge network had logged over ten thousand viewers, many leaving coordinates to other forgotten places, fragments of joy they wanted illuminated. [570]

Walking out through the stone trees, Mira realized she'd been holding her breath for months, maybe years. [587] In that daydream fold, that timeless fog-space, she'd remembered something essential: joy wasn't lost in the past, waiting to be excavated. [607] It was right here, in the reaching, in the painting with light, in the momentary connection between then and now, between wanting and having. [630]

The fresco fragment remained behind, the little girl still reaching in her bubble of painted time. [646] But now Mira carried her answer outward, into the next ruin, the next forgotten place where light might grow something beautiful from old soil. [669]

The fog swallowed her footsteps, but for once, she didn't mind the erasure. [682] Some things—the best things—only needed to exist for a moment to prove that joy could be rediscovered whenever someone bothered to paint with light. [707]
