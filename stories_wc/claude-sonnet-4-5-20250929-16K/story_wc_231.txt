The opal dock gleamed wetly through the mist at nautical twilight, that liminal hour when sea and sky merged into indistinguishable gray. [21] Margit stood at the water's edge, the dried Edelweiss boutonnière clutched in her weathered fingers, studying the harbor where she'd found the drowned man three days before. [48] As lighthouse keeper for twenty-seven years, she'd seen bodies before, but none had left her with this peculiar burden. [68]

The stranger had worn the Alpine flower pinned to his lapel, impossibly preserved despite the salt water. [86] More disturbing were the borrowed memories that came when she touched it—fragments of experiences that couldn't be hers. [105] A child's birthday in Geneva. [110] The taste of her grandmother's strudel, though Margit's grandmother had been Swedish. [122] A marriage proposal on a mountain she'd never climbed. [132]

She'd reported the body to the harbor police, who identified him as Ernst Kohler, a cognitive researcher from Zurich with no known connections to this remote Norwegian coast. [158] They'd taken his effects except the boutonnière, which had fallen unnoticed beneath the dock. [174] When Margit found it the next morning, the memories began—softly persistent, like waves wearing down stone. [191]

Now she returned to investigate, compelled by a need to decode this stranger's final gesture. [207] Why had he worn an Edelweiss here, so far from Alpine meadows? [220] Why did touching it fill her mind with his life, or what felt like his life? [238]

Margit approached the problem as she approached everything—by observing gaps. [249] The spaces between what was said and unsaid. [258] What the harbor police hadn't asked. [264] What the memories themselves omitted. [269]

She replayed Ernst's borrowed memories carefully, noting their edges. [279] The birthday party ended abruptly mid-song. [286] The mountain proposal contained no answer, only the question hanging in alpine air. [300] The strudel memory had no beginning, just the taste and a profound sadness. [314]

Gaps. [315]

Margit walked the dock's length, studying where she'd found him. [326] The tide had been going out. [333] His body had shown no signs of struggle. [342] He'd simply been there at dawn, floating face-down, the white Edelweiss bright against his dark coat. [359]

She pressed the flower to her temple and let another memory surface. [372] This one was different—recent. [377] Ernst standing on this very dock in twilight identical to this one, pulling the boutonnière from his pocket. [395] He'd brought it from home, from his daughter's funeral three months ago. [408] It had been pinned to the small casket. [417] Anna, aged seven. [421] The same child from the birthday memory, Margit realized. [430]

The borrowed memory continued. [434] Ernst had developed a neural interface technology for memory transfer, hoping to preserve consciousness beyond death. [450] After Anna died, he'd encoded his memories of her into the flower's crystalline structure—Edelweiss stems containing silicate compounds perfect for data storage. [472] He'd succeeded technically, but the memories only deepened his isolation, playing back moments that could never return. [490]

In this final memory, Ernst stood where Margit stood now, understanding that preserved memories weren't preservation at all. [507] They were ghosts. [510] Beautiful, perfect, and utterly separate from living. [517] He'd come to this remote place specifically for its witnessed isolation—the lighthouse keeper who would find him, the automated beacon that would continue regardless, the indifferent sea. [544]

He'd weighted his pockets with stones but kept the Edelweiss pinned outside, hoping someone would understand his gesture. [563] Not suicide exactly, but a man choosing to stop being a museum of his own grief. [580]

Margit held the boutonnière over the water. [588] The borrowed memories would die with the flower, and perhaps that was the point. [603] Some things weren't meant to persist beyond their moment. [613] Anna's laughter, Ernst's love, even this understanding Margit had gained—all were meant to fade like mist at nautical twilight. [633]

She released the Edelweiss. [637] It floated briefly on the dark water, then sank. [647] The memories left her immediately, replaced by her own solitude, which felt lighter now. [661] Ernst's final gesture decoded: not preservation, but permission to let go. [673]

Margit walked back toward her lighthouse, its beam cutting softly, persistently through the gathering dark. [689]
