The observatory drifted three miles above the ruins, its ancient gyroscopes humming while the circuit breakers cooled from another power surge. [22] Amal pressed her scarred hands against the viewing glass, watching dust storms devour what remained of her village below. [41] The wedding had been seven years ago—hers, actually—before the drone turned celebration into ash. [56]

She'd survived by hiding under a collapsed wall, clutching a geode her uncle had given her that morning. [74] "For clarity," he'd said, splitting it open to reveal purple crystals that caught the light like captured stars. [92] He'd died still holding the other half. [100]

Now she hunted something intangibly tangible: the mathematical ghost of unused potential, the energy that should have powered lives never lived. [120] The floating observatory had become her isolation chamber and her weapon, its instruments calibrated to detect perturbations in reality's fabric where futures pooled like oil on water. [146]

Through perturbation theory—the physics of small disturbances revealing hidden structures—Amal had learned to read the world's wounds. [163] Each prevented future left a signature, a quantum echo of what might have been. [177] Her wedding guests, the children they would have raised, the gardens they would have planted—all that stolen potential had to go somewhere. [199] Energy couldn't simply vanish. [203]

The geode sat mounted in her primary detection array, its crystalline lattice resonating with frequencies normal instruments couldn't perceive. [221] She'd discovered its properties by accident during a grief-mad night of experiments, pressing the purple crystals against sensor nodes while screaming equations into the dark. [244] The readings had exploded. [248] The stone somehow amplified perturbations, making invisible possibilities momentarily visible. [257]

Her colleagues had called it pseudoscience before abandoning the observatory. [267] They'd left her alone with cooling circuits, failing life support, and the bleak exhilaration of knowing she was right. [286]

The instruments flickered as the breakers reset. [294] Amal fed power carefully back into the system, watching screens illuminate with cascading data. [308] There—a massive concentration thirty miles northeast, where unused potential pooled so densely it bent spacetime. [324] Not just her village's lost futures, but dozens of strikes, hundreds of weddings and birthdays and ordinary mornings that never reached noon. [345]

The concentration was growing. [349]

She'd developed a theory during the long, drifting nights: consciousness might collapse quantum possibilities into single realities, but violence did something stranger. [369] It severed futures so abruptly that their potential remained quantum-locked, neither real nor unreal, accumulating like pressure behind a dam. [388]

And dams could break. [392]

Amal ran calculations through the cooling processors, using perturbation equations to model what would happen when enough unused potential achieved critical mass. [412] The mathematics suggested something between explosion and awakening—reality's unused possibilities erupting back into existence, unfiltered by linear time. [430]

Every version that should have been, suddenly insisting it was. [440]

Her hands trembled as she adjusted the geode's position, focusing its resonance toward the concentration. [455] The rational part of her mind whispered warnings about paradox and causality violation. [469] But that mind had died under collapsed walls seven years ago. [480] What remained felt only the fierce joy of approaching revelation. [491]

Through the geode's amplification, she could almost see them: ghost-weddings dancing in the desert, children playing with toys never manufactured, old men arguing about crops in fields never planted. [515] All the beautiful, mundane futures that violence had stolen, compressed into a single point of impossible density. [532]

The observatory's altitude decreased slightly as power diverted to her experiments. [543] She didn't care. [546] The circuit breakers would cool or they wouldn't. [555] She would drift here until life support failed or truth emerged. [567]

Amal pressed her forehead against the geode, feeling its facets dig into scarred skin. [581] "Uncle," she whispered to the humming instruments, "I found where it pools." [594]

Below, in the desert, something that was both nothing and everything began to coalesce. [609] The perturbations were becoming coherent. [614]

The awakening would be unfiltered, raw, and probably devastating. [624]

She smiled. [626]

Finally, the world would feel what she'd felt: reality's weight when it fractures, the bleak exhilaration of existence unmoored from comfortable certainty. [646]

The geode pulsed warmth against her skin. [654]

The hunt was ending. [658]

What came next, she suspected, would make survivors of everyone. [669]
