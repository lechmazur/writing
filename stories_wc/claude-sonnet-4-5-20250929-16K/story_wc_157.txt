The greenhouse smelled of soil and beetle wings. [8] Dr. Malachi Renn adjusted his wire-rimmed glasses, grinning at the assembled conspirators hiding among the terrariums of his entomologist colleague. [28] "Friends," he began, his voice honey-smooth despite the tremor in his hands, "the MindTax Bureau logged my breakfast thoughts yesterday—scrambled eggs, apparently, cost me forty credits in 'food fantasy taxation.'" [55]

Nervous laughter rippled through the group. [61] Since the Cognitive Revenue Act passed, thinking had become a luxury. [72] Neural implants monitored synaptic activity, billing citizens for every imagination, every memory revisited, every private rebellion. [87] The government called it fair taxation of mental resources. [96] The people called it theft. [101]

Malachi was a charming rogue scholar, expelled from three universities for "ideological contraband" but beloved by students who smuggled his lectures on flash drives. [125] He'd gathered them here, in this humidity-thick sanctuary of catalogued insects, because Dr. Chen kept her greenhouse off-grid—no surveillance cameras could pierce the condensation-fogged glass. [149]

"I propose," Malachi continued, pulling a weathered gourd rattle from his satchel, "a secret language club." [165] He shook it gently; seeds rattled inside like imprisoned thoughts seeking freedom. [177] "Not spoken, not written—planted." [182]

A young woman named Iris leaned forward. [189] "Planted?" [190]

"Community gardens," Malachi explained, his tone candidly cryptic, as always. [200] "We join them across the city, plant message patterns that warp traditional botanical arrangements into readable code." [217] He cracked the gourd open, spilling dozens of seeds into his palm. [230] "Gourd rattle seeds grow fast, climb high, bear fruit that produces sound—natural encryptions." [244]

The room erupted in overlapping voices, questions colliding with objections, excitement tangling with fear. [258] Converging chaos, Malachi thought, is how revolutions begin. [267]

Dr. Chen spoke from her corner, where she'd been cataloguing click beetles. [279] "The MindTax auditors patrol community gardens now. [287] They're suspicious of patterns, of anything resembling organization." [296]

"Exactly why it'll work," Malachi countered. [302] "They're looking for digital networks, encrypted files. [310] They won't recognize a row of gourds beside tomatoes as dissent." [322] He distributed seeds to each person. [329] "Plant in spirals for questions, straight lines for statements, figure-eights for urgent warnings." [342]

Iris held her seed up to the light filtering through palm fronds. [355] "But why?" she asked. [360] "Why risk audit seizures, memory wipes, imprisonment?" [368]

Malachi's expression softened, the roguish charm giving way to something rawer. [380] "Because we must stand guard over our own sparks of defiance," he said quietly. [395] "Every thought they tax, they own. [402] Every imagination they price, they control. [409] If we don't protect the private spaces in our minds, we become calculators—processing, not living." [425]

The greenhouse fell silent except for the mechanical hum of Dr. Chen's incubators. [439]

"I watched my daughter stop drawing," contributed an older man, his voice breaking. [453] "She's seven. [456] The implant flagged her crayon scribbles as 'non-productive creative expenditure.' Now she sits still, thinking nothing, because nothing costs nothing." [476]

The chaos converged into something sharper: purpose. [483]

Over the following weeks, they dispersed across the city, joining community gardens with forged enthusiasm for urban agriculture. [501] Malachi himself tended three plots, charming garden coordinators with tales of heirloom vegetables and sustainable living. [517] Meanwhile, gourd vines climbed their trellises, spelling warnings in green cursive: MindTax audits planned for District Seven. [535] Safe houses available. [538] Do not submit to voluntary deep scans. [546]

The language warped and evolved, new members learning the botanical grammar, teaching others. [559] Seeds became syntax. [562] Gardens became libraries of resistance. [567]

In the entomologist's greenhouse, surrounded by insects that had survived epochs through adaptation, Malachi added another gourd rattle to his collection. [587] This one, grown from their first planting, sounded different when shaken—fuller, angrier, alive. [601]

"They can tax thoughts," he told Iris during a late-night meeting, "but they can't tax what grows wild." [621]

She smiled, pockets heavy with seeds for tomorrow's planting. [631]

Outside, the city's neural surveillance towers blinked in the darkness, monitoring, calculating, billing. [645]

Inside, the secret language took root. [652]
