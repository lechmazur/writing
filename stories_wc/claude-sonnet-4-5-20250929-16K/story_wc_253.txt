The farmhouse sat beneath the wind turbines like a forgotten gravestone, their blades carving silence into smaller, more precise silences. [21] Maya watched them through the kitchen window while dramatically narrating her dishwashing to no one: "She lifts the plate, encrusted with yesterday's optimism, and scrubs in circular motions, clockwise, as mandated." [49] Her voice held no inflection. [54] The Happiness Mandate had ended three months ago, but its absence left a vacuum where feelings should have been. [72]

Her brother's dried flower bouquet still hung above the sink, petals brown and brittle, from the funeral no one was permitted to cry at. [95] That had been during the Mandate, when grief was illegal and joy was currency. [109] She'd smiled through the service. [114] Everyone had. [116]

Now she was learning what the grief counselors called "remade hush"—the careful reconstruction of silence that allowed feeling to exist again without naming it. [138] It meant moving through the world blank-faced, a performer in a show with no audience and no script. [156]

The turbines groaned. [159] Maya picked up her brother's whittling knife from the windowsill. [169] "She examines the blade," she announced to the empty room, "noting how efficiently it could slice through the stems of dead flowers or the thin skin of wrists." [196] She didn't know if that thought made her morally ambiguous or simply honest. [209] During the Mandate, such thoughts were rewired. [216] After, they simply existed, neither good nor bad, suspended in the emotional void everyone now inhabited. [232]

She found a piece of driftwood Tom had collected from their last beach trip, back when beaches still existed for recreation rather than processing centers. [255] "She begins to whittle," Maya narrated, the knife peeling away pale curls. [268] "Not creating anything. [271] Just reducing." [273] The rhythm matched the turbine blades. [279] Slice, turn, slice. [282]

Tom had taught her to whittle during the Mandate's early days, when they'd needed activities to perform happiness around. [301] "Make something joyful," the enforcers would say, watching families through kitchen windows. [313] So they'd carved smiling faces into wood, their own faces carefully arranged in matching expressions. [328]

Now Maya carved nothing at all. [334] Just made the wood smaller. [339] "She cultivates lightness," she narrated, "not in the sense of joy, but in the sense of weight, of mass, of evidence." [361] Each curl that fell away was grief made physical, then dismissed. [373] This was what remade hush meant—not the absence of feeling but its transformation into something that could be borne without breaking the new, fragile peace. [400]

The turbines had been installed during the Mandate, their hum designed to mask unapproved sounds. [416] Crying. [417] Screaming. [418] The wet, animal noises of actual human feeling. [426] They'd overshadowed the farmhouse completely, turned it into a footnote beneath renewable energy and social engineering. [443]

"She considers taking down the bouquet," Maya narrated, but her hands kept whittling. [457] The flowers had been picked by Mandate enforcers, bred to bloom in prescribed colors: yellow for mandatory joy, pink for approved affection. [478] Tom had hated them. [482] She'd hung them anyway because keeping them felt like the only morally ambiguous choice available—neither honoring the Mandate nor properly mourning its violence. [505]

The wood in her hands had become nearly translucent, whittled down to almost nothing. [519] "She has made it light," Maya said. [527] Her voice cracked slightly—the first uncontrolled sound she'd produced in weeks. [540]

The turbines didn't care. [544] They kept spinning, generating power for cities that had learned to function without authentic emotion, where everyone moved blank-faced through predetermined routines, narrating their existence because direct experience remained too dangerous. [572]

Maya set down the knife and finally reached for the bouquet. [583] The dried flowers disintegrated at her touch, petals falling like manufactured snow. [596] She didn't narrate this. [600] Some moments of lightness, she was learning, required their own kind of hush—remade or otherwise. [616] In the space where the bouquet had hung, there was only wall, only absence, only the beginning of something that might eventually become permission to feel. [642]

Outside, the turbines continued their endless work, and Maya stood in their shadow, lighter now, emptier, learning slowly how to carry nothing at all. [667]
