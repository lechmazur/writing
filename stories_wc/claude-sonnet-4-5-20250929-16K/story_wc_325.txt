The facility appeared only between tides, when the sea pulled back to expose barnacled walls and rusted walkways like the ribs of some ancient creature. [25]

Maya pressed against the entrance, fighting the familiar constriction in her chest. [37] A claustrophobic spelunker was a contradiction she'd lived with for twelve years, ever since her sister disappeared into these same corridors. [58] The research station had studied undersea cables—mapping the invisible highways of data that connected continents beneath the waves. [77] But something else had lived in those cables, something her sister had been tracking when the facility was abandoned and struck from every record. [100]

The codex lay open in Maya's waterproof pack, its medieval margins decorated with gold flecks that caught the dying light. [120] Her sister had found it in the facility's archive room, had recognized that the illuminated patterns weren't decorative—they were maps. [141] Maps of signals that shouldn't exist, traveling through the cables in pulses that matched no known transmission protocol. [159] Electromagnetic whispers from somewhere deep. [164]

Maya descended into the first chamber as water dripped from the ceiling in a rhythm like failing breath. [182] Crashing hush, crashing hush—the sound of the ocean above, muffled but present, a weight she felt in her bones. [203] Her equipment detected the familiar traces: electromagnetic anomalies following paths that mimicked the cable routes her sister had documented. [222] Invisible things, but Maya had learned to track them through their effects—the way compass needles trembled, the way her instruments' readings shifted in cascading patterns. [247]

The facility sprawled through four levels, each one more corroded than the last, each one narrower. [263] She moved quickly, knowing she had maybe forty minutes before the tide returned. [277] The phase transitions were already beginning—pools of standing water starting to freeze where the temperature dropped, condensation forming on metal walls as pressure changed. [301] The facility seemed to breathe, moving between states: exposed and submerged, air and water, remembered and forgotten. [318]

In the deepest level, where the primary cable junction had been housed, Maya found what she'd come for. [336] The monitoring station stood untouched, its screens dark but intact. [347] She powered it on with her portable generator and watched as it flickered to life, displaying data from fifteen years ago—the last readings before evacuation. [372]

The invisible things her sister had tracked were singing through the cables still. [385] Patterns that suggested consciousness, or something like it. [394] Communications not meant for human understanding, passing through infrastructure humans had built. [407] The researchers had realized too late that they weren't just observing—they were being observed back. [423]

Maya understood why they'd sealed the records, abandoned the facility. [433] Fear of what lived in the deep, using humanity's own neural pathways against them. [447] But in erasing the research, they'd erased the researchers too. [458] Her sister's name appeared nowhere in official records, as if she'd never existed. [472]

That was why Maya returned, tide after tide, descending into spaces that made her throat close and her vision narrow. [493] To stand by the unremembered. [499] To witness. [501]

She downloaded the data, every fragmented file, and added her own notes beside her sister's annotations in the codex. [520] The gold flecks seemed to pulse in her headlamp's beam—not decorative at all, but conductive, she realized. [538] Trace metals that responded to the electromagnetic fields, creating a physical map of invisible currents. [553]

Water began seeping under the door. [559] The tide was returning early. [565]

Maya sealed her pack and moved toward the exit, through rising water that marked another phase transition. [582] The facility would submerge again, return to its forgotten state beneath the waves. [596] But she carried proof of what had been learned here, what her sister had discovered. [611]

She emerged as the sea crashed back over the entrance, the hush that followed profound and absolute. [628] In her hands, the codex glowed faintly, gold illuminating the margins where invisible things had left their mark. [646] Tomorrow she would return again, gathering piece by piece what had been deliberately unmade. [661] Some acts of remembering required descent into the very spaces that terrified you most. [675] Some loyalties demanded you track what others refused to see. [686] Between the tides, between the states of being, Maya would keep returning until every forgotten name was spoken again. [706]
