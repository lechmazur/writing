Mara's repair shop occupied the eastern corner of the old rail depot, where fog rolled in thick from the harbor and settled between rusted tracks like a breathing thing. [31] The dawn light filtered weakly through the mist, turning everything soft and indistinct, but Mara had not relied on ordinary sight for seven years. [58] Her fingers moved across the workbench with practiced certainty, finding the artificial hummingbird drone her last customer had left—its iridescent wings cracked, motor whirring with an irregular stutter. [87]

She filled the shallow glass basin beside her bench with water from the copper pitcher, then positioned the drone above it at a precise angle. [113] Through the depot's high windows, the pale morning sun struck the water's surface, and Mara leaned close, feeling the warmth on her face while her fingertips rested on the basin's rim. [144] The vibrations in the water told her stories that eyes could not. [156]

From the harbor beyond, she heard the deep groan of machinery—the anchor lifting on the Mercantile, the new freight vessel everyone had been discussing for months. [179] Its maiden voyage, she knew, was scheduled for this very hour. [190] The sound seemed to pulse through the depot's bones, through her bench, through the water in her basin. [207]

Mara adjusted the drone's position, rotating it slightly. [215] Light refracted through the water features she'd carefully created—ripples, depths, surfaces—breaking into patterns she had learned to read through sensation and sound. [237] The distortions told her where the metal had fractured, where the delicate circuitry had loosened, where the synthetic feathers had torn. [257] She decoded each variation in temperature, each shift in the water's trembling surface, transforming feedback into direction. [274]

Her tools were arranged exactly where memory insisted they would be. [285] She selected a microwelder without hesitation, her heartfelt dedication to the craft evident in how she handled even this broken, common thing as though it were precious. [311] Every device that came through her shop mattered because someone needed it, relied on it, perhaps even loved it. [330]

The patch required steadiness. [334] Mara brought the welder to the wing's edge, feeling the heat echo back from the metal, using the thermal feedback to guide her hand. [357] She worked in silence except for the distant sounds of the harbor—the Mercantile's engines building power, workers calling to one another, the splash of water against the dock. [384]

When she returned the drone to the basin, the refraction patterns had changed. [397] The light bent differently now, passing through the water with a smoothness that indicated structural integrity. [412] She rotated the drone again, checking from multiple angles, interpreting the subtle shifts in how warmth played across her face and how vibrations moved through the water. [437]

The motor still stuttered. [441] This required different attention. [445] Mara lifted the drone and opened its thorax panel by touch, finding the minute screws she had known would be there. [466] Inside, components smaller than rice grains waited for her interpretation. [477] She dripped a single drop of water onto the motor housing and listened—truly listened—to how it responded, how the liquid moved across surfaces and revealed the geography of damage through sound alone. [510]

A fragment of debris, she understood. [516] Microscopic, but disruptive. [519] She selected a brush finer than an eyelash and swept it through the mechanism's interior with a gesture that seemed more like prayer than repair. [543]

The Mercantile's horn sounded, resonant and final. [550] Through the depot windows, Mara sensed the change in light as the great ship moved, blocking and then revealing the sun. [570] She imagined it sliding away from the dock, its anchor secure in its housing, beginning its journey to wherever freight ships go when they leave familiar harbors. [596]

She reassembled the hummingbird and held it in her palm. [606] The motor hummed now with perfect consistency, a sound like contentment. [617] Mara smiled, feeling that magnetic calm she always felt when broken things became whole again. [632] She set the drone on its charging station and returned to her basin, pouring fresh water, preparing for whatever came next. [652]

Outside, the mist held everything gently. [658] The world moved at its own pace, and Mara moved within it, translating what others could not see into what she alone understood. [680] Her shop in the rail depot was a place where damage transformed into direction, where the heartfelt work of an artisan made small miracles commonplace. [704]

The day would bring more broken things, and she would be ready. [716]
