The Thunder-echo range swallowed sound before returning it, transformed. [9] Mira had forgotten this—how silence here accumulated weight, pressing down like snowpack before the break. [23] Avalanchingly quiet, her mentor had called it, back when she still had a mentor, back when she still had a ward to protect. [48]

She moved through the canyon with the leather case strapped across her chest, its familiar weight both comfort and accusation. [67] Three months since the guardianship ended, since she'd watched the threshold collapse and the world she'd sworn to protect fold into inaccessible distance. [89] Three months of replaying each decision, searching for the hairline fracture that had widened into catastrophe. [105]

The first driftwood marker appeared where the canyon split, silvered wood she'd placed two days prior, pointing left toward the narrower passage. [127] She'd spent a week arranging these markers, mapping the places where the range's strange acoustics created pockets of absolute silence—the thin places, where barriers between worlds grew gossamer. [154] If she couldn't restore what she'd lost, she could at least understand how she'd lost it. [170] Failure, hoarded and examined, might yield insights that success had never offered. [182]

The markers led her deeper, past formations that sang with wind and others that deadened every whisper. [199] She'd tested each location with stones dropped into darkness, listening for which echoes came back changed, carrying harmonics from elsewhere. [219] The driftwood had traveled far to reach these mountains—ocean-smoothed pieces she'd gathered from the distant coast, now repurposed as signposts for her investigation. [241]

At the canyon's heart, where three walls formed a natural amphitheater, she found her final marker. [257] Here, the silence had texture, almost tangible. [264] Sound didn't echo—it dissipated, pulled elsewhere. [271] This was as close as she could get to the threshold's memory. [283]

Mira uncased the gilded reed flute with reverent care. [292] The instrument had belonged to the lost world, one of few artifacts that existed simultaneously in multiple realms. [310] Its golden inlay caught the thin canyon light, reeds harvested from a riverbank that touched three realities at once. [329] She'd played it during her guardianship, its notes helping maintain the threshold's integrity. [342] She hadn't touched it since the collapse, afraid of what its silence might confirm. [356]

Now she brought it to her lips and blew softly. [366] The first note emerged hesitant, barely more than breath, but the canyon seized it. [380] Instead of echoing, the sound stretched, attenuating into something else—a bridge rather than a reflection. [395] She played the sequence she'd practiced daily for seven years, the melody that should have held the threshold stable. [414]

The air before her rippled. [419] Not opening, not the full weaving between worlds she'd once facilitated, but a shimmer, a suggestion of permeability. [438] Through it, dim and distorted, she glimpsed the world she'd failed to keep connected—still existing, still intact, just unreachable. [458]

Relief crashed through her, then understanding. [464] The threshold hadn't collapsed because of her playing or her vigilance. [475] She saw it now in how the shimmer wavered: the gilded flute itself was fading, its dual-world nature eroding. [494] The reeds that touched three realities had been dying, slowly losing their connection to the realms they bridged. [513] Nothing she'd done could have prevented it. [520] The failure belonged to time itself, to the natural entropy of liminal things. [534]

She played on, memorizing this translucent glimpse. [541] The world beyond showed her its inhabitants, still thriving, adapted to isolation. [553] They didn't need her guardianship to survive, only to visit. [563] The understanding settled into her bones with the canyon's peculiar quiet. [574]

When the flute's final note faded and the shimmer vanished, Mira lowered the instrument. [588] She would return tomorrow, and the day after, harvesting these moments of near-connection until the flute gave out entirely. [607] Not to restore what was lost, but to document it, to learn the architecture of endings. [624] The driftwood markers would guide others here eventually, when she was ready to share what the Thunder-echo range had taught her about graceful collapse. [649]

She cased the flute and touched the canyon wall, feeling how silence pooled in the stone. [666] Some things ended not in catastrophe but in slow dimming, and there was wisdom in witnessing that passage without looking away. [688]
