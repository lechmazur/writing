The formaldehyde smell no longer bothered Mira as she arranged her father's tools in the funeral home prep room where she now worked nights. [25] She had spent her childhood watching Marcus Chen—master forger, eloquent liar, brilliant con artist—manipulate truth like clay, yet he'd raised her to value honesty above all else. [50] "Never become me," he'd whispered before his arrest, pressing his vintage ink pot into her hands. [66] The antique vessel, still staining her fingers indigo, had been his instrument of deception, yet she kept it on her workstation like a talisman against inherited sin. [93]

Tonight's case was unusual: a woman seeking political asylum had died hours before her hearing, and her brother had requested Mira prepare the body for viewing. [118] Pavel sat in the corner now, hunched and desperate, explaining through tears how Elena had survived three assassination attempts in Kyrgyzstan, had documented governmental corruption, had finally breached the fortress of bureaucracy only to die of an aneurysm. [155]

"Her testimony documents are missing," Pavel said. [162] "Without them, I have no case for my own asylum." [173] He stared at Mira with the same desperate calculation she'd seen in her father's marks—people seeking salvation through transactions they couldn't afford. [196]

Mira focused on Elena's peaceful face, the deathly vitality that bodies sometimes held in preparation, as if mortality had simply paused rather than concluded. [218] She understood Pavel's equation: one dead sister's evidence equals one living brother's freedom. [232] The mathematics of a fair trade, except nothing about death dealt in fairness. [246]

"I can't help you forge documents," Mira said quietly, thinking of her father's cell. [260]

"No." [261] Pavel shook his head. [265] "I need you to wait with me." [273] He explained that Elena had swallowed a microSD card before crossing the final border, fearing confiscation. [290] The medical examiner, rushed and careless, had missed it. [300] "It will pass through as her body... processes," Pavel whispered. [311] "But I cannot stay here alone with her." [320] Cultural prohibitions, he explained. [324] Religious law. [326] He needed a witness, a professional, someone to wait actively through the night while biology completed what bureaucracy had interrupted. [347]

Mira looked at her father's ink pot, remembering his rigid thinking: the world contained only marks and operators, fools and wolves. [368] But that philosophy had liquefied under prison's harsh chemistry, hadn't it? [379] His letters spoke differently now—about the spaces between right and wrong, about how survival sometimes required uncomfortable mathematics. [398]

She nodded. [400] "I'll stay." [403]

They waited together through the long hours, Pavel sharing stories of Elena's journalism, her courage, the seventeen people whose testimonies she'd gathered. [425] Mira prepared other bodies, maintained the equipment, while Pavel prayed in Russian and Kyrgyz, songs that sounded like wind through mountain passes. [448]

At 4 AM, during the routine examination she'd explained was necessary, Mira found it—a tiny capsule in the drainage, waterproof and intact. [469] She rinsed it carefully, placed it in Pavel's shaking hands. [480]

"Is this legal?" [483] he asked, suddenly afraid. [487]

"Yes," Mira said, meaning it. [492] "This belongs to your family. [497] I'm simply returning property found during standard preparation procedures." [506] She documented everything properly, made Pavel sign the logbook. [516] Her father would have forged the signatures, backdated the entries, created elaborate fiction. [529] Mira just wrote the truth: one brother reclaiming his sister's final testimony. [541]

As dawn light filtered through the prep room's high windows, Pavel clutched the drive against his chest. [558] "How do I repay this?" [564] he asked, seeking that equation again. [570]

Mira thought of her father's ink pot, of Elena's body on the table still radiating that strange vitality, of how waiting actively was itself a kind of action. [598] She thought of fair trades and impossible mathematics, of the spaces where honesty and necessity finally converged. [616]

"Just tell her stories," Mira said. [622] "That's the only mathematics that matters." [629]

Pavel nodded, understanding. [632] He left as the morning shift arrived, carrying his sister's words toward whatever tribunal would judge them both worthy or wanting. [653] Mira cleaned her workspace, returned the vintage ink pot to its shelf, and prepared for the next body, the next family, the next impossible equation that only truth could solve. [685]

Outside, she heard the city waking—indifferent, enormous, full of people seeking asylum in a thousand different forms. [703]
