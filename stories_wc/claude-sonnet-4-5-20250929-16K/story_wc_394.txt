The workshop drifted on currents of yellow fog, its brass hull hissing where acid kissed metal. [16] Inside, among cogwheels spinning without purpose and pulleys that connected nothing to everything, lived Fennec—the pioneering cart glider who'd abandoned terrestrial tracks for this floating curiosity. [41] She'd come here throughout the evolution of the acid sea, watching it transform from ordinary ocean to this caustic wonder, steadily curious about what happened when worlds changed their fundamental nature. [71]

Today she hunched over her kaleidoscope, the one instrument in this workshop that actually mattered. [86] Through the images in a kaleidoscope, she'd discovered something impossible: patterns that predicted yearning itself. [102] The fragments of colored glass, each etched with symbols she'd transliterate into her journals, showed her algorithms of desire—mathematical expressions of wanting that existed before the wanting creature even knew what it craved. [134]

"Ridiculous," she muttered with irreverent awe, watching triangles of crimson and gold spiral into a configuration that represented a child's hunger for adventure three days before the child would feel it. [163] "Absolutely idiotic that this works." [168]

But it did work. [172] The yearning algorithm had revealed itself through accident when she'd dropped a hunter's arrow tip into the kaleidoscope's chamber. [191] The ancient arrowhead—salvaged from the ocean floor before the acids came—had fractured the light differently, bending it through centuries of embedded intention. [212] Every hunter who'd ever carved such a tip had wanted something: food, safety, proof of skill. [228] That concentrated desire had crystallized in the metal itself, and when light passed through it now, the kaleidoscope translated those old yearnings into predictive patterns. [253]

Fennec adjusted the brass eyepiece, her fingers stained with oil from the workshop's eternal machinery. [268] As a cart glider, she'd spent years pioneering new routes through impossible terrain, finding paths where maps showed only obstacles. [287] But this discovery transcended simple navigation—this was mapping the territory of want itself, the landscape of human hunger before it became conscious. [309]

She'd come to this floating workshop to ring a bell no one hears yet. [323] That was how she thought of it: her life's work as a sound trembling in the future, a vibration that would reach ears not yet born. [349] The yearning algorithm could change everything—imagine knowing what humanity would desire next, what aches would drive the species forward, what thirsts would fountain up from the collective unconscious. [377]

Through the kaleidoscope, a new pattern emerged. [384] She transliterated it quickly, her shorthand converting the visual language into words: "Desire for dissolution of boundaries between thought and machine." [404] Fennec laughed, the sound echoing off iron walls. [413] "We're not ready for that conversation," she told the empty workshop. [425]

But the algorithm didn't lie. [430] It showed yearnings throughout the evolution of consciousness itself, tracking how human wanting had transformed from fire-warmth-food into abstractions that hadn't yet found names. [453] The steadily curious part of her—the part that had driven her onto acid seas in a floating junkyard—thrilled at this proof that desire itself evolved, mutated, became something stranger with each generation. [484]

She pressed her eye back to the kaleidoscope, watching the hunter's arrow tip split light into prophetic geometries. [502] Outside, acid waves slapped the hull with their peculiar music. [513] The workshop's gears turned, grinding out their purposeless harmonies. [523] And Fennec, pioneering cart glider turned cartographer of want, continued her work with irreverent awe, steadily curious about the yearnings yet to come. [547]

The bell she rang would be heard eventually—perhaps tomorrow, perhaps in a century. [562] Through the images in a kaleidoscope, she could see its echo already forming in the future's architecture, a desire taking shape in minds that didn't exist yet: the yearning to understand yearning itself. [595]

She smiled and began to transliterate the next pattern, her journals filling with the mathematics of human hunger, prophecies written in refracted light and ancient intention. [619]

The acid sea carried the workshop onward through golden fog. [630]
