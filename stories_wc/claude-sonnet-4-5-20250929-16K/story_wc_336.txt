The orchard pruner arrived at dawn, when mist still clung to the verdant parapet beside the waterfall. [17] Her name was Esme, and she carried shears that had belonged to her grandmother, their handles worn smooth by three generations of careful hands. [39] The waterfall's constant whisper created what she called the radiant hush—that particular quality of sound that wasn't quite silence but invited contemplation nonetheless. [62]

She had come to this threshold place for a specific purpose, one that few would understand. [78] In her pocket rested an heirloom seed, the last of its kind, from an apple tree that bloomed in colors no longer seen in the waking world. [106] The tree had died the previous winter, but Esme, insatiably creative in her methods, refused to accept that its wonder should vanish entirely. [128]

The parapet existed in that strange geography where reality thinned, where the mist from the waterfall sometimes revealed glimpses of other gardens, other orchards. [151] Esme had discovered it years ago while pruning the estate's oldest trees, noticing how certain branches seemed to reach toward spaces that shouldn't exist. [174] She had learned, through patient observation, the art of weaving between worlds—not with grand magic, but with the subtle craft of a gardener who understood that roots and branches cared nothing for the boundaries humans drew. [211]

Now, upon the hush of budding hope that marked early spring, she prepared her work. [226] The other groundskeepers thought her eccentric, the way she would stand motionless for hours, watching how light fell through leaves, how wind moved through branches. [250] They didn't understand she was learning to see the essence of things—not just their physical forms, but the particular quality that made an ancient oak feel like wisdom, or made cherry blossoms carry the weight of fleeting beauty. [287]

Esme knelt on the wet stone of the parapet and placed the seed before her. [303] Through the waterfall's spray, she could see them now—the shimmer of other gardens, places where color operated by different laws, where trees grew in spirals and bore fruit that sang. [332] These were the worlds she had been studying, preparing to understand. [344]

She closed her eyes and began the work of capturing essence. [356] With her pruner's knowledge, she had learned that a tree was more than wood and sap—it was the sum of seasons, the memory of sunlight, the particular way its flowers had made people stop and stare, children point, poets fumble for words. [395] The heirloom seed contained genetic memory, yes, but Esme sought something deeper. [408]

Her consciousness stretched thin, weaving between the world of stone and water where her body knelt, and those other gardens visible through the mist. [431] In one realm, she found a color that matched her memory of the lost tree's blossoms—a luminous coral-gold that seemed to hold dawn itself. [456] In another, she discovered the exact quality of wonder the tree had inspired, that catch of breath when something impossibly beautiful appeared in ordinary day. [481]

Slowly, with the patience of someone who had spent decades learning when to cut and when to let grow, Esme wove these essences together. [504] She drew them through the thin places, braiding them around the seed's genetic promise like grafting invisible branches onto a living root. [525]

The work took hours. [529] The sun rose higher, burning off the mist, but the waterfall's radiant hush remained constant, holding the space steady. [548] When Esme finally opened her eyes, her hands were cramped, her knees aching from the wet stone. [565]

The seed looked unchanged, but she could feel the difference—it now carried not just the genetic blueprint of the lost tree, but the preserved essence of what it had meant, the wonder it had inspired. [598]

She would plant it in soil that touched multiple worlds, in a corner of the estate where reality grew particularly thin. [619] Perhaps it would grow in only one world, perhaps in many. [631] But either way, she had offered succor to something dying, had refused to let wonder fade completely from any realm. [651]

Esme stood, joints protesting, and tucked the seed safely away. [662] The waterfall continued its eternal song, and through its mist, she could still see those other gardens waiting. [680] There were other seeds to save, other essences to preserve, other colors of wonder that needed a wise hand to keep them alive in the spaces between worlds. [708]

She picked up her grandmother's shears and smiled. [717] The work, as always, continued. [722]
