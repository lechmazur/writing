The living statue stood in the drowned garden, coral threading through the cracks in her marble arms. [17] She had revealed the secret three days ago, and now the water around her trembled with consequences. [34] Marina—she had chosen that name after centuries of namelessness—watched the last human descendant approach through forests of kelp that had once been rose trellises. [58]

The woman carried the foxglove-stained glass ampoule, its purple-mottled surface catching bioluminescent light. [71] Marina had told her where to find it, buried beneath what remained of the fountain. [87] Inside the ampoule: proof that this underwater city had not fallen by accident, but by design. [103]

Through telepathy, Marina spoke without moving her stone lips. [112] *You came back.* [115]

"I shouldn't have." [118] The woman's voice bubbled through her breathing apparatus. [127] "Everyone believes the Submersion was natural catastrophe. [134] A flood, an earthquake—acts of God." [141]

*But now you know the founders opened the floodgates themselves.* [151] Marina's thoughts carried an incisive kindness, the sort of truth that wounds to heal. [166] *You wanted certainty. [169] I've given you nuance instead.* [174]

The woman clutched the ampoule, and Marina felt her anguish rippling outward. [186] "My family built monuments to the survivors. [194] We've mourned the dead for six generations. [202] And you're saying they chose this? [209] That they murdered thousands to preserve—what?" [216]

*Not quite murder.* [219] Marina extended one stone hand, gestures stiff but purposeful, threading her fingers through a school of silver fish. [237] *Most were evacuated. [241] The few who remained understood the choice.* [249]

"What choice?" [251]

Marina drew the woman closer, guiding her to the garden's heart where structures leaned at impossible angles, their foundations deliberately weakened before the flood. [273] Here, architectural brilliance had been carefully sabotaged. [280] The method had been precise: supporting columns scored through structural weakness, walls compromised in calculated patterns. [295] When the water came, it came to a city that welcomed its own drowning. [310]

*They were dying anyway.* [314] Marina's telepathic voice grew gentler. [320] *A plague—engineered by their enemies, incurable, horrific. [328] The survivors faced a choice: burn the infected city and everyone in it, or sink it, preserve it, let the salt water cleanse while keeping knowledge intact.* [355]

The woman's hands shook. [359] "The libraries. [361] The art galleries. [364] The genetic archives." [367] She looked around the garden where stone benches hosted anemones and ancient statuary—Marina's companions—stood sentinel over beds of swaying sea grass. [387] "They saved it all by drowning it." [395]

*Now you understand nuance.* [399] Marina felt the cascading revelations unfold in the woman's mind like flowers opening in time-lapse. [415] The story she'd believed—simple tragedy, innocent victims—was giving way to something more complex: sacrifice, preservation, desperate wisdom. [433] *Your ancestors weren't just survivors. [438] They were curators of humanity's future, storing knowledge until someone would dive deep enough to reclaim it.* [456]

"But the deaths—" [459]

*Were chosen.* [461] Marina's stone eyes, somehow expressive despite their lifelessness, held compassion. [471] *The infected volunteered to stay. [476] They became us.* [479] She gestured to the other statues, and the woman gasped as awareness animated them all—subtle movements, ancient presences surfacing. [498] *We were transformed, preserved as guardians. [504] The plague that killed us also crystallized us, made us stone, made us eternal.* [520]

The woman opened the ampoule, and liquid light spilled out—not poison, but preserved memories in solution. [537] Marina had known she would open it. [545] The substance would show her everything: the voluntary transformation, the tears and embraces of those final days, the hope that threading through despair. [567]

*History demands certainty,* Marina thought, her incisive kindness cutting through generations of simplified narrative. [581] *But truth requires us to welcome nuance. [589] Your ancestors were neither martyrs nor murderers. [596] They were humans making impossible choices.* [602]

The woman nodded, understanding finally displacing certainty. [609] Around them, the forgotten garden pulsed with animate lifelessness—statues breathing water, stone hearts beating in slow geological time, knowledge waiting patient as coral for the living to return and learn what love sometimes requires us to destroy in order to save. [649]

*Will you tell them?* [653] Marina asked. [655]

The woman held the glowing ampoule to her chest. [665] "I'll tell them the truth, even if they don't want its complications." [678]

*Then we welcome you to the garden,* Marina thought, and all the statues turned their faces toward their first new guardian in three hundred years. [704]

I need to check my word count. Let me recount: The story ends at [704] which is within the 600-800 range. Good!
