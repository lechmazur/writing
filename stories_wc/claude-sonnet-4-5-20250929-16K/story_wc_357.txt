The orchard planet of Verdansk turned inside-out every twenty-eight hours, and Kael had learned to fly through the inversion. [19]

She gripped the controls of her pollination skiff as the first tremors rippled through the air, signaling the approach of the Turning. [40] Around her vessel, the ancient rock arches that floated between the orchards began their slow rotation, preparing for gravity's reversal. [61] In one hour, up would become down, and only pilots who understood the invisible currents could survive. [78]

Kael wasn't just any pilot—she was intrepid enough to fly during the Turning itself, navigating by water flow as the planet's irrigation systems revealed their true nature. [106] The water always knew which way to fall, even when gravity forgot. [119]

Today, she had a purpose beyond pollination. [126] For three generations, her family's orchards had withered while others thrived, and she needed to discover why some trees possessed resilience while hers did not. [151] The elders spoke of a gathering of echoes deep in the Arch Maze, where the planet's memory pooled in acoustic eddies. [173] If any place held answers, it would be there. [183]

The Turning began. [186]

Her stomach lurched as gravity released its hold. [194] The skiff's engines whined, adjusting thrust as Kael's body lifted against the restraints. [208] All around her, the massive stone arches completed their rotation, now pointing at what had been the sky. [226] Fruit that had hung downward on branches now strained upward, and water from the irrigation canals rose in shimmering columns. [246]

Kael followed the water. [250]

The ascending streams formed pathways through the Arch Maze, revealing routes invisible during normal gravity. [265] She threaded her skiff between floating boulders and through narrow gaps in the ancient stone formations. [281] Her hands moved with practiced precision, reading the water's flow like script. [293]

Deep in the maze's heart, she found it: a chamber where seven arches converged in impossible geometry. [310] Here, the water didn't rise or fall but hung suspended, forming a sphere. [324] And within that sphere, sound itself seemed to pool and eddy—the gathering of echoes. [340]

Kael anchored her skiff to a smaller arch and floated free, pulling herself toward the water sphere. [357] As she approached, she heard voices—not speaking now, but speaking then. [370] Layered conversations from decades past, trapped in acoustic loops by the planet's unique geology. [384]

One voice rose above the others, clear and urgent. [394] Her grandmother's voice. [397]

"The old treaty," the echo said. [404] "We buried it beneath the First Orchard, marked with a broken arrow tip. [418] The compact that lets certain families accelerate plant growth—they renewed it without us." [433]

Kael's breath caught. [436] She'd heard stories of the First Orchard, abandoned after a blight, located three kilometers north of her family's land. [455]

The gravity inversion was halfway complete. [461] She had thirty minutes. [465]

She flew hard, following her grandmother's echo like a beacon. [476] The water streams grew chaotic as gravity began its return, but Kael's skill held true. [492] She found the First Orchard just as objects began falling again—gently at first, then with increasing urgency. [510]

The broken arrow tip jutted from the soil beneath a skeletal tree, exactly where the echo had promised. [528] Kael dropped from her skiff and dug with her hands, racing the final moments of the Turning. [547]

Her fingers struck metal—a canister sealed with the old families' marks. [560] Inside, a living root system, genetically modified to accelerate plant growth in exchange for regular renewal ceremonies. [578] Her family's name was crossed out in the ledger, excluded three generations ago in a dispute her grandmother had tried to resolve. [600]

The Turning completed with a thunderous silence—that peculiar whirling quiet when gravity reasserted itself and everything settled into stillness. [620] Fruit fell like rain around her. [626]

Kael held the canister against her chest. [634] She'd discovered not just the source of others' resilience, but the theft of her own. [650] The gathering of echoes had kept the truth alive, waiting for someone intrepid enough to listen. [667]

She fired her engines, heading home. [673] The water flowed downward again, but Kael no longer needed it to show her the way. [690] She knew exactly where she was going—to the council, to demand her family's restoration, armed with proof that resilience wasn't given freely. [712]

It was stolen, then forgotten. [717]

But echoes remember everything. [721]
