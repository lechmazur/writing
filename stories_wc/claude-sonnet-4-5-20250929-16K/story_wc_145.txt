The falcon circled twice before landing, ice crystals falling from its wings onto the rust-stained windowsill. [16] Mara watched it through the frosted glass of the outpost, her breath misting against the pane. [31] "Took your time," she said, though the bird had made remarkable speed across the frozen lake. [47]

She was an atlas editor by trade, stationed at this deteriorating outpost for three months now, chasing the question that had consumed her professional life: where did the rivers truly begin? [75] Not the tributaries marked on standard maps, but the actual source, the place where water first decided to become a river. [96]

The falcon bore a small canister on its leg. [105] Inside, a strip of paper covered in symbols she didn't recognize—not unusual, given the remote informants her predecessor had cultivated. [125] Mara retrieved the polyglot's phrasebook from her desk, its pages swollen with moisture and age. [140] The book fell open naturally to a dog-eared section, Linguistic Markers of the Northern Watersheds. [154] Someone had used this page repeatedly. [160]

She lit the oil lamp, though afternoon light still filtered through the dirty windows. [173] The warmth drew condensation across the glass in strange patterns, like rivers themselves, branching and merging. [188] Mara held up the coded message, comparing it to the phrasebook's marginalia. [200] Her predecessor had been subtly confident in his annotations, never explaining too much, trusting future readers to make connections. [218]

"Herald tribes," she read aloud, translating the first symbol cluster. [228] Groups who announced the seasons, who watched for the thaw. [238] The next symbols were coordinates, but they pointed to the center of the frozen lake, impossible. [254] Unless. [256]

Mara pressed her fingers to the condensation on the window, tracing the water's path as it ran downward. [273] The droplets didn't fall randomly—they followed microscopic imperfections in the glass, always taking the same routes. [289] She looked at the frozen lake outside, its white expanse broken by darker patches where currents moved beneath the ice. [309]

The pattern matched. [312]

She cross-referenced the coordinates with her own charts, hands steady despite her racing thoughts. [326] Every major river system she'd been mapping—seventeen in total—their earliest tributaries all pointed back to this lake. [344] Not to various springs or mountain snowmelt, but here. [353] A singular convergence point, working in reverse. [361]

"You clever bastard," she muttered, thinking of her predecessor who'd disappeared last winter. [374] He hadn't gotten lost—he'd gotten close. [381]

The worrying tranquility of this place suddenly made sense. [390] The outpost was positioned exactly where one might watch for something emerging. [402] The silence wasn't peaceful; it was expectant. [409]

Mara returned to the window, studying the condensation patterns more carefully. [420] Where the droplets converged near the bottom corner, the metal frame had corroded in a peculiar way, eaten by minerals in the water. [443] She scraped at it with her fingernail, collecting rust-red residue. [454] The same color stained the rocks at certain points along the lake's shore. [468]

The phrasebook's dog-eared page held one more notation she'd missed, written in her predecessor's hand: "They don't begin. [486] They return." [489]

Understanding crystallized like ice forming on glass. [496] The rivers didn't start from this lake—they ended here, somehow, in ways that defied conventional hydrology. [513] Water flowing backwards through deep time or geography she couldn't yet map. [526] The singular convergence wasn't spatial but temporal, cyclical. [535]

She needed to herald this discovery, but to whom? [545] The academic journals would dismiss it without proof she couldn't provide from this rusted outpost. [560] The falcon watched her with its bright, ancient eyes. [570]

Mara pulled out fresh paper and began sketching, documenting the condensation patterns, the coordinates, the phrasebook translations. [586] Her predecessor had been right to be subtly confident—this truth would reveal itself to anyone patient enough to watch water find its path. [609]

Outside, the frozen lake exhaled mist as temperatures dropped. [619] Somewhere beneath that ice, all rivers were remembering where they'd been born, or where they would return. [636]

The distinction, Mara realized, might not matter. [644]

She fed the falcon and watched it settle in for the night, its job complete. [659] Tomorrow she would venture onto the ice itself, following condensation's wisdom to find what lay beneath. [676]

Tonight, she sat in worrying tranquility, understanding that some questions answer themselves if you learn to read the language of water on glass. [698]
