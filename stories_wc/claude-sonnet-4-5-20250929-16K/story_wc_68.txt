The new historians called it the Great Forgetting, which Marcellus found laughably ironic since they were the ones doing the forgetting. [20] He sat in what had been a storm drain before the waters rose, now a cylindrical chamber in the sunken district where old pipes formed a philosopher's cell. [47] The plague had ended three years ago, and the survivors had decided the past needed revision. [63]

Marcellus disagreed, but calmly, methodically, the way one might explain basic arithmetic to a stubborn child. [78] He held the chronometer cog between thumb and forefinger, feeling its brass teeth catch the dim light filtering through green water overhead. [99] Seafarers had once used such mechanisms to know their place in the world, calculating longitude through precision gearing and celestial observation. [119] Now the Council taught that the ancients had been primitives, stumbling through darkness until the plague purified humanity into enlightenment. [138]

"Primitives who measured time in microseconds," Marcellus muttered, setting the cog on his makeshift desk. [152] He'd found it while excavating through sedimentary layers of the submerged plaza, each stratum revealing a different era's refuse and treasures. [172] The cog came from the merchant quarter's lowest level, pre-flooding, alongside nautical charts that proved sophisticated mathematical astronomy. [189] Evidence that contradicted the Council's narrative. [195]

This was why he agonized, not from doubt but from the weight of what preservation meant. [211] To keep the ancient methods alive was to mark himself as rationally rebellious—someone who didn't reject authority through emotion but through demonstrable fact. [232] The Council couldn't execute him for studying sewer ruins, but they could make him irrelevant, and irrelevance was a philosopher's death. [252]

He descended deeper into the sunken city, pulling himself through collapsed archways where fish now nested in judge's chambers and coral grew on subway tiles. [274] Each layer told a competing story: the Council claimed the ancients had caused the plague through moral corruption, but the hospital records Marcellus had recovered showed a natural pathogen, tracked scientifically, fought methodically. [303] The pre-flood society had nearly defeated it before infrastructure collapsed. [313] That wasn't primitive ignorance. [317] That was tragedy. [320]

In the lowest accessible chamber, Marcellus had established his archive. [330] Waterproof cases held salvaged textbooks on navigation, engineering, astronomy—disciplines the Council now taught as "intuitive arts" rather than mathematical sciences. [349] They preferred mysticism over measurement, claiming humanity's survival proved divine selection rather than epidemiological statistics. [363] Competing narratives, battling for supremacy in the post-plague world. [372]

Marcellus placed the chronometer cog with others he'd collected, seventeen brass teeth that once worked in concert to translate celestial mechanics into earthly position. [395] Ancient methods weren't just techniques; they were frameworks for understanding reality through observation rather than decree. [410] The Council feared such frameworks because they enabled questioning. [419]

A shadow passed overhead—patrol boats checking the ruins for salvagers. [430] Marcellus remained still, his abrasive calm serving him well. [439] Let them look. [442] His sewer-philosopher's cell appeared empty of value to those who'd forgotten what value meant. [456] He'd been called worse than sewer rat; the Council's approved philosophers worked in marble halls, composing treatises on humanity's spiritual awakening through suffering. [478] They wrote beautifully about transcendence. [482]

Marcellus wrote technical documentation. [485]

When the patrol passed, he returned to his excavation notes, cross-referencing the chronometer's manufacture date with tidal charts and building records. [505] Through sedimentary layers, he was reconstructing not just what the old world knew, but how it knew—the epistemological methods that separated justified belief from comfortable fiction. [532] The chronometer proved they'd understood precision. [538] The hospital records proved they'd understood causation. [545] The infrastructure proved they'd understood engineering. [551]

Preservation wasn't about nostalgia. [554] It was about maintaining the toolkit for truth-seeking that the new narratives deliberately abandoned. [568]

Marcellus sealed his notes in a waterproof cylinder and wedged it into the pipe network's highest point, above the current water line. [590] Future excavators, perhaps decades hence, would find both the Council's mysticism and his evidence. [604] They could decide which narrative made more sense. [612]

He ascended toward dimmer light, surrounded by drowned streets and the abrasive calm of knowing he was right, even if no one listened yet. [635]

The chronometer cogs would wait, patient as mathematics, through whatever sedimentary layers time added next. [650]
