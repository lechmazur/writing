Maya pressed her palm against Iris's forehead, checking for fever again even though she knew it wouldn't help. [17] Her partner had been one of forty thousand who'd taken the telepathy pills before the recall, before the lawsuits, before the government admitted the neurochemical pathways they'd promised were actually fractally precise tangles that nobody understood. [54] Maya didn't believe in shortcuts to consciousness, never had, but that skepticism felt hollow now as she watched Iris drift through their light painting studio, fingers tracing patterns only she could see. [85]

"I can still feel them," Iris whispered, not for the first time. [97] "The pathways. They're still there, just... I can't access them anymore." [109]

Maya squeezed her hand, affection warring with frustration. [117] She'd warned Iris about the pills, about promises that sounded too clean, but love meant helping pick up pieces, not saying I told you so. [142]

The static shock happened on a Tuesday. [149] Maya was adjusting the LED array, setting up for a client's session, when the faulty wire met her damp fingers. [169] The jolt threw her backward into Iris, and in that crystalline instant, Maya felt it—a foreign presence brushing against her mind, fractals of sensation blooming and retracting like time-lapse flowers. [198]

Iris gasped. [200] "You felt that." [203]

Not a question. [206] Maya's hands trembled as she picked herself up from the floor. [218] For three seconds, maybe four, she'd experienced what Iris had lost: the humming awareness of another consciousness, mapped in somatic markers throughout her body. [241] A pressure behind her left eye meant curiosity. [250] Warmth in her solar plexus meant recognition. [257] The ghost-sense of those pathways lingered even now, fading like afterimages. [268]

"What if electricity can bridge it?" [274] Maya said, mind already racing. [280] "The pills created neural pathways. The recall happened because they were too complex, too fractally precise for conventional imaging. But what if we could map them differently?" [307]

She pulled out her grandmother's collection, stones and minerals accumulated over decades, until she found it: a muscovite geode sliver, paper-thin, naturally translucent. [329] Muscovite held piezoelectric properties—it generated voltage when stressed. [337]

"We devise something new," Maya said, holding the sliver up to the studio lights. [351] Rainbows scattered through its layers. [357] "Not telepathy. Something better. A map." [364]

For three weeks, they worked. [369] Maya would induce small static charges through the muscovite, holding it between their touching palms while Iris described the somatic markers she felt. [391] Maya photographed each session using long exposures, her light painting techniques capturing the movements of Iris's other hand as she traced the pathways in air. [415]

The images that emerged were extraordinary. [421] Fractally precise patterns repeated at every scale, branching like lightning or lungs or river deltas. [436] Each somatic marker corresponded to a specific movement pattern—curiosity spiraled clockwise, fear fractured into sharp angles, love bloomed in expanding circles. [457]

"It's not telepathy," Maya explained to the researcher who finally agreed to see them. [472] "It's better. It's a lexicon." [478]

Dr. Chen studied the photographs covering Maya's studio walls, hundreds of light paintings forming a comprehensive map. [495] "You've documented the pathways," she breathed. [502] "This is what we couldn't see in the imaging. They're not random. They're a language." [519]

The revelation didn't cure Iris—there was no cure. [528] But it illuminated hidden pathways for thousands of others trapped in the recall's aftermath. [542] Maya's light paintings became diagnostic tools, helping doctors understand which neural patterns were damaged, which could be rehabilitated. [560]

Standing in their studio on the one-year anniversary of the static shock, Maya watched Iris guide another recall survivor through the mapping process. [583] The hope in the room felt delicate as willowglass, ready to shatter but somehow holding. [598]

Iris caught her eye and smiled, and Maya felt that familiar warmth in her solar plexus. [615]

Recognition. [616] Love. [618] Not telepathy, but something the pills had never promised: a way to make visible what had always been invisible, to transform loss into understanding. [642]

Maya picked up her camera, adjusted the exposure time, and began to paint with light. [658]
