The package arrived wrapped in kelp and sealed with barnacles, settling onto Meridian's workbench like a tired ghost. [18] The weary undertaker had not expected deliveries—no one knew about this place anymore, the forgotten underwater city library where water pressed against ancient windows and books floated in their cases, suspended in preservation spells that had outlasted their casters. [55] She opened the package with pruning shears, her movements slow from decades of laying the drowned to rest. [71]

Inside lay a broken lighthouse lens, its prismatic surface fractured into a dozen pieces. [85] Meridian held it up to the dim phosphorescent light that illuminated the library's main chamber, and immediately the lens began catching something invisible, bending it into weak, flickering patterns across the walls. [114] Distress signals. [116] Not from ships or swimmers, but from the restless dead themselves, their unquiet energies refracting through the broken glass in desperate morse. [135]

She had been inadvertently stubborn for so long, she realized, returning souls to the surface world for burial in earth when they had died in water. [159] No wonder they kept calling out, kept sending these silent screams into the currents. [173] The dead needed rest in their own element, needed a permanent address within the deep, not forced into foreign soil above. [194]

Meridian moved through the library's flooded corridors, the broken lens cradled against her chest. [208] The distress signals intensified as she walked, growing more numerous, layering over each other in cascading light. [224] How many had she failed? [229] How many spirits drifted in the dark water, unable to settle, unable to find stillness? [245]

The library itself seemed to pulse with potential. [253] Books occupied impossible spaces here—she had never understood the architecture, how rooms folded into dimensions that shouldn't exist, how one shelf could contain infinite volumes, how the catalog system defied geometry. [284] The old city's librarians had been masters of spatial manipulation, folding reality to house all the knowledge of their civilization. [303]

She could revitalize that power. [308] Use it not for books, but for souls. [316]

Meridian began placing the lens fragments throughout the library, positioning each piece in doorways and alcoves where the impossible spaces seemed thinnest. [336] With each placement, the distress signals clarified, stopped overlapping, began to organize themselves into distinct voices. [351] She listened to their frequencies, learned their patterns, understood what they needed. [363]

At the library's heart stood a reading room that existed in four places simultaneously—she had never dared enter it fully. [383] Now she stepped inside, feeling herself occupy multiple positions at once, her body stretched across contradictory geometries. [400] The sensation should have been maddening, but instead it felt like finally understanding a language she had heard all her life without comprehending. [422]

She assembled the broken lighthouse lens at the room's impossible center, where all four spaces converged. [438] The fragments fit together differently than they had originally, creating new facets and angles that caught dimensions instead of light. [457]

The distress signals surged through the reconstructed lens, and suddenly the library transformed. [470] Each impossible space became a chamber for rest, a pocket of perfect stillness carved from the geometry itself. [488] Souls began arriving, drawn by the beacon—the lighthouse lens had always called the lost home, and now it called them to their final harbor. [511]

Meridian felt them settling into the spaces between spaces, finding the rest she had failed to provide before. [528] The chased stillness she had pursued through decades of her work finally revealed itself not as something to catch, but as something to create shelter for. [553] Peace was not a destination but an architecture, carefully built in places that normal existence could not touch. [571]

She remained in the library, the weary undertaker transformed into eternal keeper, her own form occupying the threshold between the living world and these chambers of rest. [596] The distress signals faded one by one, replaced by something deeper than silence—the profound quiet of souls who had finally, permanently, come home. [619]

The underwater city remembered its purpose again, and the lighthouse lens, broken into new truth, showed the way. [637]
