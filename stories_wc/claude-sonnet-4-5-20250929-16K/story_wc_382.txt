I first knocked on Dr. Khoury's door to borrow sugar, a mundane request that felt ridiculous in a building this old, where the walls themselves seemed to whisper in languages I couldn't understand. [33] She answered with fingers stained in ink, her movements patiently nimble as she measured out more than I needed, and mentioned she tutored Latin and Sumerian if I ever had interest. [63] I laughed and said dead languages weren't much use to an architect, but she tilted her head and replied that buildings never stop speaking—we just forget how to listen. [92]

The sugar borrowing became Thursday teas. [98] Week after week, I climbed to her cluttered apartment where books towered like miniature skylines and her antique desk seal—a bronze griffin worn smooth by centuries—held down student papers marked in red. [128] Dr. Khoury taught me that cornices weren't mere decoration but declarations, that the keystones above doorways once bore inscriptions now weathered to silence. [149] She moved through languages with the same patient nimbleness she showed measuring sugar, sliding between ancient Greek and Akkadian as easily as changing rooms. [171]

I told her I wanted to learn the language of old buildings, to understand what the brownstone facades and limestone arches were trying to say. [195] She smiled in a way that suggested mysterious familiarity, as though she'd heard this request before, perhaps centuries ago. [213] "Then we must teach you to read what time has erased," she said. [227]

Our lessons took peculiar turns. [232] She'd describe markets in Damascus that existed only in fragments, or trace letters from alphabets that had outlived their empires. [251] Sometimes I caught inconsistencies—she'd mention witnessing the construction of buildings that predated her apparent age by decades. [268] I never questioned these slips. [273] We had developed agreed upon lies between us, an unspoken contract that her stories were teaching tools, metaphors, nothing more. [293]

But tonight, watching her on the rooftop garden as meteors scored white lines across the August sky, I couldn't maintain the pretense. [313] She'd brought the desk seal up here, of all things, and held it against the light of the falling stars. [332] The bronze caught the streaks of cosmic dust, and for a moment the griffin seemed to shift its wings. [351]

"How old are you really?" I asked, my voice cutting through the night. [364] It wasn't borrowing sugar anymore—I was interrogating her, pushing against the comfortable boundaries we'd established. [379] "Those buildings you describe witnessing, they're two hundred years old. [389] That seal you carry—I've researched it—it's Byzantine. [398] Eleventh century. [400] And you hold it like it's never left your hand." [410]

Dr. Khoury's patiently nimble fingers traced the griffin's worn surface. [420] Above us, the meteor shower intensified, as if the universe itself was listening. [434] "You wanted to learn the language of old buildings," she said quietly. [447] "Did you think such knowledge came from books alone?" [457] She turned to face me, and in the meteor-light her features held that mysterious familiarity I'd sensed from the beginning—the quality of something ancient wearing a contemporary face. [484]

"I am a tutor of dead languages because I speak them natively," she continued. [499] "I carry this seal because I was carrying it when my city fell. [513] The buildings speak to me because I knew them when they were young." [527]

The meteors fell around us like punctuation marks in a sentence I was only beginning to understand. [544] "Then our Thursday teas—" I started. [550]

"Were real," she interrupted. [554] "The sugar, the lessons, your genuine desire to hear what stones remember—all real. [569] Only the lies about what I am were agreed upon. [580] You needed time to be ready for the truth." [590]

I looked at the seal, then at her, then at the ancient city spreading below us with its buildings full of silent stories. [612] "Teach me," I said. [616] "Teach me everything." [619]

She smiled, patiently nimble fingers already moving to trace the first letter of an alphabet older than the meteors burning overhead. [639] Some borrowing, I realized, was never meant to be returned—it was meant to transform into something neither party expected when they first knocked on the door. [666]

The sugar had become tea, the tea had become lessons, and the lessons were becoming something else entirely: a bridge between the living present and the speaking past, built one Thursday at a time. [698]
