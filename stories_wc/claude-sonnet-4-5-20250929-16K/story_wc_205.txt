The baroque asteroid hung like a frozen tear in the void, its gilt corridors and frescoed chambers empty for three centuries. [19] Matthias walked these halls alone, his reflection fragmenting in the ornate mirrors that lined every passage, each one draped now in black velvet. [42] He had learned to cover them before the temporal storms came—when time became visible two decades ago, the universe had split open in ways nobody anticipated. [70] The storms manifested as cascading auroras of past and future, and mirrors caught them, trapped them, created feedback loops that could shatter a mind. [94]

He had been a revolutionary once, leading the Chronist Uprising against those who hoarded the technology that made time perceptible. [113] Now he was merely a scholar sorting through ruins, his fervor cooled to something like wisdom, or perhaps just exhaustion. [132] The cause had won, then fractured, then dissolved into academic squabbles and tenure disputes. [146] What remained was this: him, the asteroid, and the question of who had lived here before. [163]

The crystal vase shard rested in his palm, no larger than a thumbnail, refracting the overhead luminescence into prismatic ghosts. [183] Dr. Keraine insisted it proved the asteroid's inhabitants were Terran colonists from the Third Expansion, pointing to the lead-crystal composition and baroque aesthetic as evidence. [208] But Matthias knew better, felt it in the way the shard held light—not reflected it, but remembered it. [227] When he held it during temporal storms, with all the mirrors carefully shrouded, he could see them: the original architects of this place, moving through their daily rituals in the visible stream of time. [259]

They had not been human at all. [266]

He had spent five years learning to devise new methods of temporal archaeology, techniques the academic establishment dismissed as poetry rather than science. [288] Perhaps they were right to call him poetically inclined—he wrote his observations in verse, finding that rhythm and metaphor captured the nuances of visible time better than sterile data logs. [316] "They built their halls like prayers," he had written, "each arabesque a hymn to moments / they knew would outlast their singing." [337]

His motivation had evolved from toppling governments to something stranger and more urgent: to reimagine an entire civilization that official histories had erased. [360] The academic dispute was really about this—whether the baroque asteroid represented human achievement or evidence of another intelligence entirely. [380] Keraine and her faction couldn't accept that humanity's grand narrative had gaps, that we had found and colonized places already made beautiful by others. [403]

Thunder rolled through the asteroid—not sound, but visible time churning past the walls. [417] Matthias checked each mirror, ensuring the coverings held secure. [427] Through the uncovered windows, he watched history and futurity spiral together in copper and gold streams. [443] The shard grew warm in his hand. [450]

He saw them again: tall figures with too many joints, moving with geometric grace through these same halls. [468] They had covered their mirrors too, he realized—not with velvet but with panels of carved stone that still stood in some chambers. [491] They had known about the temporal storms long before humanity made time visible. [505] Perhaps they had fled this place because of them, or perhaps they had simply moved on, their baroque artistry merely a waystation in an incomprehensible journey. [530]

When the storm passed and he could safely uncover the mirrors again, Matthias stood before his own reflection. [548] The revolutionary he had been stared back—older, quieter, but still fighting in his way. [564] He placed the crystal shard against the mirror's surface. [573] For one heartbeat, he saw them overlapped: past builders and present witness, two species reaching across time to touch the same beautiful, broken thing. [598]

"We are not the first to weep at our reflections," he wrote later, his words a bridge across the visible river of moments, "nor the last to make cathedrals / from our sorrow." [628]

The baroque asteroid kept its secrets, but he would keep asking. [639] The dispute would continue, bitter and academic, while he walked these gilt halls composing elegies for a civilization that existed now only in storm-lit glimpses and a single shard of remembered light. [671] His revolution had given everyone the ability to see time's flow. [683] Now he would use it to ensure these vanished architects were not forgotten, that their burnished sorrow echoed into whatever future the storms might bring. [709]
