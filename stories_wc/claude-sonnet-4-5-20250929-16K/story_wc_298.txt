Mira descended into the catacomb orchard with a lantern that cast amber shadows across the gnarled apple trees, their roots threading through ribcages and skulls like curious fingers. [28] She had cultivated this place for seven years, planting each sapling in soil enriched by the dead, believing that life and death could nourish each other if only someone was brave enough—or foolish enough—to facilitate the exchange. [59] Her reputation had spread through whispered networks: the woman who could trade destinies, who could take your suffering and give you someone else's joy, all for the price of what you'd been meant to become. [95]

She was a reckless idealist, her mentor had warned before vanishing into his own bartered fate, but Mira believed the world needed someone willing to patch holes in the soul, even if it meant ripping open her own. [131] She moved through the half-lit corridors between trees, her fingers trailing across bark where she'd carved symbols—a method she'd perfected, inlaying meaning everywhere so that every trunk, every root, every stone told part of the great web of exchanged futures. [171]

Tonight she clutched a burned tarot card, the Tower, its edges blackened and curling. [185] It had arrived three days ago in a wooden box with no return address, but she knew who'd sent it. [207] Kael. [209] The boy whose destiny she'd traded away when he was sixteen, replacing his predetermined early death with a borrowed lifespan. [229] She'd been fiercely gentle with him then, holding his shaking hands as she'd made the exchange, promising him decades he'd never been meant to have. [254]

But destiny, she'd learned, wasn't meant to be trammeled so completely. [266] Every trade created ripples, consequences that spiraled outward like roots seeking water. [278] The life she'd given Kael had belonged to a young woman named Senna, who'd died in a bridge collapse that Kael had survived. [301] Mira had convinced herself it was fair—Senna's chart had shown wealth and ease, while Kael came from poverty and pain. [322] Surely the universe could balance such an exchange. [330]

But the burned card told her otherwise. [337]

She found him waiting beneath the oldest tree, its branches heavy with fruit that glowed phosphorescent in the dark. [357] Kael had grown into the years she'd stolen for him; he was twenty-three now, lean and weathered, with eyes that held a dusky resolve she recognized from her own mirror. [387]

"You came," she said softly. [392]

"You knew I would." [396] He held up another card, the Lovers, also burned. [406] "Senna was going to be my wife. [413] Did you know that when you traded our paths?" [422]

Mira's lantern trembled. [425] She hadn't known, hadn't looked that far ahead into the threads she'd rewoven. [440] "I saved your life," she whispered. [446]

"You saved *a* life," Kael corrected, his voice tight with controlled anguish. [459] "But Senna and I were supposed to find each other, survive together, build something neither of us could build alone. [479] Instead she died, and I'm alive but incomplete, walking around with a hole where she should be." [497]

Mira looked at the symbols carved into the tree behind him, all the meanings she'd layered into this place, her certainty crumbling. [519] "I only wanted to help," she said, and heard how foolish it sounded, how naive. [536]

"Then help me now," Kael said, stepping closer. [544] His hand was gentle on her wrist, but his grip was firm. [557] "Trade it back. [560] Give me the death I was meant to have, and let Senna live." [574]

"It doesn't work that way," Mira said, but even as she spoke, she was calculating, measuring the roots and symbols around them, wondering if it was possible. [601] Wondering if her reckless idealism had one more impossible feat left in it, or if this was where she finally learned that some holes in the soul couldn't be patched—only earned, only endured. [635]

The fruit above them pulsed with borrowed light, and in the half-glow of her lantern, Mira made her choice. [655]

She would try. [658]

She would always try, even knowing that destinies, once bartered, left scars in the fabric of what-should-have-been. [676] Even knowing she couldn't save everyone. [682]

But perhaps, in this catacomb orchard where death fed life and roots embraced bones, she could learn to be gentle with the impossible. [705]

She took Kael's hand, and together they stepped into the web of meanings she'd inlaid everywhere, ready to unmake what never should have been made. [731]
