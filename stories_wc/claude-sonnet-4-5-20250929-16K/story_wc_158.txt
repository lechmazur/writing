The poet hadn't slept in three hundred years. [8] She lived inside a gargantuan shell that had once housed a creature the size of mountains, back when the ocean still existed. [30] Now the shell sat tilted on its side in the great dust plains, its pearlescent interior catching starlight through the spiral opening, and she had made it her sanctuary. [58]

Her insomnia had begun as ordinary sleeplessness, the kind that plagues anxious minds, but across centuries of longing—longing for rest, for peace, for the world that was—it had transformed into something else entirely. [89] She no longer needed sleep. [94] Instead, she wrote. [97]

The postcard arrived on a Tuesday, though weekdays meant little anymore. [108] It depicted a galaxy she didn't recognize, swirls of purple and gold against velvet black, with text on the back in fading ink: "Still blooming here." [133] No signature. [135] No address, really—the shell itself was address enough, visible from orbit, the only landmark for hundreds of miles. [154]

She pinned the postcard to the curving wall where dozens of others hung, a constellation of correspondence from survivors scattered across the dying planet. [176] Each one was a small defiance, proof that beauty persisted. [187] This was her motivation, the engine of her endless waking hours: to photosynthesize pain into beauty, to transform the ache of loss into something that could sustain others. [215]

The wind outside began its nightly song, an off-key howling that threaded through the shell's chambers via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind. [238] She had learned to hear music in it, the way one finds faces in clouds. [254] Tonight it sounded almost hopeful. [259]

A figure appeared at the shell's opening, silhouetted against the star-thick sky. [271] The poet recognized her immediately—Mira, the gardener who cultivated impossible flowers in bomb craters twenty miles south. [288] Mira entered shyly, but with that unstoppable quality she possessed, the way seedlings push through concrete. [304] Shyly unstoppable, the poet had written of her once. [314] Mira had kept the poem folded in her pocket for fifty years. [327]

"I brought something," Mira said, her voice carrying the reef-shadow joy of someone who has learned to find wonder in ruins. [348] She held out a bulb, dark and unpromising. [357] "It's from the Before. [361] Real Earth stock, preserved in the ice vaults." [369]

The poet took it carefully, feeling its weight, its potential. [379] "What does it grow?" [384]

"Cherry blossoms," Mira said. [388] "I thought—I thought maybe we could try. [396] Together." [398]

The shell had soil in its deepest chamber, where rain collected and minerals concentrated. [413] They walked there now, descending the spiral, and the poet felt something shift in her chest. [429] For centuries, she had worked alone, transforming anguish into verse, but perhaps that wasn't the only way to create beauty. [448]

They dug together, preparing a space to ensconce the bulb. [458] Mira hummed while she worked, harmonizing with the wind's strange music. [469] The poet found herself humming too, her voice rusty from disuse but willing. [483]

"I've been thinking," Mira said as they patted soil around the bulb, "about what you wrote last spring. [501] About the blossom armistice." [506]

The poet nodded. [509] That poem had proposed a truce with grief, a treaty where both beauty and sorrow could exist without one destroying the other. [531] Cherry blossoms embodied this perfectly—their beauty inseparable from their brevity, their falling. [543]

"If this blooms," Mira continued, "I want to send petals to everyone. [555] Press them into postcards. [559] Proof that we haven't given up." [565]

The poet looked at her companion, really looked—at the hope in her eyes, the dirt under her fingernails, the way she bent toward the future like a flower toward light. [594] Maybe she had been wrong. [600] Maybe sleep wasn't what she needed. [606] Maybe this was: hands in earth, voices tangling with wind, the shared audacity of planting something that might outlive them both. [627]

Above them, through the shell's opening, stars wheeled in their ancient patterns. [639] The wind sang its lullaby. [644] The bulb waited in darkness, dreaming of spring. [652]

"Yes," the poet said finally. [657] "Let's make them beautiful." [661]

And for the first time in three centuries, she felt something close to rest. [676]
