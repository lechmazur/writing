The onyx-ink cartomancer climbed through veils of starlight to reach the midnight glade, where ancient trees grew from clouds dense as marble. [23] Three months after the birth, Nadia had left her daughter sleeping in her sister's arms and ascended the sky-path her grandmother once described, driven by a singular need: to find where lost time accumulates. [54] She carried only her deck of hand-painted cards and a porcelain fragment—the cracked saucer from her daughter's dolls' tea set, broken the first week she'd returned to work instead of staying home. [84]

The glade materialized at midnight's exact center, suspended in the breathless space where atmosphere thinned to nothing. [101] Luminescent moss carpeted the ground between silver-barked trees whose branches disappeared into distances that defied geometry. [117] The beauty was choking—so exquisite it squeezed her chest, made breathing an act of deliberation. [132] Stars pressed close enough to warm her skin, and the moon hung low like a lantern someone had forgotten to extinguish. [152]

Nadia had always been willingly perplexed by her craft, embracing confusion as the doorway to deeper sight. [169] She'd learned from her mother that certainty was the enemy of true knowing, that the cartomancer must dwell in questions to perceive answers. [191] Now she spread her silk cloth across a flat stone table that seemed placed there for exactly this purpose, this midnight, this woman. [213]

Her fingers trembled as she began the ritual. [221] First, she placed the cracked saucer at the cloth's center, its pink-painted roses still visible through the lightning-bolt fracture. [240] Then she unfastened the leather cord binding her card deck, letting each card fall where it would. [257] The cards scattered like leaves, forming a pattern she recognized from childhood—the spiral her grandmother called "time's true shape." [276]

But the final element was missing. [282] Nadia reached into her pocket and withdrew the folded tablecloth, the one from her daughter's first birthday—next week—that she'd already marked in advance, unable to wait, terrified she'd forget. [310] Her family's custom stretched back six generations: tracing hands on birthday tablecloths, pressing palm and fingers into fabric with permanent ink, dates written beneath. [331] Her own hand-prints covered dozens of cloths in her mother's cedar chest, a paper trail of growth. [347]

She'd traced her daughter's tiny hand three nights ago, alone in the kitchen, weeping. [361] The onyx ink—the same ink she used for her deepest cartomancy—had stained the white linen: five perfect fingers, a thumb, the delicate lines of a three-month-old palm. [388] Beside it, she'd traced her own hand, but where their fingers should have met, a gap remained. [405] The space between them held all the hours she'd missed, all the moments she'd chosen wrong, all the feeding times and first smiles she'd traded for clients seeking futures she couldn't guarantee. [436]

In the midnight glade, Nadia placed this cloth over the scattered cards. [448] The cracked saucer at the center suddenly blazed with cool light. [459] The gap between the traced hands began to shimmer, and she saw it: time itself, pooling like water, collecting in the negative spaces of our lives. [485] Lost time didn't disappear—it accumulated in the places we left empty, waiting. [498]

Her cloudbound repentance had brought her here, guilt lifting her above the world to see clearly. [514] She understood now that she couldn't recover those lost hours. [525] They were gone, transformed into this aching wisdom. [533] But the tablecloth showed her daughter's hand, still small enough to fit inside her own, and the future birthdays yet to come. [553]

The cartomancer gathered her tools as dawn began to silver the cloud-edges. [566] She kept the cracked saucer, but left one card behind—the only one showing a mother and child, together. [585] It was an offering, a promise, a vow written in starlight and regret. [598] As she descended, the choking beauty of the glade released her chest, letting her breathe freely for the first time since the birth. [621] She rushed downward through the thinning darkness, hurrying home to trace new hands together, to let their fingers finally touch. [641]
