Mira had returned to the village three times before, each visit cut short by obligations that pulled her back across the ocean. [21]

This time, she told herself, would be different. [29]

The orchard had belonged to her grandmother, though Mira barely remembered it from childhood—just flashes of white blossoms and the old woman's weathered hands. [52] When the village elder handed her the rusted key, he mentioned something she hadn't known: beneath the fruit trees lay the ancient catacombs, where their ancestors had been laid to rest for a thousand years. [86]

The trees had grown wild in the decades since her family's diaspora. [98] Apple and pear roots had broken through the catacomb ceiling, snaking between skulls and ribcages, drawing sustenance from the bone-rich earth. [117] It was grotesque, perhaps, but Mira found herself warmly curious rather than repelled, sensing some sacred logic in this marriage of death and renewal. [139]

She had come to excavate her grandmother's tomb, to fulfill the reburial rites that had been interrupted by war and exile. [159] The village priest had lost faith in the old ceremonies, declaring them superstitions best forgotten, but Mira felt differently. [177] Her years abroad had hollowed something in her—some sense of rootedness, of continuity. [191] She hoped that by completing what her family had left unfinished, she might rebuild that internal architecture. [207]

The work progressed slowly. [211] Each morning, Mira descended into the cool darkness with her tools and lantern, but she rarely went directly to her destination. [231] Instead, she practiced what she came to think of as purposeful wandering: following root-carved passages, discovering chambers she hadn't known existed, reading the names carved above burial niches. [257] The catacombs formed a labyrinth, and she was learning its logic through her feet and fingertips. [273]

One afternoon, in a chamber where a massive pear tree had thrust its roots through the ceiling like wooden lightning, she found the sundial base. [297] It was half-buried in fallen earth, a circular stone platform carved with radiating lines and strange script. [314] The gnomon—the part that cast the shadow—had long since vanished. [327] But the base remained, a timekeeper that no longer kept time, displaced from the sun it was meant to measure. [347]

Mira carefully excavated it, brushing away centuries of soil. [356] The script, she realized with a quickening pulse, was in her grandmother's language, the old tongue she'd been losing word by word in her years away. [380] It marked not hours but seasons, harvest days, festivals of remembrance. [391]

She understood then that this sundial had once stood above ground, in the orchard, before the trees grew wild and the catacombs were forgotten. [413] Time had inverted this place—what was above had gone below, what was below had broken through above. [431] The roots and bones had become indistinguishable, life and death one continuous weaving. [444]

Over the following weeks, as she finally reached her grandmother's tomb and prepared it for the rites, Mira kept returning to the sundial base. [466] She began the work of rebuilding it, carrying it piece by piece toward the surface, though she wasn't certain where it should stand or if it could function again. [495]

The priest visited her once, descending reluctantly into the catacombs. [506] He stood in the pear-root chamber, and she watched cautious enchantment cross his weathered face. [521]

"I had forgotten," he whispered, "that our faith was never just about heaven. [534] It was about this—roots and bones, the dead feeding the living." [547]

On the day of her grandmother's reburial, half the village came. [559] They had interrupted their own journeys, she realized, their own connections to this place. [573] Together they carried the sundial base up into the orchard and set it among the wild trees. [591]

The gnomon was gone, yes, but the shadows of living branches marked time well enough. [606] Some interruptions, Mira thought, watching light move across ancient stone, were not endings but transformations. [621] Faith didn't need to be what it was—it needed to grow like these trees, nourished by what came before, reaching toward what came next. [646]

She would leave again, she knew. [652] But this time, she would return. [658] Her wandering had found its center, here where roots and bones remembered each other's names. [673]
