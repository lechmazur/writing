The mural restorer pressed her palm against the crumbling wall, feeling the echo before she heard it. [16] In the sound wave garden, every surface sang back. [26] Marta had spent three years here, methodically restoring the vivid murals that lined the amphitheater's curved walls, each one depicting a different dreamer mid-awakening. [48] The garden itself was an acoustic marvel: sculptured hedges shaped to catch and redirect sound, stone pathways that hummed when walked upon, fountains that whispered conversations back at different pitches. [75] She worked in the pause between question and reply, that suspended moment when the garden held its breath before answering. [94]

Today she discovered something new. [99] Behind a section of peeling paint, hidden within the oldest mural's seventh layer, she found a hobo nickel embedded in the plaster. [120] The coin had been carved with extraordinary skill, its surface transformed into a tiny sleeping face, eyes closed, mouth curved in peaceful unknowing. [143] She pried it loose carefully, and when it came free, the wall behind it opened—not physically, but sonically. [162] A tone emerged, pure and questioning. [168]

Marta held the nickel to her ear. [175] The carved face seemed to shift. [181] Had the eyes been closed a moment ago? [189] She blinked. [191] She was standing in the same spot, but the mural before her had changed. [205] The dreamer painted there now faced a different direction, looking at her with recognition. [219] Marta's pulse quickened. [222] She'd fallen asleep. [225] No—she'd woken up. [229] Or had she? [232]

The garden's acoustics intensified, bouncing her breathing back at her in overlapping waves. [245] She sang a single note experimentally. [251] The garden transformed it into a question that hung in the air: *Are you certain?* [267]

This was the third time today she'd "woken up" in the garden. [279] Or was it the first? [285] Each time, the murals were different, more vivid, more impossibly detailed. [296] Each time, she found herself holding the hobo nickel, its carved face slightly more awake than before. [312] Each time, she remembered starting her restoration work that morning, but the memories felt thin, like paint watered down too many times. [332]

Marta had always worked methodically, documenting every layer, every pigment, every brushstroke of the original artists. [347] But she was also playful in her approach, sometimes imagining conversations with the long-dead painters, wondering what they'd meant by this symbol or that color choice. [371] Now those imagined conversations felt less imaginary. [378] The murals seemed to be having conversations with her, through reflected sound that carried meaning beyond words. [395]

She held the nickel up to catch the light. [405] The face carved into it was definitely awake now, eyes open, staring back at her with urgent intensity. [422] Another note hummed from the wall where she'd found it. [433] The garden caught the sound and spun it into something that felt like bewitchment—not coercion, but invitation. [450] The murals around her began to pulse with their own light, and she understood suddenly that each one was a threshold, a layer of dreaming. [473]

How many times had she woken up today? [481] How many versions of herself were working through these nested awakenings, each one thinking she was the real Marta, the original consciousness? [502] The question should have frightened her. [508] Instead, she felt a strange liberation. [514]

She'd spent her career preserving certainty, documenting facts, establishing provenance. [524] But what if uncertainty was more honest? [531] What if curiosity was more valuable than conclusion? [539] She tucked the hobo nickel into her pocket, feeling its weight like an anchor—or like wings. [556]

Marta pressed both palms against the mural now. [564] The painted figure reached back. [569] She sang a clear, rising note. [575] The garden caught it, shaped it, sent it spiraling through the acoustic pathways until it returned as an answer that was also a question: *Wake up again.* [601]

She smiled and let herself fall backward into sleep, or forward into waking. [614] In the sound wave garden, in the pause between question and reply, it no longer mattered which direction was which. [633] Each awakening revealed another layer of the world's vivid complexity. [644] Each dream added another restoration. [649] The hobo nickel burned warm against her hip, its carved face now grinning with the same methodically playful expression she recognized from her own reflection. [672] The garden sang her deeper. [677] The murals opened their eyes. [682] And somewhere, in another layer, another Marta picked up her brush and began again. [696]
