Maya's fingers drummed against the metal railing, three beats then two, a rhythm she'd adopted years ago when thoughts tangled like kelp. [23] The sea level monitoring station creaked with the morning tide, its stilts groaning in the water fifty meters below. [42] She'd been stationed here for six years, ever since the fossil fuel ban transformed the coastal research network into something closer to vigil than science. [68]

The atlas page lay on her desk, torn deliberately from a book she'd found in the station's previous occupant's effects. [90] It showed the Coral Sea as it had been mapped in 2015, before the first major bleaching event she'd witnessed as a graduate student. [114] Back then, she'd floated above gardens of color that seemed periodically eternal—dying back with warming, resurging with cooling, an endless cycle of resilience. [137] Until the cycle broke. [141]

Three-two, three-two. [144] Her fingers found the desk's edge now, tapping while she studied the morning's data streams. [160] The coastal currents had shifted again, the third time this month. [172] Migration routes that appeared on her screens one week vanished the next, leaving only empty blue corridors where whale songs should echo. [194]

"You're doing it again," said Jin through the comm, his voice crackling from the northern sister station. [211] "The tapping. [214] I can hear it through your mic." [221]

Maya hadn't realized she'd left the channel open. [230] "Sorry. [232] Thinking." [233]

"About the disappearing paths?" [237]

She pulled up the overlay she'd been assembling for weeks—historical current maps, temperature data, salinity readings, all the fragments that might explain why established routes were winking out of existence. [267] The ocean had responded to the fuel ban with what everyone called recovery, but recovery implied returning to a previous state. [290] This felt different. [293] New. [294]

"The paths aren't disappearing," she said slowly, three-two rhythm continuing unconsciously against her thigh. [309] "They're shifting." [311]

"We know that—" [314]

"No." [315] Maya stood, pulling the torn atlas page toward the light. [326] Someone had marked it with faded pencil: dots along the Great Barrier Reef, dates beside each. [343] Bleaching events. [345] She'd assumed it was research notes, but now she saw the pattern. [358] The dates weren't random. [362] They followed a sequence. [366]

Three-two, three-two. [369]

The rhythm matched the tidal charts. [376]

She began pulling up archived data, fingers flying across keyboards, assembling decades of records. [390] The monitoring station had been built on a site chosen for its stability, moored permanently to bedrock below the waves. [410] But the ocean around it drifted with memory—currents that remembered every temperature shift, every chemical change, even the ones from before the ban. [434]

"Jin, what if the paths aren't disappearing?" [442] Her pulse quickened. [445] "What if they're returning?" [449]

The atlas page showed currents from seventy years ago, before industrial heating scrambled the ocean's ancient highways. [467] The bleaching dates marked when the Reef had tried to adapt to new, human-made flows. [484] Now, with temperatures stabilizing—still high, but no longer climbing—the water was remembering older patterns. [501] Periodically eternal: the ocean's memory asserting itself in cycles too long for human lifetimes to recognize. [518]

She'd been trying to track where the new paths led, but she'd been using the wrong maps. [537]

Three-two, three-two. [540] The rhythm of the tide, the rhythm of return. [550]

Maya grabbed her headset. [554] "I need you to cross-reference your current data with pre-industrial models. [566] Not the modified ones—the original reconstruction attempts from the 2020s." [577]

"Those were considered speculative—"

"They were right." [581] She taped the atlas page to her window, where sunrise hit the Coral Sea beyond. [597] "We weren't watching paths disappear. [602] We were watching them come back. [608] The ocean's been trying to show us where it wants to flow, where it flowed before we redirected everything." [627]

The station swayed, moored but moving, fixed yet drifting with the ancient pull of water finding its true course. [647] Maya's fingers stilled against the glass. [654]

Somewhere below, in water slowly healing, the coral might remember too. [666] Not the gardens she'd watched bleach, but their children's children—adapted, persistent, waiting for the paths to resettle into patterns periodically eternal. [688] The delayed revelation settled in her chest: recovery didn't mean going backward. [701] It meant the ocean assembling itself into what it had always been trying to become, before humanity interrupted. [719]

Three-two. [720] Three-two. [722] The rhythm of tides, of return, of paths finding their way home. [735]
