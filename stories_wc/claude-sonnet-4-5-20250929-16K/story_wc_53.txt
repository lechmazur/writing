The carousel had stopped three days ago, or perhaps three years—Kera could no longer distinguish between the weight of hours and the weight of decades. [27] She stood at the edge of the kinetic lagoon, watching silver waters churn above the cloudline, their perpetual motion a mockery of her own stillness. [54] The lagoon existed in defiance of physics, suspended in the thermal currents where sky became something other than sky. [74]

She was a scavenger, had always been, even when she'd called herself other names. [89] Architect, once. [91] Visionary. [92] Those titles had eroded like the cliff faces below, worn smooth by years of compromise and postponement. [109] Now she collected what others discarded: whispers that drifted up from the world beneath the clouds, fragments of conversations that tangled in the mist. [133]

"He promised me a city," one voice said, threading through the vapor. [146] "She forgot what she came for," another murmured, disconnected from time or source. [160] Kera gathered these story-shards in her mind, arranged them like puzzle pieces that never quite fit. [177] The method kept her hands busy, her thoughts occupied. [186] It kept her from remembering too clearly. [193]

The disposable camera wheel appeared on the fourth morning, or the second evening—chronology slipped through her fingers like lagoon water. [213] She found it wedged between two floating stones, the plastic toothed wheel that advanced film frame by frame. [231] No camera remained, just this small mechanism of progression, of moving forward. [243] She turned it in her palm, feeling each click, each deliberate advancement to the next moment. [259]

Her ghost stood twenty feet away, as it had for weeks or months. [273] It wore her face from a decade past, when blueprints still covered her walls and sleep came easily. [291] The ghost never spoke, only watched with eyes full of questions Kera couldn't answer. [306] She'd been trying to negotiate, to explain, but how did one justify the slow abandonment of everything one had meant to become? [329]

"You were supposed to build the floating gardens," a fragment whispered, someone's memory of someone's promise. [345] Kera's hand tightened on the camera wheel. [353] Yes. [354] The floating gardens. [357] She'd designed them in meticulous detail: irrigation systems that worked with cloud-moisture, foundations that rode the thermals, parks where children could play above the smog-choked cities. [382]

But funding had dissolved. [386] Partnerships crumbled. [388] Years accumulated like silt, burying ambitions under layers of almost and eventually and maybe tomorrow. [403] She'd told herself she was being practical, being patient. [413] Now she understood she'd been drowning in hesitation, in the fear that she wasn't enough. [429]

The lagoon's waters spiraled faster, responding to some shift in atmospheric pressure. [441] Kera approached her ghost with the camera wheel extended. [451] "I know," she said, her voice cracking through the fractured stillness. [463] "I know what we lost." [468]

Regret tasted like copper and cloud-water, sharp and insubstantial. [478] It filled her throat as she remembered the moment she'd first said no instead of yes, the meeting she'd skipped, the grant application she'd abandoned half-complete. [505] The carousel of opportunities had spun and spun, and she'd been too afraid to reach for the brass ring. [525] Then it had stopped, and the silence had been absolute. [536]

"I collected their stories because I couldn't bear my own," she told the ghost. [550] "Easier to carry other people's failures and dreams." [559] The ghost tilted its head, and in that gesture, Kera saw not accusation but invitation. [575]

She clicked the camera wheel once. [581] Twice. [582] Each advancement a moment, a choice, a possible future. [592] The mechanism couldn't take pictures anymore, couldn't preserve what was. [603] But perhaps it could still move her forward. [612]

"The carousel stopped," Kera said, "but the lagoon still turns." [623] She pocketed the wheel and extended her hand toward her ghost, toward her past self, toward negotiation. [641] "Maybe that's enough to start again." [648]

The ghost's fingers brushed hers, solid and cool. [657] In the kinetic waters, Kera saw blueprints reflected, eroded but still legible. [670] Small gardens, perhaps. [673] Modest platforms. [675] Something achievable in the time she had left, however much or little that might be. [692]

The fractured stillness held them both as the lagoon spun on, indifferent and eternal, above a world that had forgotten to look up. [714]
