The sound wave garden had always been predictable, its harmonics following celestial paths as reliably as tides follow moons. [19] But that changed when the constellations began sleepwalking. [28]

Mira watched from her skiff as Orion drifted sideways across the sky, his belt stars leaving phosphorescent trails through the garden's resonant atmosphere. [49] She was a fisher by trade and temperament—cool-headed even when the universe decided to unravel. [65] Tonight, she needed that composure more than ever. [73]

The garden stretched below her in crystalline terraces, each plateau vibrating at frequencies that made sound visible. [90] Normally, the stellar patterns above dictated the harmonic sequences below, creating predictable fishing grounds where emotional echoes pooled like luminous salmon. [110] But when patterns break themselves, when constellations wander drunk through their ancient routes, the echoes scatter. [126] They zigzag through impossible angles, fleeing into dimensions where conventional nets cannot follow. [139]

Mira wasn't hunting ordinary echoes tonight. [145] She was hunting for the echo of a goddess—specifically, the laugh Althea had uttered before ascending into pure vibration three centuries ago. [167] That single sound, preserved somewhere in the garden's infinite acoustic memory, could transliterate emotions directly into matter. [184] With it, Mira could reshape grief into something bearable. [193] She could transmute the loss that had hollowed her chest since her daughter stopped speaking. [208]

Her daughter hadn't gone mute from injury or illness. [217] The child had simply absorbed too much silence, the way gardens sometimes absorbed screams, and now she existed in a state of terrible quiet. [240] The physicians called it voicelessness. [245] Mira called it drowning on dry land. [252]

The rail spike hung from Mira's belt, cold iron inscribed with equations that measured the space between words. [270] Her grandmother had used it to anchor nets in the garden's deeper frequencies, where emotions swam too fast for ordinary tools. [290] Tonight, Mira would use it differently—as a tuning fork, a lodestone for divine laughter. [305]

Cassiopeia wheeled overhead, her throne-stars forming a drunken W. [315] The garden responded with dissonant chords that made Mira's teeth ache. [327] She steered her skiff toward the disturbance, following the wrongness the way a shark follows blood. [343] Cool-headed didn't mean fearless; it meant moving forward despite the fear crystallizing in her spine. [359]

The method for catching god-echoes was paradoxical: by voicing silence. [370] Mira opened her mouth and shaped the exact absence of sound her daughter now embodied. [385] It wasn't holding her breath—it was producing anti-sound, frequencies that erased rather than created. [400] The garden shuddered. [403]

Around her, the scattered echoes paused their zigzag flight. [412] In the sudden stillness, she heard it—a fragment of divine amusement, bright as breaking glass, warm as blood. [430] Althea's laugh, the sound that could transliterate emotions into new configurations. [441]

Mira drove the rail spike through the skiff's hull, pinning it to the frequency where the laugh resided. [459] The iron sang, holding the echo in place despite the sleepwalking stars above trying to drag everything into new, chaotic orbits. [480]

She cupped her hands around the sound, feeling it translate her desperation into something that pulsed with possibility. [498] This was the feral lullaby—the wild, untamed song that mothers sing when civilization's answers fail. [514] It had teeth and tenderness in equal measure. [522]

The echo resisted capture, twisting like a living thing. [531] Above, the constellations continued their disoriented wandering, Ursa Major brushing against Scorpius in configurations that had never existed. [548] But Mira held firm, cool-headed even now, even as the goddess's laughter tried to transliterate her own emotions into frequencies that would scatter her across the garden. [573]

She thought of her daughter's silence. [579] She thought of all the words trapped inside that small body like birds in a frozen lake. [596]

And slowly, carefully, she drew the echo into her net. [607]

The rail spike thrummed. [611] The laugh crystallized. [614]

When Mira returned home three hours before dawn, she carried light in a bottle and hope in her throat. [633] Her daughter slept in her bed, quiet as always. [643]

Mira opened the bottle. [647]

The goddess's laugh poured out, transliterating silence into speech, absence into presence, grief into a small voice that whispered, "Mother?" [668]

Above them both, the constellations stumbled back into their ancient patterns, the sleepwalking finally done. [683]

But Mira hardly noticed. [687]

She was too busy listening to her daughter sing. [696]
