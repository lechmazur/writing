Mira hummed as she locked the cemetery gates, her blithe nature unshaken even by the velveteen gloom settling over the headstones like moth wings. [26] After seventeen years tending these grounds, death held no terror for her, only the quiet satisfaction of keeping beauty alive among the departed. [50] She walked toward the old cobalt silo that stood at the property's edge, its painted surface drinking in starlight, transforming it into something between midnight and sapphire. [77]

The silo had been converted into storage for her tools and the cemetery's historical records, all tenderly organized across wooden shelves she'd installed herself. [102] Tonight, she had a different purpose. [109] The chess clock in the estate lawyer's office had finally run down that afternoon—six months since Old Warden Castellan's death, the exact period his will stipulated before his private effects could be examined. [142]

The antique sovereign case sat on her workbench where the lawyer had left it, gold-washed and no larger than a prayer book. [164] Castellan had left it specifically to her with a note: "For the only one who might understand the uncharted echoes." [186] The phrase had puzzled her for months. [193] Castellan had been a strange man, spending his final years in the groundskeeper's cottage, playing chess against himself and weaving at an old loom he'd installed by the window. [219]

Inside the sovereign case, she found no coins. [227] Instead, a tightly rolled square of fabric, snipped from something larger. [238] She recognized it immediately—a corner section from the massive tapestry that had hung in Castellan's cottage, the one he'd been obsessively repairing before he died. [263] The main tapestry had been burned per his instructions, but this fragment remained. [277]

Mira spread it beneath her lamp. [283] The tapestry's border showed a geometric pattern of interlocking branches, but along the hem, the threads had frayed badly, creating a chaotic tangle of colors. [308] She'd always assumed it was simple deterioration, but now, alone under the curved ceiling of the cobalt silo, she wondered if Castellan had deliberately pulled these threads. [336]

She fetched her magnifying glass and began to untangle the border systematically, separating each thread by color and length. [355] Hours passed. [357] The stars wheeled overhead, visible through the silo's high window. [367] Gradually, a pattern emerged—not random fraying, but deliberate displacement. [377] By decoding the frayed threads in the tapestry's border, treating each loose strand as a cipher, she began to see letters. [399]

Blue threads pulled left: B, E, N. [406] Gold threads crossed right: E, A, T, H. [415] Beneath. [416] Red threads looped downward: S, I, L, O. [424] Beneath silo. [426]

Her breath caught. [429] This silo. [432] She set down the tapestry and began examining the floorboards, running her fingers along the seams until she found one that shifted. [453] Beneath lay a wooden box containing letters—decades of correspondence between Castellan and a woman named Helena, written during a war Mira barely remembered. [476]

Reading them in the star-lanced darkness, Mira finally understood. [485] Castellan and Helena had been engaged, but his family had forbidden the marriage, deeming her unsuitable. [502] They'd separated, and he'd spent his life here among the dead, never marrying, weaving his loss into fabric and code. [524] The uncharted echoes weren't sounds but the reverberations of a love that had never found its proper shape, never mapped onto the world as it should have. [554]

The final letter was addressed to Mira herself: "You asked me once why I chose to live here. [572] I told you I was learning to understand the language of endings. [585] That was half true. [589] I needed to discover the shape of intentions—mine, Helena's, the family that separated us. [605] I needed to know if our love was real or merely the ghost of something I'd wanted it to be. [628] These letters are the answer. [633] I leave them to you because you understand that tending memory is sacred work. [648] Let someone know we were real." [654]

Mira sat in the cobalt silence, the letters pressed against her heart, and decided she would plant a Helena rose at Castellan's grave—something living to mark what had been lost, something beautiful to honor what had been true. [693] Even in velveteen gloom, love deserved its witness. [701] She gathered the letters tenderly, already organizing how she would preserve them, these uncharted echoes finally given voice beneath indifferent stars. [721]
