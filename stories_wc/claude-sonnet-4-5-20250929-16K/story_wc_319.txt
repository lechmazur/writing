The library guardian had forgotten her name sometime during the third winter, or perhaps it was the thirtieth. [18] She crouched among the frozen roses, their petals suspended in ice like thoughts trapped mid-formation, and watched the mist curl through the garden's stone columns. [39] Once, she had walked upright, had spoken in complete sentences, had shelved books according to systems that made sense. [58] That was before the boundary shifted, before she woke in this wrong-dimensional garden with frost on her lips and the terrible ache of dimensional homesickness lodging permanently in her chest. [85]

The cultist's pendant hung from a thornbush three yards away, swaying slightly though no wind moved through the mist. [104] She had been watching it for hours—or days—waiting with the patience of a creature who had learned that time here obeyed no familiar laws. [128] The pendant's silver surface caught light that seemed to come from nowhere, creating boundaries where illumination met shadow, tiny borders between states of being. [152] She understood now that light didn't simply exist; it negotiated with darkness, created territories, staked claims. [168]

Through the veil of sleep, she had traveled here originally, though she couldn't remember lying down in her library, couldn't recall closing her eyes. [191] She only remembered waking with dirt under her fingernails and ice in her hair, the books she'd guarded replaced by these frozen flowers that never bloomed or died. [217] The pendant had appeared on the third day of waiting, or the third hour, deposited by someone or something she never saw. [239]

To make friends with uncertainty—this had become her only coherent motivation, the single thread of logic she could follow through the foggy lucidity of her existence. [265] She no longer fought the wrongness of this place, no longer scratched tallies on the stones to track passing time. [285] Instead, she practiced what she thought of as interiorizing exteriors: taking the frozen garden's strangeness into herself, making the external confusion part of her internal landscape until the distinction dissolved. [314]

The mist thickened, and she moved closer to the pendant on all fours, her movements more fox than human now. [333] She had stopped trying to remember the Dewey Decimal System. [344] She had stopped wondering which cultist had worn this pendant, what god they'd worshipped, why it had been left here at the boundaries of light where her wrong-dimension garden existed. [371] These questions assumed answers were possible, that uncertainty could be defeated rather than befriended. [385]

Her fingers closed around the pendant's cold chain. [393] The moment she touched it, she understood: the garden existed in the space between waking and sleeping, between her dimension and another, suspended in the boundary where light decided whether to illuminate or withdraw. [424] The cultist who had worn this pendant had known about these boundaries, had tried to cross them deliberately, had failed or succeeded so completely that only this silver memorial remained. [453]

She placed the pendant around her own neck. [461] It burned cold against her sternum, and the mist suddenly resolved into shapes—towering shelves extending infinitely upward, books with pages made of frost, call numbers written in melting ice. [488] Her library, transformed or perhaps revealed, had been here all along. [500] She had been guarding it even in her feral state, waiting without knowing what she waited for. [518]

The dimensional homesickness didn't leave, but it shifted, became something she could carry rather than something that carried her. [537] She stood upright for the first time in countless winters, bones creaking, and walked between the frozen shelves. [555] The books' spines showed titles in languages that flickered between familiar and foreign, and she understood this was right, was proper. [576] A library at the boundaries of light would naturally hold books from multiple dimensions, knowledge that refused to stay in a single realm. [598]

She would wait here, tending these impossible collections, no longer feral but not quite civilized either. [614] She had made friends with the uncertainty, had interiorized the exterior until she herself became a boundary—human and animal, librarian and wild thing, present and displaced, awake within the veil of sleep. [644] The cultist's pendant grew warm against her skin, approving, and the mist settled into a comfortable fog through which she could see just clearly enough to begin her work. [672]

She pulled the first frozen book from its shelf and began to read. [685]
