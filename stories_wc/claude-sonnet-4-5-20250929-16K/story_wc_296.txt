The magic trick had failed at dawn, leaving the lake's surface churning with renewed fury. [15] Kael stood at the shore, her staff planted in the mud, watching the swirling orchard vortex pulse at the water's center like a malevolent heart. [40] She was a guarded druid, known throughout the valley not for warmth but for her uncanny ability to find lost things—objects, people, truths that others had surrendered to shadow. [70] Today she would find what mirrors refused to reveal: the source of the curse that had drowned an orchard and twisted it into this hungry spiral. [98]

The villagers had hired a charlatan who promised liberation through spectacle. [109] His trick involved mirrors arranged around the lake, meant to reflect the curse back upon itself. [125] Instead, the vortex had shattered every glass surface and pulled the man screaming into its depths. [141] Kael had watched with warlike serenity, her expression as calm as still water yet sharp with predatory focus. [159] She had expected failure. [163] Charlatans dealt in surfaces; curses required roots. [170]

She stepped onto the water, her feet finding purchase on lily pads that shouldn't exist in winter. [187] The orchard vortex swirled ahead, leafless apple trees spinning slowly in the lake's heart, their branches reaching upward like skeletal hands. [208] Kael moved toward them through expanding circles, spiraling inward in the ancient method of the search-pattern ritual. [225] Each circuit brought her closer while allowing her to read the water's memory, to sense what lay hidden. [242]

On the third circle, she felt it: a presence trapped within the vortex's eye. [256] On the fifth, she heard words, though they made no sound. [267] A frozen confession, suspended in the moment before speech becomes air. [278] Someone had tried to speak here, to admit something terrible, and the lake had seized that truth mid-utterance, transforming confession into curse. [299]

Kael reached the first tree and gripped its bark. [308] The wood was ice-cold and pulsing. [315] She closed her eyes and unbent her carefully maintained defenses, letting her consciousness flow into the orchard's trapped roots. [333] This was the price of her gift—to find lost things, she had to lose herself temporarily, to become unguarded. [352]

The vision struck like a blade: a woman standing where Kael stood now, holding a leather pouch. [369] "I poisoned the harvest," the woman was saying to someone unseen. [381] "I poisoned the harvest and blamed—" But the confession never finished. [392] The lake had risen in that instant, drowning words and woman and orchard together, freezing the moment of truth-telling into eternal rotation. [412]

Kael pulled back, gasping. [416] The curse wasn't punishment for evil done but for truth interrupted. [427] The lake had been enchanted to protect someone's reputation, and it had trapped the confession before completion. [444] To break this, she needed the confession to finish. [453]

She drew from her pouch the flesh-eating plant seed she'd carried for seven years, won from a bog witch who owed her a debt. [477] The seed consumed lies, digesting deception to reveal truth. [487] Kael pressed it against the tree's bark and channeled her power into forcing growth. [502]

The seed cracked and sprouted with violent speed, sending crimson roots through the dead wood. [517] The tree shuddered, then groaned with a voice not its own: "—blamed the druid who loved me, though she was innocent." [537]

The words finished at last. [542] The frozen confession completed itself. [547]

The vortex stopped spinning. [551] The trees began to sink peacefully into the depths, their purpose fulfilled. [563] Kael walked back across the calming water, her circles expanding outward now, taking her home. [579] Her expression maintained that warlike serenity—she had won through discipline and ruthlessness toward her own guarded nature. [596]

She had found what mirrors couldn't show: the words that were never reflected because they were never released. [613] Behind her, the lake became still, and in that stillness, finally rested. [626]
