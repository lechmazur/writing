Aina was known among the few who remembered her as the elusive mirage painter, though she had not touched brush to canvas in seven springs. [26] She stood on the echoing terrace where sound folded back on itself, where even whispered confessions returned as questions. [46] Rain had just ceased, leaving the prism parapet gleaming—its beveled stone edge splitting the emerging twilight into ribbons of color that danced across the wet flagstones. [73]

She was perceptively calm, as always, her stillness so complete that birds sometimes landed on her shoulders during these vigils. [93] But beneath that tranquility pulsed a borrowed heartbeat, the rhythm of her late daughter synchronized somehow to her own, a phenomenon no physician could explain and no mother could refuse. [120] Since Maya's death three years ago, Aina had felt that secondary pulse, fainter but insistent, as though her child's time had been deposited into her own chest for safekeeping. [148]

The borrowed heartbeat demanded purpose. [152] It had led Aina here, to this terrace each spring evening, to attempt something that straddled the line between desperation and magic: to persuade mirrors to show possibilities rather than mere reflections. [181] She had arranged them carefully along the parapet—twelve antique mirrors, each angled to catch both the prismatic light and the last rays of sun breaking through departing clouds. [209]

Over the hush before bells ring, that suspended moment when the city held its breath between day and night, Aina believed the barriers between what was and what might have been grew thin. [240] This was when she sang. [245]

Her method had revealed itself gradually, through dreams where Maya appeared humming half-remembered melodies. [259] Aina began encoding messages through coded lullabies in children's songs—"Twinkle, Twinkle" with altered intervals, "Ring Around the Rosie" with extra verses that spoke of doorways and choices. [285] The codes were simple substitutions at first, then grew complex: every third note represented a letter, every pause a punctuation mark, every key change a shift in meaning. [312]

Tonight she sang "Lavender's Blue," but wove into it a question she had carried for three years: If I had taken you to the doctor one day earlier, what color would your room be painted now? [346] The mirrors trembled, or perhaps it was only the wind. [357] The prism parapet threw indigo and amber across their surfaces, and for a heartbeat—her borrowed heartbeat—the reflections showed not Aina's weathered face but a teenage girl laughing, painting a mural of impossible birds. [388]

Aina's voice cracked but did not stop. [395] She moved into "Hush, Little Baby," encoding deeper questions: What would you study? [407] Who would you love? [411] Would you still hum while you painted? [418] The grace with which she transitioned between melodies belied the ferocity of her longing—each note was both caress and command, demanding the mirrors acknowledge what they kept hidden. [444]

The bells began their first tentative chime, and the moment started to collapse. [457] But in the final seconds, one mirror—the smallest, rimmed in tarnished silver—shimmered differently. [471] Instead of reflecting the terrace or the prism-light, it showed a studio apartment filled with canvases, a young woman with Maya's eyes mixing paint, singing one of Aina's coded lullabies to a child who resembled no one yet everyone. [507]

The vision held for three heartbeats—one borrowed, two her own—then dissolved into ordinary reflection. [521]

Aina sank onto the wet stone, exhausted but no longer entirely alone. [533] The mirrors had answered, not with certainty but with possibility, which was its own form of grace. [549] In the dusky harmony of spring evening, she understood that the borrowed heartbeat was not Maya clinging to life but Maya's way of ensuring her mother remembered that life contained more than what had actually occurred. [585]

The terrace echoed with the final bells, with the last notes of the lullaby, with the sound of a woman standing and carefully wrapping twelve mirrors in cloth printed with children's songs. [615] Tomorrow she would return, with new questions encoded in old melodies, sustained by the heartbeat that reminded her that even mirages could be real if painted with enough love. [642]

She was still elusive, still a painter, but now she created mirages of hope rather than grief—landscapes of the possible glimpsed in the prismatic light of what remained. [669]
