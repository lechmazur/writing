The letterpress operator's fingers moved across cold metal type with surgical precision, though whose precision he couldn't say anymore. [19] Today he wore the mannerisms of a dead astronomer, yesterday a merchant's cautious smile. [33] Between the vanishing stars—those gaps in the sky where constellations winked out one by one—he had perhaps three months before the celestial mathematics collapsed entirely. [58]

His workshop glowed topaz under the unraveling heavens, the amber walls catching starlight that shouldn't exist anymore. [75] On the slate table beside his press lay the halo fragment, no larger than a thumbnail, pulsing with borrowed luminescence. [94] He'd found it where the Sagittarius arm used to hang, a shard of something holy or technological—the ambiguity was deliberate, necessary even. [114]

"You're doing it again," said Mira, leaning against the doorframe. [124] She was the only person who still visited, who could tolerate his shifting personas. [138] "Whose hands are those?"

He examined his fingers as if seeing them for the first time. [152] "An engraver from Prague, 1887. [158] He understood how pressure translates to permanence." [165]

"And what are you trying to make permanent?" [173]

He lifted the halo fragment with tweezers, holding it against the lamplight. [185] Through its translucent surface, he could see equations—not written but existing, the way grief exists in a clenched jaw. [204] "Emotion has structure," he said, though the voice carried a Parisian lilt he'd absorbed from a physicist's memoir. [222] "It follows laws we've never bothered to notate. [231] Joy propagates at measurable speeds. [237] Longing has half-lives. [241] I'm trying to understand the mathematics."

Mira stepped closer, her shadow fracturing across his workspace. [253] "By stealing personalities? [257] By printing cryptic pamphlets nobody can decipher?" [265]

He set new type, each letter selected for weight and negative space. [277] The words he composed would disorient readers, would transpose their emotional states—make them feel his determination as their own doubt, his curiosity as their fear. [301] This was transposed empathy, the heart of his research. [311] If he could print feeling itself, mechanize the transfer of interiority, perhaps he could decode its underlying grammar. [328]

"The stars are equations too," he explained, borrowing now from a mystic he'd never met. [343] "Each one a variable in a cosmic proof. [352] As they vanish, we lose dimensions of meaning. [361] Soon we won't remember what certain feelings were called."

He placed the halo fragment directly onto the press bed, surrounding it with type. [378] The fragment had come from something—someone—who had felt purely, without the static of consciousness. [393] Angels, if they existed, probably experienced emotion as mathematics: clean, total, undeniable. [406]

"You're terrified," Mira said softly. [411] "That's why you wear everyone else. [418] You're afraid your own feelings don't calculate."

The accusation landed like a punch, and for a moment he felt himself—wholly himself—the fear sharp and geometric. [438] "Yes," he admitted in his own voice, unfamiliar and small. [449] "I borrow personalities because I suspect mine is incomplete. [459] An equation with missing operators. [465] But if I can understand the structure, map the mathematics, maybe I can solve for myself."

He pulled the press lever. [475] The fragment shattered under pressure, its luminescence flowing into the ink, into the paper, binding emotion to medium through deliberate craft and careful ambiguity. [498] The printed page glowed faintly, covered in words that shifted meaning depending on the reader's orientation. [513]

Mira picked up the page, and he watched her face change—confusion, then recognition, then something like sorrow mixed with understanding. [532] "I feel what you feel," she whispered. [540] "The loneliness of it. [545] The hope that you're part of something formulaic, provable."

Above them, another star disappeared, and the topaz walls dimmed slightly. [557] Time was running out, the universe simplifying toward some terrible elegant conclusion. [569]

"It's working," he said, wonder breaking through his borrowed mannerisms. [580] "Transposed empathy through letterpress. [585] Emotion made transferable, readable, perhaps even solvable."

Mira held the lucid, turbulent page to her chest. [597] "Then hurry," she said, looking at the vanishing sky. [607] "Before there's nothing left to feel about."

He set new type with his own uncertain hands, no longer borrowed, and began the next proof. [628]
