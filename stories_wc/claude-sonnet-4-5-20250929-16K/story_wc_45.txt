Dr. Maren Cole had spent thirty years setting bones in the village clinic, a forgiving skeptic who believed in what her hands could prove. [24] After they found the substitute body in the creek—bark and moss shaped like young Thomas Weir—she'd stopped believing in certainty altogether. [48]

The boy's mother brought her to the secret garden hidden behind the ancient hedge maze at the Weir estate. [68] "You'll understand now," Mrs. Weir whispered, guiding her through turns Maren had never noticed in all her years visiting the manor. [90]

The garden exhaled twilight even at noon. [97] Crystalline flowers grew alongside roses her grandmother might have planted, their petals rippling with bioluminescent patterns that mapped unfamiliar stars. [118] Thomas sat cross-legged on the moss, arranging small bones into spiraling patterns. [131] He looked up with eyes that held both mischief and ancient sorrow—shrewdly innocent, like a child who'd learned to speak by listening to centuries. [154]

"Dr. Cole." [156] His voice carried harmonics that made her teeth ache. [166] "Mother says you fix broken things." [172]

Maren knelt beside him, her skepticism cracking open like an egg. [184] The bones he arranged weren't animal—they were too symmetrical, too deliberately grown. [198] "What are you making, Thomas?" [203]

"Constellations," he said simply. [207] "The mistakes need names. [212] The real Thomas went somewhere beautiful. [219] I came here by accident—wrong gate, wrong world. [228] Now we're both displaced." [232] He reached into his mouth and wiggled a loose tooth. [244] With a child's casual grace, he pulled it free. [254]

The tooth gleamed opalescent, shifting colors like oil on water. [265] A changeling's baby tooth. [269]

"I've been setting bones since before you were born—before whatever you are was born," Maren said carefully. [287] "I've never seen anything like this." [294]

"That's why I yearned for you to come." [303] Thomas placed the tooth at the center of his constellation. [315] "Bone setting isn't just making straight what was broken. [325] It's understanding how things fit together when they're not supposed to." [338]

Maren felt a cleft opening in her certainty, that solid ground she'd stood on for decades. [355] The substitute body had been the first crack. [365] This was the chasm. [369] And somehow, falling into it felt like finally understanding a language she'd heard all her life without comprehending. [388]

"Show me," she said. [392]

Thomas guided her hands to the bone constellation. [401] Where she touched, meaning bloomed—not words but comprehension. [410] The real Thomas hadn't drowned; he'd walked through a gate only children could see, into a place where lost things went to be cherished. [435] This changeling child had stumbled through from the other direction, fleeing something in his own world, and found himself trapped in human form. [459]

"Can I go home?" [463] Thomas asked quietly. [466]

Maren examined the pattern like she'd examine an X-ray. [477] The bones told a story of displaced souls, wrong turnings, cosmic accidents. [490] But they also showed connection points—places where two worlds touched, where exchange was possible. [506]

"Not the way you came," she said, her fingers tracing the lines between the bones. [522] "But I think we can set this right. [531] Make it so both Thomas's find their way home." [542]

She worked through the afternoon, arranging and rearranging the bones while Thomas added his memories—a downy feather, a river stone, finally the changeling tooth that anchored everything. [570] The constellation grew, incorporating her medical knowledge with his ancient understanding. [582] What had been mistakes—the wrong child in the wrong world, the substitute body, the years of confusion—transformed into a map of return. [606]

As evening light filtered through the impossible flowers, the constellation began to glow. [620] Thomas stood, no longer shrewdly innocent but simply innocent, simply ready. [632]

"Will you forget me?" [636] he asked. [638]

"Never," Maren promised, the forgiving skeptic now certain of only one thing: that the universe was stranger and more merciful than she'd ever imagined. [663]

Thomas stepped into the light his constellation made, and somewhere, another child stepped out. [678]

Maren walked back through the hedge maze, carrying her new certainty like a healing she'd learned to perform on reality itself. [700]

Behind her, the secret garden bloomed its nostalgic innovation, where old magic and new understanding grew together in the spaces between worlds. [723]
