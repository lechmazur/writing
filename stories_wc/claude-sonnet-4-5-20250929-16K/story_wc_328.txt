The herbalist's underground garden hummed with its own weather, moisture beading on limestone walls as Elena descended the spiral stairs into the earth. [24] She wore the guise of a botanical illustrator, but her real work involved documenting creatures that shouldn't exist. [43] Three weeks ago, the missing had returned to Millbrook—seventeen people who'd vanished over forty years, unchanged, speaking in riddles about a "harmony untamed." [66] Now everyone wanted answers, and Elena suspected those answers grew in Magda's subterranean sanctuary. [80]

"You're late," Magda said, pruning a vine that defied gravity, its tendrils reaching downward before curling upward in spirals. [99] The old woman's garden was gravitationally playful, plants growing in directions that made Elena's inner ear ache. [117] "The phone's been ringing all morning." [123]

Elena noticed the ancient cordless phone mounted on the wall, its antenna wrapped in copper wire. [139] Static crackled from the receiver even while cradled. [147] "Who calls you down here?" [152]

"Not who. What." [156] Magda handed her a clay pot containing something that looked like moss but pulsed with bioluminescence. [173] "Plant this in the northeast corner. The returned ones, they need to confess, and that phone's the only thing that lets them." [194]

Elena knelt in the dark soil, her fingers brushing something sharp. [206] A flint arrowhead, ancient and precisely knapped, lay among the roots. [218] She pocketed it quickly. [222] "Confess what?" [224]

The phone rang—a sound like wind through a canyon, overlaid with human breathing. [238] Magda lifted the receiver and held it between them. [248] Through the static, Elena heard Tom Bridger, one of the returned, his voice fractured: "We were taken into the harmony...the place where bitterness metamorphoses...where anger becomes music...we learned to laugh at our pain until it became stars..." [283]

Elena's academic training screamed hoax, but she'd seen Tom's DNA report. [295] Forty years gone, not a day aged. [302] "What harmony?" she whispered. [306]

"They met something in the woods," Magda said, replacing the receiver. [317] "Something old. Something that feeds on human suffering but only to transform it." [331] She gestured at her impossible garden. [337] "This place exists between spaces. The plants here remember being animal, mineral, light." [351] She pointed at a tree that seemed to shift between oak and birch with each breath. [368] "That's what the creature does. It takes people filled with bitterness, people ready to crack, and shows them how pain metamorphoses when you stop clinging to it." [393]

Elena felt the arrowhead in her pocket, suddenly understood its presence. [404] "The creature's been here a long time." [411]

"Since the first people walked these hills." [418] Magda's expression held frostbitten hope—the look of someone who'd glimpsed warmth through ice. [433] "It's a cryptid only to those who don't understand that some mysteries solve us, not the other way around." [452]

The phone rang again. [456] This time Magda gestured for Elena to answer. [465] She lifted the receiver, and through the static came her own mother's voice—her mother who'd died bitter and angry three years ago. [487] "Elena...baby...I finally get the joke...all that rage I carried, it was just energy refusing to dance...tell your father I'm sorry...tell him the stars here sing his name..." [515]

Elena dropped the phone. [519] Tears froze on her cheeks in the garden's strange microclimate. [530] Her mother had been taken before death, transformed, returned somewhere beyond Elena's reach but close enough to whisper through electromagnetic spaces. [550]

"Will you report this?" Magda asked. [556] "Tell your cryptozoology institutes about the creature that turns bitterness into cosmic jokes?" [569]

Elena touched the arrowhead again, felt its edge sharp against her thumb. [581] Thousands of years of human pain and transformation, all feeding the harmony untamed. [594] Some creatures didn't need capturing, only witnessing. [601]

"No," she said, pocketing the phone's copper-wrapped antenna. [610] "I'm going to learn how to metamorphose instead." [619]

Outside, snow began falling upward. [624]
