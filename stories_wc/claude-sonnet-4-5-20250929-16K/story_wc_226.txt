The towers of bone rose like broken fingers from the canyon floor, their surfaces smooth as polished ivory, ancient as accumulated guilt. [23] Mira stood among them, her brush and paints abandoned at her feet, knowing that color had no place in this realm of judgment. [47] Only echoes lived here—whispers of confessions past, accusations that never died, reverberating eternally between the pale walls. [66]

Tomorrow, the ritual would begin. [71] Tomorrow, the Keepers would come to this canyon of endless echoes and demand her truth, singular and sharp as a blade. [92] But Mira was an artist, defiant even in the face of judgment, and she believed that truth could be many things depending on the light that struck it. [119]

She had come here not to hide, but to prepare. [130]

The pale spire in mist stood at the canyon's heart, taller than all the others, perpetually wreathed in fog that seemed to breathe. [152] That's where they would take her tomorrow. [160] That's where she would have to answer for what she'd done—the painting that had revealed the High Minister's secrets, spilling them across the gallery walls in vermillion and gold. [189] She'd thought it harmless, almost playful. [196] An innocently mischievous act, she'd told herself, exposing hypocrisy through beauty and art. [210] But the Minister's daughter had taken her own life when the shame became too heavy to carry. [228]

Forgiveness had a price here. [233] The ritual would extract it from flesh, from memory, from the soul itself. [248]

Unless Mira could make them see what she saw—not one truth, but many. [263] Not a single beam of light, but a rainbow. [273]

She began to speak, her voice tentative at first, testing the canyon's acoustic depths. [288] The words came as poetry, unplanned and urgent:

"A brush dipped in justice
or cruelty's ink? [301] The hand that painted
did not stop to think—" [311]

The echoes caught her verse and threw it back, fragmented, multiplied. [323] Did not think... did not think... justice or cruelty... cruelty... cruelty... [337]

Encouraged, she moved between the towers, speaking new verses:

"She showed the world
a gilded lie. [351] But whose hand
made the daughter die?" [359]

The canyon answered in chorus: whose hand... whose hand... gilded lie... die... die... die... [377]

Through impromptu poetry sessions, Mira worked through the night, her verses growing bolder as she learned to use the bone towers as instruments. [401] Each poem was designed to refract the single truth into many, to bend it like light through a prism. [421] She spoke of intention versus consequence, of art's duty versus its damage, of innocence entangled with destruction. [439] The towers caught every word, splintering them through endless corridors until meanings multiplied like reflections in facing mirrors. [457]

Her motivation was clear: if she could make them hear a hundred versions of what happened, perhaps they would grant mercy to at least one. [482]

By dawn, when the mist began to thin, she had filled the canyon with contradictory symphonies. [499] The echoes layered upon echoes, creating harmonies where she was guilty, righteous, reckless, and brave all at once. [517]

But as she finally fell silent, exhausted, the pale spire emerged fully from its fog, and Mira understood. [536]

The canyon had not scattered her truth. [544] It had amplified it. [549]

Every refraction still contained the core: a girl was dead, and Mira's art had illuminated the path to that death. [570] The poetry had dressed it in different garments, approached it from different angles, but the weight remained precisely the same. [591]

A forged hush settled over the canyon—that peculiar silence that comes not from absence but from the deliberate cessation of sound, hammered into shape by will and exhaustion. [618] The echoes faded to whispers, then to nothing. [627]

Mira gathered her paints, though she knew she would never use these colors again. [642] The Keepers would come soon. [648] The ritual would proceed. [653]

She had wanted to refract a single truth into many, to make them see complexity where they demanded simplicity. [672] But she saw now that the price of forgiveness didn't work that way. [686] It required not the multiplication of truth, but the acceptance of it—whole, sharp, undivided, and real. [705]

The pale spire waited in the thinning mist, patient as bone, inevitable as judgment. [720]

Mira walked toward it. [725]
