The orbital station bent light in ways that made Vera's head ache, but she'd grown to find the distortion oddly soothing. [21] The gravitational anomaly at Point Lacuna had been pulling at space-time for three decades now, and someone needed to interpret the celestial signals that warped through its influence. [47] That someone was Vera, confidently uncertain about every translation she made, yet somehow always employed. [62]

After planting the wrong seeds on the Meridian colony—her mistranslation had identified the world as temperate rather than acidic—Vera returned to her cramped observation pod with a peculiar weight in her chest. [93] Two thousand settlers had expected apple orchards and got sulfur-resistant lichen instead. [106] They weren't angry, not exactly, but their polite gratitude for "adapting the mission parameters" felt worse than rage. [124]

She found the dried-up fountain pen in her grandfather's effects box, its exotic nib shaped like a split crescent moon. [145] He'd been a signal interpreter too, before the anomaly formed, when celestial navigation was done with star charts and ink. [166] The nib had fascinated her as a child—its strange double point that could draw two parallel lines simultaneously. [185]

Vera held the pen near her console, and the screens flickered. [196] The gravitational distortion responded to the exotic metal, some rare element that resonated with warped space. [212] When she touched nib to screen, the recorded signals began to shift, characters rearranging themselves like startled birds. [229]

She was editing history. [233] Not changing what happened, but revising her interpretation, creating alternate readings that had always been possible, always existed in quantum superposition until observed. [256] The anomaly held all versions simultaneously, and the pen let her unbend reality's rigid spine, letting other truths stand upright. [277]

But which version was real? [282] Which seeds should she have recommended? [289]

Vera spent weeks in the strange comfort of uncertainty, learning to thresh meaning from experience through contingent relationships. [307] She discovered that each signal existed only in relation to others—a star's brightness meant nothing without knowing its distance, its age, the medium through which light traveled. [335] The Meridian readings hadn't been wrong; they'd been incomplete, interpreted in isolation. [348]

She began to unbend her thinking, following chains of connection. [358] The colony's atmospheric readings related to its moon's orbit, which related to solar wind patterns, which related to the system's position in the galactic arm. [384] Everything touched everything else. [388] Change one interpretation, and twenty others shifted. [395]

The dried-up pen became her divining rod through probability. [405] Its double nib traced contingent paths across her data, showing her not what was, but what else could be. [425] She found seven different Meridians, each equally valid depending on which relationships she prioritized. [439]

In one, the acidic soil was temporary, volcanic activity that would cease within a generation. [455] In another, the settlers' sulfur-resistant lichen would become the foundation of a unique biochemistry worth billions. [472] In a third, Meridian was never meant for farming at all, but for mining rare compounds that existed nowhere else. [493]

Vera sent her revised interpretations—all seven versions, weighted by probability, connected by conditional branches. [508] The response came weeks later: the settlers had read her contingent histories and found strange comfort in the multiplicity. [528] They were already adapting, no longer bound to a single failed future but exploring several simultaneous ones. [545]

She set the fountain pen on her console, its exotic nib catching the bent starlight. [560] The gravitational anomaly hummed around her station, holding all versions of truth in its warped embrace. [576] Vera understood now that she'd never planted wrong seeds—she'd simply been reading a single timeline in a universe that refused to be singular. [600]

The pen's double nib had taught her to see double truths, to unbend her certainty and let contingency flourish. [620] Outside her viewport, stars traced impossible curves through folded space, each photon a signal awaiting interpretation, each interpretation creating new realities. [642]

She was confidently uncertain, and that was exactly right. [651] In the gravitational anomaly's strange comfort, Vera had learned to thresh meaning not by finding the one true answer, but by understanding how all answers related, how truth bent and split and remained whole. [686]

The dried-up fountain pen wrote nothing, yet through it, she'd revised everything. [699]
