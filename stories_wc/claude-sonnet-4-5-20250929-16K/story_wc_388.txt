Maya pressed her goggles tight against her face as another rust-colored dust storm rolled across the wasteland, yet the orchard before her remained impossibly green. [26]

She had spent fifteen years debunking conspiracy theories, and the tale of the Krasnov Diamond had always struck her as the most absurd—a flawed stone supposedly cursed to bring ruin to whoever possessed it. [53] After the liquidation had turned three provinces into radioactive deadlands, the survivors needed someone to blame, and a gem with an inclusion shaped like a teardrop became their scapegoat. [82] But Maya knew better than to trust comfortable lies. [91]

The orchard's caretaker, an old woman named Vera, met her at the gate with suspicious eyes. [106] "You're the debunker," Vera said, not a question. [115] "Come to tell us our diamond curse is nonsense." [124]

"I'm here to excavate truth," Maya replied, her sharply observant gaze already cataloging details: the fruit trees heavy with apples despite the poisoned soil, the absence of radiation burns on Vera's exposed skin, the way the dust seemed to flow around the orchard rather than through it. [165]

Inside Vera's cottage, Maya found what she'd come for—a metal box filled with shredded paper. [181] "The Institute's records," Vera explained. [186] "They tore them up the day before the liquidation. [195] Said it was protocol." [199]

Maya had intuited there would be documents here. [207] Every conspiracy had a paper trail, and someone always tried to destroy it too late. [222] She spread the strips across Vera's table and began the painstaking work of reassembling shredded letters, matching torn edges and faded ink. [243]

Hours passed as patterns emerged. [248] The documents detailed experiments at the Institute—not with cursed diamonds, but with something called Project Stillpoint. [264] Maya's pulse quickened as she pieced together a memo: "...containment field maintains stability...radiation cannot penetrate...tested using Krasnov Diamond as focus..." [283]

"They weren't trying to curse anything," Maya murmured. [291] "They were trying to save something." [297]

She worked through the night, and by dawn, the truth had assembled itself before her like a terrible mosaic. [316] The Institute had discovered a method of creating a hidden stillpoint—a bubble of normalcy where physics operated as it had before the world broke. [338] The Krasnov Diamond, with its unique internal flaw, had served as the geometric anchor for the field's projection. [356] But the experiment had catastrophic side effects: it pushed the radiation outward, intensifying it beyond the stillpoint's borders. [373]

The liquidation hadn't been caused by the diamond's curse. [382] It had been caused by the Institute's desperate attempt to preserve this one perfect place. [397]

"You understand now," Vera said quietly, appearing with tea as the dust storm finally cleared. [412] "They sacrificed everything else to save the orchard. [421] The diamond is buried here, still working, still holding this space pure." [433]

Maya looked out the window at the thriving trees, at this impossible garden in a dead world. [450] The comfortable lie had been believing in a curse—random, meaningless suffering that no one could prevent. [467] The uncomfortable truth was that someone had chosen this outcome, had drawn a circle around one precious thing and condemned everything beyond it. [490]

"The survivors believe the diamond is evil," Maya said. [499] "They want it destroyed." [503]

"And if they destroy it?" [508] Vera asked. [510]

Maya could intuit the answer from the reassembled letters, from the equations partially visible on the reconstructed pages. [527] The stillpoint would collapse. [531] The orchard would die. [535] The last pure place would become as poisoned as everything else. [546]

She had come to debunk a conspiracy, to free people from superstition. [558] But what did you do when the comfortable lie protected people from a truth that would destroy their last fragment of hope? [580]

Maya carefully gathered the reconstructed documents and fed them, one by one, into Vera's stove. [595] Some truths, she realized, were better left buried beneath the thriving apple trees. [608]

The diamond would keep its curse, and the orchard would keep its secret stillpoint. [622]

Sometimes excavating truth meant knowing when to stop digging. [631]
