The prism sanctuary fractured starlight into a thousand nervous colors across the stone floor. [14] Mara knelt at the center, her own face half-hidden behind a restoration mask she'd never finished—cracked porcelain, missing its left eye. [35] The irony wasn't lost on her: a broken mask restorer, mending spirits instead of clay. [50]

Before her lay the centuries-old fisherman's net, salt-stiff and knotted with more than rope. [64] Each knot held a voice, a memory, a death at sea. [76] She'd discovered it three months ago in the sanctuary's vault, and immediately understood its purpose. [91] The net didn't catch fish—it caught the drowned, tangling their restless spirits in an interlaced hush that neither released them nor let them speak. [114]

"You came back," she said to the darkness. [122]

The boy materialized slowly, phosphorescent like deep-water creatures. [130] Ten years old when he drowned, forever ten in death. [140] He'd been appearing each night since she started her work, drawn to the unraveling. [154]

"Will it hurt?" he whispered. [159]

Mara threaded the tapestry needle with silver wire—the only tool fine enough to work the ancient knots without destroying them completely. [180] "Truth usually does," she said. [186] Her hands trembled. [189] They always did now. [193] That's what made her broken: hands that shook, a restoration career ended, a sanctuary found by accident when she'd come here to hide. [214]

She'd discovered she accumulated silence the way others collected scars. [224] Each spirit she worked to free added its particular quiet to her—not peaceful silence, but the held-breath moment before drowning, the muffled underwater scream. [247] The sanctuary held dozens of these silences now, pressing against her ribs like unfallen snow. [262]

"I need to tell you something," the boy said, floating closer. [273] "Before you finish." [276]

This was the timeframe she'd learned to recognize—across sharing a secret, the spirits always became most real. [293] Most dangerous, too. [296] The truth could anchor them or shatter everything. [304]

"Tell me," Mara said, working the needle into a knot near the net's edge. [318] The rope resisted, then yielded. [323] One loop loosened. [326] She felt something exhume from the weave—not the boy, but something older, colder. [340]

"I wasn't alone when I drowned," he said. [348] "My brother. [351] He pushed me." [354]

Mara's needle paused. [357] Starlight through the prisms painted his face in anxious blues and greens. [369] "Is he in the net too?" [375]

"No. [376] He lived. [378] He's old now. [381] He comes here sometimes, to the cliffs above. [389] I can feel him remembering." [394]

She understood then. [397] This was why the boy couldn't settle—not the drowning itself, but the unspoken accusation, the brother's guilt above and the boy's truth below, neither reaching the other. [422] The interlaced hush had kept them separate for sixty years. [432]

"If I free you," Mara said carefully, "you'll be able to reach him." [445]

"Yes." [446]

"That's not the same as peace." [452]

The boy's form flickered. [456] "I know. [459] But I'm tired of silence." [465]

Mara thought of her own broken pieces—the trembling hands, the unfinished mask, the sanctuary she'd made from her failure. [483] She thought of all the silence she carried, and how it never felt like peace either. [499] Only absence. [501]

"Then let's ground you properly," she said, and drove the needle deep into the net's heart. [517]

The knots began to unravel in sequence, a cascade she couldn't stop now even if she wanted. [534] The boy brightened, solidified, his voice growing stronger as the interlaced hush tore apart. [548] Above, somewhere in the night, she imagined an old man on the cliffs, suddenly feeling his brother's presence after six decades of trying to forget. [572]

The sanctuary filled with sound—waves, screaming, a name called over and over. [584] Then the boy was gone, and the silence that rushed back was different. [597] Emptier. [598] Heavier. [599]

Mara added it to her collection and reached for the next knot, her broken mask reflecting fractured starlight, her restless hands already moving. [620]
