Mira noticed things others didn't—the way the fountain's moss crept higher each week, how the palace walls accumulated another layer of vines each season, the gradual disappearance of neighbors who never quite moved away but simply weren't there anymore. [40] She called it creeping normality, this slow erasure of the world as it had been. [55]

After the birds flew south, leaving the overgrown palace courtyard silent except for wind through broken windows, Mira discovered the tea house. [76] It sat behind a wall of brambles she'd planted herself three autumns ago, part of her guerrilla gardening campaign to green the abandoned royal grounds. [100] The structure was small, traditional, its paper screens somehow intact despite decades of neglect. [115]

Inside, she found ceramic cups arranged on a low table, and beside them, half a loaf of bread. [133]

The bread shouldn't have existed. [138] It came from Demyan's bakery, wrapped in his distinctive blue cloth, still faintly warm. [152] But Demyan's bakery had vanished six months ago—not closed, vanished, the building replaced by a smooth expanse of wall as if it had never interrupted the street's facade. [180]

Mira held the bread with what her grandmother would have called heuristically gentle hands—touching softly, learning through careful exploration rather than force. [202] The crust crackled authentically under her fingers. [210] She tore a piece and tasted it: Demyan's signature rye, dense with caraway seeds. [225]

"You're the one planting everywhere," a voice said. [233]

An old woman sat across the table, though Mira was certain she'd been alone moments before. [249] The woman wore clothes from another era, her hair pinned in a style Mira recognized from palace portraits. [267]

"The gardens bring things back," the woman continued. [276] "Not permanently, but enough. [281] Seeds remember." [283]

Mira understood then. [286] Her guerrilla gardening—scattering seeds in forgotten corners, coaxing life from neglect—wasn't just beautification. [300] It was archaeology, excavation, a method of uncloaking what creeping normality had hidden. [314] Each plant pushed back against forgetting. [321]

"Why the bread?" [324] Mira asked. [326]

"Demyan seeks absolution," the woman said. [333] "Tenuous, perhaps impossible, but he seeks it nonetheless. [342] He knew the palace was being erased and said nothing. [353] Knew the old families were disappearing and kept baking as if everything was normal. [368] Now he's part of what's forgotten, and he offers what he can—sustenance for those still noticing." [385]

Mira thought of all the people she'd watched fade, how she'd convinced herself each disappearance made sense, had an explanation. [405] Her own complicity tasted bitter. [410]

"Is that why I keep planting?" [416] she asked. [418] "For absolution too?" [421]

The woman poured tea that appeared in the pot as she tilted it. [436] "You plant to find the sacred in the ordinary," she said. [449] "You see holiness in persistence, divinity in small acts of creation against erasure. [463] That's different than guilt." [467]

Mira sipped the tea—chrysanthemum, like her grandmother made. [477] Through the screen, she watched her gardens: wild roses climbing columns, sage spreading between paving stones, morning glories threading through iron gates. [498] Each plant was a witness, proof that this place existed, mattered, continued. [512]

"What happens now?" [515] Mira asked. [517]

"You keep planting," the woman said. [524] "The gardens will uncloak more—memories, people, moments preserved in root systems and seed banks. [541] Not everything. [543] Perhaps not enough. [546] But something." [548]

The woman faded like morning mist, and Mira found herself alone with the bread and tea. [565] She wrapped the remaining bread carefully in its blue cloth, tucking it into her gardening bag beside packets of seeds: hollyhock, lavender, thyme, fennel. [589]

Tomorrow she would plant the palace's east wing, where she'd noticed the stonework looked somehow younger each week, as if time moved backward there. [611] She would scatter seeds in cracks and crevices, would water and wait, would notice what emerged. [628]

The sacred in the ordinary. [633] The ordinary against oblivion. [638]

Mira left the tea house as autumn wind scattered leaves across the courtyard, each one a small act of memory, falling and falling into earth that remembered everything. [666]
