The mirror maker's workshop stood where the last apple tree had rotted three generations past, in the ruined orchard district where fog had reigned for two hundred years. [30] Eliane kept her boots planted firmly on the stone floor, her hands steady as she polished another silver-backed glass, because in a place where visibility ended at arm's length, being firmly grounded was the only way to survive. [64]

Upon the shimmer of twilight frost, when ice crystals turned the fog into suspended diamonds, she saw it again. [84] The dream drifted past her window—a translucent shape like blown glass, refracting what little light penetrated the mist into impossible colors. [106] It had escaped from old Gregor the astronomer three nights ago, slipping through his fingers as he died, and now it wandered the fog-choked streets, growing more solid with each hour. [137]

Dreams that escaped their dreamers in this district didn't dissolve. [147] They crystallized, sharp-edged and dangerous as glass mountains, cutting through the fabric between sleep and waking until the boundary disappeared entirely. [169] Already the fog had thickened where the dream passed, and Eliane had glimpsed impossible geometries forming in the mist. [188]

She lifted the astronomer's broken sextant from her workbench. [197] Gregor had brought it to her a week before his death, asking if mirrors could fix what navigation had broken. [217] The instrument's arc was cracked, its mirrors misaligned, but Eliane understood what he'd truly wanted. [232] He'd spent fifty years trying to chart stars he couldn't see through the fog, and his dream had been about boundaries—about erasing the division between hidden sky and shrouded earth. [262]

Now that dream roamed free, and if it fully materialized, it would tear the orchard district apart. [280]

Eliane stepped into the frost-glittering fog, carrying the sextant and seven mirrors of varying sizes. [295] Her breath plumed white and crystalline. [301] She'd learned her craft from her mother, who'd learned from hers—knowledge passed down about how fog and glass shared properties, how mirrors in this district could reflect not just light but intention, memory, longing. [334]

The dream pulsed ahead, a shape like a lighthouse beam refracted through a prism. [349] It was magnificent and terrible, cutting the fog into geometric shards. [360]

Eliane set her mirrors in a circle, angling each to catch the dream's light. [375] Then she raised the broken sextant, peering through its cracked arc at the wandering dream. [390] Through the fractured mirrors, she could see its structure—Gregor's desperate hope given form, his longing to connect earth and unreachable stars. [410]

To capture it, she would need to recreate it first. [421] Not copy it, but understand it so thoroughly that she could forge it anew, contained and harmless. [438]

She began to breathe in rhythm with the dream's pulsing light. [450] Slow inhalation as it brightened, measured exhalation as it dimmed. [461] Through synchronized breathing, her mother had taught her, a mirror maker could attune herself to reflection itself, could become the bridge between what was and what appeared to be. [490]

The dream drifted closer, drawn by her mirrors. [499]

Eliane's breath matched its rhythm perfectly now. [507] She could feel the boundary eroding—between herself and the glass, between the mirrors and the fog, between Gregor's lost dream and her own firm reality. [532] Her hands moved without thought, adjusting mirrors, tilting the sextant, and suddenly she could see what Gregor had seen: the stars were there, had always been there, not above the fog but within it, each droplet of mist a tiny sun. [572]

The dream shuddered, recognizing itself in her recreation. [581]

She breathed out slowly, and the dream followed her breath, condensing, softening, losing its sharp edges. [597] It drifted into the largest mirror, and Eliane tilted the glass horizontal, letting the dream settle into its surface like frost forming on a window. [623]

Captured. [624]

She carried the mirror inside as true darkness fell. [633] In her workshop, by candlelight, she could see the dream preserved in silver and glass—a map of stars hidden in fog, a sextant that measured distance between earth and longing. [665]

Tomorrow she would take it to Gregor's grave in the ruined orchard, where frozen apples still clung to phantom branches in the mist. [688] She would bury the mirror there, returning the dream to the dreamer, boundaries restored. [703]

Tonight, firmly grounded in her workshop, Eliane polished her other mirrors and watched the twilight frost fade from the fog beyond her windows, sharp and beautiful as glass mountains dissolving into memory. [735]
