The glass dome caught the dying sun like a held breath, turning Mara's desert rose farm into an amber sanctuary. [19] Her father stood at the entrance, dust-caked and armed, the bounty hunter's silhouette she'd known her whole childhood. [36] She didn't look up from her work, fingers pressing salvaged fabric into the soil around a particularly stubborn bloom. [54]

"You shouldn't have come," she said, voice carrying that engraved quiet she'd cultivated since the tower fell. [70] The silence here wasn't absence but presence, carved deliberately into every action, every breath. [84]

He stepped inside, and she heard the leather creak of his holster. [97] "The world's gone madder than before," he said. [105] "Thought you might need—"

"I don't." [108] Mara straightened, brushing sand from her palms. [116] The sand came from airship ballast sandbag scraps, torn canvas she'd collected from the wreckage scattered across the wasteland. [134] Each piece had soaked up stories—merchants' routes, cargo manifests, escape trajectories—and she pressed those narratives into the earth like prayers. [153]

Her father's hand hadn't left his weapon. [160] She could feel his restlessness radiating through the dome's carefully balanced atmosphere, disturbing the roses. [174] They leaned away from him, petals curling. [181]

"The plants know," she said softly. [187] "They always know." [190]

He'd never understood her senselessly perceptive nature, the way she could read violence in the angle of a shadow or taste tomorrow's dust storm on her tongue. [214] Logic had nothing to do with it. [222] Her mother used to say she was born listening to frequencies the rest of them had forgotten existed. [239]

"That's foolishness, Mara." [242] But his voice wavered. [246]

"Is it?" [248] She moved to another row, where younger roses pushed through soil mixed with torn canvas and something more—her intention, her values, her belief in continuity woven through catastrophe. [273] "I'm teaching them resilience. [277] Gentleness. [278] How to bloom when everything else demands thorns." [286]

The method sounded absurd when spoken aloud: inculcating plants with values, whispering principles into seeds, embedding ethics into root systems through careful attention and salvaged materials. [309] Yet the roses grew stronger here than anywhere else in the dead lands. [323] People came from settlements days away to trade for her blooms, drawn by flowers that seemed to carry hope in their very cells. [347]

"After the tower fell," she continued, "everyone scattered like they'd forgotten how to be anything but afraid." [363] She touched a blossom, and it opened further beneath her fingers. [375] "Someone has to remember how things connect. [383] How to weave continuity through chaos." [389]

Her father finally moved his hand from his gun. [398] The gesture was small, but in the dome's tranquil blaze—that particular quality of fierce peace she'd created here—it felt enormous. [417] He reached instead for the knife at his belt, that old familiar blade that had opened throats and cut through deception. [438]

Mara tensed. [440]

But he only held it a moment, weight measured in memory, then deliberately moved to sheathe it again. [459] The blade slid home with a whisper of metal on leather. [471]

"Show me," he said roughly. [476]

She blinked, salt-sting surprising her eyes. [483]

"Show me how you do it." [489] He knelt beside her, this man who'd taught her to track, to read blood trails, to calculate the price of human flesh. [510] "Teach me what you're teaching them." [517]

Mara handed him a scrap of ballast canvas, sun-bleached and wind-worn. [528] "Press it into the soil here," she instructed. [537] "Think about what you want to grow instead of what you've harvested." [550]

His scarred hands, steadier than her young ones, pushed the fabric down. [562] She watched him work, this killer learning gentleness one motion at a time. [575]

Outside the dome, the desert stretched toward horizons still choked with debris from the fallen tower. [591] But inside, in this pocket of engraved quiet, a bounty hunter bent over roses while his daughter spoke of roots and values, weaving green continuity from chaos and canvas scraps. [616]

The sun set. [619] The dome glowed. [622] The roses leaned toward them both, learning. [630]
