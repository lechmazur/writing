The dojo floated three thousand feet above what used to be called Montana, tethered to reality by cables that hummed with borrowed physics. [25] Kenji sat cross-legged on the wooden platform, watching his instructor place a glass jar between them. [41] Inside, suspended in amber fluid, a brain pulsed with faint electric light. [53] The label read "DUPLICATE" in his own handwriting. [62]

"Six months since your ego death," Master Yoon said, her voice cutting through his careful composure. [77] "You came here to feel again, but you've built new walls." [88] She gestured to the jar. [93] "This is what the court seized from Chen Industries before the memory transfer." [106] 

Kenji stared at the brain—his brain, grown from his cells, meant to house a copy of his consciousness before he'd volunteered for the experimental dissolution therapy. [132] The therapy had worked too well. [138] His sense of self had shattered, reconstituted, but left him observing his emotions from a distance he couldn't bridge. [155]

"The custody hearing is tomorrow," he said flatly. [163] "They're arguing whether the clone they made before my treatment is legally me or legally my son." [179]

"And you feel nothing about this?" [185] Yoon's question sliced through his pretense like a blade through silk. [197]

Below them, the landscape shifted as the new government's reality engines rewrote the past. [211] Forests became prairies became forests again in stuttering waves. [220] History had become a negotiable thing, facts subject to revision. [231] Only the floating sanctuaries remained anchored, places where memory could still be trusted. [244]

"I should feel something," Kenji admitted. [250] "There's a person who shares my face, my memories up to eighteen months ago, arguing that he deserves my life because I threw mine away." [273] He paused. [275] "The law doesn't know what to do with us." [285]

Yoon lifted the jar, held it to the light. [295] "The old you grew this in secret, planning immortality." [305] She set it down hard enough to make him flinch. [316] "The new you can't even muster anger at the violation." [327]

"I came here to learn to feel," Kenji said. [337] "Instead, I'm learning every meditation technique for maintaining distance." [346]

"Because you're using them wrong." [351] Yoon stood, began moving through a form—sharp angles flowing into curves, hardness into yielding, each position vivifying its opposite. [369] "You think peace means absence of pain. [376] You think enlightenment means transcending emotion. [382] But the method only works through complementary opposites." [390] She spun, her hand stopping an inch from his chest. [401] "Ego death should have taught you: the self you lost and the self you found are both real, both necessary." [420]

Kenji looked at the brain again, this time really seeing it. [432] His clone had been activated with these neurons, given life while Kenji underwent therapy. [445] They'd both emerged changed—one born into absence, one reborn from dissolution. [456]

"He's not my copy," Kenji said slowly, feeling something crack in his chest. [469] "He's my complement." [472]

"Now you're understanding." [475]

The next morning, Kenji stood in the courthouse that floated above what might have been Denver or might have been Kansas—the landscape below couldn't decide. [499] His clone sat across the aisle, wearing the same uncertain expression Kenji recognized from mirrors. [513]

When the judge asked for opening statements, Kenji stood. [522]

"I'd like to withdraw my opposition," he said, and felt his voice shake. [536] Felt it—actually felt the tremor of fear and hope mixing in his throat. [550] "Not because I'm giving up my life, but because I'm claiming a different one." [565] He looked at his clone. [571] "We're not the same person split. [578] We're both real, both necessary. [583] I think we're supposed to figure out how to be brothers." [595]

His clone's eyes widened, and Kenji saw tears forming. [605] He felt answering moisture in his own eyes. [614]

The sensation was overwhelming—grief and joy braided together, ego and emptiness complementing each other into something whole. [630]

Outside, the world rewrote itself again, but inside the floating court, two men who shared everything except their scars began, finally, to vivify each other's humanity. [653]

Master Yoon, watching from the gallery, smiled. [661]

The brain in the jar sat in evidence storage, its label obsolete. [673]

Neither of them was the duplicate. [679]

Both of them were original. [684]

And that paradox, Kenji discovered, was what it meant to feel alive. [697]
