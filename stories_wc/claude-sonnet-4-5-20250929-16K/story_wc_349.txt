The glass orchard library opened its doors to nobody, which was exactly what Mira had hoped to measure. [17] As a clean slate vendor, she understood that beginnings required emptiness first, and this floating repository above the swirling cloud-sea offered the purest void she'd encountered in years. [42] The trees—crystalline structures holding books like luminous fruit—refracted morning light into mindfully scattered patterns across the floor, each beam landing precisely where memory had been deliberately forgotten. [68]

During this lull on opening day, Mira set her case upon the central desk and withdrew her instruments. [87] The bottled moonlight she'd brought wasn't mere decoration; it was calibrated measurement, distilled absence given form. [103] Moonlight, after all, was just reflected glory, the quantified lack of sun—perfect for her work. [119]

She had come seeking the place where stories begin, that threshold between nothing and something. [134] Her clients purchased clean slates believing they'd forget, but Mira knew the deeper truth: you couldn't erase without understanding what had been written first. [157] The library's curator had granted her this morning alone, understanding that a vendor of forgetting might divine the origins of remembering. [177]

Mira uncorked the first bottle and let moonlight spill across the transparent floor. [190] It pooled like mercury, seeking the lowest points, finding the incisions where previous visitors had carved their desperation into glass. [210] The library kept these marks as records—hundreds of tiny cuts spelling out what people needed to forget. [228] Affairs. [229] Betrayals. [230] The faces of children lost. [235] Each groove caught the moonlight differently, and Mira began her work by quantifying absence, measuring the depth and length of each incision to calculate precisely how much story had been removed. [265]

The glimmering parole she offered her clients wasn't freedom from their pasts but release into understanding them. [282] True clean slates didn't erase; they reorganized, redistributed the weight of memory until it could be borne. [300] She had learned this truth floating here among the clouds, where perspective shifted with every wind current, where solid ground was only ever a comforting illusion below. [327]

As she worked, cataloging each carved wound, the books in the crystal trees began to hum. [343] The library was waking, responding to her systematic archaeology of pain. [354] She took her own incising tool—a diamond stylus cold as starlight—and began carving coordinates beside each anonymous confession. [373] Not to deepen the cuts but to map them, creating an index of where each story had begun its unraveling. [394]

The fragments accumulated into pattern. [399] Someone had carved "mother" seventeen times, each instance slightly different, tracking the deterioration of a relationship across years. [417] Another hand had written "home" once, so deeply the glass nearly cracked, a single word containing multitudes. [434] Mira photographed each incision with her moonlight, the liquid luminescence creating perfect negatives, preserving absence as presence. [451]

By noon, the lull would end and visitors would arrive, expecting a library. [464] They would find one, but Mira's catalog would live beneath their feet—a hidden collection of everything people had tried to unmake. [485] This was the place stories began: in the gap between wanting to forget and needing to remember, in the space between the cut and the scar. [512]

She bottled the moonlight again, now clouded with captured grooves and whispers. [524] These samples would return to her workshop where she'd distill them into the clean slates she sold. [542] Each slate would contain trace elements of others' absences, a homeopathic dose of collective forgetting that somehow enabled individual healing. [562]

The crystal trees chimed as the first visitors appeared at the entrance, their footsteps uncertain on the glass. [580] Mira gathered her tools and slipped toward the back exit, her work complete. [593] She had mapped the beginning of stories: they started not with words but with silence, not with presence but with the mindfully scattered pieces of what had been carefully, painfully unmade. [623] The library floated on, and below, the cloud-sea swirled with all the weight the world had learned to release. [643]
