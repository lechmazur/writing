The bloodhound had a name once, but everyone in the scrapyard settlement just called her Finder. [16] For fifteen years before the last resource war ended, she'd tracked bodies through rubble and ash, her intuition reading landscapes like text, intuitively descriptive in every gesture. [42] Now she was retired, living among the twisted metal bones that sprawled across the cracked wasteland, trying to forget what her gifts had shown her. [68]

The phonograph cylinder arrived in a trade caravan, wrapped in oilcloth. [79] Finder recognized it immediately—a relic from before, when people still bothered with music. [92] But something made her pause. [97] The grooves seemed too deliberate, too precise. [104]

She set it spinning on the hand-cranked player she'd salvaged months ago. [116] Static hissed out, then a voice, painting pictures with words: "Where autumn sleeps in amber walls, the first truth waits." [136]

A riddle. [138]

Finder's pulse quickened in the wild hush of her shelter, wind whistling through gaps in the corrugated walls. [156] She knew that voice—Crow, her partner from the war, the one who'd understood distance not as separation but as something to overcome, to translate into closeness. [181] They'd worked side by side, reading the dead, until the final battle scattered everyone like leaves. [197]

She played the cylinder again, listening deeper. [204] Between the words, scratched into the grooves themselves, were other messages—secret texts encoded in the spiral, meant to be read by touch as much as sound. [228] Her fingers traced them, feeling more than seeing. [237] Letters emerged: coordinates, dates, fragments of meaning. [245]

"Where autumn sleeps in amber walls." [251] Finder stood, scanning her collection of salvaged objects. [260] There—a small cube on her shelf, an autumn leaf preserved in wax, its veins still visible through the golden translucence. [280] She'd carried it through the war, a reminder that beauty had existed once. [293]

She held it to the lamplight. [299] Shadows moved through the preserved leaf, and suddenly she saw: the veins formed letters, a map etched in nature's own hand. [319] Tinted revelations—truths colored by the amber medium, visible only when light passed through at the right angle. [336]

The coordinates pointed west, toward the old communications hub. [346]

The journey took three days across the wasteland. [355] Finder moved through the cracked earth like a ghost, her old skills returning. [368] The settlement around the hub was smaller than hers, quieter, built from the bones of satellites and transmission towers. [386]

She found Crow in a shelter constructed from a fallen dish antenna. [398] Older, grayer, but alive. [402]

"You solved it," Crow said, voice rough with disuse. [411] "I've been broadcasting that cylinder for months, hoping someone would trade it your way." [425]

"Why the riddle?" [428] Finder asked, though she already understood. [435]

"Because distance isn't just space," Crow said, pulling out another wax-preserved leaf. [447] "It's time, silence, all the things we couldn't say during the war. [460] I needed to know if you still remembered how to read what others miss." [474]

Finder touched the leaf Crow held—maple, not oak. [483] Together, they would make a pair. [490]

"I spent years finding the dead," Finder said quietly. [499] "I'm ready to find the living now." [507]

They sat in the wild hush of the settlement, two old bloodhounds retired from horror, and began translating the distance between them into something closer. [531] Crow had more cylinders, more riddles—not puzzles to solve, but bridges to build. [545] Each groove held secret texts describing not what was lost, but what remained. [558]

Outside, the wasteland cracked and groaned. [564] Inside, two people who'd learned to read death were learning, slowly, intuitively, to read hope instead. [580]

The autumn leaves in wax glowed on the table between them, preserving not just beauty, but the tinted revelation that even after everything, connection was still possible. [606]

That some distances were meant to be crossed. [614]
