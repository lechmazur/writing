Kaela arrived at the tidal bluff as the aurora bloomed overhead, her feet barely touching the ground in the frictionless world. [21] She had learned to move like the eels she once herded, undulating through space rather than walking, never staying in one place long enough for anyone to find her. [51] Being elusive had become survival after the change, after friction vanished and the world forgot how to hold things together. [71]

The painted rocks waited in her satchel, each one marked with symbols in collapsed star dust she'd harvested from the crater up-coast. [92] The dust glowed faintly purple, a substance from before the change, before the sky cracked open and physics rewrote itself. [112] She'd promised her sister she would understand what happened, decode the patterns that preceded the unraveling, and that promise lingered like the aurora itself—beautiful, untouchable, never quite fading. [139]

But the curse made everything harder. [145] Kaela saw futures branching with every breath, thousands of outcomes flickering behind her eyes. [159] She'd foreseen the tides wrong twice this week, nearly losing her rock collection to the frictionless waters that couldn't grip the shore properly. [182] The visions came faster now, more insistent, as if the universe itself demanded she work quicker. [198]

She knelt on the bluff's edge where the stone held memory of friction, where things still possessed weight if not grip. [218] The eels twisted in the bay below, silver bodies moving in patterns she'd studied for years—sacred geometries that predated human mathematics. [238] They were the only creatures that thrived after the change, their natural slickness now an advantage in a world without resistance. [259]

Kaela began placing the rocks. [264] First, a sequence of primes spiraling outward from a central stone marked with collapsed star dust. [280] The dust responded to mathematical truth; she'd learned that much through months of trial. [294] Then Fibonacci numbers in an arc facing the water, each rock painted with symbols that matched the eels' movement patterns. [313] The aurora pulsed above, its rhythm matching her heartbeat, and she wondered if the light itself was trying to communicate. [332]

A vision struck her: this same bluff, three tides from now, empty. [345] Another: the rocks scattered, patterns incomplete. [351] Another: herself standing here with understanding finally breaking through, tears on her face, knowing it came too late. [369] She shook her head, forcing herself back to the present, to this borrowed dawn where she still had time. [388]

The term felt right—borrowed dawn. [393] Everything since the friction disappeared felt borrowed, temporary, like the world was waiting to decide whether to continue or collapse entirely. [413] The aurora wasn't really dawn, just light pretending at beginning. [424] She was pretending too, pretending she could harness the sacred patterns, that her curse was a gift, that she could fulfill her sister's last request before the ocean took her. [453]

She placed the final rock, completing a sequence that mirrored the constellation overhead, the one that appeared the night friction vanished. [473] The collapsed star dust flared, connecting rock to rock in threads of light. [487] The eels below shifted their pattern, moving into formation. [497] Kaela's curse exploded with visions—futures converging, narrowing to single points of light. [510]

She saw it then: the pattern wasn't about understanding what happened. [522] It was about harnessing what came next. [530] Friction didn't disappear randomly; it was preparation. [538] The sacred patterns the eels followed, the mathematics she'd placed in stone, the collapsed star dust holding remnants of cosmic compression—all of it pointed toward transformation, not ending. [566]

The aurora sang overhead, no longer borrowed but earned. [576] Kaela remained elusive to those who might find her, but she'd found what she sought. [592] Her promise to her sister transformed from burden to blueprint: understand the patterns, yes, but then teach others to move within them. [613] In this frictionless world, the eel herder would show humanity how to swim rather than fall. [630]

She gathered her rocks as the true dawn approached, each stone warm with purpose, and began the undulating journey home. [650]
