The copper veins in Maerith's skin pulsed faintly as she climbed the spiral staircase carved into the tower of bone. [20] The canyon below stretched endlessly, its walls reflecting every sound back and forth until meaning dissolved into pure reverberation. [39] She had lived here for forty-three years, the last speaker of Keshrin, watching her language die one word at a time. [59]

The flawed diamond sat in her palm, no larger than a child's tooth. [72] Through its imperfect crystalline structure ran a crack like a thread, and within that crack, echoes gathered and nested. [90] Other scholars had refused to touch it, whispering that the stone was cursed, that it had driven its previous owners to madness. [110] But Maerith understood what they did not: the flaw was not a weakness but a tunnel, a passageway through which sound could travel in ways the physical world did not allow. [138]

She was quietly articulate by nature, choosing each word with the precision of a jeweler cutting facets. [154] When she spoke Keshrin now, there was no one to answer. [165] Her brother had died last winter. [171] Her daughter spoke only the common tongue, the language of trade and treaties that had swallowed the old ways like a flood consuming a valley. [193]

Maerith's obsession had become singular: to translate texture into sound. [203] If she could learn to harness the diamond's strange properties, she could encode the patterns of her language into physical objects—the grain of wood, the roughness of stone, the smoothness of water-worn glass. [234] These textures, when passed through the diamond's fractured tunnel, would sing in Keshrin. [247] The language would live in the surfaces of the world, waiting for someone to learn how to listen. [265]

She had studied the problem for years, but the breakthrough came from watching birds. [278] A flock of starlings swept past her tower each evening, their formations shifting in patterns that seemed almost linguistic. [296] She began to observe them obsessively, sketching their movements, noting how they flowed around obstacles, how density shifted through the group like meaning moving through a sentence. [321]

The birds taught her that information could move in waves, in clusters, in sudden breaks and reformations. [337] She realized the flawed diamond worked the same way. [346] Sound entering the crack did not simply echo—it scattered and regrouped according to patterns she could learn to predict, even to control. [368]

She held the diamond to her lips and spoke a Keshrin word: "nethara," which meant the particular quality of late afternoon light in autumn. [389] Then she pressed it against the surface of a bone pillar, feeling the microscopic ridges and pores. [406] The diamond hummed. [409] When she withdrew it and held it to her ear, she heard something new—not quite the word she had spoken, but a strange harmonic that carried its essence. [435]

Over the following months, she refined her technique. [443] She learned which textures held which frequencies, how to harness the diamond's tunnel of echoes by angling it precisely, how to encode complex words by combining multiple surfaces. [469] The towers of bone became her library, each surface inscribed with invisible Keshrin through her careful translations. [486]

She knew she would not live to see anyone decode her work. [498] Perhaps no one ever would. [503] But in the canyon of endless echoes, where every sound eventually faded to silence, she had created something different: a language written in the permanent vocabulary of texture, waiting patiently in stone and bone and wind-carved wood. [539]

The cursed diamond had cost her sleep and, some would say, her sanity. [552] But holding it now, watching another flock of birds pattern themselves against the sunset, she felt she had paid a fair price. [573] When Keshrin finally died—when she spoke her last word and no one living understood it—the language would not disappear. [593] It would only change form, becoming something you could touch, something whose meaning lay not in sound but in the subtle geometries of the world's surface, speaking endlessly to anyone patient enough to listen to what the diamond could reveal. [630]

She smiled, her copper veins catching the fading light, and pressed the stone once more against the bone. [647]
