The observatory had stood for centuries, its copper dome green with age, though no astronomer could say exactly when it was built. [23] Mira climbed the spiral stairs each night, her fingers black with the ash she mixed into resin for her mourning jewelry. [48] After Vincent's death, after the creditors, after waking on her sister's couch with nothing but her tools, she had found this place abandoned and claimed it. [76]

The telescope no longer worked, but she didn't need it to. [88] Through the dome's opening, stars fell across her worktable where she shaped grief into wearable art—lockets containing hair, rings with compressed funeral flowers, brooches embedding photographs in amber. [117] Her clients came seeking beauty made from loss, something genuinely artificial: tokens that transformed death into decoration, sorrow into symbol. [137]

Tonight, a new commission waited. [142] The client had left specific instructions folded into an origami crane, along with payment. [157] Inside the paper bird, coordinates were inked in violet: a cemetery plot where a young woman rested. [175] "Make her bloom again," the note read in a mother's desperate hand. [188]

Mira unfolded the tissue-thin vellum the mother had included—a tattoo stencil, delicate as spiderweb. [204] Cherry blossoms curved across the translucent sheet, the design her daughter had planned to wear on her shoulder but never received. [226] The mother wanted the image preserved in a pendant, something to illuminate the darkness of her loss. [244]

This was different from Mira's usual work. [251] She heated her silver carefully, watching metal transform from solid to liquid, then back again into possibility. [269] As she worked, she thought about curtains of intention—how people hung barriers between themselves and their pain, how mourning jewelry was both veil and window. [294]

Her own loss felt distant now, softened by the months of creating for others. [308] Vincent's death had shattered her, yes, but rock bottom had been the month after, when she'd realized she couldn't afford to keep their studio, couldn't maintain the life they'd built. [340] She'd given away their furniture, sold his camera collection, let everything go until even grief felt like a luxury. [360]

The observatory had saved her—this timeless place where past and future collapsed into an eternal present. [377] Here, she'd learned that teaching withering to bloom again meant understanding that transformation wasn't betrayal. [392] Death could become beauty without diminishing loss. [399] Change was the only constant constellation. [405]

She pressed the vellum stencil against warmed silver, watching the image transfer with painstaking precision. [420] The cherry blossoms emerged ghostlike on metal, each petal a small resurrection. [433] Using diamond-tipped tools, she carved along the transferred lines, giving depth to flatness, dimension to memory. [450]

For the background, she mixed the young woman's cremation ash—another element the mother had provided—into clear resin. [468] The mixture turned cloudy, opalescent, like dawn through fog. [478] She poured it behind the silver flowers, sealing the ash between layers of preservation. [493]

As the resin cured, Mira folded her own origami—a lotus this time, its petals revealing the cemetery coordinates and her completion date. [515] She would leave it at the mother's door tomorrow, attached to the finished pendant. [530] This method of communication felt right, origami creatures carrying messages like mechanical birds between grief-stricken souls. [546]

She held the pendant to the starlight streaming through the dome. [558] The silver blossoms seemed to illuminate from within, the ash-infused resin catching celestial light and transforming it into something warmer. [578] Through it, she could see the Pleiades distorted into new constellations, the dead woman's essence filtering reality into beauty. [597]

Mira's subdued ardor for this work—this quiet passion that burned without consuming—had grown strong in the months since her collapse. [617] She understood now that mourning jewelry wasn't about forgetting or replacing. [628] It was about carrying forward, about teaching withering to bloom by showing that death and beauty could occupy the same small space. [650]

She placed the pendant in its velvet box beside the paper lotus. [663] Tomorrow, another mother would open her door to find transformed grief waiting. [676] Tonight, Mira climbed onto the observatory's observation platform, surrounded by her tools and tokens, her honestly artificial resurrections. [695] Above, the stars wheeled through their ancient patterns, and she felt, finally, like she was learning their language. [713]
