The tide had withdrawn hours ago, leaving the grotto exposed beneath an indifferent scatter of stars. [15] Mei crouched at the water's edge, her fingers trailing through a pool no larger than a dinner plate, cataloging the small dramas unfolding there. [37] She had been a tidal-pool chronicler for three decades, documenting the creatures that thrived in these threshold spaces—neither fully ocean nor fully land, existing only in transition. [64]

Her niece Lin sat on a boulder behind her, arms wrapped around her knees, silent. [79] They had been talking before the silence descended, or rather, Lin had been explaining why she was leaving the family's coastal village, and Mei had been failing to understand. [107] Now the pause stretched between them like the exposed sand, vast and uncomfortable. [120]

Mei's notebook lay open beside her, but she wasn't writing. [130] Instead, she watched a hermit crab testing the entrance to a new shell, advancing and retreating, sensing whether this transition would suit it. [152] The warmly observant quality that made her excellent at her work—the patient attention to small gestures, the willingness to wait for meaning to emerge—seemed useless in human conversations. [180]

"There's a jade cicada in my pocket," Lin said suddenly, breaking the silence. [193] "Grandmother gave it to me before she died." [201]

Mei glanced back, surprised. [205] Their grandmother had been a chronicler too, though of stones rather than pools, believing that minerals held time differently than flesh. [225]

"She told me cicadas understand transformation better than any creature," Lin continued. [237] "They wait underground for years, then emerge for a single summer." [248]

Mei turned this information over, approaching it tangentially rather than directly, the way she might circle a skittish octopus. [266] She had learned long ago that you couldn't foresee the shape of understanding by charging straight at it. [284] Truth revealed itself sideways, through patience and peripheral attention. [293]

"Show me," Mei said. [297]

Lin uncurled from the boulder and came to kneel beside her aunt, producing a carved figure no larger than a thumbnail. [318] Even in starlight, the jade gleamed with its own interior weather. [330] Mei held it carefully, feeling the smoothness of its wings, the delicate articulation of its body. [346]

"You think I'm abandoning something," Lin said softly. [354] "By leaving." [356]

"I think," Mei said slowly, still holding the cicada, "that I'm trying to discover the texture of time." [375] She gestured at the pools around them. [383] "These creatures exist in the spaces between. [391] High tide, low tide—they have perhaps six hours before everything changes again. [404] I've spent my life watching how they navigate that." [414]

She handed the jade cicada back to Lin. [423] "But I forgot that humans live in transitions too. [433] You're not leaving something—you're inhabiting the pause between one life and another." [447]

Lin's eyes were bright in the darkness. [455] "Grandmother said you would understand, if I was patient." [465]

"She was wiser than me," Mei admitted. [473] She returned her attention to the hermit crab, which had finally committed to its new shell, settling in with what looked like satisfaction. [496] "I wanted to hold you here, in this moment, as if time were a pool I could chronicle and preserve." [517]

"But that's not how time works," Lin said. [526]

"No." [527] Mei smiled, warmly observant even of her own resistance. [537] "Time moves like tides. [542] And we're all creatures of the threshold, whether we live beside the ocean or not." [558]

They sat together in the ancient grotto, the pause between them transformed now into something else—not absence but presence, not ending but transition. [581] Above them, the stars wheeled in their own vast cycles. [592] Below, in the pools, life prepared for the ocean's return. [603]

"Will you write to me?" [608] Lin asked. [611]

"I'll chronicle your transformations," Mei promised, "the way I chronicle everything that matters." [624]

The tide would turn soon. [630] They could already sense it in the air, in the subtle shift of the water's whisper against stone. [649] But for now, they remained in the pause, learning its particular texture, discovering what could only be understood in the space between. [672]
