The lightning collection tower stood against the amber sky like a skeletal finger, its copper coils still warm from the storm that had passed three days before. [28] Mira had kept the toll gate at its base for seven years, collecting coins from engineers and technicians who climbed the spiral stairs to check the capacitors. [57] It was monotonous work, but she had learned to find beauty in small things: the way light caught in puddles, the geometric shadows the tower cast at different hours. [89]

Since the city-wide blackout, however, few visitors came. [97] The tower had absorbed the lightning as designed, but something in the distribution grid had failed catastrophically, plunging everything into darkness for forty-seven hours. [119] When power finally returned, everyone noticed the silence in the agricultural zones. [131] The drone beehives, those marvels of pollination technology, had not resumed their humming flights. [144]

Mira possessed an unfortunate condition: she was involuntarily truthful. [153] A neural implant gone wrong during childhood meant she physically could not lie, which made social interactions exhausting and had eventually led her to this solitary post. [180] People appreciated honesty in a toll keeper, at least. [190]

On the fourth evening after the blackout, as the sun melted into honey-colored haze, an old woman approached the gate. [209] She wore a beekeeper's veil, anachronistic in an age of automated apiculture. [222]

"The drones won't wake," the woman said. [229] It wasn't a question. [233]

"No," Mira replied, feeling the familiar compulsion to elaborate truthfully. [243] "The engineers say the electromagnetic pulse from the lightning surge corrupted their navigation protocols. [256] They're trying to rewrite the code, but the drones just spin in circles." [269]

The woman nodded slowly. [273] "I kept real bees, before. [279] Do you know why the old hives thrived?" [287]

"I don't." [289] Mira's answer was automatic, honest. [294]

The woman produced a small matchbox from her pocket and slid it across the toll counter. [310] Inside, instead of matches, lay a strip of paper with words in faded ink: "What carries sun without heat, dances without legs, and dies bringing forth life?" [336]

Mira read it three times, the riddle settling into her mind like sediment. [349] "I don't understand," she admitted, because she had to. [359]

"You will," the woman said, and pressed a lacquer box into Mira's hands. [372] Its surface was decorated with painted bees and flowers, the craftsmanship exquisite. [384] "Open it when you solve the riddle. [391] Take it to the engineers. [396] Tell them truth they've forgotten." [401]

After the woman left, Mira sat in her booth as twilight deepened, turning the matchbox riddle over in her mind. [420] Carries sun without heat. [424] Dances without legs. [427] Dies bringing forth life. [431]

Then, in a moment of clarity as golden light touched the lacquer box, she understood: pollen. [447]

Her hands trembled as she opened the box. [455] Inside, nested in silk, lay tiny glass vials filled with pollen from a dozen plant species, and beneath them, a handwritten note explaining the old symbiosis. [482] Real bees had never just followed programs—they had learned, adapted, communicated through their waggling flights. [497] They had carried the living dust of flowers, each grain unique, coating their bodies with the chaos of natural variation. [518]

The drone beehives had failed because they had been designed for perfect efficiency, not for the messy miracle of actual pollination. [539]

Mira closed the toll gate and climbed the lightning collection tower's stairs, the lacquer box held carefully. [555] At the top, she found the head engineer staring at lines of failing code. [569]

"I know what's wrong," Mira said, and the truth spilled out of her like honey. [585] She revealed everything: the riddle, the pollen, the forgotten knowledge that wonder and imperfection were not inefficiencies to be coded away, but the very essence of life's persistence. [613]

The engineer listened, and in her eyes, Mira saw the same thing she had been preserving in herself all along—the capacity to be amazed by what should have been obvious. [642]

By the next nectar-colored dusk, modified drones dipped and wandered through fields with new randomness in their flight paths, dusted with real pollen, finally dancing like the living things they had tried to replace. [675]
