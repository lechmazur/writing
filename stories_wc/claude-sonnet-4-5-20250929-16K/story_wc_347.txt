The orchard clung to the cliffside like a desperate memory, its gnarled trees bearing fruit that screamed when picked. [19] Maren had inherited this cursed place from an aunt she'd never met, along with the obligation to tend it until someone else could be fooled into taking over. [48] She hated every twisted branch, every path that reformed itself into new configurations each dawn, creating a labyrinth that even she sometimes couldn't navigate. [73] The mechanical birds her aunt had constructed—or summoned, the distinction seemed irrelevant—clicked and whirred overhead, their brass wings catching the late afternoon light as they patrolled their predetermined routes with offhandedly exact precision, never deviating by even a single wingbeat. [114]

Today, though, Maren had found something that changed everything: a small nut, no larger than her thumbnail, wedged in the bark of the oldest tree. [139] When she'd pried it loose, engravings had appeared on its surface—microscopic lines forming what looked like architectural plans. [159] A forgotten blueprint, she realized, squinting at the impossibly detailed etchings. [170] Not for the orchard itself, but for something within it. [181] A way through. [185]

She heard the cry before she saw them—three hikers stumbling between the trees, their faces scratched and bewildered. [203] The labyrinth had caught fresh victims. [210] Maren's chest tightened with the familiar, unwelcome weight of responsibility. [221] This was why she couldn't leave, not really. [230] The curse demanded a caretaker not just for the trees but for the lost souls who wandered into their maze. [250] Her aunt's final cruelty: binding Maren's conscience to this place by giving her the motivation to guide lost travelers to safety, knowing she'd never abandon them. [276]

"Don't move," she called out, studying the blueprint-nut in her palm. [288] The engravings showed how to assemble something—not physically, but conceptually. [299] A path made of intention rather than stone. [308]

The mechanical birds descended, circling the hikers with menacing curiosity. [318] Maren had perhaps an hour before the night frost formed, when the orchard's curse strengthened and the trees began their feeding. [339] She'd seen what happened to those who stayed after dark—their graceless beauty as they transformed into new trees, mouths open in eternal silent warnings. [363]

She held the nut between her fingers and began walking, leaving impressions without touching the ground itself—her aunt's final teaching, the only one that mattered. [389] Each footfall hovered a breath above the earth, her weight distributed through pure will into the air around her. [409] The blueprint showed her where to step, which angles created resonance with the labyrinth's hidden geometry. [425]

As she moved, the paths responded. [432] Not shifting their physical stones, but revealing routes that had always existed between the visible trails. [449] The mechanical birds adjusted their patrol patterns, creating corridors of safety through their absence. [463]

"Follow exactly where I've walked," Maren instructed the hikers. [473] "Step where the air feels warm." [480]

They obeyed, sensing the urgency in her voice. [489] She led them through impossible turns, past trees that reached with hungry branches, under archways of thorn that somehow never quite scratched. [511] The nut grew warm in her hand, its blueprint burning itself into her memory. [526]

Finally, they reached the outer edge where the curse weakened and normal cliff paths resumed. [542] The hikers stumbled forward into mundane reality, already forgetting the exact configuration of their terror. [558]

Maren turned back to her prison, to her purpose. [568] The small nut had crumbled to dust in her palm, its knowledge now permanently etched in her mind. [586] She understood now: her aunt hadn't trapped her here out of spite. [599] Someone had to know the true paths, had to be able to assemble safe passage from invisible architecture. [618] Someone had to stay. [623]

The mechanical birds settled into the branches above, their clicking a kind of applause. [638] Tomorrow more would come, and she would guide them through. [650] The orchard's curse was also its strange gift—the ability to save those who wandered into beautiful, graceless danger. [670]

Maren walked back into the labyrinth as dusk approached, finally understanding what it meant to be chosen. [688]
