Miriam's fingers trembled as she traced the latest curve in her notebook, another impossible angle that shouldn't exist in three dimensions. [20] The living bridge garden sprawled before her, its ancient root-woven spans connecting islands of carefully sculpted hedges across pools of still water that reflected not sky but memory. [47] She had been the garden's maze designer for seven years before the retrognition began—before the past started bleeding through like watercolor on wet paper. [73]

Now she experienced yesterday, last month, centuries ago, all at once. [84] The condition had no name in medical texts, this being retrocognitively trapped, watching history flicker across her present vision like fading photographs left too long in sunlight. [110] She saw the garden's original architect planting the first willows; she saw lovers meeting in her maze's heart during some forgotten spring; she saw her own hands from three years ago, still steady, still certain. [143]

The photographs themselves lay scattered across her worktable in the garden's center pavilion, each one growing paler by the day. [164] They showed her maze designs from every angle, but something was happening to them that shouldn't be possible—they were losing not just color but dimensionality, as if the images were retreating into some plane beyond mere flatness. [199] Miriam had begun to understand that time had texture, that it could be felt, folded, perhaps even cut if one knew where to press. [224]

That's why she had devoted herself to hyperbolic geometry. [233] The mathematics of curved space, of saddle-point surfaces where parallel lines diverged infinitely—this was the language time spoke when it dreamed. [256] Her latest maze design incorporated these principles, pathways that seemed to double back but actually spiraled through dimensions the eye couldn't quite parse. [278] Walking it induced vertigo, a sense of moving through more than just space. [291]

She found the halo fragment on a Tuesday that felt like Thursday, embedded in the roots of the oldest bridge. [310] It was no larger than her thumb, crystalline and gently luminous, curved as if it had once encircled something divine or at least other. [332] When she lifted it, the retrocognitive visions intensified—she saw the fragment whole, saw it shatter, saw the moment of its shattering repeat and repeat like a scratched record of catastrophe. [361]

Miriam carried the fragment into her hyperbolic maze, driven by her deepest motivation: to discover the texture of time itself, to run her fingers along its weave and understand whether it was silk or burlap, whether it could tear. [397] The hedges rose around her in their impossible curves, and the fading photographs in her pocket seemed to pulse with heat. [418]

As she reached the maze's center, where the geometry folded most intensely back upon itself, she held the halo fragment up to the light. [441] The quaking reverie that had haunted her for months reached a crescendo—past and present vibrated in the same space, occupying the same moment, and she understood suddenly that she had designed this maze as a kind of lens. [478]

The photographs began to disintegrate in her pocket, not rotting but unbecoming, their molecules forgetting how to cohere. [497] The fragment in her hand grew warm, then hot, and through it she could see time's true texture: not linear but recursive, not smooth but fractured into infinite self-similar patterns. [527] Hyperbolic geometry hadn't just described her maze—it had described reality's deep structure, the way moments nested within moments like infinite regress. [548]

Miriam felt herself coming untethered, her own edges beginning to disintegrate. [559] But there was no fear, only reverence. [566] The living bridge garden around her seemed to breathe, its roots and spans restructuring according to principles she had mapped in hedge and path. [589] She had discovered what she sought: time felt like standing in a doorway between two mirrors, infinite corridors of self and shadow extending forever in both directions, each reflection slightly different, each one true. [621]

The halo fragment flared once, brilliant and complete, before dissolving into light. [633] Miriam dissolved with it, not dying but dispersing, becoming part of the garden's memory, another fading photograph that would haunt some future designer who dared to map the unmappable. [661]

The maze remained, its hyperbolic pathways still teaching their impossible lesson to anyone brave enough to walk them. [679]
