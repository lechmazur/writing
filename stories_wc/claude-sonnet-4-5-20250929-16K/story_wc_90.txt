The Meridian had been cobbled together from seventeen derelict vessels, its hull a patchwork quilt of salvaged titanium and prayer. [20] Ren moved through its corridors with ghostly resolve, each step deliberate, each breath measured. [34] They had been the ship's keeper for sixty-three years—since the last human was born, a child who would never grow old in the way their ancestors had. [62]

The photographs covered the recreation bay's walls like scales on a fish. [74] Ren had collected them from every abandoned station, every drifting habitat: images of faces that once held laughter, anger, fear, love. [94] Under the recycled ship's pale bioluminescent strips, something glimmered on these photographs—the faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded surfaces, salt crystals catching light like tiny galaxies. [119]

This was shadow work, Ren knew. [125] Confronting what they had fled from for decades: their own cowardice, their steadfast pacifism when action might have mattered. [143] They had watched humanity contract, fold inward, dimension by dimension, until only this thin membrane of reality remained. [160] And they had done nothing but bear witness, refusing to raise their hand in violence even as everything dissolved. [178]

The Kwan Yin's Tear hung at their throat—a jade pendant containing a single drop of water that never evaporated, never froze. [199] Legend claimed it was a gift from the Bodhisattva herself, distilled compassion made physical. [213] Ren didn't know about that, but they knew it grew warm when they faced their darkness honestly. [229]

Today they would stitch. [233]

Ren had discovered the strange physics of their own grief months ago: when happiness touched them, even briefly, their body became gravitationally lighter. [255] Joy made them float. [259] It seemed cruel, this inversion—that the memories which should anchor them instead sent them drifting toward the ceiling, untethered. [277] But they had learned to use it. [284]

They began with a photograph of their sister, dead now for a hundred years. [298] The tear-shimmer at its corner glowed faintly in the dim light. [310] Ren touched it with one finger, and suddenly they were there: in that moment of grief, whoever had wept over this image. [331] The sorrow was a thread, and Ren began to stitch it to their own. [347]

The needle was silver, fine as spider silk. [355] They pulled the emotion through, connecting their grief to the stranger's, that stranger's to another's, following the constellation of dried tears from photograph to photograph. [377] Each stitch was an acknowledgment: I see you. [385] I see what was lost. [390] I carry it too. [394]

As they stitched, something shifted. [399] The photographs began to ripple like water, and behind them, Ren glimpsed something vast and dark—the locked dimension where humanity had retreated, or been pulled, or had chosen to go. [427] The place beyond this last thin reality. [434]

Their heart lifted. [437] Not with joy, exactly, but with something close: recognition. [447] And immediately, Ren's feet left the floor. [455] They rose slowly, still stitching, their body responding to that flicker of hope by defying gravity itself. [471]

"I will not fight you," Ren whispered to the locked dimension, to the darkness, to their own shadow. [488] "But I will not abandon you either." [495]

The Kwan Yin's Tear blazed hot against their chest. [504]

With the final stitch, the photographs tore open like paper, revealing not emptiness but fullness—a space crowded with presence, with the weight of everyone who had passed beyond. [530] Ren pushed at the membrane with both hands, their body now so light they were nearly translucent. [548]

The dimension resisted. [551] It had been locked for good reason, sealed against the violence and chaos of the old world. [568] But Ren was no warrior forcing entry. [575] They were a pacifist, arriving with compassion's key, with the stitched-together grief of a species, with shadow work finally, painfully completed. [595]

The lock recognized them. [599]

The dimension opened. [602]

And Ren, weightless with something like joy, something like peace, passed through to bring the lost ones home. [620]
