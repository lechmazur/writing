The alchemist's market sprawled across suspension bridges and platforms strung between the city's tallest spires, where vendors sold bottled starlight and crystallized memories to those who knew how to look. [30] Mira had spent the years between childhood and now learning to see what others missed, which was why the Guild had trained her as a between-worlds translator—someone who could read the languages that existed in the spaces where realities touched. [68]

She moved through the crowded walkways with practiced ease, her fingers trailing along vendor stalls until they found what her intuition promised would be there: a lighthouse lens fragment no larger than her palm, its surface etched with symbols that flickered between visibility and absence. [109] The merchant, an old woman with copper-streaked hair, smiled knowingly. [120]

"You feel it, don't you?" [125] the woman said. [128] "The way it pulls at something deeper than sight." [137]

Mira nodded, turning the fragment in the late afternoon light. [147] It was elusively tangible—solid glass that somehow felt like it might dissolve into pure concept if she stopped paying attention. [167] She'd been searching for artifacts like this for months, ever since discovering that her grandmother had been erased from the official records of the Guild's founding. [193]

"How much?" [195] Mira asked. [197]

"For you, translator, nothing." [201] The merchant leaned closer. [205] "Your grandmother sold it to me thirty years ago, made me promise to return it to family who would understand its purpose." [227]

Mira's throat tightened. [230] She'd found scattered references to her grandmother's work—a pioneer who believed translation wasn't just about words but about recovering lost connections between worlds, about honoring overlooked histories that the Guild deemed too dangerous or inconvenient to preserve. [262]

Back in her workshop, Mira placed the lens fragment on her desk beside three paintings she'd acquired over the past year. [283] Each depicted the same lighthouse from different angles, painted by different artists across a century. [298] To casual observers, they were merely coastal scenes. [306] But Mira had learned her grandmother's method: translation through hidden details in paintings, where artists unconsciously recorded the echoes of between-world phenomena. [328]

She held the lens fragment up to the first painting. [338] Through its distorted glass, new layers emerged—symbols painted in pigments that existed only at the edge of perception, anchors of intuition that her grandmother had embedded as a map for those who would follow. [370]

Mira worked through the night, unfastening each hidden layer from its camouflage, copying the symbols into her notebook. [387] The paintings revealed coordinates, not in space but in the layered geography of overlapping realities. [403] Places where forgotten histories had been deliberately severed from the present, cut away by Guild authorities who preferred clean narratives to complicated truths. [427]

The final painting showed the lighthouse keeper—her grandmother's face unmistakable despite the artist having never known her name. [445] Behind her, rendered in those elusively tangible pigments visible only through the lens, stood dozens of other translators, their work attributed to others or simply deleted from records. [471]

Mira felt suspended in an eternal instant, that crystallized feeling where past and future collapsed into a single point of understanding. [492] Her grandmother hadn't just hidden a map; she'd created a method for recovery, a way to restore what had been taken. [513]

She began drafting her presentation to the Guild Council. [523] They wouldn't be able to deny the evidence she'd gathered, the proof that their foundation story was incomplete. [541] More importantly, she now possessed her grandmother's technique—a way to find and restore other overlooked histories, other voices that deserved to be heard across the boundaries between worlds. [569]

As dawn broke over the suspended market outside her window, Mira understood that translation had never been just about converting one language to another. [591] It was about insisting that every voice mattered, that nothing truly disappeared as long as someone remembered how to look. [611]

The lens fragment caught the morning light, and for a moment, Mira could have sworn she saw her grandmother's reflection smiling back—elusively tangible, like everything worth finding. [637]
