Mara pressed her palm against the greenhouse glass, watching silver fruit bloom backward through time. [14] She was the bewildered curator of the Hesperides Archive, keeper of the astral orchard blossoming on this lonely asteroid at the universe's forgotten edge. [36] Three weeks managing the collection, and she still couldn't predict which trees would bear yesterday's fruit or tomorrow's seeds. [54]

The inheritance here was simply complicated—that phrase the previous curator had scrawled across seventeen margins before disappearing. [71] Properties passed from parent to offspring, yes, but also from offspring to parent, and sideways through branches that existed in different decades simultaneously. [93] An apple fallen today might plant the tree that bore it ten years ago. [108] Mara's head ached constantly with the logic. [116]

She found the pistachio shell cameo blank wedged between two volumes in the restricted section. [131] It was impossibly thin, pale green, small enough to fit on her thumbnail. [145] Someone had begun carving a face into it but stopped halfway, leaving a profile caught between existence and absence. [164] The catalog listed it only as "Artifact 77: Do Not Inquire." [177]

But pursuing forbidden knowledge was precisely why Mara had accepted this position. [189] Back on the stations, she'd been dismissed from three universities for asking questions about temporal causality that made her professors uncomfortable. [209] Here, questions were currency. [213] Here, the trees grew in spirals. [220]

That evening, she retreated to the station's small bathroom, the only place the humming of the time-twisted trees couldn't reach. [241] She'd discovered that philosophical breakthroughs came easier in bathrooms—something about the white tiles and flowing water quieted the chaotic inheritance patterns enough to think. [265] She held the cameo blank under the fluorescent light. [275]

What if the unfinished carving was the point? [284] What if it was meant to be completed by someone who hadn't been born yet, or who had died centuries ago? [306] What if she was simply the custodian between the first and last page of its story, neither author nor reader, just the one holding it in this particular moment? [337]

Mara returned to the orchard at midnight, when the asteroid's rotation brought them facing the distant ribbon of the galaxy. [357] The trees glowed with brightened disquiet, their fruit luminous with contained unease. [370] Beautiful and wrong, hopeful and haunted. [377] She understood that feeling. [381]

She began to inquire systematically, checking each tree's documentation against the physical reality before her. [397] A pomegranate tree bore fruit that remembered being picked by hands that wouldn't exist for another generation. [415] A fig tree's roots reached toward a sun that had died before the asteroid was formed. [433] The inheritance moved in spirals, not lines. [441]

Then she saw it—one tree at the orchard's heart had no documentation at all. [457] Its bark was carved with symbols in the same incomplete style as the cameo blank. [473] Mara approached slowly, her breath forming crystals in the thin atmosphere of the dome. [489]

She pressed the pistachio shell against the tree's trunk. [499] It fit perfectly into a gap in the carvings, and suddenly Mara understood. [513] The knowledge bloomed through her in reverse, from conclusion to premise. [526] The cameo wasn't unfinished—it was the beginning of something that would be completed by passing through this tree, through her, through time itself. [552]

She was simply a page in a book being written non-chronologically. [565] The previous curator hadn't disappeared; he had inherited himself backward into his own grandfather, teaching himself the questions he would later ask. [589]

Mara carved her name into the tree beneath the empty socket, then placed the cameo back in the archive. [609] Someone between the first and last page would need it next. [621] Perhaps it would be her, in a version of herself she was still growing toward. [638]

The trees continued their backward blossoming, and Mara, no longer quite so bewildered, continued her curation. [655] The forbidden knowledge sat quiet in her chest now, patient as a seed waiting for the right time to sprout. [676] Or the right time that had already passed. [685] In nonlinear inheritance, she was learning, there was no difference. [697]

She returned to the bathroom, smiled at her reflection, and understood at last why she looked familiar. [715] She had her grandfather's eyes—the grandfather she would inherit herself into becoming. [729] Simply complicated, perfectly impossible, and blooming with brightened disquiet under the asteroid's eternal stars. [744]
