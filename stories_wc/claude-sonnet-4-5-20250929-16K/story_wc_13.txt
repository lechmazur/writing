The natural history illustrator pulled her gondola through the rooftop canal, water barely rippling in the suspended quiet. [17] Mira had documented countless phenomena—storm beetles, crystalline moss, spiral-finned fish—but never this. [30] Never the origin of echoes themselves. [36]

Her infinity symbol pendant hung cold against her chest, its weight reminding her of the bargain she'd made. [53] Time-sculpting was forbidden in most districts, but up here, between the sleeping towers, rules dissolved like morning fog. [70]

The giant's nap had begun three hours ago, would last perhaps six more. [83] During those precious hours, the city transformed. [90] Canals materialized on rooftops, connecting spires that normally stood isolated. [100] Gravity loosened its grip. [104] And sounds—sounds behaved strangely. [108]

Mira had first noticed it while sketching a nest of wind-sparrows. [119] Their calls didn't simply bounce back from tower walls. [128] The echoes arrived in interrupted cadence, breaking apart and reassembling in patterns that shouldn't exist. [142] Some echoes returned before the original sound finished. [150] Others arrived days late, their voices aged and weather-worn. [159]

She'd spent months tracing these temporal disruptions, mapping them in her journals between anatomical studies of impossible creatures. [176] Every pattern led here—to the Throat, a narrow channel where five towers leaned together, nearly touching. [192]

The water ahead grew turbulent. [197] Mira shipped her oar and let momentum carry her forward. [207] Around her, the borrowed time she'd collected hummed in the air like trapped insects. [221] She'd taken seconds from hatching eggs, from sunset's lingering, from the pause between heartbeats. [235] Small thefts, carefully noted. [239] She would return them, eventually. [244]

The pendant warmed. [247] Mira touched it, felt time itself become malleable beneath her fingers—thick as honey, thin as wire. [263] She shaped it carefully, creating a bubble of accelerated moments around her gondola. [276] Outside her sphere, water froze mid-ripple. [283] Inside, she moved freely. [287]

The Throat narrowed. [290] Here, suspended between the towers, hung cages. [298] Dozens of them, iron and brass and stranger metals. [307] They swayed without wind, filled with captured sounds. [315] Mira heard crying, laughing, whispered secrets, the crack of breaking glass. [326] Each sound trapped mid-expression, unable to complete its journey into echo. [337]

This was it. [340] Echoes weren't born from surfaces or distance. [347] They were born from completion—from sound finally released to find its reflection. [359] These cages prevented that birth, hoarding original sounds, leaving the world full of echoes searching backward for sources that couldn't answer. [379]

Mira released her time-bubble and reached for the nearest cage. [389] The lock was temporal, not mechanical. [395] She pressed her pendant against it, borrowing seconds from the cage's own future, aging the lock until it crumbled to rust. [414]

The cage door swung open. [419]

A child's laugh escaped, decades old but fresh. [427] It raced forward and backward simultaneously, finally free to complete its interrupted cadence. [439] Mira heard it echo properly for the first time—not bouncing back, but answering itself, harmonizing across the space between was and will be. [462]

She moved faster, uncaging sound after sound. [469] The air filled with temporal music, with the pure mathematics of completion. [481] Her pendant grew hot, then cold, then both at once. [492] The borrowed time she carried flowed out freely, a fair exchange—seconds for songs, moments for memories. [508]

The giant would wake soon. [513] The canals would drain back into possibility. [521] But Mira had found it, had documented it in her journal with precise sketches and careful notes. [537] The birthplace of echoes wasn't a place at all, but a moment—the instant when sound learned it wasn't alone. [556]

She turned her gondola back toward the sleeping city, her pendant cool and quiet again. [570] Behind her, between the towers, freed sounds danced in interrupted cadence, each one teaching others the ancient art of answering. [588]

The echo of her oar striking water returned to her before she'd finished the stroke, welcoming her home. [605]
