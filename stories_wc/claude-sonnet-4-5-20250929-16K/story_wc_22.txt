The coachman from Gloom Hill arrived at the blooming jetty as twilight stained the horizon purple, his weathered hands clutching a leather satchel filled with dried seed pods. [29] No one hired coaches anymore, not since the great reef died and the coastal roads crumbled into the advancing sea. [50] But Erasmus had never been an ordinary coachman—he had driven passengers between words, between the living and the silent, interpreting the calls of cormorants and terns to navigate routes no map could show. [83]

The jetty stretched into waters that had swallowed the old battlefield three seasons past, its pilings now wrapped in morning glory and wild clematis that bloomed ceaselessly in the strange new climate. [113] Where cannons had thundered, only the narrow vastness remained—that peculiar emptiness that feels both confined and infinite, like staring into a keyhole that opens onto an ocean. [140]

Erasmus knelt at the jetty's edge, where wood met water, and opened his satchel. [154] The seed pods rattled like oracle bones—lupine, columbine, bleeding heart, and species whose names existed only in languages dead for centuries. [175] He had spent years collecting them from abandoned gardens, translating their botanical names from Etruscan, from Linear A, from the lost tongue of the reef people who once sang to the coral below. [209]

A pelican landed nearby, issuing its guttural croaking call. [218] Erasmus tilted his head, listening to the rhythm and pitch. [228] "The currents have shifted," he murmured in response, though whether in English or some older language, he couldn't say. [246] "The salt content drops near the memorial stones." [254]

He had learned this method from his grandmother, who had learned it from the reef people before the warming took them. [273] Birds spoke in patterns—not words, but truths about wind, water, and the hidden architecture of the world. [291] They knew where soil had settled over sunken armor, where fresh water seeped up through dead men's graves, where life might take root again. [313]

A gull's cry drew his attention westward. [320] Erasmus stood and walked along the jetty, scattering seeds as he went, pressing some into crevices where soil had accumulated. [339] The birds had told him about nitrogen pockets, about where the bodies had enriched the sediment. [355] To fertilize this place properly, he needed to understand what the battlefield had become beneath the waves—a submerged concord between violence and dissolution, where weapons rusted into nutrients and bones became calcium for new growth. [389]

The sun touched the waterline, igniting the blooms that already claimed the jetty in shades of amber and rose. [408] Erasmus spoke to them in Sumerian, telling them to grow strong, to send roots deep into the waterlogged soil where soldiers had fallen. [430] The words felt appropriate—Sumerian gardeners had also known war, had also watched cities sink beneath the Euphrates. [448]

Another call—a heron this time, standing in the shallows. [458] Its message was clear: the tide would be low tomorrow, exposing new ground. [472] Erasmus made a mental note to return with bulbs, with tubers that could survive periodic flooding. [489]

He worked until full darkness, guided by memory and the voices of night birds. [503] The last of his seed pods went into a gap between planks where a cluster of barnacles had died, leaving a small hollow of possibility. [528]

As he prepared to leave, an owl's hunting call drifted across the water. [541] In its modulation, Erasmus heard something unexpected—a pattern that meant "remembering" in the clicks and whistles the reef people had used. [563] Perhaps some intelligence remained in this place, some consciousness in the accord between land and sea. [579]

The coachman from Gloom Hill shouldered his empty satchel and walked back toward shore, leaving the blooming jetty to its work. [599] By next spring, he thought, the garden would reach the water's surface, and the battlefield would be remembered only as the place where beauty learned to swim. [627]
