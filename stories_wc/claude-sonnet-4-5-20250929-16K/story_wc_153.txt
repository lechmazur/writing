The mangrove roots twisted like frozen thoughts, and between them, the spirits sang their endless harmonies. [16] Isla navigated by their voices, clutching the bundle of unsent letters against her chest, each one written to her sister during the five years since their silence began. [45]

The medium's dwelling appeared where two massive mangroves had grown together, forming a natural arch. [60] Moonlight filtered through the canopy, turning the brackish water silver. [71] The woman who emerged wore shells in her hair and eyes that seemed to look through time itself. [90]

"You seek the moment before deciding," the medium said, not asking. [101] Her voice carried the same layered quality as the spirits' songs. [112] "The instant before words became weapons." [118]

Isla's throat tightened. [121] "I want to find when I could have apologized instead of—" [133]

"The space where an apology waits unspoken is not a place of absence." [147] The medium extended her palm, revealing a jagged piece of stone, ancient and water-worn. [161] "It's where everything still trembles with possibility. [168] This is a gargoyle's rainspout shard, broken from a cathedral that stood for eight hundred years. [184] It remembers every storm, every prayer whispered in rain." [193]

The singing spirits grew louder, their melodies wrapping around Isla's ribs like gentle hands. [206]

"Your letters," the medium said, gesturing to the bundle. [215] "They're portals. [217] Each one holds the ghost of what you meant to send." [228] She took them with surprising tenderness, spreading them across a window frame that hung suspended between two mangrove trunks, facing the moon. [249]

As moonlight struck the glass, condensation began to form, and within it, words appeared—not Isla's writing, but her sister's. [268] *I miss you too. [272] I was also afraid.* [276]

"The shard," the medium murmured, pressing the gargoyle fragment against one of Isla's unsent letters. [290] "It heals in moonlight. [294] Not bodies—moments. [296] It can evoke what was never quite lost." [304]

Isla watched as the stone began to glow softly, and suddenly she was standing in her sister's kitchen three years ago, the moment hanging crystalline and perfect. [329] Her sister was turning toward her, mouth opening to speak, and Isla felt the fury rising in her own chest, the defensive words already forming. [353]

But now she could see what she'd missed: her sister's hands trembling, the desperate hope in her eyes, the way she was leaning forward like someone reaching across an abyss. [381]

"This is where you chose," the medium's voice said, though she wasn't visible in this memory-space. [396] "Watch." [397]

Time slowed. [399] Isla saw herself open her mouth, saw the exact instant before the cruel words emerged. [413] The space was so small—a single breath, a heartbeat—but infinite with possibility. [426]

"Can I change it?" [430] Isla whispered. [432]

"You already are." [435] The medium's hand touched her shoulder, and Isla was back in the mangrove labyrinth, moonlight streaming down. [451] The window's condensation now showed new words forming in wet trails across the glass: *I'm sorry. [467] I should have listened.* [471]

But they appeared in Isla's own handwriting. [478]

"Your sister wrote to you too," the medium said softly, producing another bundle of letters from within her shells and fabric. [498] "Unsent letters find their way here eventually. [505] The spirits collect them, singing their contents into the roots." [515]

Isla took them with shaking hands, reading words of regret and love that mirrored her own. [530]

The gargoyle shard pulsed with lunar light between them, and the medium closed Isla's fingers around it. [546] "The moment before deciding never truly passes. [553] It lives in every moment after, waiting to be chosen again." [564] Her eyes were fierce now, blazing with an intensity that held both challenge and absolute protection. [579] "Go to her. [582] The apology isn't waiting unspoken—it's speaking itself through you right now, has been speaking all along through your longing." [601]

The singing spirits crescendoed, their voices forming a luminous path through the labyrinth back toward the living world. [618]

Isla clutched the letters—both sets—and the healing shard, and ran toward reconciliation, toward the fierce tenderness that had survived everything, even silence. [639]

Behind her, the medium smiled and faded back into moonlight and mangrove shadows, leaving only the spirits' song and the messages still forming in condensation on the hanging window, blessings for the journey home. [670]
