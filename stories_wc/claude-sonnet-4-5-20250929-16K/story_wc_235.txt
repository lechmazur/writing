The birch bark scroll curled at its edges, brown and brittle as October. [13] Mara held it to the lamplight in the ranger cabin, squinting at her own handwriting from—when? [29] Three years ago, or was it next week? [37] Time had become a tangled fishing line, and she'd stopped trying to unsnarl it. [51]

She was a lucid dream chronicler by trade, or perhaps by curse. [63] Before the confusion set in, she'd documented hundreds of controlled dreams for the university's consciousness studies program. [79] Now she lived alone at eight thousand feet, in a cabin that smelled of pine sap and old smoke, recording only for herself. [101]

The scroll described a dream where she'd soared above these same mountains, younger, her body still trusting altitude. [119] In that dream-memory, she'd laughed. [125] Actually laughed. [127] The woman who'd written this scroll had been someone else entirely—someone who believed documentation mattered, who thought consciousness could be mapped like terrain. [148]

Mara felt the familiar bite of jealousy reading it. [157]

Her past selves haunted her more than any ghost could. [167] They were competent, hopeful, untouched by the knowledge that would fragment her. [179] She envied the Mara of five years ago, who'd never hiked to the old cemetery in the valley. [197] Who'd never seen the weathered headstone with her own name, her own birth year, and a death date still three months away—or three months ago, depending on which thread of time she pulled. [230]

The ranger station radio crackled with distant voices, but she ignored it. [242] She had one purpose left: to distill chaos into narrative, to make the impossible progression of her days mean something on paper. [263] If she could just document enough, perhaps a pattern would emerge. [275] Perhaps she'd understand why time folded around her like origami, why her dreams bled into waking, why she'd buried herself in the valley. [297]

Or would bury herself. [301] Or was being buried, in some eternal present tense. [311]

She uncurled a fresh strip of birch bark—she preferred it to paper now, something about its organic memory felt appropriate. [330] Her pen hovered. [333] What came next? [336] This morning she'd woken on the cabin floor, tasting copper and mountain air. [349] Yesterday—or tomorrow—she'd watched herself sleeping from the ceiling corner, untethered. [361] Last week she'd soared again in a dream so lucid it left her regular life feeling like the fantasy. [380]

That was the trouble with feral nostalgia: it made you rabid for moments you couldn't re-enter. [396] Wild with wanting what you'd already lost, or hadn't yet found. [407] She craved the innocence of her earlier chronicling days with an animal hunger that surprised her. [423] Those past Maras seemed to move through time like everyone else, linearly, sensibly, aging in the right direction. [441]

The lamp flickered. [444] Outside, November wind—or was it March?—scraped against the cabin walls. [456] She began writing, her handwriting matching the loops and slants of the old scroll. [470]

"Theory 47: I am living my life in shuffled sequence. [481] The grave was not prediction but memory. [489] I have already died, am currently dying, will die, all true simultaneously. [502] Today I remembered how to soar—or prophesied it. [512] The distinction seems quaint now, almost charming." [520]

She paused, feeling that particular exhaustion that comes from being amazed by horror. [533] Jaded wonder, she'd started calling it. [540] The millionth time you see the impossible, it still steals your breath, but you roll your eyes while gasping. [559]

The scroll grew dense with her cramped notation. [567] Dream-soaring at 3 AM, waking at sunset, finding tomorrow's dinner already cooked and eaten. [582] Small impossibilities accumulated into a life lived sideways through time. [593]

When she finally set down the pen, dawn or dusk was breaking outside. [606] The birch bark scroll joined dozens of others, her desperate attempt to map territory that refused to hold still. [625]

She was a chronicler still, even chronologically shattered. [633] Especially shattered. [635] Only broken time reveals how desperately humans need their stories to march forward, orderly and promised. [651]

Outside, something that might have been her past self or future ghost moved between the pines, and Mara felt that twin-edged feeling again: bitter, knowing, yet somehow still capable of awe. [678]

She picked up another strip of bark. [686] There was always more chaos to distill. [694] Always another attempt to make the impossible make sense. [704]

The lamp burned on, or had already burned out, or would never be lit at all. [720]
