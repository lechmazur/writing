The velvet observatory stood suspended between earth and sky, its purple-draped walls filtering midsummer light into a bruised twilight that never quite resolved into clarity. [27] Iris Venn pressed her palm against the cool glass of the display case, feeling the familiar tug of objects speaking their histories. [50] As a provenance researcher, she had learned to read the invisible threads connecting artifacts to their makers, but lately those threads had begun to fray, showing her futures instead of pasts. [82]

The transparent violin rested on its stand like a captured ghost. [94] Carved entirely from ice crystal harvested from the northernmost glacier, it had survived three centuries without melting, preserved by methods its creator had taken to the grave. [121] Iris had been hired to authenticate its origin before the Imperial Collection claimed it, adding another treasure to their vault of silenced wonders. [145]

She retreated to her corner desk, where the morning's coffee had left its residue in the bottom of her cup. [165] The stains spread like continents across porcelain, and lately, they had begun showing her what was coming—a gift or curse that arrived the same week she discovered she could hear the thoughts of the potted ferns lining the observatory windows. [206] The plants whispered constantly about light and water, their needs simple and urgent, so unlike the violin's complex silence. [226]

*Show me,* she thought, tilting the cup. [233] The stains shifted, forming patterns: the violin shattered, its pieces scattered across the Imperial throne room. [250] But in another swirl, she saw it played, its music propagating outward in waves that made flowers bloom through marble floors. [272] Perforated destiny, she had come to call it—futures riddled with holes, possibilities leaking through like light through lace. [293]

"The ferns say you're troubled," came a voice. [301] Iris looked up to find Director Kemble, whose own talents ran toward persuasion rather than perception. [317] "They're worried about your water intake." [324]

"I'm fine," Iris said, though she wasn't. [332] The promise she'd made to herself was losing its glow—to never let the Empire own something beautiful without understanding what it would cost. [356] But the violin's provenance remained opaque, showing her only that its creator had meant it to be played, not imprisoned. [377]

"The Emperor expects your report by sunset," Kemble said. [386] "Authenticate it, and you'll have secured the Empire's favor for life. [398] Dream of anything, and it's yours." [405]

Iris looked at the coffee stains again. [412] This time they showed her clearly: herself, older, surrounded by luxuries, unable to remember why she'd once cared about the difference between preservation and possession. [435] The ferns rustled anxiously, sensing her distress. [443]

"What if it's not meant for them?" [450] Iris asked. [453]

Kemble's expression hardened. [456] "You're weighing a dream against an empire. [464] Choose carefully." [466]

After he left, Iris approached the violin again. [474] She had spent weeks trying to authenticate it through conventional means, but perhaps that was the wrong approach. [492] She pressed both palms to the case, reaching not backward into history but forward into possibility. [509]

The ice crystal sang without sound, showing her what it wanted: to be propagated, copied, its design freed so that others might make their own impossible instruments. [535] The original could remain with the Empire—a single captured note—but its essence could spread like seeds on wind. [555]

Before she could doubt herself, Iris began to sketch, her hands remembering the violin's every curve and crystalline lattice. [573] The ferns cheered silently, understanding growth better than anyone. [583] By sunset, she would give the Emperor his authentication and his prize. [596] But she would also give the world its blueprint, instructions spreading through underground networks where artists still believed in propagation over possession. [618]

The coffee stains showed her the consequences: exile, maybe, or worse. [630] But also music, multiplying outward, ice violins appearing in villages where the Empire's shadow never reached. [647]

She worked through the velvet afternoon, that mulberry ache in her chest she'd learned to recognize as the price of choosing right over easy. [671] The perforated destiny closed around one path, leaving only the difficult one illuminated. [685] The plants whispered encouragement, knowing instinctively what she had learned: that some things must be scattered to survive. [704]
