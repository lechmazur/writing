The lore keeper called herself Vess, and she had spent three centuries cataloging the memory-circuits of the old world. [18] Tonight, she would finally sally forth into territory that existed only in corrupted data fragments and half-remembered songs. [37] The unclaimed throne waited somewhere beyond the kaleidoscopic waterfall, accessible only through the stairway of ascension that no living soul had found. [58] She had until sunrise. [62]

The waterfall shimmered at the canyon's edge, its cascading pixels refracting light into impossible geometries. [77] Once, this had been mere water, falling according to gravity's ancient laws. [89] Now it was something else entirely—a curtain of living color that sang in forgotten frequencies. [105] Vess approached with wisely adventurous steps, her scanner glove reading the patterns. [118] The old texts had mentioned an orchard hidden behind such a waterfall, a place where the first architects had planted trees whose fruit contained compressed wisdom. [143]

She stepped through the prismatic veil. [149]

The orchard spread before her in twilight luminescence, trees heavy with fruit that glowed softly like captured stars. [167] The bark of each tree displayed circuit-patterns, nature and technology grown inseparable over lost millennia. [182] Between the rows stood ancient walls, once white but now layered with centuries of paint—each generation adding their own colors, their own attempts to remember or forget. [209]

The ruby flake rested in Vess's palm, its surface etched with coordinates she'd decoded from a corrupted archive. [227] According to the fragments, this flake had been broken from the throne itself, and it would resonate when near the stairway. [248] She held it forward like a compass. [255] Nothing. [256]

Frustrated, she leaned against one of the painted walls. [265] A piece of paint cracked beneath her shoulder, falling away to reveal something underneath—a curve of gold, part of a larger image. [287] Her breath caught. [290] The method had been hiding in plain sight. [298]

Vess began carefully peeling away the paint layers, each one representing a different era. [312] The top layer showed abstract geometric forms in electric blue—the style of the Twenty-Third Renaissance. [328] Beneath that, pastoral scenes in green and amber from the Age of Reconciliation. [341] Deeper still, she found propaganda murals from the Unification Wars, bold reds and blacks. [355]

With each layer removed, the ruby flake grew warmer in her pocket. [367]

The original mural finally emerged, and Vess felt tears on her cheeks though she couldn't remember the last time she'd wept. [387] The artwork depicted the first throne room, painted before the great abandonment, before humanity had scattered to the wind and left their seat of power empty. [411] The mural showed the throne in impossible detail—every facet, every inscription—and behind it, a doorway wreathed in light. [431]

The ruby flake burned hot now, thrumming with recognition. [440]

Vess traced the painted doorway with her fingers, and the wall responded. [452] Stone turned liquid, reforming, remembering its original purpose. [460] A passage opened, revealing stairs that spiraled upward into darkness. [471] The stairway of ascension. [475]

She climbed. [477]

Each step activated under her feet, illuminating with soft bioluminescence. [487] The stairs were carved with names—the original architects, the first guardians, the last kings and queens who had walked this path before vanishing into myth. [512] Vess ran her fingers across the inscriptions, committing each to her perfect memory. [526] This was why lore keepers existed: to bridge the gap between what was and what could be again. [545]

The stairs opened onto a chamber just as the first hint of dawn touched the world outside. [563] The throne sat in the center, crafted from compressed starlight and human ambition, exactly as the murals had shown. [582] Unclaimed for a thousand years. [587] Empty, waiting, patient. [590]

Vess placed the ruby flake in the small indentation on the throne's arm where it had been broken away. [609] The fragment fused seamlessly back into place, and the throne hummed to life, its ancient systems recognizing the touch of one who had sought it wisely, adventurously, with purpose beyond mere power. [638]

She didn't sit. [641] The throne would remain unclaimed a while longer. [649] But now she knew the way, could guide others here when the time came. [663] That was enough. [666]

Sunrise painted the chamber gold as Vess descended, carrying the weight of possibility and the lightness of hope—futuristic and ancient all at once, like everything else in this strange, beautiful world. [695]
