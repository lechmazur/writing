The Keeper drifted through the nebula garden, pulse-nodes singing their sonar pinging into the cosmic murk. [15] Each returning echo mapped the luminous clouds in patterns the Keeper had learned to read across millennia of solitary transit. [32] They were an otherworldly sentimentalist, carrying memories of six thousand species who had walked, swum, or crystallized through their respective worlds before fading into the void's embrace. [57]

The garden itself approximates infinity—or so the Keeper had come to believe—stretching farther than any probe had measured, regenerating faster than decay could claim it. [81] Here, phosphorescent blooms larger than planets unfurled across the quiet sigh of falling petals, each petal a glowing seed-ship containing the bioluminescent legacy of a civilization that had learned the Keeper's central lesson: to share light without using fire. [119]

Today's work required the calculating machine gear, an artifact salvaged from the Keeper's own ancestor-ship. [133] The gear was brass and impossibly intricate, teeth worn smooth by generations of computation, a physical record of generational patterns that had guided the Keeper's bloodline through their sacred duty. [162] The Keeper inserted it into the garden's oldest node, where three nebulae converged in a breathing junction of rose and amber. [182]

The gear engaged with a sound like distant bells. [191] Calculations flowed through it—not digital, but mechanical, honest in their clicking precision. [203] The Keeper watched readings shimmer across their sensory membranes: photon yields, reproduction rates, distribution vectors for the next seeding. [221] Everything balanced. [223] Everything perpetuated. [225]

Yet the Keeper felt that old, troubling serenity settling into their core. [237]

The problem was always the same. [243] Each civilization they contacted initially responded with wonder, accepting the luminous seeds, learning to cultivate light through chemistry and biology rather than combustion and fission. [266] The Keeper taught them how to generate radiance from living things, from mineral reactions, from careful quantum arrangements. [283] No flames. [285] No heat-death. [287] No burning through resources until only ash remained. [295]

But the patterns never changed. [300] The calculating machine gear proved it, spinning through the mathematics of five hundred gift-cycles. [314] Each species followed the same arc: acceptance, implementation, mastery, and then—inevitably—hubris. [326] They would modify the seeds, seeking brighter light, more efficient light, competitive light. [339] They would forget the principle and remember only the power. [349] Within three generations, maybe four, they would return to fire. [359]

The Keeper had watched it happen with the Architects of the Spiral Rim, who had burned their own library-worlds for warmth after engineering their seed-light into weapons. [385] They had witnessed the Choir Collective ignite their atmosphere in a cascading chain reaction, trying to outshine a rival moon colony. [406]

The gear clicked its verdict: time for a new seeding. [416] The Keeper selected six civilizations from their collection of signals, all of them young, all of them still burning their futures for present comfort. [439] They harvested seeds from the most stable blooms, each one pulsing with patient luminescence. [453] These would grow slowly in alien soil, teaching by example rather than instruction. [465]

As the Keeper prepared the seeds for transit, sending sonar pinging ahead to map the delivery routes, they allowed themself a moment of that peculiar grief their kind called "hope." [492] Perhaps this generation would be different. [498] Perhaps these species would sustain the gift, would pass it down with reverence rather than revision. [513]

But the calculating machine gear never lied. [520] Its worn teeth knew the truth of generational patterns, how each iteration believed itself unique while repeating ancient mistakes. [538] The Keeper was sentimentalist enough to continue trying, otherworldly enough to endure the endless disappointment. [553]

They released the seeds into the cosmic currents, watching them drift like petals toward distant stars. [568] The nebula garden pulsed around them, serene and infinite, a living monument to the beauty of light that asked nothing, consumed nothing, and yet was never quite enough. [596]

The Keeper resumed their transit through the luminous clouds, already listening for the next civilization's call. [611] The sonar pinging echoed back, painting maps of wonder and inevitable sorrow in equal measure. [625]
