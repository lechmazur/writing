Teryn had failed the Automatist Exams three times. [8] In an age when spellcraft flowed through algorithms and enchantments compiled themselves, her insistence on hand-drawn sigils marked her as hopelessly outdated. [30] The Grand Academy called her an underachieving mage, though she suspected she simply achieved differently. [45] That's why she'd strapped the garden folly keystone to her back and begun the climb toward the icebound spire above the clouds, where the old magic still remembered how to breathe. [75]

The keystone weighed almost nothing despite its size—a wedge-shaped stone carved with vines and laughing faces, salvaged from her grandmother's demolished folly before the efficiency wardens recycled it. [101] Grandmother used to say follies were buildings that served no purpose except beauty, and therefore served the highest purpose of all. [122] The Academy had called that philosophy quaint. [129]

Teryn unstrapped the keystone at the cloudline and held it before her. [141] The stone's surface showed a peculiar quality her instruments couldn't measure: lingering luminance, a glow that persisted seconds after shadow passed over it, as if light itself had learned to remember. [171] She'd discovered the keystone accommodates impossibilities—when she held it during examinations, her "inefficient" spells worked perfectly, though always too slowly for the automated timers. [195]

The mist thickened as she climbed higher. [202] She remembered her grandmother teaching her mist walking, the old method of stepping between water droplets, treating fog as solid ground. [222] "Don't think of where you are," Grandmother had whispered. [231] "Think of where the mist is taking you." [239]

Teryn stepped into the cloud and felt it accept her weight. [251] Modern mages teleported with calculated precision, arriving exactly where algorithms predicted. [261] Mist walking was different—it accommodated impossibilities, taking you where you needed to be rather than where you'd planned. [279] She walked upward through brilliant dimness, light diffused by infinite water droplets, each step both certain and uncertain. [296]

The icebound spire emerged gradually, not with the sharp clarity of automated vision but with the soft revelation of dawn. [314] Ice coated the ancient tower in translucent layers, and through them Teryn could see stone carved with the same vine patterns as her keystone. [336] The spire had stood here since before magic learned to hurry, before creativity became something to optimize and systematize. [354]

She found the gap at the spire's apex where the original keystone had been removed—stolen by some efficiency reform a century ago. [374] The stone in her arms hummed with recognition. [382] Teryn lifted it, muscles burning, and slid it into place. [393]

The fit was perfect. [397]

Lingering luminance spread from the keystone through the ice, light chasing itself through frozen fractals. [412] The spire began to glow with that impossible quality—not bright but brilliant, not dim but gentle, somehow both at once. [433] The light remembered itself, echoing through centuries, each reflection lasting a heartbeat longer than physics allowed. [449]

Teryn felt something shift in her chest. [456] This was what she'd been seeking: proof that the sacred lived in simple stone, in light that lingered, in buildings built for beauty alone. [479] The automatists could generate a thousand spells per second, but they couldn't make light remember. [494] They couldn't accommodate impossibilities because they'd forgotten that magic, at its heart, was impossible. [508]

Below, she knew, the Academy's algorithms were already flagging anomalous readings from the spire. [522] They would send efficient mages to investigate, to explain, to optimize. [533] But for now, in this brilliant dimness above the clouds, Teryn stood within light that refused to forget, holding space for wonder in a world that had automated it away. [563]

She pressed her palm against the keystone and felt the old magic recognize her—not as an underachieving student, but as someone who still knew the sacred lived in simple acts: climbing, carrying, caring. [593] The lingering luminance pulsed once more, a gentle heartbeat in stone, and Teryn understood she had finally passed the only examination that mattered. [615] In the icebound spire where impossibilities found accommodation, she had become exactly the mage she'd always been. [632]

The mist below swirled, patient and eternal, ready to walk her home. [644]
