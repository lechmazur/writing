The Cloudspire Library existed in perpetual golden hour, suspended between atmosphere and void, its gardens blooming with flowers that had forgotten how to wilt. [26] Maren had worked there for seventeen years as a sharp-eyed dusk noticer, cataloging the precise moment when each visitor's hope began to fade. [50] In the age after dreams became shareable, her profession had become essential—someone needed to document what was being lost. [70]

She carried a river stone in her pocket, smooth and gray, collected from the world below before the libraries ascended. [90] Its weight reminded her of gravity, of consequence, of the earth that still turned beneath the clouds. [107]

Today's task was softly deliberate, as all her work had to be. [119] Maren sat in the Preservation Wing, surrounded by holographic projections flickering in the amber light that filtered through blossom-laden windows. [139] Before her floated two recordings: silent video footage from decades apart, both capturing the same woman in the moment of her first shared dream. [163]

The earlier recording showed Lyssa at twenty-three, eyes bright with pharmaceutical dilation, electrodes crowned around her temples like silver flowers. [182] Her hands trembled with anticipation as the dream-share interface initialized. [193] The footage captured her first glimpse into another consciousness—her mother's memory of a childhood sunrise. [209] Lyssa's face metamorphosed from nervous excitement into transcendent wonder, tears streaming down her cheeks. [223] The timestamp read 2087, the year the technology had democratized. [233]

The second recording showed the same woman forty years later, returning for her ten-thousandth share. [248] Same chair, same procedure, same electrodes. [254] But this Lyssa moved mechanically through the process, scrolling through dream catalogs with the bored efficiency of someone choosing wallpaper. [273] Her face remained slack, empty, a mask of consumer contentment. [283] No trembling hands. [286] No tears. [288] The wonder had been processed into routine. [295]

Maren paused both recordings at the precise moment of connection, comparing them with the trained eye that had earned her position. [314] The difference wasn't just in Lyssa's expression—it was deeper, architectural. [325] In the first recording, something luminous inhabited her body, a shadow unbound from despair, reaching toward beauty. [342] In the second, that shadow had been tamed, domesticated, made comfortable. [353]

This was what Maren documented: the topology of hope's erosion. [363]

She typed her report with luminous regret, each word a small betrayal. [376] Her findings would be stored in the library's vast archives, preserved but ultimately impotent. [390] The dream-share technology had given humanity access to every memory, every sleeping vision, every corner of consciousness. [407] It had promised connection but delivered consumption. [414] People no longer dreamed their own dreams—they subscribed to curated experiences, pre-tested for optimal emotional response. [431]

Maren understood why they came to the clouds to build these libraries. [443] Up here, surrounded by impossible gardens and perpetual sunset, they could pretend the work mattered. [458] They could preserve the shape of hope without confronting what hope required: vulnerability, uncertainty, the risk of disappointment. [476]

She pulled the river stone from her pocket, running her thumb across its surface. [490] Down below, rivers still carved canyons through ancient rock. [500] The process was violent, necessary, transformative. [506] Hope had always required the same courage—to be worn down, reshaped, metamorphosed by experience into something harder and truer. [526]

But the dream-share had made such transformation optional. [535] Why endure the erosion when you could simply download someone else's refined happiness? [548]

Maren saved her report and walked to the library's edge, where transparent walls revealed clouds like breathing cotton. [565] Somewhere below, rivers ran their patient courses. [573] Somewhere below, people still found stones and carried them like prayers. [585]

She pressed the river stone against the glass, leaving a small smudge of moisture—condensation from her palm meeting the temperature differential. [606] The mark would fade in seconds. [612]

It was the most honest thing she'd documented all day. [622]

Tomorrow, more footage would arrive, more faces to compare, more moments of wonder calcified into convenience. [638] And Maren would continue her softly deliberate work, archiving the metamorphosis of human longing into something safe and shallow and utterly lost. [660]

The library bloomed around her, flowers that never died because they'd never truly lived. [674]

She returned the stone to her pocket and felt its weight. [686]

Still heavy. [688]

Still real. [690]

Still hers. [692]
