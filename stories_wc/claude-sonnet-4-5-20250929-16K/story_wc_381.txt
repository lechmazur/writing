The summoner knelt beside the brook, her fingers tracing patterns in the cool night air. [15] Around her, the nocturnal haven breathed with cricket songs and rustling leaves, a sanctuary she had maintained for seventeen years in perfect solitude. [36] Tonight, however, the forest held its breath differently—amid whispered secrets that filtered through the darkness like smoke through silk. [56]

She unfolded the crane's origami wing from her leather satchel, its paper surface worn soft from constant handling. [73] The wing had arrived three months ago, delivered by no messenger she could name, appearing simply on her doorstep at dawn. [93] Creased into its delicate folds were symbols she recognized from her grandmother's forbidden texts: a prophecy written in the old code, predicting a terrestrially cosmic alignment that would shatter the barrier between earth and void. [125]

The prophecy spoke of stars falling upward, of roots drinking starlight, of the ground itself becoming doorway. [143] Such words, once uttered into the world's ears, gained momentum—they shaped reality through belief alone. [159] She had spent weeks verifying the translation, and each verification only confirmed her dread. [173] Someone had spoken this prophecy aloud, and already she could feel its truth beginning to crystallize in the fabric of existence. [193]

Her motivation was simple: to hush a prophecy spoken in code before it could fully manifest. [209]

The summoner had discovered that prophecies possessed a peculiar vulnerability. [219] They required the world's attention to achieve completion, feeding on consciousness like parasites on blood. [234] If she could map the prophecy's spread through the collective awareness—trace each whispered retelling, each fearful repetition—she might reverse its flow, pull it back into silence before the cosmic alignment occurred. [265]

She placed the crane's wing on a flat stone beside the brook, then began her work. [281] By mapping silence, her grandmother had taught her, one could see sound's inverse—the spaces where words had been swallowed, the gaps where knowledge had been deliberately forgotten. [307] The summoner entered her trance state, feeling her consciousness expand outward like ripples on still water. [323]

The brook's quiet burbling became her anchor as she sent her awareness flowing through the night. [339] She sensed the prophecy's contamination spreading through the region: travelers repeating it at taverns, scholars copying it in margins, children making it into a skipping rhyme. [364] Each instance glowed in her mind's eye like embers scattered across a dark landscape. [379]

She began to gather them. [384]

It was delicate work, requiring a tranquil blaze of focus—the paradox of intense concentration that appeared effortless, like a flame burning without consuming. [408] She touched each person who held the prophecy, finding the memory of it nestled in their thoughts. [426] Then, gently, she offered them something in exchange: a smoothed hush, a sensation of peace so profound that the prophecy's sharp edges dissolved into irrelevance. [451]

They forgot willingly, releasing the words like children releasing fireflies back into summer darkness. [465]

Hour by hour, the summoner worked, drawing the prophecy back to its source. [478] The terrestrially cosmic alignment still approached—in five days, the stars would position themselves exactly as foretold—but without human consciousness to give it purpose, the alignment would be merely astronomical, not apocalyptic. [509]

As dawn approached, she had traced the prophecy to its origin: a dying astrologer in the northern city, whose final words had been recorded by an overeager apprentice. [534] The summoner reached across the distance and found the apprentice's journal, still ink-fresh. [548] With a thought, she encouraged a spilled cup of water, a blurred page, an illegible smear. [565]

The crane's origami wing crumbled to dust in the morning light, its purpose fulfilled. [579]

The summoner rose from beside the brook, her legs stiff from kneeling. [592] The nocturnal haven had become a dawn sanctuary, and the forest no longer whispered secrets. [607] She had hushed the future itself, returned it to the realm of mere possibility. [622]

In her solitude, she smiled. [627]

The world would never know how close it had come to transformation—and that ignorance, she knew, was the truest form of salvation. [649]
