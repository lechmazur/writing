The volcanic hot springs steamed against the morning cold as Grandmother Lira knelt beside the scraggly pine that had somehow survived the war. [23] Its roots clutched volcanic rock, and through them, she felt its whispered distress about something tangled in its highest branches. [44] She had discovered this unwanted gift three months into the reconstruction, when hunger made her sensitive to every living thing: the plants spoke to her in sensations, images, primitive needs. [75] Not voices, but something stranger, more ancient. [82]

The other insurgents thought her mad when she claimed the gardens told her where the regime had buried supplies. [101] But they'd eaten well because of her madness. [109]

She climbed carefully, her seventy years no match for her determination. [120] There, snagged on dead branches, hung a child's kite, its red paper faded to pink. [136] The tail was strange—not cloth strips but something like bark paper, covered in script she recognized from the old temple before the regime burned it. [162]

Her daughter had died carrying those teachings forward. [170] Lira had carried guns instead. [175]

She brought the kite to the springs' edge where light was best. [187] The plants around the thermal pools stirred in her awareness, excited by something they sensed in the script. [205] They showed her images: deep places, sealed stones, something precious waiting. [216]

The script was fragmentary, but it spoke of unsealing. [225] Of destiny not born naturally but implanted with purpose, preserved until the world could receive it properly. [242] The regime had called such ideas corruption, superstition. [250] They'd tried to erase everything that made her people distinct. [260]

But here were the words, survived. [266]

Lira spent three days by the springs, letting the plants guide her understanding. [279] The bamboo showed her how the characters connected. [287] The moss revealed patterns in the way symbols overlapped. [296] The reeds whispered about flowing sequences, how to read not just across but through the layered text. [313]

The script became a map. [318]

It led her to a cave behind the largest spring, where steam rendered everything dreamlike and uncertain. [335] Inside, embedded in the volcanic glass of the cave wall, she found the amber sphere. [351] It was the size of two fists, and within it, suspended perfectly, floated an embryo. [367] Not human—she saw that immediately. [373] Something else, something engineered or evolved far beyond natural development. [383]

The script had warned: this was a seed of implanted destiny, created by the ancestors before the regime, before the war. [404] A living bridge designed to help her people adapt to what they were becoming. [419]

The plants pressed close in her mind, eager and afraid. [429]

The unsealing words came from the kite's final sequence. [438] Lira spoke them, her voice cracking over syllables her mouth wasn't shaped to hold. [453] The amber grew warm. [457] Cracks spiderwebbed across its surface. [462]

She thought of her daughter, who'd wanted to preserve everything exactly as it was. [476] She thought of herself, who'd wanted to destroy everything that bound them. [488] Both had been wrong. [492]

The embryo was evolution with intent, tradition carrying itself forward by choosing change. [505]

The amber shattered. [507]

The embryo drifted in the steam, beginning to grow visible only through the water vapor it displaced. [525] The plants screamed and sang in her mind simultaneously. [534] Whatever this thing would become, it was already reaching out, already connecting to the network of roots and runners that survived beneath the bombed-out villages and burned fields. [563]

Lira understood: she'd been made accidentally telepathic so she could find this moment. [576] The kite had waited for her specifically. [584] An insurgent who'd fought for her people's future, old enough to remember what mattered, angry enough to risk changing it. [605]

The embryo pulsed with bioluminescence. [610]

Around the hot springs, new shoots pushed through volcanic soil, growing at impossible speeds. [624] The reconstruction would be stranger than anyone planned. [632]

Lira touched the growing thing, felt it touch back through dimensions of connection she'd never imagined. [648]

It asked without words: will you midwife what comes next? [658]

She'd spent her life fighting. [663]

Now she would spend what remained gardening futures, tending an implanted destiny toward harvest, evolving her people's traditions with the fierce intent that had always driven her. [689]

"Yes," she told the embryo, told the plants, told the morning. [701]

The volcanic springs steamed with purpose as something ancient and new began unfolding into the reconstructed world. [718]
