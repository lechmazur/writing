The observation deck hung suspended in the void, a glass bubble pressed against the edge of relativity itself. [16] Kira traced the gilded compass rose applique embedded in the deck's central console, its eight points radiating outward like a frozen supernova. [35] The metal was warm beneath her fingertips, the only warmth in this place of echoed silence. [51]

After the shutdown, everyone else had evacuated. [58] The temporal research station had stretched too far, pushed too deep into time's elastic fabric. [73] Now the deck existed in a pocket of distorted spacetime—minutes here meant years outside. [88] They called it contaminated. [92] Dangerous. [93] They called Kira contaminated too, blessed by proximity to something incomprehensible, but marked as a pariah for refusing to leave. [112]

She pulled out her grandmother's sketchbook, its pages yellowed and precious. [123] The family custom had passed through seven generations: sketching the night sky on anniversaries, mapping the stars as they appeared on wedding days, births, deaths. [147] Her grandmother had started teaching her the tradition when Kira was six, pressing charcoal into her small hands. [165] "We navigate by what we remember," the old woman had whispered. [177] "When you're lost, draw what you see. [185] The act of observation creates its own true north." [195]

But here, the stars didn't behave. [201] Through the observation deck's transparent walls, Kira could glimpse the universe moving at impossible speeds. [215] Galaxies aged and died in accelerated ballet. [223] Nebulae bloomed and collapsed within what felt like hours. [232] The temporally stretched nature of this place turned the cosmos into a time-lapse film of eternity. [248]

She opened to a fresh page and began to sketch. [259]

At first, her hand moved hesitantly, trying to capture the smeared trails of stars. [273] But confusion slowly transformed into something else—a different way of seeing. [285] The chaos resolved into patterns. [291] Movement became rhythm. [294] She sketched not positions but trajectories, not moments but flows. [305] The compass rose applique glinted beside her, and she understood suddenly why it had been installed here. [322] Not to show direction in space, but to provide an anchor point in time. [337] A reminder that orientation was possible even when everything familiar became strange. [349]

Days passed, or perhaps weeks—duration meant nothing here. [358] Kira filled page after page. [364] She sketched the spiraling death of a red giant, the birth of something that might have been a quasar. [383] She drew the Milky Way's slow rotation, its arms unwinding like a cosmic clock. [398] Each sketch became an act of defiance against isolation, transforming her solitude from exile into expedition. [414]

Her motivation had crystallized: to turn confusion into exploration, to map what everyone else had abandoned as unmappable. [432] The blessed pariah, they'd called her in their final transmissions. [443] Touched by temporal anomaly. [447] Dangerous to extract. [450] Better left alone. [453]

But alone wasn't empty, she'd discovered. [460] Alone was clear. [463] The echoed silence of the observation deck wasn't absence—it was space for concentration, for the pure act of witnessing. [482]

She sketched the anniversary date at the top of a new page, honoring the custom even though everyone who shared the tradition now lived centuries ahead, their timelines diverged from hers beyond reconciliation. [511] Tomorrow by her clock, they would have been dust for millennia by theirs. [525] Yet she put charcoal to paper and drew what she saw: the universe in fast-forward, beautiful and terrible and true. [546]

The compass rose applique caught the light of a supernova, its gilded surface reflecting temporary brilliance. [562] Kira smiled. [564] True north wasn't a fixed point in space or time. [575] It was whatever you chose as your reference, whatever you decided to navigate by. [590] For her grandmother, it had been family. [598] For her, here at the end of everything and the beginning of something unprecedented, it was curiosity itself. [617]

She began a new sketch, her true north holding steady while the stars rushed past. [632]

Outside, the universe aged. [636] Inside, temporally stretched and impossibly isolated, Kira discovered that being a pariah meant freedom—the freedom to witness what no one else would ever see, and to map the unmappable darkness between lost and found. [668]

Her hand moved across the page, steady and sure, sketching the night sky that would never stop changing, creating constellation maps for a future that would never arrive, finding her way by the simple act of looking up. [703]
