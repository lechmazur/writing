Kaia pressed the green glass shard against her temple, feeling the coolness spread through her skull like water through cracks. [20] The abandoned spaceport repair bay hummed with the absence of engines, a negative sound that mapped itself across her consciousness in shades of rust and violet. [46] She was a sensory map maker, charting the dimensions that folded between this reality and its neighbors, translating touch and taste and the weight of silence into coordinates no computer could parse. [77]

The shard had been her mother's. [83] That much she knew. [88] Everything else about her mother existed in the murmur of half-remembered dreams, fragments that surfaced and submerged like breathing, cyclically spontaneous in their visitations. [109] A laugh that smelled like cardamom. [115] Hands that felt purple in the dark. [122] And one phrase, repeated in a voice Kaia could no longer quite hear: "The truth has weight, my love. [140] You'll know when you're strong enough to carry it." [150]

For three years, Kaia had worked in this bay, mapping the thin places where worlds pressed close. [167] The repair bay existed in a crux point, she'd discovered—a place where five parallel universes converged like petals around a center. [187] Ships had once been fixed here, their engines singing in frequencies that inadvertently thinned the barriers between realities. [205] Now only she remained, weaving between worlds through corridors of sensation that existed nowhere and everywhere. [220]

Tonight the transitions came faster. [225] Cyclically spontaneous, the worlds pulsed in and out of reach—she could smell diesel and snow from Universe Gamma, taste copper from Delta, feel the electrical hum of Beta against her ribs. [255] The green glass shard grew warm in her hand, responding to something. [267] She had learned to redirect her path through these spaces, swimming sideways through reality by following sensory currents. [284] But now the currents were pulling her, and she recognized in their insistence her mother's familiar signature. [301]

In Universe Beta, the repair bay was a garden. [310] Kaia stepped through, her feet finding moss where there should have been concrete. [323] The shard blazed hot now, nearly burning. [330] She pressed forward, letting it guide her deeper into the sensory cascade. [342] Epsilon flickered past—the bay was underwater there, pressure squeezing her lungs. [353] Then Gamma, where snow fell through a shattered ceiling. [362]

Then she found it: a pocket universe she'd never mapped, nested in the space between spaces. [378] The repair bay here was pristine, humming with active engines, and her mother stood beside a ship whose hull reflected impossible colors. [399] She looked exactly as Kaia's dreams remembered her—young, vibrant, whole. [410]

"You found it," her mother said, and her voice carried the weight Kaia had been promised. [426] "The truth." [428]

"You're alive." [430] Kaia's words mapped themselves in her chest as hot stones. [441]

"In this universe, I never left." [447] Her mother gestured to the ship, to the space around them. [459] "I learned to weave between worlds. [465] I was trying to find a universe where you and I could both be safe." [480] She touched the shard in Kaia's hand. [487] "I left this for you so you could find your way here when you were ready." [503]

"Why not just stay in our world?" [510] The question tasted like ash. [516]

"Because in our world, mapping the spaces between was illegal." [526] Her mother's eyes held decades of exile. [533] "They were coming for me. [538] I thought if I left, you'd be spared." [546]

Kaia felt the weight then, dense and specific—not crushing but substantial, like a stone she could choose to carry or set down. [568] The truth of abandonment, yes. [573] But also the truth of protection, of impossible choices, of love that bent itself through parallel universes to keep its object safe. [595]

She could stay here, in this pocket world. [603] She could return home and seal the passages behind her. [613] Or she could learn, truly learn, to weave between worlds as her mother had, carrying this weight across realities as a sensory map maker should: translating the untranslatable, finding paths through impossible spaces. [644]

Kaia closed her fist around the green glass shard. [653] It pulsed warm against her palm, a heartbeat synchronized across dimensions. [664]

"Teach me," she said, and the words mapped themselves as coordinates pointing everywhere at once. [679]

Her mother smiled, and the repair bay hummed with engines beginning to sing. [692]
