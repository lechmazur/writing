Mira set the kettle on and returned to her workbench beneath the rain-beaded skylight, where the ash wood carving blank waited like an unanswered question. [26] Outside, October rain traced wandering paths down the angled glass, each drop here and gone in the space of a breath. [49] She picked up the blank, feeling its weight, its promise of form still sleeping in the grain. [66]

Twenty-three years with Viktor, and she'd learned that circus people understood impermanence better than most. [81] The crowds that roared one night were strangers by morning, the tent city packed into trucks, the sawdust swept away. [101] Even the lions he'd gentled with such patient authority—Czar, Bathsheba, young Nero—all gone now, retired to sanctuaries or dust. [121] Viktor himself, here and gone, his heart stopping backstage on an ordinary Tuesday. [134]

The grief counselor had called her approach "unusual." [142] Mira called it hauntingly practical, because what choice did widows have but to be both haunted and practical at once? [162] She couldn't contain Viktor in photographs alone—those flat, frozen faces that never breathed or argued about burnt toast or hummed off-key in the shower. [186] So she'd begun carving. [190]

Not his likeness, but the moments themselves. [197]

She'd discovered the method by accident, working through crystallized time—those particular instances that grief had preserved in perfect, painful detail. [217] The way Viktor's right hand had always moved to his chest pocket for the reading glasses that lived there. [236] The precise angle of his chin when he listened to rain, exactly as she did now. [253] The small, specific gestures that made a person irreplaceable. [262]

Each carving captured one such moment, frozen in ash wood. [272] She'd filled a shelf already: a hand reaching, a profile turning toward morning light, the curve of shoulders in repose. [292] The blank before her now would become his laugh—she could almost see it already, the way his whole body had participated in joy, head thrown back, arms open. [318]

The kettle began its preliminary whisper, that prelude before the shriek. [329]

Mira turned the blank slowly, studying the grain. [337] Ash wood was honest timber, neither too soft nor too hard, receptive to both delicate detail and bold strokes. [356] Viktor would have approved. [360] He'd always said that lion taming wasn't about domination but conversation, understanding the nature of the thing before you and working with its truth, not against it. [386]

She picked up her knife, feeling the familiar weight settle into her palm. [399] The first cut was always the hardest—that commitment to subtract, to release the form by removing everything it wasn't. [418] She began with the curve of a spine, arching backward. [428]

Rain drummed harder against the skylight, turning the loft into a cave of soft gray light and shadow. [446] This was her ring now, this quiet space where she contained what couldn't be contained, where she harvested lessons from loss. [468] Viktor had taught the lions to trust, to perform impossible feats through patient repetition and reward. [485] He'd taught her something else: that love makes demands even after death, requires you to honor what was by acknowledging how it shaped what is. [510]

The kettle reached full boil, screaming its readiness. [518]

Mira set down the blank—already transformed, the suggestion of movement visible in the wood—and crossed to silence the kettle. [537] She made her tea with the same deliberate care she brought to everything now, each gesture a small ceremony. [556] When she returned to the bench, the carving waited with that particular patience of objects that know they'll eventually become what they're meant to be. [579]

She worked until the tea grew cold, until the rain-beaded skylight darkened from pearl to slate. [596] The wooden figure emerged slowly, a body in the act of laughter, here and gone and here again, held in ash and memory and the rust-hued peace of acceptance. [624] Viktor had been here. [628] He was gone. [631] But in her hands, through the humble alchemy of blade and wood and crystallized time, he remained—not as he was, but as what he'd taught her to become: someone who could hold loss without being crushed by it, someone who carved meaning from absence. [674]

The figure would join the others on the shelf, a gallery of gestures, a museum of moments. [692] Tomorrow she would begin another. [698] Tonight she would sit with this one, with her cooling tea and the patient rain, harvesting what only grief could teach. [719]
