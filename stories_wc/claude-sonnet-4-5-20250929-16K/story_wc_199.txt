The ashen skyborne arbor floated through perpetual twilight, its branches heavy with seeds that fell upward into clouds the color of old bone. [26] Miren had sorted seeds here for seventeen years, her fingers knowing each variety by texture alone: the ridged ember-seeds, the smooth ghost-pearls, the spiral windwhispers. [50] She worked during the hush where past meets prophecy, that trembling hour when the arbor's bark whispered old stories and new warnings simultaneously. [73]

Regional folklore claimed the arbor had once been earthbound, rooted in soil rich with the bones of oracles. [91] When the Great Unmooring came, it tore free and ascended, taking with it all the seeds of what might be. [112] The old verses said: "She who reads the falling leaves shall know the shape of tomorrow." [129] Miren had memorized those verses as a child, tracing their meanings like others traced constellations. [145]

But leaves didn't fall in the traditional sense here. [154] They transformed mid-descent, becoming moths, becoming rain, becoming small silver questions that dissolved before reaching any answer. [171] Still, Miren watched them obsessively, her true motivation hidden beneath the methodical sorting. [184] To decode the message in falling leaves—this had become her singular purpose, more vital than breath. [201]

She built tiny monuments everywhere she worked: small cairns of rejected seeds, arrangements of broken twigs forming symbols from forgotten alphabets, circles of pebbles marking where particularly strange leaves had transformed. [231] Other workers thought her eccentric, but the Head Gardener tolerated her peculiarities because she never missed a single viable seed. [251]

Today felt different. [254] The air held a mossy delight, damp and green despite the arbor's ashen appearance, as if spring hid just beneath the gray bark waiting to burst forth. [279] Miren's fingers moved through the day's collection—and stopped. [288]

There, among the windwhispers, lay something impossible: a moonstone cabochon dust speck, no larger than a grain of salt, but unmistakable in its opalescent shimmer. [313] Moonstones didn't grow on the arbor. [320] Nothing mineral did. [324] Yet here it rested, and when she lifted it to the light, tiny symbols swirled within its depths like smoke. [345]

She recognized them from her monuments, from the old folklore, from dreams she'd never quite remembered upon waking. [363]

Miren placed the speck on her sorting table and used a dried twig to prod it gently. [380] The moonstone rolled, and where it touched wood, moss sprouted—actual living moss, verdant and impossible. [397] The moss grew in a pattern, branching like veins, like rivers, like the paths leaves took when they transformed. [417]

She prodded again, guiding the speck along different trajectories. [427] Each path created different moss patterns, different messages. [436] Her heart hammered with recognition. [441] The leaves hadn't been failing to communicate—she'd been trying to read them at the wrong moment, in the wrong state. [463] They emerged transformed always because transformation WAS the message, not an obstacle to it. [478]

The folklore suddenly made perfect sense. [485] The prophecy wasn't in the leaves themselves but in their willingness to become something other, something new. [503] The arbor had unmoored not to escape fate but to embrace infinite possibilities. [517]

Miren began building her most elaborate monument yet, using the moonstone speck as its heart. [532] She arranged seeds in spirals, added leaves in various stages of transformation, created tiny archways from bent twigs. [550] The structure grew under her hands, and the mossy delight in the air intensified until she could taste spring on her tongue. [572]

When she prodded the moonstone one final time, the entire monument shimmered. [584] The seeds sprouted simultaneously, the leaves crystallized into prismatic forms, and Miren felt herself begin to transform—not her body, but something deeper. [607] Understanding bloomed within her like flowers from ash. [616]

She had decoded the message: Nothing stayed fixed. [625] Everything was always emerging, always becoming, always translating itself into new languages. [637] The arbor had been teaching her this through every sorted seed, every built monument, every year of patient watching. [656]

Tomorrow, she would begin teaching others. [663] But today, in the hush where past meets prophecy, Miren simply sat within her monument and transformed, becoming at last what she'd always been sorting toward: a translator of possibility, a reader of eternal emergence. [696]

The ashen arbor bloomed around her, no longer gray but shimmering with every color transformation could hold. [713]
