The queen had grown weary of crowns and courtiers, but it was the dreams that finally drove her from the palace gates. [21] Each night for a fortnight, she had seen the same vision: a cobalt grotto above the clouds, bleeding starlight like wounds across the sky. [45] The court physician called it fever; the high priest called it prophecy. [57] She called it maddening. [61]

After the final warning—a third messenger collapsing at her throne, babbling about light that cuts and stars that weep—she made her decision. [83] At dawn, she left her crown on the windowsill and began to climb. [97]

The ridge rose sharp and treacherous, a blade of stone cutting through morning mist. [111] Her ladies-in-waiting had begged to accompany her, but the queen refused with that softly commanding voice that made refusal sound like benediction. [132] This mystery belonged to her alone. [138] The recurring dreams had shown her the path: follow the spine of rock where the air grows thin and cold, where eagles nest and mortals rarely tread. [164]

By midday, she passed the tree line. [171] By afternoon, she climbed through clouds, her gown heavy with moisture, her hands scraped raw. [186] The world below vanished into white nothingness. [193] She thought of her kingdom—fragile, fracturing—and felt nothing but distant concern, as if observing someone else's troubles through thick glass. [213] Disenchantment had settled into her bones like winter cold. [222]

The ember grotto appeared first on the ridge, a slash of volcanic warmth that melted the clouds into steam. [241] She rested there, drawn by the heat, watching orange light pulse beneath crystalline formations. [255] It reminded her of a dying hearth, of warmth fading. [266] But the dreams pulled her higher still. [274]

Then she saw it: the cobalt grotto, exactly as her sleeping mind had promised. [288] It hung impossibly above the cloudbank, its entrance a dark mouth lined with stones the color of deep ocean, the color of midnight, the color of bruises that never heal. [316]

She stepped inside and gasped. [321]

The walls wept light—not reflected, but exuding it, as if the stone itself were wounded and bleeding illumination. [339] Starlight, she realized, though no stars were visible. [348] The phenomenon dripped and pooled, silver-blue rivulets running down rock faces, gathering in depressions where it shimmered and slowly faded. [367] Bleeding starlight, just as the messengers had described before their minds broke. [379]

"Beautiful, isn't it?" [382]

The queen turned. [385] An old woman stood at the grotto's edge, though no one had been there moments before. [401] Her eyes held the same cobalt shade as the surrounding stone. [413]

"You sent the dreams," the queen said, her softly commanding tone unwavering even here, even now. [430]

"I sent the invitation." [434] The woman moved closer, and her steps made no sound. [446] "The question is why you answered. [453] Most monarchs ignore such summons, too wrapped in their golden certainties." [464]

"I have no certainties left." [469] The confession emerged easier than expected. [476] "Only questions and these visions that won't release me." [486]

The old woman smiled, an expression of lacy menace—delicate as frost patterns, dangerous as the blade beneath. [503] "Then watch." [505]

She gestured toward the bleeding starlight, and the queen saw shapes forming in the luminescence: her kingdom's future, branching and splitting like lightning, each path showing different devastations, different salvations. [533]

"I don't understand," the queen whispered. [539]

"You will." [541] The woman took her hand—her grip surprisingly warm—and together they moved to the grotto's edge. [557] The clouds below had thinned with evening's approach. [566] They stood in shared silence, and then, with a shared exhale, they spotted them: the first fireflies of summer rising from the valleys below, tiny stars ascending to meet the bleeding light above. [598]

In that moment, watching life mirror the heavens, the queen understood. [609] The dreams weren't warnings of one fixed destiny but invitations to choose, to act, to climb beyond comfortable despair. [628] The bleeding starlight wasn't a wound but a threshold, light escaping from whatever lay beyond the stone, beyond the known world. [650]

"What must I do?" [654] she asked.

The old woman's smile softened. [660] "Return. [661] Rule. [662] But remember what you've seen—that even stars can bleed, even queens can climb, and some mysteries unravel not into answers but into choices." [687]

The queen began her descent as darkness fell, fireflies lighting her path downward, her disenchantment transformed into something harder, clearer, more dangerous: purpose. [710]
