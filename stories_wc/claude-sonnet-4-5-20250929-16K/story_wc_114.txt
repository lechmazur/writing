After the fever broke, Mira returned to the weather station's observation deck with hands that still trembled. [17] The mountain air cut clean and cold through her lungs, sharper than it had been in the delirium's haze. [35] For six days, she'd lain in the narrow cot while Chen monitored both the instruments and her temperature, feeding her broth and recording barometric pressure in the same steady rhythm. [65] Now she stood alone at dawn, watching auroras paint the sky in shades of green and violet—beautiful and departing, like everything that mattered. [89]

The botanical illustration lay on her desk where she'd left it three weeks ago, before the fever took her. [108] Her sister's work: a precise rendering of alpine forget-me-nots, each petal's vein mapped in ink, each stamen counted and true. [129] Eva had drawn it the summer before the avalanche, before the mountain took her in a way the weather models had called unlikely, probability margins too small to warrant alarm. [159]

Mira had been the oracle then, the one who read the snow and sky. [175] Fault-tolerant, they called her forecasting method—building in expected errors, accepting that certainty was a myth at this altitude where weather systems collided and created their own rules. [206] She gave probability ranges, confidence intervals, acknowledged the margins where her knowledge frayed. [219] But she had read those margins wrong. [226]

She touched the illustration now, her fingertip accidentally smudging the graphite shadows beneath the smallest bloom. [242] The mark spread like a bruise. [249] Eva had occupied margins too, preferring the peripheral zones where weather happened—not the station's center but the boundary territories, the ecotones where alpine flowers somehow endured. [274] "Truth lives in the edges," Eva had said. [283] "The places where one thing becomes another." [291]

Mira had swallowed a truth the day Eva died, felt it lodge somewhere between her throat and stomach like a stone. [312] For two years, she'd carried that weight, never speaking it, never letting it surface even in her own thoughts. [331] But fever had a way of loosening such things. [341] In the delirium, she'd spoken to Eva's ghost, had confessed aloud what she'd always been peripherally aware of but refused to center: she had seen the data anomalies that morning. [372] Subtle shifts in the snowpack monitors, the kind that lived in the error margins, the noise she'd been trained to filter out. [395] She'd made the fault-tolerant choice, the reasonable choice. [404] The avalanche probability was still low. [410] Not worth a warning. [414]

But Eva had died in that narrow margin of uncertainty. [425]

The sky brightened, aurora fading into ordinary dawn, and Mira felt the sorrow of it—how something so luminous could vanish so completely, leaving only pale blue absence. [453] She picked up the illustration, carried it to the window. [464] In this light, she could see how Eva had worked by occupying the margins of the page, building the image from the edges inward, letting the flowers emerge from white space rather than imposing them upon it. [501]

Chen appeared in the doorway with tea. [508] "You should still be resting," he said, but his voice held no insistence. [522]

"I need to recalibrate the snowpack sensors," Mira said. [532] "The sensitivity thresholds. [536] We're filtering too much out." [541]

"The models will be less certain," Chen warned. [549] "More false positives." [552]

"Yes." [553] Mira held the illustration against the window, the paper translucent in the dawn. [567] "But certainty is what killed her. [573] My certainty that the margins didn't matter." [580]

She would become a different kind of oracle now—one who gave weight to the swaying edges, who honored the uncertain spaces where truth actually lived. [606] The illustration's flowers seemed to glow in the backlight, fragile and exact, Eva's truth made visible. [623] Mira would carry that weight forward, no longer swallowed but held up to the light. [638] She would forecast from the margins, where all the real weather happened, where small probabilities could still mean everything. [657]

The mountain air steadied her hands. [663] She pressed the illustration to her chest and turned back to the instruments, ready to recalibrate not just the sensors but her own understanding of what mattered. [690] The smudge on the paper remained, a small imperfection, proof that even the most careful rendering could be altered by a single touch. [713] Proof that everything swayed, nothing stayed fixed, and that was not weakness but the only honest way to see. [732]

Outside, the sun climbed higher, burning off the sorrow but never quite erasing it. [747] Some weights, once swallowed and then spoken, became part of you forever—not burden but ballast, keeping you grounded in the thin mountain air. [771]
