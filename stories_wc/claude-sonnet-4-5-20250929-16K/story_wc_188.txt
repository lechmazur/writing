Mara arrived at the blooming fortress just as dusk painted the walls purple, her leather satchel heavy with copper filings and sulfur compounds. [23] She was a wandering fireworks designer, following rumors of places where light had forgotten its purpose. [38] The fortress walls crawled with moonflowers opening their white faces to the darkening sky, but something felt wrong—the blossoms seemed to droop even as they bloomed. [62]

"Ash to ember, ember to sky," she chanted while walking through the main gate, her voice low and rhythmic. [80] The guards didn't stop her; they barely looked up, their eyes glazed with a peculiar emptiness. [96] She continued her chant, an old habit that helped her filter the world's noise from its whispers, separating what mattered from what merely existed. [119]

Through ambient awareness—that sixth sense she'd cultivated across a dozen kingdoms—Mara felt the fortress's sickness. [135] It wasn't plague or siege, but hopelessness, thick as morning fog. [147] The people moved like sleepwalkers, tending gardens they couldn't see, maintaining defenses against enemies they no longer feared or cared about. [167]

In the central courtyard, she found what she'd been seeking without knowing it: a vast mosaic depicting the fortress's founding. [187] Most visitors would see only decorative tiles arranged in battle scenes and harvest celebrations. [201] But Mara walked the mosaic's perimeter, still chanting, and the pattern shifted in her perception like a puzzle solving itself. [221] Hidden in the arrangement of colored stones was a note, a message written by the fortress's architect centuries ago: "When stars refuse to witness, make your own." [248]

She smiled, the expression sharp with understanding and mischief. [257] This was why she wandered—to defy the gravity of hopelessness wherever it tried to pull people down into forgetting. [276]

That night, during the hush of a night with no stars, Mara climbed to the fortress's highest tower. [295] She'd spent the evening in preparation, soaking rags in kerosene, binding them into intricate knots the way fire spinners did. [314] But she wasn't planning a performance—she was planning a resurrection. [325]

The fortress's commander found her there, a woman whose armor hung loose on her frame. [340] "You're the fireworks maker," she said flatly. [348] "We have no festivals to celebrate." [354]

"Then I'll make my own reason," Mara replied, attaching the first kerosene rag knot to her launching apparatus. [371] "Your mosaic told me something. [377] The fortress was built by someone who understood that hope isn't found—it's manufactured." [391]

"Pretty words," the commander muttered. [396]

"Watch," Mara said, and lit the first charge. [405]

The kerosene knot spiraled upward, tumbling through the starless void, then exploded in a cascade of gold and crimson. [424] But this wasn't mere spectacle—Mara had designed each burst to hang longer in the air, to drift and combine, to write messages in light against the darkness. [452] She launched another, then another, her movements a dance of serious playfulness, each gesture precise yet joyful. [469]

Through ambient awareness, she felt the fortress stirring below. [478] People emerged from barracks and homes, their faces turning skyward. [488] She filtered her art through everything she'd learned in her wanderings—the colors that spoke to memory, the patterns that bypassed reason and struck directly at the heart. [513]

The kerosene knots wrote temporary poetry: spirals that suggested growth, stars that replaced the absent ones, phoenixes that rose and rose again. [534] Each explosion was a note in the larger mosaic she was painting across the night sky. [551]

By dawn, when the moonflowers closed their petals, the fortress had changed. [563] Not transformed completely—hopelessness doesn't surrender in a single night—but cracked, letting light seep through. [578] The commander stood straighter, her eyes wet with something like recognition. [589]

Mara packed her satchel, already chanting the walking-song that would carry her to the next place that needed reminding. [607] "Ash to ember, ember to sky," she murmured, and the fortress bloomed behind her, truly bloomed, as she wandered on. [627]
