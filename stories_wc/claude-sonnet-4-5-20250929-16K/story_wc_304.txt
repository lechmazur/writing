The grotto floated three miles above the cloudline, suspended by winds no mortal science could chart. [15] Kael had practiced her dual craft here for seventeen years, beautician and mortician both, preparing the departed for their last passage beneath the aurora's streaming fire. [37] Tonight the lights ran green and violet, casting their ancient glow through the grotto's open ceiling, illuminating the body before her. [57]

The woman on the stone table had been a weaver. [67] Kael could tell by the calluses, the slight rightward bend of the spine, the way the fingers curved even in death's stillness. [88] She worked with lucidly watchful attention, seeing everything, missing nothing, aware that time contracted in these heights where breath itself grew thin. [109]

From her kit she drew the emerald chip, no larger than a thumbnail, its facets catching aurora light. [126] This fragment held properties she'd spent years learning to channel: memory, essence, the crystallized moments that defined a life. [145] She placed it on the weaver's forehead, at the threshold of stillness where body met whatever came after. [163]

Kael closed her eyes and began her work. [171] The method had come to her gradually, revealed through practice and patience: finding patterns in static. [186] The dead gave off a kind of white noise, a soft crackling frequency that most people couldn't perceive. [204] But Kael had trained herself to hear it, and more—to see within it the shapes of who they'd been. [224]

She let the static wash over her, not forcing, not grasping. [236] Patterns emerged like constellations: a child's laughter, the smell of dyed wool, morning light through workshop windows, hands moving in the sacred rhythm of the loom. [260] These were the sparks, the luminous fragments that remained even as the body cooled. [275]

Her motivation was simple and profound: to capture one last spark before oblivion claimed everything. [290] Not to resurrect or preserve, but to acknowledge, to honor, to infuse the body with the echo of its own lived radiance before releasing it to the sky. [317]

Kael opened her eyes. [321] The emerald chip glowed with soft inner light now, saturated with what she'd gathered from the static. [338] She began her beautician's work, but transformed—each touch infused with the patterns she'd witnessed. [352] She arranged the hair in the style the weaver had favored at twenty, when she'd first mastered her craft. [371] She mixed pigments to match the flush of pride the woman had felt presenting her finest tapestry to the mountain lords. [392] She positioned the hands as they'd moved through thousands of hours of patient creation. [407]

The aurora intensified overhead, as if responding to her work. [418] In this skyborne grotto, the boundaries between worlds grew gossamer-thin. [429] Kael understood she was not merely preparing a body but performing a translation, converting the static's patterns into visible testament. [448]

She stepped back, her work complete. [454] The weaver looked not merely dead but transfigured, radiant with the particular light that had been uniquely hers. [471] The emerald chip had turned cloudy, its purpose fulfilled, its energy spent. [484] Kael removed it gently and set it aside. [493]

She spoke the traditional words, her voice barely a whisper in the radiant hush: "You are seen. [509] You are known. [512] You are released." [515]

The stone table began its slow mechanical descent, lowering the body toward the aperture in the grotto's floor. [532] Far below, the consecrated winds would receive her, scattering her atoms across a thousand miles of sky. [549] But she would fall as herself, marked by the life she'd lived, carrying that last captured spark into whatever darkness or light awaited. [572]

Kael watched until the body disappeared from sight. [580] Then she turned to her basin, washing her hands in collected aurora-melt, preparing for the next soul that would arrive on tomorrow's winds. [602]

The aurora whispered overhead, green and violet and gold. [612] In the threshold of stillness, in the space between ending and after, she kept her vigil. [628] Lucidly watchful. [630] Always listening for the patterns. [635] Always ready to catch the spark before it fled forever into the vast, waiting dark. [651]
