Layla arrived at the arboretum before dawn, when the automated beacon from the distant point still swept across the glass conservatory walls. [22] The last lighthouse keeper had retired three years ago, replaced by solar panels and sensors, leaving this clifftop garden the only place where human attention still mattered. [49]

She carried the crumpled photograph in her shirt pocket, always. [59] The paper had worn soft as cloth from years of worried handling—her and Samir on their wedding day, frozen mid-laugh under a canopy of white flowers. [85] Twenty-three people in that courtyard. [91] Eleven survived. [93]

The arboretum's director had hired her without questions when she'd appeared four years ago, recognizing something in her careful silence. [113] Layla proved quietly talented with the Mediterranean specimens—the olive trees and rosemary hedges that somehow thrived in the salt wind. [133] She understood survival. [136] She knew which plants needed shelter from the harsh coastal gales and which grew stronger for the struggle. [155]

Her hands moved through the morning tasks with practiced efficiency: checking soil moisture, pruning dead growth, noting which seedlings had pushed through overnight. [176] The work kept her anchored. [181] It gave her body something to do besides remember. [191]

Through somatic markers, the trauma lived on. [198] Her therapist had explained it: the body keeps score even when the mind tries to move forward. [216] A plane's distant drone would send her heart racing before conscious thought caught up. [231] Sudden noises made her freeze, muscles locked, breath suspended, transported instantly back to the moment the world turned to fire and screaming. [252]

But here, among the green growing things, she had learned to recognize the signs earlier. [268] When her shoulders began to tighten, when her breathing shallowed, she would stop and place both palms flat against the cool glass wall overlooking the sea. [293] She would count the waves. [298] Find the rhythm. [301]

She called it her pearl of stillness—that small, luminous moment when the body's alarm finally quieted and she could simply exist. [322] Not happy, not healed, but present. [329] Real. [330]

Today she was propagating lavender from cuttings, her fingers gentle with the delicate stems. [344] A school group was scheduled for noon, children who would run shrieking through the paths, and she was preparing herself. [364] Their joy didn't hurt anymore, not exactly, but it required something from her—a conscious choice to anchor optimism in realism, to believe that the world contained both what happened to her and what was happening here, now, in this moment. [403]

The photograph crinkled as she bent over the potting bench. [413] She pulled it out, unfolded it carefully. [420] Samir smiled up at her, forever young, forever about to say something that would make her laugh. [438] She had survived and he hadn't, and there was no sense to be made of that mathematics. [456]

But she could plant these cuttings. [462] She could teach children the names of growing things. [471] She could stand at the cliff's edge when the panic came and breathe with the waves until her body remembered it was safe. [493]

A sound made her freeze—a helicopter, low and fast across the water. [506] Her pulse spiked. [509] Sweat prickled her neck. [513] The potting soil blurred. [517]

She set down the cutting with exaggerated care and walked to the glass wall. [531] Palms flat. [533] Cool surface. [535] The helicopter was already disappearing around the headland, probably coast guard, routine patrol. [549] She counted breaths. [552] One wave. [554] Two waves. [556] Three. [557]

The tightness in her chest began to ease. [566] The pearl of stillness formed slowly, microscopic layers of calm over the irritant of fear. [582] Not perfect. [584] Not whole. [586] But enough. [588]

She returned to her lavender cuttings. [594] The children would arrive soon. [599] She would be ready. [603] The arboretum would bloom around them all, persistent and true, clinging to its cliff while the automated light swept emptily across the water. [626] She tucked the photograph back against her heart and pressed her fingers into the dark, rich earth. [644]

This was the work: to tend what could still grow. [654] To freeze when she must, then thaw again. [663] To survive not just the violence but also the endless, ordinary after. [676] The Mediterranean herbs released their scent as she moved among them, sharp and clean, anchoring her to this particular morning, this specific now. [699]

It was enough. [702] It had to be. [707] And some days, like today, it almost was. [716]
