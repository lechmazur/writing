The mirrors still worked in the abandoned carnival funhouse, though Vera wished they didn't. [13] Each reflection showed her photographically cursed face—every image ever taken of her had stolen a fragment of her features, leaving her appearance distorted, blurred at the edges like an overexposed negative. [42] She clutched the opera cloak clasp in her palm, the silver warm against her skin, its lingering luminance casting pale green light across the warped glass. [67]

"You're afraid of the wrong thing," came the whisper behind her. [77] The advisor—she'd never learned his actual name—materialized from the shadows between two funhouse mirrors, his form as indistinct as her own face. [100] He'd found her three days after the resuscitation, after the paramedics had shocked her heart back into rhythm and she'd opened her eyes to discover the curse had deepened during those two minutes of death. [135]

"Fear isn't the enemy," he continued, his voice like silk dragged across broken glass, repulsive yet magnetic. [151] "Fear is the map." [155]

Vera turned the clasp over, watching the luminance pulse. [164] It had belonged to her grandmother, a stage actress who'd understood the peculiar magnetism of the grotesque, who'd worn elaborate costumes that both attracted and repelled audiences. [188] The clasp was all that remained after the fire, still glowing faintly with whatever strange energy had preserved it. [206]

"I'm listening," Vera said. [210]

The advisor produced a leather-bound book from his coat—a dream dictionary, but unlike any she'd seen. [227] Its pages were filled with paradoxical notes, definitions that contradicted themselves. [238] "To fall is to rise," one entry read. [246] "To drown is to breathe." [251]

"Your grandmother left this," he whispered. [257] "She knew the curse would pass to you. [265] She knew you'd need to trick fear into revealing its weakness." [276]

Vera took the dictionary, its cover warm like living skin. [286] The funhouse around them seemed to contract, the warped mirrors multiplying their distorted forms into infinity. [301] She wanted to unbosom herself of everything—the terror of watching her face disappear, the isolation of being unphotographable, the horror of dying and returning even more cursed. [328]

"Read the entry for 'reflection,'" the advisor urged. [336]

She found the page. [340] The paradoxical note stated: "A reflection is not what you see but what sees you. [355] To fear your image is to give it power. [365] To love your absence is to become whole." [374]

The lingering luminance of the clasp intensified, flooding the funhouse with that repulsive, beautiful green light. [389] Vera understood suddenly—her grandmother hadn't been cursed. [397] She'd chosen this, had allowed photographs to take her features until she became undefined, unfixed, free. [413]

"Fear thinks it's winning when you hide," the advisor whispered. [423] "But fear's weakness is that it believes in permanence. [432] It doesn't understand that dissolution can be transformation." [440]

Vera pinned the clasp to her collar and faced the nearest mirror. [452] Instead of recoiling from her blurred face, she leaned closer, studying the way her features seemed to shift and flow. [471] She looked like smoke, like possibility, like something that couldn't be captured because it refused to stay still. [489]

The fear that had gripped her since the resuscitation began to crack. [501] She'd been afraid of disappearing, but what if disappearing was the point? [513] What if the curse was actually a key? [522]

"What do I do?" [526] she asked.

"Unbosom yourself to the mirrors," the advisor said. [535] "Tell them everything you fear. [541] Watch how fear cannot hold what refuses to be solid." [551]

So Vera spoke, pouring out her terror to the distorted reflections, and with each confession, her image grew more indistinct, more luminous, more free. [573] The funhouse seemed to breathe with her, its warped reality no longer a prison but a sanctuary for those who'd learned to love their own dissolution. [598]

When she finally fell silent, the advisor was gone, but the opera cloak clasp still glowed against her chest, and in the mirrors, something beautiful and terrible smiled back—not quite her, not quite anyone, but gloriously, impossibly alive. [635]

She walked out of the funhouse as dawn broke, her photographically cursed face catching the light, becoming shadow, becoming everything fear could never contain. [658]
