In the mirror world, where everything existed in reverse shadow, Elara lived as pieces. [14] She was a scattered memory keeper, her consciousness fragmented across dozens of glass shards that floated through the alchemical orchard greenhouse like luminous moths. [37] Each fragment held a different memory from the dying realm—a child's laughter, the scent of bread baking, the weight of a lover's hand. [61] But the memories were fading, just like the realm itself, which had been shrouded in endless night for seven years. [81]

The greenhouse had once been a place of transformation, where alchemists cultivated impossible fruits that bridged worlds. [98] Now the trees stood skeletal and dark, their branches reaching toward a sky that never brightened. [114] At the greenhouse's heart stood a single mica window, its translucent layers catching what little luminescence remained in Elara's scattered form. [133]

Through that window, when her fragments aligned just right, she could see them: the woven dawns. [149] They were mornings stolen from the past, from before the mirror world had inverted into permanent darkness. [166] Each dawn was a thread of gold and rose, tangled with the others in a great tapestry just beyond reach. [186] If she could gather them, pull them through, she might rekindle what had been lost. [202]

But Elara's scattered nature made focus nearly impossible. [210] Her memories drifted, colliding and separating, each shard pulling in different directions. [222] She needed something to bind herself together, at least temporarily. [232] That's when she remembered the forgotten songs. [239]

They had been sung by the first communities of the mirror world, melodies that knits communities together across distances, before the darkness came and people retreated into isolated pockets of dying light. [268] The songs existed in her oldest shards, the fragments she'd kept longest. [280] Elara began to hum, and her pieces trembled, drawn by the sound. [292]

The melody was simple but insistent, a lullaby meant to swaddle newborns in their first moments. [308] As she sang, her fragments drew closer, orbiting the mica window in tightening spirals. [322] The song was about bound release—about wrapping something tight so it could grow strong enough to break free. [340] Her grandmother had sung it in the time before mirrors inverted, when dawn still came. [355]

Through the window, the woven dawns began to pulse. [365] Elara sang louder, and more forgotten songs rose from her scattered memories. [377] Harvesting chants, wedding hymns, mourning dirges—every song that had once bound people together. [390] The mica window began to glow, its layered sheets resonating with different frequencies of her voice. [406]

The woven dawns responded, threads loosening from their distant tangle. [416] They slipped through the mica like light through water, entering the greenhouse in streams of gold and amber. [433] Elara shaped them with her songs, weaving the dawn-threads around the dead trees, which shuddered and began to bloom. [452]

But the dawns needed more than trees. [459] They needed people. [462] Elara gathered her fragments with great effort and drifted through the greenhouse walls, out into the scattered settlements where families huddled in the dark. [485] She sang the forgotten songs over each home, each gathering place, and the woven dawns followed, wrapping around the buildings like gentle hands that swaddle infants. [509]

Where the dawn-light touched, people emerged, blinking in wonder. [518] They began to sing too—first tentatively, then with growing strength. [528] The songs Elara had preserved in her scattered memory now returned to living throats, and the communities that had isolated themselves in darkness began to reach toward one another. [555]

Elara felt herself growing thinner, each song releasing another fragment of her being into the rekindled realm. [572] This was the bound release she'd always carried—she was held together only by the dying world's need, and as it healed, she could finally let go. [598]

Through the glowing mica window, she watched the woven dawns spread across the mirror world's sky, a tapestry of mornings that would last. [620] Her final fragment dissolved as the first true sunrise broke over the alchemical orchard, where impossible fruits were already beginning to grow again. [643] The forgotten songs remained, carried now by the communities she'd knit back together, held in throats instead of glass shards. [663] And in the mirror world, where everything existed in reverse, the scattered memory keeper found wholeness in dissolution, binding the realm by releasing herself into its light. [690]
