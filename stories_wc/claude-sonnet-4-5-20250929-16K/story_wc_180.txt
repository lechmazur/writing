Mara had broken sixteen deciduous vows before the Guild finally noticed. [11] Each autumn, she'd sworn to train only their approved apprentices, and each spring, those promises fell away like apple blossoms. [31] Now, clutching her worn leather bag and her daughter's hair ribbon—the only thing her granddaughter had left behind—she climbed the crumbling stairs of the abandoned Cathedral of Seven Mercies. [60]

The rumors spoke of an orchard in the rafters. [69] Mara needed to see if they were true. [77]

She emerged into impossible beauty. [82] Where vaulted ceilings should have been, gnarled apple trees stretched across ancient oak beams, their roots threading through stone and timber. [103] Fruit hung heavy among the crossbeams, and dappled sunlight filtered through leaves that had no business existing a hundred feet above ground. [126] The air smelled of ripening pears and old incense. [136]

"You shouldn't have come." [140] The voice belonged to a young woman perched on a beam, surrounded by glass bottles of various sizes. [158] She wore her copper hair in a practical braid, and her eyes—one brown, one an imperfect quartz replacement—fixed on Mara with familiar stubbornness. [181]

"Lisel." [182] Mara's voice cracked. [185] "I've been searching for six months." [191]

"I told Mother I didn't want to be found." [200] Lisel's endearingly feisty nature showed in how she crossed her arms while balanced thirty feet above the nave floor. [219] "Especially not by the quartz-eye mender who broke every promise she made." [232]

"Those were deciduous vows," Mara said, testing her weight on a thick branch that bridged two beams. [249] "Meant to be shed. [253] The Guild wanted me to refuse anyone without their blessing, anyone who couldn't pay their fees." [269] She persisted forward, branch by careful branch. [276] "I couldn't turn away people who needed eyes to see their children, their work, their world." [293]

"You turned away from me." [298] Lisel's manufactured eye caught the light, revealing hairline fractures Mara had trained her whole life to repair. [315] "Too busy with everyone else's family." [322]

Mara reached the beam where Lisel sat, breathing hard. [331] The height made her dizzy, but she lowered herself beside her granddaughter, letting her legs dangle into open air. [350] "You're right," she said, surprised by her own admission. [360] "I thought the craft was enough to leave you. [370] I thought if I preserved the skill, you'd understand everything else." [382]

She fumbled with her bag, the one she'd carried for forty years. [395] Among the usual tools—grinding stones, polishing cloths, calibration rods—her fingers found something forgotten. [408] A half-finished quartz eye, one she'd been crafting the day Lisel had left. [423] She'd meant it as a gift, a teaching tool, something to bridge the gap between them. [440]

"This was for you," Mara said, holding up the cloudy orb. [452] "To show you how we capture light in the facets, how each angle serves purpose." [468] She turned it slowly. [472] "I got the geometry wrong. [477] Kept trying to force perfection, but perfection makes them look dead. [489] The flaws make them alive." [494]

Lisel leaned closer, her damaged eye reflecting the unfinished stone. [505] "You taught me that once. [510] When I was ten." [514]

"Did I?" [516] Mara smiled. [518] "Then maybe I wasn't completely absent." [524] She looked at her granddaughter's fractured eye. [532] "Let me fix this one. [537] And you can tell me why you're collecting rainwater in bottles among the trees." [552]

"I'm growing medicine," Lisel said softly. [558] "Using what falls naturally—rain, fruit, leaves. [565] The Guild charges too much for healing draughts. [573] Someone taught me that some rules deserve to be broken." [584]

Mara laughed, pulling out her tools as fruit ripened overhead and light danced through impossible branches. [601] "Then let's both persist," she said, threading her finest wire. [612] "You show me what you've learned about letting things grow wild, and I'll show you what I should have taught you years ago." [635] She tied the daughter's hair ribbon around both their wrists, a new vow, neither permanent nor thoughtless. [653] "Wisdom falls when it's ready, like leaves," Mara said, not meaning to sound profound but somehow landing there anyway. [672] "We just have to be standing underneath when it does." [683]

Above them, apples ripened in cathedral light, and for the first time in years, both mender and apprentice reached for the same tools, the same future, the same carefully flawed craft. [713]
