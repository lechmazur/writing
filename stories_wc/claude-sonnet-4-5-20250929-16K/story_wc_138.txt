The immortal known as Vesper had lived through seventeen thousand solar cycles, and now she sat in her prismatic escondite, watching auroras dance through crystalline walls while magnetic storms raged overhead. [31] She pressed her palm against the fragment of cursed amulet embedded in her wrist, feeling its familiar pull toward spaces that shouldn't exist. [54] The fragment had been there for three centuries, a constant companion in her eternal tedium, its curse both burden and gift: it made her dimensionally aware, able to perceive the thin places where reality folded into itself. [89]

Today's solar storm was different. [94] Through the prismatic walls of her hidden sanctuary, Vesper watched as magnetic fields twisted into impossible geometries, creating corridors between dimensions that flickered like whispered promises. [116] She had retreated here after watching her last mortal friend die, after speaking that final goodbye at the funeral, after wondering for the thousandth time what came after those partings for the ones who could actually leave. [151]

The amulet fragment began to burn. [157] 

Vesper stood, her ancient bones remembering urgency. [164] The magnetic fields outside were organizing themselves into something purposeful, almost intelligent. [175] She recognized the pattern immediately—spatial mutiny. [182] The very fabric of location was rebelling against its fixed nature, dimensions attempting to overthrow their assigned positions in the cosmic hierarchy. [203] It happened perhaps once every millennium, always during solar storms when magnetic fields grew strong enough to challenge the laws of physics themselves. [225]

But she had never witnessed it from inside a dimensionally-aware consciousness before. [237]

Through her fragment-enhanced perception, Vesper saw the mutiny unfolding across multiple planes simultaneously. [250] Spaces that should have remained separate were negotiating new arrangements, trading places like conspirators in some vast intrigue. [268] Her prismatic escondite, built at the convergence of seven dimensional faults, was becoming the epicenter. [284]

She felt the first displacement as a gentle tug, then watched as her sanctuary's eastern wall suddenly opened onto a beach that existed three dimensions sideways. [310] The smell of salt water that had never known earthly oceans filled the air. [325] The fragment in her wrist thrummed with approval, pulling her forward. [337]

For the first time in millennia, Vesper felt something like fear, and something even rarer—hope. [353]

The spatial mutiny was creating temporary bridges between all states of existence. [365] If she moved quickly, if she followed the magnetic field lines that were rewiring reality itself, she might find an answer to the question that had haunted her since she realized her immortality was absolute. [400] What happened after goodbye? [404] Where did the dead actually go? [411]

She had always assumed death was simply cessation, but the dimensionally-aware fragment whispered otherwise. [425] It showed her glimpses: departed souls weren't destroyed but displaced, moved to spaces where time ran differently, where goodbye became a transition rather than an ending. [451]

The aurora overhead intensified, and through it, Vesper saw a path. [463] The magnetic fields were creating a staircase of sorts, each step a different dimensional layer, each leading closer to that place beyond final farewells. [488] The fragment burned hotter, warning her this was temporary, that spatial mutiny always resolved itself, usually within hours. [506]

She had hours, then, to discover what seventeen thousand years of goodbyes had actually meant. [521]

Vesper stepped through her eastern wall onto the impossible beach. [532] The sand beneath her feet hummed with magnetic potential. [542] Above her, the solar storm painted the sky in colors that had no names in any language she had learned across the centuries. [567] The prismatic escondite behind her was already shifting, its walls cycling through configurations that would cease to exist once the mutiny ended. [590]

She walked forward, following the pull of the cursed fragment, chasing the hushed thunder of dimensions rearranging themselves, finally unafraid of what she might find in those spaces beyond goodbye. [616] 

The magnetic fields embraced her like old friends, and Vesper, the bored immortal, began to climb through layers of reality toward an answer she had stopped believing existed. [642]

Perhaps, she thought, some eternities were meant to end. [652] Perhaps immortality's true curse wasn't lasting forever, but never knowing what forever was protecting her from discovering. [670]

The fragment pulsed once, twice, and pulled her through into the space between dimensions, where all goodbyes waited to be understood. [692]
