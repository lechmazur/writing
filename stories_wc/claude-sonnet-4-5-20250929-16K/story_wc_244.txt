The disused railway station had become Vera's cathedral of controlled chaos, its platforms choked with ivy that crept through cracked windows like curious parishioners. [26] She'd chosen this place precisely because no one looking for order would ever think to check here. [44]

"So you're telling me," she said into her satellite phone, perched atop a rusted luggage cart, "that the medical supplies are in Budapest, the doctors think they're in Bucharest, and the actual emergency is in Bratislava?" [74] She laughed, that bright, brittle sound she'd perfected over fifteen years of impossible logistics. [88] "Magnificent. Absolutely magnificent." [91]

This was how Vera operated—desperately jocular in the face of catastrophe, turning crisis into comedy because the alternative was drowning in the weight of all that need. [115]

The elusive logistician, they called her in the relief community. [125] She'd cultivated that reputation carefully, never appearing at official conferences, never filing proper reports, yet somehow always knowing exactly which warehouse held forgotten antibiotics or which retired pilot owed someone a favor. [155] Her method defied every protocol: she worked through improbable rumor chains, tracking whispers and gossip across continents, turning coffee shop conversations and market square speculation into functional supply lines. [181]

On the vine-strangled bench beside her sat her most peculiar possession—a fragment of moon rock no larger than a chess piece, mounted in scratched Lucite. [205] It had started as payment from an astronaut whose family she'd helped evacuate from a flooded town in Colombia. [224] But the moon rock had become something more: the cornerstone of her economy of reciprocity. [239]

Everyone who received Vera's help understood the unspoken rule. [248] You didn't pay her back—you paid forward, and when she needed something impossible, you delivered. [264] The moon rock sat in her meetings like a silent witness to all these debts and obligations, a reminder that even those who'd walked on other worlds were bound by the same human need to balance the scales. [300]

But reciprocity, Vera had learned, couldn't cure the thing she actually suffered from. [313]

"Tell the Budapest warehouse to 'accidentally' route everything to Vienna," she instructed, fingers dancing across her laptop balanced on an overturned bucket. [332] "Then spread a rumor that Vienna has a surplus and is looking to offload medical supplies quietly. [349] Make sure someone from the Bratislava hospital hears this at that café near the opera house." [366]

It would work. [369] It always worked. [372] The beautiful anarchy of it—polite, structured, yet completely subverting every official channel—made her smile. [387]

A young man appeared at the station's broken entrance, pushing aside curtains of ivy. [402] "I heard you could move mountains," he said respectfully, holding a worn notebook. [415] "My village needs—"

"Let me guess," Vera interrupted, still typing. [423] "Clean water, generators, or insulin?" [428]

"All three." [430]

She gestured to the bench, and he sat, eyeing the moon rock with appropriate reverence. [445] This was when the story always changed—the moment a new thread entered her web. [460]

"I can catalyze the help you need," she said, her tone light despite the darkness beneath. [476] "But first, tell me something. Why did you come alone?" [487]

He blinked. [489] "Everyone else was busy with—"

"No." [491] Vera set down her phone, and for a moment, the desperate jocularity fell away. [505] "Why are you, specifically, the one who cares enough to walk three days to find someone most people think is a myth?" [527]

The young man looked at his hands. [534] "Because I know what it's like to stand in a room full of people and feel like you're shouting into a void." [556]

Vera picked up the moon rock, felt its impossible weight. [566] This stranger had just named the thing she'd been trying to fix with every supply chain, every rumor, every favor called in across her web of reciprocity. [593]

She'd been looking for the cure for loneliness in logistics, as if connecting resources to need could somehow connect her to the world. [615]

"Tell me about your village," she said quietly, the ivy rustling against the station's bones. [630] Outside, the old rails led nowhere, but here, in this moment, she felt the story shifting. [647] Maybe the cure wasn't in the having, but in the honest asking. [659]

She began making calls, but this time without the jokes, without the mask. [672] The young man waited, and in his patience, in his presence, Vera felt something catalyze—not a supply chain, but a genuine connection. [693]

The moon rock caught the fading light, and for once, she didn't feel quite so far from home. [711]
