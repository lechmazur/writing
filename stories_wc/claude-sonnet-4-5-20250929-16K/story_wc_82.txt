The crafty lantern maker understood that grief, like light, needed a vessel. [12] After the shadow detached from her daughter's body, leaving only stillness on the infirmary cot, Mira returned to her workshop in the floating island tea garden, where steam from celestial kettles mingled with clouds. [45] The glass basilica loomed above on its higher tier of the isle, its crystalline spires refracting dawn into a thousand colors that felt like mockery. [71]

She had promised herself she would fold one thousand origami cranes, each one holding a fraction of her anguish, until the weight became bearable. [95] But paper alone could not contain what churned inside her—this luminous torment that made every breath shine with unshed tears while simultaneously crushing her chest. [118] So Mira began to craft something more permanent, more crafty, more true. [130]

Her lanterns had always been special, embedded with dream-recording gems that captured sleepers' visions when hung bedside. [146] Now she would transform her entire practice. [153] She selected a large moonstone, its surface rough and opaque, and began the gem polishing method her mother had taught her decades ago. [175] Small circles, patient pressure, letting the stone reveal its inner architecture. [186] As she worked in the tea garden pavilion, surrounded by floating planters of chamomile and silver needle plants, she watched the glass basilica descend while ascending—an optical phenomenon unique to the floating isles, where perspective shifted as air currents moved different tiers at varying speeds. [226] The building seemed to sink even as it rose, a perfect metaphor for how she felt. [243]

Into the moonstone she polished her first recorded dream, the nightmare that visited her every night: her daughter's shadow peeling away like burnt paper, leaving the body behind. [268] The gem began to glow. [273] Mira threaded it into a paper crane's center, folding rice paper around the light. [288] The crane transformed, becoming something between memory and lantern, between wish and warning. [301] It pulsed with captured sleep, with recorded grief. [309]

She made another. [312] A sapphire polished smooth, containing the dream where her daughter still laughed, still poured tea in this very garden, still pointed at the glass basilica and said it looked like frozen music. [341] This crane glowed blue and warm. [347] 

Night after night, Mira polished gems and folded cranes. [356] The tea garden became a gallery of luminous torment, each paper bird hanging from threads, each one holding a dream-gem heart. [376] Other residents of the floating isle began to visit, drawn by the strange light. [390] They brought their own griefs, their own nightmares, their own shadows that had detached or threatened to detach. [408] Mira taught them the craft: polish the gem until it accepts the dream, fold the paper until it becomes a vessel, transform pain into something that could fly. [435]

The glass basilica descended while ascending, and Mira understood finally what this meant. [448] Grief took you down into darkness even as life insisted you rise into each new day. [465] You sank into memory while climbing toward survival. [473] The floating isle itself embodied this paradox—earth that fell through sky while somehow never reaching ground. [489]

On the thousandth crane, Mira used a clear diamond, the most difficult gem to polish because it showed every imperfection. [508] She recorded her most recent dream: her daughter's shadow reattaching, not to her body, but to every lantern Mira had ever made, every light she'd crafted to guide people through darkness. [537] The diamond blazed like a captive star. [544] She folded it into the final crane and hung it in the tea garden. [559]

The glass basilica caught the morning sun, and suddenly every crane illuminated, a thousand dream-recorded lights swaying in the wind. [578] Mira poured herself tea and sat among them, descending while ascending, transforming while remaining, crafting light from the luminous torment of love that persists after shadows detach. [604] Her grief had become a garden, and her daughter's shadow lived in every recorded dream, every polished gem, every paper wing. [625]
