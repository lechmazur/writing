Maren pressed the worn leather diary against the elevator's frost-etched window as the mechanism groaned upward through the icebound spire. [20] The brass cage rattled past the first floor, then the second, carrying her toward the captain's abandoned quarters on the tenth. [40] She had served Captain Thessaly for twelve years aboard the Nimbus Cloud, cleaning quarters and mending sails, until the airship had made its final mooring at this frozen tower above the world. [71]

Now Thessaly was gone—not dead, but hollowed, staring blankly from her hospice bed on the ground floor, her mind lost to the pressure sickness that claimed so many who flew too high. [101] Maren had found the diary tucked inside the captain's navigation chest, its pages covered in symbols that shifted and changed depending on how you looked at them. [128] Encryption, certainly, but of what kind? [134]

The elevator passed the third floor, then the fourth. [143] Maren pulled the captain's goggles from her apron pocket—those ridiculous oversized things with the amber lenses Thessaly had worn at the helm, insisting they helped her see currents in the air itself. [173] She had always been warmly inquisitive about the captain's eccentricities, never mocking, always wondering what truth might hide in seeming madness. [193]

She fitted the goggles over her eyes. [200] Through the amber lenses, the scattered light refracting through the spire's thick ice walls suddenly sharpened into ribbons of gold and crimson. [221] The diary's page blazed to life. [228] The encrypted symbols weren't symbols at all, but tiny precise illustrations that only revealed themselves through scattered light filtered just so. [247]

Fifth floor. [249] Sixth. [250]

Maren watched as the first entry began to unfold before her, the captain's careful drawings resolving into words, into sentences, into meaning. [271] "Today I taught young Maren the difference between cumulus and cumulonimbus," the first entry read. [286] "She laughed when I said the clouds had different personalities, then asked with such earnest curiosity whether I had ever met an angry cloud." [309] 

Maren's throat tightened. [312] She remembered that day, her first week aboard, how patient the captain had been with a servant girl who knew nothing of sky or sail. [336]

Seventh floor. [338] The elevator climbed steadily as Maren turned pages, watching them unfold through the goggles' amber light. [353] Entry after entry revealed not the navigation logs she had expected, but tiny moments of joy carefully preserved in secret ink and scattered light. [377] "Maren sang while polishing the binnacle today—some folk tune about earthbound farmers. [389] Made me remember there are people who never look up." [399] Another: "Asked Maren what she thought of the sunset from ten thousand feet. [412] She said it looked like God had spilled his paint. [423] Such unschooled poetry." [426]

Eighth floor. [428] Ninth. [429]

The later entries darkened, the illustrations more hurried, the words betraying the pressure sickness creeping in. [444] "Can't remember if I've eaten. [450] Maren brought soup. [453] She worries. [455] Good girl." [457] Then: "The altitude is taking something from me. [466] I feel it dissolving, who I was, what I loved. [477] I've hidden these pages in scattered light because maybe, when I'm gone, someone will find them and know that I was here, that I noticed beauty, that I cherished small things." [510]

The elevator shuddered to a halt at the tenth floor. [521]

Maren removed the goggles slowly, holding them like they held the captain's soul. [534] In a way, they did. [540] Thessaly had encrypted her joy, hidden it away in light and lens and paper, preserving what the altitude would steal. [561] The diary wasn't navigation logs or airship secrets—it was evidence of love, scattered across pages like light through ice. [580]

Maren tucked both diary and goggles into her apron and stepped into the captain's quarters to begin packing. [598] She would read the rest later, seeking out every moment of joy the captain had recorded beneath her anguish. [617] It was what remained of Thessaly—not the hollow woman below, but these fragments of attention and affection, caught and kept. [637]

The elevator descended, carrying Maren back down through the frozen spire. [648] She felt affectionately detached from her own grief now, understanding that she held something more permanent than sorrow. [666] She held proof that someone had noticed her, had written her into their private sky, had loved the world enough to encrypt it against forgetting. [692]

Outside the spire, clouds drifted past like patient ghosts. [701] Maren thought perhaps they did have personalities after all. [711]
