The bunker revealed itself only when she stopped looking for it, as most important things do. [16] Hindsight knew this from experience—from all those futures she'd glimpsed and all those pasts she'd witnessed, though the present remained forever blind to her. [40] Her companions called her Foresight Hindsight Only, a name that had become less joke than job description over the years. [60] Now the vine-draped concrete structure emerged from the rewilded forest like a half-buried memory, moss-thick and patient. [78]

The storm approached from the west, turning the canopy overhead into a churning green sea. [93] She had perhaps an hour, maybe less. [101] Thunder rolled through her bones, and the wind carried that electric smell of transformation. [115]

Inside, the bunker smelled of earth and forgotten purpose. [124] Roots had broken through the ceiling in places, hanging down like the fingers of some sleeping giant. [141] The walls bore faded murals—instructions, perhaps, or warnings—their meanings lost beneath layers of moss and time. [158] At the center of the main chamber, on a concrete pedestal wrapped in flowering vines, sat a metal box. [177]

The wafer seal on its lid was impossibly thin, translucent as butterfly wing, marked with symbols that shifted when she tried to focus on them. [200] She recognized the old language, or thought she did. [210] In her visions of the past, she'd seen these marks before, always at thresholds, always at moments when reality bent. [229]

The seal cracked beneath her precisely playful touch—not rough, not tentative, but something between ceremony and improvisation. [245] Inside lay a single yellowed card bearing what she immediately understood to be a decaying directive: an instruction that had been losing coherence for generations. [267] The words themselves were half-faded, but their meaning bloomed in her mind through that sideways knowing she'd learned to trust. [286]

"Dreams are the door," the directive whispered in its dying voice. [297] "The walker does not choose the path. [305] The path dreams the walker into being." [313]

She'd come here seeking exactly this answer, driven by a motivation that had haunted every vision: to discover why some paths choose their walkers. [334] Why certain people seemed drawn inexorably toward certain destinies, as if the future reached backward to select them. [351]

The storm was overhead now, shaking the bunker with each thunderclap. [362] Rain began to stream through the broken ceiling, and she lay down on the cold floor, letting the drops fall on her closed eyelids. [385]

Through interpreted dreams, the directive had promised. [393] That was the method, the key. [400] She let herself slip sideways out of time, into that space where her gift worked best—where past and future existed simultaneously, where cause and effect tangled like those vines overhead. [428]

In the dream that came, she saw herself as a path, not a person. [443] She was the bunker, the forest, the choice that people made when they stopped trying to control their destination. [462] The paths were alive, dreaming people into existence who would walk them. [474] Every decision point in reality was actually a place where paths negotiated with each other, trading walkers like children trading marbles. [494]

She saw her own path now, extending backward and forward simultaneously. [505] It had dreamed her into being specifically for this moment, for this understanding. [518] The revelation was both ethereal and gritty—beautiful in its strangeness, harsh in its implications. [532] Free will was real, but it was the paths who possessed it, not the walkers. [548]

When she opened her eyes, the storm was passing, and light streamed through the vines in golden shafts. [566] The directive on the card had faded completely, its purpose fulfilled, its final message delivered. [581]

She understood now how to transcend the old way of thinking, how to stop fighting the path and instead learn its language. [602] The bunker had chosen her just as surely as she'd chosen to find it. [616] Rising, brushing dirt from her clothes, she felt precisely playful about the whole ridiculous, magnificent truth of it. [634]

Outside, the rewilded forest steamed and dripped, already forgetting the storm. [646] And she walked forward into her path, or her path walked forward into her—it hardly mattered which anymore. [666]
