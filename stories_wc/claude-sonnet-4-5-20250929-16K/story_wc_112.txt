The xenobiology research station floated in perpetual orbit above Kepler-442b, where enormous crystalline moths cycled between atmospheres, their wings catching triple sunsets. [24] Renna adjusted her goggles with grease-stained fingers, always ready to help whenever the senior researchers needed adjustments to their observation equipment. [47] As the station's obliging sky mechanic, she maintained the external sensors that tracked the moths' patterns, but her true work happened in secret, during those precious minutes within the hush of beating wings at rest—when the creatures settled on the station's viewing platforms at twilight, folding their translucent wings into stillness. [94]

Dr. Voss found her in the maintenance bay, surrounded by disassembled holographic projectors. [108] "The atmospheric samplers need recalibration," he said, offering that mechanically warm smile of his, genuine beneath its practiced efficiency. [127]

"Of course," Renna said, setting down her tools. [136] She always obliged, though tonight she wished to continue her experiment. [148] Still, she followed him to the observation deck, where twilight painted the station's viewports in amber and violet. [167]

The moths had begun their evening descent, hundreds of them, creatures larger than shuttles, settling onto the station's extended platforms with deliberate grace. [190] Their wings created a sound like silk dragging across metal, then silence—that profound hush that Renna had learned to measure in heartbeats. [213]

"They're magnificent tonight," Voss murmured, his breath fogging the viewport slightly. [225]

Renna nodded, but her attention had caught on something else entirely. [237] The magnetic nexus at twilight—that phenomenon the station's instruments couldn't quite explain, the shimmer that appeared when moth and metal and dying light converged. [262] When the moths landed, their crystalline bodies created a field that bent light strangely, making the stars shimmer and double, turning reality briefly translucent. [287]

After Voss left, satisfied with her quick repairs, Renna returned to her bay and activated her jury-rigged apparatus. [307] Through holographic principles, she'd discovered she could capture and replay the light-bending effect the moths created. [324] But more than that—when she overlaid temporal markers onto the holographic recordings, something impossible emerged, something that made her hands shake and her pulse quicken. [350]

She pulled the lever on her modified projector, and the world changed. [363]

The hologram bloomed before her in layers of cold light that somehow radiated warmth, showing three moths landing simultaneously from different angles. [386] But as she adjusted the temporal filter, the landing didn't progress forward through time in the expected sequence. [406] Instead, moments scattered sideways, existing adjacent to each other rather than consecutive. [419] The moth's wing folded and unfolded at once; its landing was both complete and beginning, spatially arranged rather than temporally sequential. [441]

This was what she needed to prove that time moves sideways—at least here, at least during these crystalline convergences when massive alien life forms generated magnetic fields strong enough to warp local spacetime into something navigable. [476]

A subdued awakening was spreading through her understanding, slow and inexorable. [488] Not a sudden revelation but a gentle unfurling, like the moths' own wings catching wind. [504] Time didn't flow forward; it laid itself out in dimensions her instruments were just learning to perceive. [522]

"What are you doing?" [526]

Renna turned slowly. [529] Dr. Voss stood in the doorway, his expression curious rather than accusatory, holding two cups of coffee that steamed in the cool air. [552]

"Proving something everyone thinks is impossible," she said quietly, her voice steady despite her racing heart. [569]

He approached the hologram, coffee forgotten, and she watched his face transform as he saw what she saw—the sideways moments, time rendered as landscape rather than river, as space rather than sequence. [601]

"This is—" He stopped, reached toward the projection with trembling fingers. [614] His hand passed through light that felt somehow both cold and warm, data made luminous, impossibility made visible. [633] "This changes everything we know about physics." [641]

"I've been afraid to show anyone," Renna admitted, vulnerability creeping into her voice. [655] "I'm just a mechanic who fixes broken sensors." [665]

"You're a scientist," Voss corrected gently, that mechanically warm tone returning, mixing professional respect with genuine wonder. [683] "You've made the most important discovery this station will ever witness." [696]

Outside, the moths began stirring, their wings catching the last threads of twilight before they launched again into the alien sky. [718] But in the maintenance bay, Renna and Voss stood before the hologram, watching time move sideways, seeing the universe reshape itself through the eyes of an obliging mechanic who'd been patient enough to look beyond what she was supposed to see. [759]

The magnetic nexus pulsed once more at the horizon, a promise that tomorrow's twilight would bring new revelations, new subdued awakenings in the hush of beating wings at rest. [788]
