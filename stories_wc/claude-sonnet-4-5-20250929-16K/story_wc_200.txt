Mara descended into Echo Gorge in the hush of a hidden sunrise, when light touched only the canyon's highest rim and the depths remained suspended in twilight. [29] She was a lost soul collector, though she preferred the term "shepherd of the wandering," and she carried her misaligned harp across her back like a crooked wing. [57] The instrument had been damaged in her last collection—a violent spirit who'd refused passage—and now its strings sang slightly wrong, each note bent and wavering. [83]

But wrong, she'd discovered, was sometimes right. [90]

The gorge exhaled cold breath, and within it, she heard them: spectral confessions echoing off stone walls, layered and multiplied until individual words became a chorus of grief. [114] "I stole from my brother." [119] "I abandoned my child." [123] "I loved no one, not even myself." [130] The confessions repeated endlessly, trapped in the canyon's acoustic peculiarities, souls bound by their own unabsolved guilt. [145]

Mara was modestly fearless in her work, neither reckless nor paralyzed, moving with the careful certainty of someone who'd learned that fear acknowledged was fear diminished. [169] She'd been collecting lost souls for seven years, ever since her own daughter's laughter had been stolen by illness, and she'd realized that healing required more than medicine—it needed joy woven back into suffering. [202]

She unslung the harp and sat on a flat stone. [212] From her pocket, she withdrew the crocodile's tooth, yellowed and ancient, which her mentor had given her with strange instructions: "When you find souls too heavy to lift with music alone, use this to remind them they once had teeth too—they once bit into life." [253]

Mara didn't fully understand, but she clutched it anyway. [262]

She began to play. [266]

The misaligned harp created distorted notes that should have been discordant but instead seemed to slip between the confessions like a hand through water, touching them without disrupting them. [293] She pursued the nearest voice—a woman who whispered "I never forgave her" again and again—following the sound deeper into the gorge where shadows pooled like ink. [318]

The spectral confession grew louder, more defined. [325] Mara played a melody she'd composed in grief, its notes deliberately imperfect, mirroring the harp's new nature. [341] The music found harmonies in the wrongness, and suddenly she could see the ghost: a translucent figure with a mouth open in perpetual speech, eyes closed against her own words. [367]

"I hear you," Mara said softly, still playing. [374]

The ghost's eyes opened, startled to be witnessed. [382]

"You never forgave her," Mara continued, "but did you ever laugh together?" [393]

The distorted notes seemed to ask the question again, warping it into something both painful and tender—a luminous ache that filled the gorge. [414]

The ghost's expression shifted, memory moving across her transparent features. [424] "Once," she whispered, breaking from her script. [431] "We laughed until we couldn't breathe. [437] At something stupid—a dog chasing its tail." [445]

Mara smiled and changed her melody, finding something lighter within the brokenness of her harp. [460] She held up the crocodile's tooth. [466] "You had teeth," she said. [471] "You bit into life. [475] You tasted joy." [478]

The ghost stared at the tooth, that ancient reminder of hunger and living, and something cracked in her expression—laughter, sudden and surprised, bubbling up through decades of guilt. [504] It sounded like water over stones, like light breaking. [513]

Mara played faster, weaving the laughter into her music, integrating it with the confession until they became inseparable: yes, I failed to forgive, and yes, we laughed until we couldn't breathe. [543] Both true. [545] Both real. [547]

The ghost began to glow, her translucent form growing solid with remembered joy, then fading as she finally moved on. [566] The echo of her confession disappeared from the gorge's chorus. [576]

Mara stood, her harp humming with residual magic. [584] Above, the hidden sunrise had climbed higher, painting the canyon rim gold. [596] She had dozens more to pursue before full light came, dozens more souls who needed to remember that grief and joy were not opposites but companions, teeth that bit into the same life. [629]

She descended deeper, following the spectral voices, her misaligned harp singing its beautiful, broken truth. [644]

In the luminous ache of dawn, healing sounded like laughter threaded through tears, wrong notes made right by their very imperfection. [665]
