The lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes had witnessed countless endings, but Kael believed it might host one beginning more. [22]

As the settlement's shadow-laced peacekeeper, she moved through disputes like twilight through trees—present in every corner, never fully solid, always calmly intuitive about the pain beneath raised voices. [41]

Today's conflict had brought two clan leaders to her door, their decades-old feud finally erupting over fishing rights in the newly opened channels below. [64]

They sat across from each other in her circular room, where apple trees pressed against windows designed for maritime watching, their branches heavy with impossible fruit that thrived in the salt-wind and cold. [95]

Kael had asked the first leader a question, and now the weighted breath before reply stretched between them all, thick as fog. [115]

In that suspension, she closed her eyes and let her shadows unfurl. [127]

The broken crystal ball fragment rested in her palm—a shard she'd carried since her own village had shattered years ago, since she'd learned that seeing fragments of truth was more honest than claiming to see everything. [160]

Her shadows crept across the walls to where she'd mounted them: vintage store mirrors salvaged from the old world, their silvered backs tarnished, their frames ornate with creatures that no longer lived in these warming seas. [193]

Through her shadow-sense, the mirrors became portals to moments not quite here. [205]

In the first mirror, she glimpsed the elder's childhood—a father's hand striking him when he'd suggested sharing the catch with the neighboring clan. [227]

In the second, she saw the other leader's daughter, sick last winter, saved only by medicine the rival clan had provided in secret. [249]

The fragment in her hand grew warm, and Kael understood this was how she must reconstitute what had broken: not by mending the past, but by gathering its scattered truths and reshaping them into something both sides could hold. [285]

She'd been called a courageous anomaly since arriving at this northern edge—a peacekeeper who wielded darkness instead of light, who sought truth in reflections rather than demanding it face-forward. [311]

But courage, she knew, was just the practice of mapping empathy onto action, again and again, even when the action seemed impossible. [332]

The mirrors showed her more: every slight, every secret kindness, every moment these two clans had been tangled together like the gnarled roots of her orchard trees, fighting for the same soil, drinking from the same water. [365]

Outside, the ice floes groaned and separated, the world itself constantly breaking and reforming. [378]

The elder's breath finally released. [383]

"I—" he began. [386]

Kael opened her eyes and let her shadows guide his attention to the western window, where his grandchild played in the orchard with the other leader's nephew, the two boys collaborating to reach an apple branch neither could grasp alone. [421]

"Before you answer," she said softly, "hold this." [429]

She offered the crystal fragment to each leader in turn. [439]

They frowned, but took it, and in their palms her shadow-sense allowed them to feel what she'd witnessed in the mirrors—not every detail, but the emotional truth: the scars they shared, the web of debt and gift that connected their bloodlines, the future fracturing just like this shard if they continued their collision. [485]

The second leader's hand trembled. [490]

"I didn't know you remembered," she whispered to her counterpart. [499]

"I remember everything," he said, and his voice cracked like spring ice. [511]

"Then remember this too," Kael said, drawing her shadows back, letting natural light fill the room. [526]

"The ice below us shifts every day, opens new paths, closes old ones. [538]

We can break like the crystal, showing only fragments to each other, or we can reconstitute—piece by piece, truth by truth—into something whole enough to hold our children's weight." [568]

The leaders looked at each other in that suspended moment, then down at the fragment passing between their hands. [585]

Through the orchard windows, the boys' laughter rang out as they finally caught their apple, and both elders smiled the same smile, sad and hopeful at once. [610]

"Tell us how," the first leader said. [617]

Kael nodded, calmly intuitive even now, knowing this was why she'd climbed to this impossible place where fruit and light and ice converged—to prove that peace wasn't the absence of shadows, but the courage to let them reveal what must be reconstituted. [655]

"We begin," she said, "with the truth of what you've already shared without knowing." [669]

And in the mirrors on the wall, her shadows danced with reflected light, gathering fragments into a map only empathy could read. [690]
