The sea-foam recollectionist had been working in the iridescent cave for seventeen days, watching luminous patterns shift across the geode's crystal walls like memories dissolving into mist. [29] Her name was Calla, though she rarely spoke it aloud anymore, and she specialized in recovering the missing pieces of paths that had vanished from the world's collective consciousness. [58]

She held up a fragment of crater glass, its surface rippled and dark green, born from celestial violence eons ago. [77] Through its peculiar lens, Calla could transliterate emotions—converting the ineffable feelings embedded in forgotten routes into visible script that danced across the crystalline surfaces. [102] Today, the glass revealed only fragments: joy-turning-to-doubt, wonder-edged-with-sorrow, the particular ache of a farewell never quite completed. [121]

"Missing pieces everywhere," she murmured with a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes, her voice echoing cheerfully through the gloom. [141] The cave itself seemed to understand her melancholy optimism, its walls pulsing with soft rainbow light, beautiful and cold simultaneously. [161]

The breakthrough had come via the scattered seeds dropped by a migrating bird—a temporal swallow that traversed not just geography but chronology itself. [185] Three weeks ago, she'd noticed the bird leaving a trail of seeds through the cave's entrance, seeds that shouldn't have been able to grow in such mineral darkness. [214] Yet they had sprouted into peculiar silver vines, their leaves inscribed with maps of vanished roads, forgotten shortcuts, paths that had simply stopped existing. [237]

Calla traced her fingers along one vine, feeling the slight warmth of preserved memory. [251] She pressed the crater glass against a particularly dense cluster of leaves and watched the transliteration begin: emotions streaming forth as luminous text. [273] Anticipation, she read, then confusion, then resignation. [281]

"People walked you once," she said softly to the path-memory, her tone bright despite the sadness underneath. [298] "Why did you disappear?" [302]

She had devoted her career to discovering why some paths disappear, driven by a childhood memory of a road that had led to her grandmother's house—until one summer it simply wasn't there anymore, and no one else remembered it had ever existed. [345] The mystery had haunted her with cheerful persistence, a riddle wrapped in loss. [359]

The crater glass grew warm in her palm. [367] More transliterations emerged: This path ended because it was walked only once, by someone who never returned. [386] Paths need footsteps to remain real. [393] Without repetition, without pilgrimage, they become like sea-foam—beautiful, essential, and heartbreakingly temporary. [408]

Calla sat back against the cool crystal wall, processing this revelation. [419] She had always assumed paths disappeared due to catastrophe or deliberate erasure, but the truth was simpler and sadder. [438] They faded because they were forgotten, because no one chose to walk them twice. [453]

The temporal swallow returned, landing on a crystalline outcropping, regarding her with eyes that held too much understanding. [471] It dropped another seed, which fell directly into her open hand. [483]

She planted it immediately, knowing she was racing against time, working urgently before memory fades completely and even the traces would be lost. [506] The seed sprouted faster than the others, its vine wrapping around her wrist like a bracelet, its leaves showing not a map but a choice. [531]

Through the crater glass, she transliterated the emotion embedded in this newest path-memory: hope-choosing-to-return. [547] It was a path someone had walked once, then walked again, and again, until it became permanent. [565]

Calla stood, energized by her cheerful gloom, understanding now what her work truly meant. [579] She couldn't restore the missing pieces—some losses were inevitable, like foam dissolving into sea. [594] But she could document them, honor them, and perhaps most importantly, choose which paths to walk repeatedly, anchoring them into existence through the simple act of return. [621]

The cave's iridescent walls pulsed brighter, as if approving. [631] She pressed her palm against the crystal, feeling the collected memories of ten thousand vanished paths humming beneath her touch, each one a small tragedy, each one perfectly, necessarily temporary. [662]

"I'll remember you," she promised them all, smiling through the gentle sorrow, making her conjecture into covenant: that bearing witness to disappearance was itself a kind of preservation. [690]

The temporal swallow sang once, dropped three more seeds, and vanished into the glittering dark. [706]
