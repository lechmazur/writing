The dimensional anchor hummed beneath Father Micah's feet, that peculiar vibration where three realities pressed against one another like nervous strangers in an elevator. [25]

He'd been summoned here before dawn, to this basement chapel where the walls seemed to breathe and distances refused to stay fixed. [48]

The girl—Elena—knelt at the altar, her body rigid, her lips moving in languages that predated speech. [64]

The possession was incomplete, thank God. [70]

Father Micah set down his loop pedal, the battered device that had earned him ridicule from the diocese and reverence from those who understood. [94]

Next to it, he placed his most peculiar tool: an artist's palette holding only white—not absence of color, but the presence of all colors unified, waiting. [120]

"Listen," he said softly, though whether to Elena or the thing trying to wear her, he wasn't certain. [138]

He pressed the pedal, recording silence. [144]

Then he let it play back, that captured nothing, looping eternally. [155]

The basement filled with the sound of no sound, and within that paradox, Father Micah began to work. [173]

He decorates with silence, they said about him in whispers. [183]

It was true. [186]

Where other exorcists shouted prayers, he built cathedrals of quiet, layering absence upon absence until the void itself became architecture. [206]

"What do you assume?" he asked Elena, his voice achieving that quality he'd practiced for years—muffled clarity, words that reached the mind without jarring the ear. [231]

"Tell me the thing you've never questioned." [238]

Elena's head tilted impossibly. [242]

The thing inside her was curious now, distracted from its burrowing. [253]

Father Micah began to plumb the depths of her condition through rhetorical devices, each question a careful probe into the unraveling stillness that surrounded possession. [276]

"If you are nothing," he asked the entity, "then how can you speak? And if you can speak, how can you claim to be nothing? Do you see the assumption? That void and voice can coexist without paradox?" [311]

The loop pedal hummed its silent loop. [318]

He added another layer, recording his own breath, then stopping it mid-exhale. [330]

The dimensional anchor shuddered, responding to the philosophical tensions he was weaving. [342]

This place existed because it held contradictions stable—it was the pin that kept incompatible realities from flying apart. [360]

And he was using that property as a weapon. [369]

"You assume you can possess what is whole," Father Micah continued, lifting the white palette. [383]

He dipped his finger into the single color, drawing a mark on Elena's forehead. [397]

"But what if she's already everything? What if there's no room left inside her for you?" [412]

The white paint gleamed. [416]

In it, all colors resided. [421]

In Elena, he was suggesting, all possible states already existed. [431]

The possession required empty space, an assumption of lack. [440]

But Father Micah was illuminating a different hidden assumption: that humans were incomplete vessels. [453]

What if they were already full? [459]

The entity inside Elena screamed without sound, and Father Micah's loop pedal caught that too, feeding it back, making the thing hear itself. [481]

The silence decorated the space between heartbeats, between thoughts, between the moment of invasion and the moment of completion. [499]

In that unraveled stillness—that place where quiet came apart into its component threads—Father Micah worked his deepest magic. [518]

"You cannot possess what cannot be separated from itself," he said. [529]

"You cannot enter where there is no threshold. You cannot fill what has no emptiness. Do you understand? Your entire existence depends on an assumption that isn't true." [555]

Elena gasped, her eyes suddenly her own. [562]

The dimensional anchor settled, its hum returning to that baseline frequency. [573]

The loop pedal played its final cycle of recorded silence, then Father Micah clicked it off. [589]

He helped Elena to her feet, both of them shaking. [599]

"What was that?" she whispered. [604]

"Rhetorical exorcism," he said simply. [609]

"Some demons are just bad arguments. You disprove them, and they disappear." [621]

The white paint on her forehead gleamed like a third eye, like a seal, like proof. [637]

Outside, dawn was breaking, but here in the dimensional anchor, time moved differently. [650]

They had finished before the possession could complete itself, before assumption became reality. [663]

Father Micah packed his loop pedal and his palette, tools that made sense only in the muffled clarity of his calling. [683]

He decorated one more silence—the grateful, breathing quiet of a soul returned to itself—and then he left, ready for the next unraveling. [706]
