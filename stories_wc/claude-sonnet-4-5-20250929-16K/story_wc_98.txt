Mira climbed the ancient ridge as dawn painted the blooming irises gold, each petal heavy with dew that would vanish when the monsoon came. [25] She was the island's reality checker, a position that sounded empirically whimsical to outsiders but served a vital function: verifying which memories were real and which had been invented by the collective dreaming. [58]

The island's people shared dreams the way mainlanders shared meals, and over generations, these dreams had woven themselves into the fabric of what everyone remembered as history. [87] But lately, something had shifted. [92] The elders spoke of festivals Mira couldn't find in any record. [103] Children sang songs no one remembered teaching them. [111] The boundary between lived experience and dreamed fiction was dissolving. [120]

Mira carried in her satchel the last knowledge fruit seed, given to her by the archive keeper with trembling hands. [139] "Plant it before the rains come," the old woman had whispered. [150] "It's the only way to waken what we're losing." [159]

The ridge had bloomed early this year, as if the land itself knew time was running short. [176] Mira found the oldest stone marker, worn smooth by centuries of pilgrims' hands, and knelt in the carpet of flowers. [195] She needed to understand what was happening to her people's memories before she could protect them. [210]

Closing her eyes, she pressed her palms to the warm stone and opened herself to the method she'd been trained in since childhood: interpreting the collective dreams. [234] The island's people didn't just dream individually; their sleeping minds created a vast, shared landscape where cultural memory lived and breathed. [254]

The dream-space rushed in. [258] Mira found herself standing in the same ridge, but transformed. [268] The flowers blazed with impossible colors that had names only in the old language. [282] Around her, translucent figures moved through ceremonies she half-recognized—planting rituals, wedding dances, funeral songs. [297] These were the memories trying to waken, struggling to remain real. [308]

But something was feeding on them. [314] Mira watched in horror as a creeping gray mist consumed the edges of each memory, simplifying them, making them generic. [333] A specific grandmother's recipe for festival bread became just "something sweet." [344] A particular hero's name dissolved into "someone brave." [352] The collective memory was being stripped of its details, its empirically whimsical truth, leaving only vague impressions. [368]

She understood now. [371] Without the knowledge fruit tree, there was no anchor for specificity. [382] The tree had died three years ago, victim to a blight no one had anticipated. [397] Its fruit had always been eaten during coming-of-age ceremonies, and something in its chemistry locked personal memory to cultural memory, keeping the collective dreaming honest. [422]

Mira woke gasping, luminous doubt flooding her mind. [430] Could one seed really restore what was being lost? [440] The science was sound—she'd verified it herself—but the scope of erosion seemed too vast. [456]

Still, she had no other choice. [463] This was why she'd become a reality checker: to protect cultural memory from fantasy's beautiful lies. [479]

She dug into the rich soil with her bare hands, placed the seed in the earth, and covered it with a whispered prayer in the old language. [505] The words felt both absolutely true and utterly uncertain in her mouth. [517]

Rain clouds gathered on the horizon, dark promises of the monsoon. [528] Mira sat back on her heels, fingers buried in the blooming ridge, and waited. [542] The seed would need weeks to sprout, months to mature, years to bear fruit again. [557]

But in the dream-space, she felt something shift. [566] The gray mist paused, perhaps sensing resistance. [574] The translucent figures moved with slightly more clarity. [583] That grandmother's recipe included honey and cardamom. [590] That hero's name was Kael. [595]

Details returning, one by one, like flowers opening to face the light before the storm. [610]

Mira smiled through her luminous doubt, her empirically whimsical faith that memory could be measured, planted, and made to grow again. [630] The monsoon would come, but the knowledge fruit seed would waken beneath the earth, roots reaching deep into the collective dreaming. [650]

And she would be here, reality checker and dream interpreter, protecting the specific truth of who her people had actually been. [670]
