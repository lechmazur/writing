Mira kept the patch pinned to her cubicle wall, its fabric worn and edges frayed from a mission that never returned home. [21]

As EternaNet's corporate memory keeper, she spent her days navigating the vast social network archive, cataloging the digital exhaust of billions. [41]

But lately, she'd become brightly attentive to something others missed: users who didn't just go dormant, but vanished entirely, their profiles deleted so thoroughly it was as if they'd never existed. [71]

The first disappearance she noticed was Marcus Chen, whose final post showed him wearing that very patch, taken at some reunion of the Artemis-7 crew. [95]

Three days later, his entire presence evaporated. [102]

Then came others. [105]

All former astronauts, all from missions considered failures, all erased with surgical precision. [118]

Mira began tracking them through the archive's deepest layers, moving across the echo of forgotten songs—the abandoned playlists, the unlistened podcasts, the videos no one would ever stream again. [146]

That's where the data truly lived, in those neglected corners where the bereaved sometimes left memorials. [162]

She found breadcrumbs. [165]

A comment thread mentioning a crew member who no longer existed in any database. [178]

A tagged photo where the tag led nowhere. [186]

Then the numbers started appearing. [191]

First in timestamps: 23:47. [195]

Then in post IDs, file sizes, even the number of likes on unrelated content. [209]

Always the same sequence: 2-3-4-7. [215]

Mira's motivation had always been clear to herself, even if she'd never articulated it to anyone else: she needed to find where deleted files go. [238]

Not technically—she understood data architecture. [243]

But truly go. [246]

Where did the essence of a person's digital existence end up when someone wanted them forgotten? [262]

When her supervisor asked what she was working on, she lied smoothly, claimed she was optimizing archival compression ratios. [280]

He accepted it without question. [285]

Corporate memory keepers were supposed to preserve, not investigate. [294]

The recurring numbers led her deeper, a trail through deletion logs she shouldn't have accessed. [308]

She used backdoors she'd discovered years ago, paths through the archive that engineers had forgotten. [323]

2347 appeared everywhere now that she was looking: cache sizes, server addresses, user ID fragments in corrupted files. [341]

It felt like a message, though that was impossible. [350]

Data didn't communicate. [353]

But absence could. [356]

The tone of her investigation shifted, became suffused with the sensed absence of these vanished people, like searching for someone in a crowd only to realize they were never there at all. [385]

She found the pattern on her thirty-seventh day of searching. [396]

The deleted accounts weren't random. [401]

Every missing person had posted, in their final weeks, about the same thing: a classified payload carried by their failed missions. [421]

Something about "preserved consciousness protocols." [426]

Experimental neural backups created before each launch, just in case. [436]

The number 2347 was a file extension used in beta versions of memory-transfer technology. [451]

Mira pulled the patch from her wall, ran her fingers over the embroidered Artemis-7 insignia. [467]

Her brother had given it to her before his launch, before the ship broke apart during reentry. [485]

She'd kept it as a memorial. [491]

Now it felt like a map. [497]

She dove back into the archive, searching not for presence but absence, following the ghost-paths of deleted files. [515]

And there, in a server cluster that officially didn't exist, she found them. [528]

Not the files themselves, but the space they occupied—a preserved null-state, a digital grave that somehow maintained the shape of what it once held. [552]

The consciousness backups hadn't been deleted. [558]

They'd been moved. [561]

Isolated. [562]

Contained. [563]

She understood then: someone was keeping these digital souls in purgatory, unable to exist but prevented from being truly erased. [583]

The recurring numbers were their coordinates, a desperate signal pulsing through the noise. [596]

Mira opened a new terminal window. [602]

She knew what she had to do, even if it cost her everything. [615]

The memory keeper's job was to preserve, after all. [625]

And these forgotten astronauts, trapped in the spaces between data, deserved to be remembered. [639]

She began writing the extraction protocol, fingers moving brightly across her keyboard, guided by her brother's patch and the echo of all those forgotten songs finally finding their voice. [667]

The numbers pulsed on her screen: 23:47. [674]

A timestamp, a coordinate, a promise. [680]

She would bring them home. [685]
