<story>
The professional dream interpreter, Mara, arrived at the humming vapor collection facility with a notebook tucked under her arm.<words>19</words>
She had been summoned because a crumpled invitation, found in the ash of the bakery ovens, had sparked a series of unsettling nocturnal visions among the workers.<words>46</words>
The invitation bore the faint seal of the city council, a reminder that the laws carved in stone still governed the steam‑filled corridors.<words>69</words>
Mara sensed a quiet pulse beneath the clatter of condensers, a rhythm that only a dream interpreter could translate into purpose.<words>90</words>
Her method, unconventional yet effective, involved impersonating a missing person whose last dream had been recorded in the facility’s logbooks.<words>110</words>
She chose to become Elias, the baker who vanished during a night of experimental dough rising, because his disappearance was occasionally frequent in the town’s whispered histories.<words>137</words>
Donning Elias’s flour‑stained apron, Mara entered the baking chamber where the ovens exhaled clouds of vapor like breathing giants.<words>156</words>
During baking, the heat caused the metal racks to calcify, turning soft iron into a brittle, stone‑like lattice that echoed the ancient statutes.<words>179</words>
Mara whispered the missing baker’s last dream into the steam, letting the quiet pulse of the vapor carry the secret to the council’s stone tablets.<words>204</words>
She believed that by rewriting the dream onto the stone, the laws could be softened, allowing the facility to breathe without crushing the workers’ imagination.<words>229</words>
The crumpled invitation, now unfurled on the oven door, glowed faintly as the vapor swirled, confirming the peculiar faith that guided her steps.<words>252</words>
Each breath of steam seemed to echo a heartbeat, a reminder that even stone can feel the rhythm of a dream when someone dares to listen.<words>278</words>
When the council’s archivist arrived, he found the stone tablets etched with the baker’s hopeful sunrise, a symbol that the laws could be reshaped.<words>302</words>
Mara’s impersonation had been a catalyst, turning the occasionally frequent rumors of disappearance into a concrete proof that dreams can calcify into reality.<words>325</words>
The vapor collection facility, once a silent monolith, now thrummed with the quiet pulse of renewed purpose, its workers smiling as the ovens sang.<words>349</words>
In the end, Mara filed the crumpled invitation into her case, a reminder that even the most mundane slip of paper can hold the key to rewriting stone.<words>377</words>
She left the facility as the sunrise painted the vapor tanks gold, feeling the quiet pulse settle into her own heart like a new law.<words>402</words>
