<story>
The outlaw cowboy poet rode his rust‑capped horse into the brass‑cogged observatory dome, where steam hissed like a restless chorus. <words>20</words>
He had come seeking the virtually peculiar worn runic bone dice that were said to align destinies with a single, trembling roll. <words>42</words>
The dice lay on a polished brass table beneath a vaulted ceiling of rotating lenses, each lens reflecting a different epoch of sky. <words>65</words>
His motivation was simple yet fierce: to spark unstoppable curiosity in the hearts of anyone who dared to listen to his verses. <words>87</words>
He began rehearsals, reciting his poetry aloud while the observatory’s gears clicked in time, each stanza a rehearsal of fate itself. <words>108</words>
During these rehearsals the coffee shop walls—an odd, portable gallery of steam‑etched panels—kept changing text, offering cryptic clues that only he could read. <words>131</words>
He discovered that the walls misaligned his verses, shifting syllables like gears slipping, and he learned to read the walls to correct the misalign. <words>155</words>
Each time he adjusted a line, the runic bone dice glowed faintly, as if acknowledging the intertwined destinies of poet and outlaw. <words>177</words>
The tone of his voice carried saturated ambivalence, a mixture of longing and defiance that resonated with the brass pipes and the humming ether. <words>201</words>
When the final stanza rose, the coffee shop walls flickered, spelling a single word: “Unbound.” <words>216</words>
He tossed the dice, letting them tumble across the brass table, each face a rune that pulsed in rhythm with the observatory’s heart. <words>239</words>
The dice landed on a side that glowed brighter than the rest, and the walls instantly rewrote the entire script of his poem, now endless. <words>264</words>
He realized that his rehearsals had not only aligned his verses but had also misaligned the world’s expectations, creating a new pattern of wonder. <words>288</words>
The steampunk dome’s gears whirred louder, as if applauding the outlaw’s daring, while the coffee shop walls settled into a calm, looping mantra of curiosity. <words>313</words>
In that saturated ambivalence, he felt both triumph and loss, knowing that the intertwined destinies he had forged would forever misalign ordinary lives into extraordinary quests. <words>339</words>
He walked out of the observatory, the worn runic bone dice tucked into his coat, the coffee shop walls now a silent promise to anyone who dared to read between steam and steel. <words>372</words>
As the city’s night lamps flickered, his verses drifted on the wind, each line a seed that would sprout curiosity in the hearts of strangers for generations. <words>399</words>
And so the outlaw cowboy poet rode onward, his destiny forever tangled with the dice, the dome, and the ever‑changing walls that whispered, “Begin again.” <words>424</words>
