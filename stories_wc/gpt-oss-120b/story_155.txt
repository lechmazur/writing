The underwater welder named Mara drifted into the broken planetarium, now pulsing like a night club beneath the sea. <words>19</words>
Neon constellations flickered above a rusted dome, and the air hummed with a bass that seemed to echo distant tides. <words>39</words>
Mara’s helmet visor reflected the room through vintage store mirrors that lined the bar, each pane offering fragmented glimpses of other eras. <words>61</words>
In a cracked reflection she saw a dusty button box, its brass knobs worn smooth by generations of curious hands. <words>81</words>
She reached for it, feeling the patient impatience that had been inherited from her grandmother, a diver who once whispered about impossible power. <words>104</words>
The moment the box clicked, the club’s lights stuttered, and the timeline crossing—a seam where two histories should never meet—shivered into view. <words>126</words>
Mara felt the core concept of moments of unraveling coil around her like a tide, each second pulling threads of past and future apart. <words>150</words>
She pressed a button, and a soft chime pampered the crowd, coaxing them to linger in the strange lull between beats. <words>171</words>
Through the mirrored walls, patrons glimpsed their own younger selves, their eyes widening as the impossible power of the box seeped into the water‑filled floor. <words>196</words>
Mara, patient yet impatient, guided the energy with practiced hands, welding the rusted steel of the dome as if stitching a wound. <words>218</words>
Each spark sang a note of inheritance, a mystery passed down through generations of divers who believed the sea kept secrets in its pressure. <words>242</words>
The club’s DJ, a holographic figure stitched from starlight, spun tracks that resonated with the box’s frequency, amplifying the unraveling. <words>262</words>
Patrons felt their memories unwind, and Mara pampered the moment by offering them a brief taste of the power she sought. <words>283</words>
She knew that wielding such improbable power required more than skill; it demanded the acceptance of paradox, the willingness to stand at the crossing. <words>307</words>
The crossing pulsed, a thin veil of light that split the club into two overlapping eras—one of analog neon, the other of bioluminescent algae. <words>331</words>
Mara’s hands glowed as the button box transferred its charge, and the broken planetarium’s ceiling cracked open, revealing a sky of swirling constellations. <words>354</words>
In that instant, the moments of unraveling coalesced into a single thread, and Mara felt the impossible power settle like a warm current in her veins. <words>380</words>
She smiled, a patient impatience finally resolved, and whispered to the reflected selves that the mystery was theirs to inherit, not to destroy. <words>403</words>
The club erupted in a cascade of light, the vintage button box humming softly as the two timelines merged, and the night stretched onward, forever a place where the sea and stars could be wedded. <words>438</words>
