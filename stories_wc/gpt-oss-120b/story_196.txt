<story>
The tired swordsman slipped into the quiet breakroom of the floating rock monastery, his armor clanking like distant thunder. <words>19</words>
A colleague had just resigned, leaving a hollow chair and a lingering sigh that seemed to echo off the stone walls. <words>40</words>
He dropped his plain cloth bag onto the table, its fabric whispering secrets of journeys he had once vowed to keep hidden from even his own reflection. <words>67</words>
The bag, though unadorned, contained a single, tarnished amulet that pulsed faintly whenever the night sky promised a meteor shower. <words>87</words>
He remembered the spark of defiance he felt as a youth, a flicker that refused to be smothered by the endless cycles of war. <words>111</words>
Now, fiercely apathetic, he stared at the empty mugs, feeling nothing but a lazy curiosity about whether he could still overcome his own inertia. <words>135</words>
The monks whispered that the next meteor shower would blaze across the heavens at midnight, a celestial map for those daring enough to follow its trail. <words>161</words>
He recalled a hidden promise he had made to himself long ago: to never let the world dictate the shape of his destiny. <words>184</words>
The promise was tucked away like a seed, waiting for the right storm to coax it into bloom. <words>202</words>
He lifted the bag, feeling the amulet's pulse sync with the distant rumble of the monastery's ancient generators. <words>220</words>
A knowing naivety settled over him as he imagined the meteors as breadcrumbs, each fiery speck a step toward reclaiming his forgotten fire. <words>243</words>
He slipped the amulet into the cloth bag, sealing his resolve with the soft thud of fabric against metal. <words>262</words>
The breakroom's single window framed the night, and as the first meteor streaked across, he felt the spark of defiance flare anew. <words>284</words>
He stepped onto the monastery's outer balcony, the floating rock trembling slightly under his weight, as if the world itself sensed his intent. <words>307</words>
Following the meteor's luminous tail, he sprinted across the stone ledges, each stride a silent oath to outpace his own apathy. <words>328</words>
The sky erupted in a cascade of shooting stars, and with each flash he felt the plain cloth bag grow lighter, as if the promise itself were shedding weight. <words>357</words>
When the final meteor vanished beyond the horizon, he stood breathless, the amulet now glowing bright enough to illuminate the monastery's inner sanctum. <words>380</words>
He returned to the breakroom, placed the bag back on the table, and whispered to the empty chairs that the hidden promise had been kept. <words>405</words>
The resigned colleague's absence felt less like loss and more like a doorway, a quiet invitation for the swordsman to finally write his own ending. <words>430</words>
With a knowing smile, he lifted his sword, its blade catching the faint afterglow of the meteors, and walked toward the sunrise that now seemed within reach. <words>457</words>
