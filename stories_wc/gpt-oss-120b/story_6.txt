The skeptical minstrel, a wiry lute‑player named Corin, arrived at the disappearing ink factory just as the sun slanted through broken panes.<words>22</words>
He had heard rumors that an immortal trickster was hiding a scrap of dragon‑scale armor inside the rusted heart of the plant, and his curiosity was as sharp as his sarcasm.<words>53</words>
The factory’s corridors were choked with the faint hiss of an ancient steam vent, a ghostly sigh that seemed to carry secret instructions.<words>76</words>
At the hush of an empty mailbox at midday, Corin set his battered slingshot on a rusted workbench, loading it with a vial of disappearing ink that would vanish the moment it touched paper.<words>110</words>
His reckless generosity demanded he share this impossible trick with the factory’s forgotten workers, even though no one remained but the echo of their own sighs.<words>136</words>
He whispered a ballad of doubt to the empty walls, his skeptical tone dripping with irreverent awe as he imagined the trickster watching from the shadows.<words>162</words>
The steam vent hissed louder, as if approving the plan, and a thin filament of vapor curled around the slingshot, making the launch impossibly plausible.<words>187</words>
Corin aimed at the scrap, perched on a dented metal shelf like a dragon’s tooth, and let the slingshot fire, the ink‑filled projectile whistling through the stale air.<words>215</words>
When it struck, the armor fragment shimmered, its scales reflecting the faint light and releasing a burst of ink that vanished the moment it touched the floor, proving the trickster’s legend both real and absurd.<words>250</words>
The disappearing ink seeped into the cracks, erasing the factory’s old graffiti and, in a twist of reckless generosity, also erasing the names of the trickster’s past victims.<words>278</words>
A sudden clatter echoed from the vent, and a translucent figure emerged, the immortal trickster himself, smiling at Corin’s audacity.<words>298</words>
“​You think a slingshot and ink can out‑scheme me?” the trickster crooned, his voice a blend of thunder and laughter.<words>318</words>
Corin, never one to back down, offered the trickster the remaining scrap, promising to donate the armor’s protective charm to any soul who dared to sing truth in the ruins.<words>348</words>
The immortal, amused, accepted, and as a token of his own reckless generosity, he turned the disappearing ink into a permanent mark that glowed whenever a lie was spoken.<words>378</words>
The factory, now alive with a humming aura, became a sanctuary where the skeptical minstrel could test his doubts against the trickster’s riddles, each note a slingshot of truth.<words>407</words>
At the hush of the empty mailbox, now a symbol of paused expectations, Corin strummed his lute, the melody echoing the impossible plausibility of generosity that could outwit eternity.<words>436</words>
