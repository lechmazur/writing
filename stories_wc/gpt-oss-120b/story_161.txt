The orchardist, vigilant even when the world smelled of ripe apples, arrived at the paper airplane test facility with a sardonic grin. <words>22</words>
He was never tardy, a habit forged after his sister's untimely death, which he now chased away with punctuality as a personal rebellion. <words>45</words>
Volunteering throughout the summer, he tended the facility's sprawling greenhouse of paper sheets, each leaf a potential wing for the test flights. <words>67</words>
One rainy afternoon, a courier slipped an antique letter seal into his palm, its wax bearing a cryptic crest that resembled a peacock's tail. <words>91</words>
He recognized the pattern immediately, for the iridescent eyes of the bird had once guided his sister's secret diary entries, a map of hidden grievances. <words>116</words>
The seal, he deduced, was a key to a conspiracy that tangled the facility's board, the city council, and a shadowy syndicate that profited from sabotaged flights. <words>143</words>
He decided to demonstrate his theory by arranging a series of paper airplanes whose flight paths would mimic the peacock's tail feathers, each arc a clue. <words>169</words>
The first plane, a sleek white sheet with a crimson stripe, swooped left, echoing the leftmost eye of the crest, and landed on the director's desk. <words>195</words>
When the director opened it, a hidden compartment sprang, spilling microfilm that listed the dates of every delayed test, a pattern of intentional postponements. <words>219</words>
He laughed, a sardonic glee bubbling up, because the conspirators had assumed his punctuality made him blind to timing tricks. <words>239</words>
The second plane, painted teal with gold speckles, arced right, mirroring the right eye of the crest, and crashed into the supply closet, revealing a false floor. <words>266</words>
Beneath it lay a ledger of bribes paid to the board members, each entry stamped with the same peacock motif as the seal. <words>289</words>
The orchardist felt the old grief loosen, as each revelation stitched a new pattern over the torn fabric of his loss. <words>310</words>
He continued volunteering, now with a purpose that turned every sunrise over his orchard into a reminder that vigilance could prune conspiracies as easily as weeds. <words>336</words>
When the final plane, a silver glinting dart, spiraled upward like the central plume of the peacock, it triggered the facility's alarm, exposing the syndicate's leader. <words>362</words>
The leader, a former horticulturist turned corrupt official, sneered at the orchardist's triumph, only to be outwitted by the very timing he had tried to manipulate. <words>388</words>
In the end, the antique seal was placed back on the orchard gate, a reminder that even the most ornate feather can hide a blade. <words>413</words>
He walked away, never tardy, his steps echoing the rustle of leaves and the faint, triumphant clatter of paper wings, his grief finally folded into purpose. <words>439</words>
