<story>
The atom‑powered lighthouse rose from the sea like a silver needle, its core humming with restless particles.<words>17</words>
Inside its rotating chambers, a time refugee from a forgotten empire tended a small fire, the only thing that could keep his chronal wounds from freezing.<words>43</words>
He was trustworthy strange, a paradox that made the lighthouse’s guardians accept his presence without question.<words>59</words>
His purpose was quietly defiant, to bind old wounds with unstoppable will, even as the world outside ignored the scars of his empire.<words>82</words>
On the table beside him lay an embroidered tablecloth, its patterns depicting constellations that only the exiled could read.<words>101</words>
He believed that by the alignment of the stars the cloth could become a map to a hidden catapult buried beneath the lighthouse’s foundation.<words>125</words>
The catapult was not a weapon of war but a device to launch memories into the sky, turning grief into light.<words>146</words>
In the hush of a line that never moves, the lighthouse’s beam traced a steady path, a borrowed dawn that promised redemption.<words>168</words>
He set the embroidered cloth upon the ancient stone slab, aligning its golden threads with the rising constellations.<words>186</words>
As the stars clicked into place, the lighthouse’s atom core pulsed, feeding the catapult with raw energy.<words>203</words>
A quiet hum rose, and the catapult’s arm, forged from forgotten alloy, swung upward, bearing the cloth like a banner of hope.<words>225</words>
When released, the embroidered tablecloth unfurled into a cascade of luminous threads that stitched the night sky together.<words>243</words>
Each thread carried a fragment of his empire’s memory, and as they rose, the old wounds of the past glowed with a soft, unstoppable will.<words>268</words>
The lighthouse’s beam, now intertwined with those threads, painted the horizon with colors no one had seen since the empire’s sunrise.<words>289</words>
Villagers who gathered at the base felt a strange trust settle in their hearts, as if the refugee’s quiet defiance had become their own.<words>313</words>
He watched the borrowed dawn deepen, knowing that the alignment of the stars would soon shift, and the catapult would need to fire again.<words>337</words>
But he was patient, for his unstoppable will was not a sprint but a marathon across centuries.<words>354</words>
When the next alignment glimmered, he whispered to the cloth, “Carry our hope beyond the horizon, and bind the future to the past.”<words>377</words>
The catapult obeyed, hurling the embroidered banner into the void, where it became a constellation that would guide lost souls for ages.<words>399</words>
And so the time refugee, quietly defiant yet trustworthy strange, stood beneath the atom‑powered lighthouse, watching his empire’s memory rise like a borrowed dawn over the endless sea.<words>427</words>
