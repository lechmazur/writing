<story>
In the heart of a sandstone labyrinth lit by drifting lanterns, a homeless philosopher‑king named Arin roamed, his mind a map of riddles and reigns.<words>25</words>
He carried a weather‑beaten kaleidoscope, its cracked glass swirling colors like memories of kingdoms lost to dust.<words>42</words>
During readings of ancient scrolls, he whispered theories aloud, each syllable earnestly frivolous, as if playfulness could coax truth from stone.<words>63</words>
His purpose was singular: to puzzle out the labyrinth once thought unsolvable, to extend its corridors into a new geometry of understanding.<words>85</words>
Arin believed that every junction hid a proposal, a confetti‑coded invitation to a random wedding hidden within the maze’s echo.<words>105</words>
When a wandering bride entered a vaulted hall, the kaleidoscope burst into a cascade of colored shards, each fragment spelling a vow that rewrote the path.<words>131</words>
The confetti‑coded proposals were not mere celebrations; they were riddles that extended the labyrinth’s logic, turning joy into a compass.<words>151</words>
Yet betrayal lingered like a shadow, for the kaleidoscope had once belonged to a tyrant who traded its colors for power.<words>172</words>
When Arin finally aligned the final lantern with the last wedding’s confetti, the tyrant’s spirit emerged, offering a pact to keep the maze intact.<words>196</words>
The bargain was simple: the labyrinth would remain unsolved forever, preserving the tyrant’s secret, if Arin surrendered his kaleidoscope.<words>215</words>
Arin felt the weight of transformative betrayal, his heart fracturing like the kaleidoscope’s glass, yet his smile stayed earnestly frivolous.<words>235</words>
He realized that to truly extend the maze’s mystery, he must break the pact and let the colors bleed into the walls.<words>257</words>
With a deliberate toss, he shattered the kaleidoscope, scattering confetti‑coded vows that rewrote every corridor into a living poem.<words>276</words>
The lanterns flickered brighter, their light now a chorus of promises, and the labyrinth breathed a new pattern of hope.<words>296</words>
Random weddings across the realm felt the shift, as couples found their vows echoing the maze’s newly forged routes.<words>315</words>
Arin, now both king and beggar, walked the ever‑changing passages, his philosophy humming in the simple complexity of each turn.<words>335</words>
He understood that the true unsolvable was not the maze’s shape but the human desire to bind joy into static order.<words>356</words>
Thus, every confetti‑coded proposal he now offered at weddings became a seed, extending love into the stone, refusing betrayal.<words>375</words>
The sandstone walls, once cold and indifferent, now whispered back in colors, a testament to a king who chose frivolity over fear.<words>397</words>
In that moment, the labyrinth was solved not by a single answer but by an endless, earnestly playful extension of the human heart.<words>420</words>
