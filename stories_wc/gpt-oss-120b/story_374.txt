On a wind‑swept rooftop of the megacity’s horse stables, a lonesome minstrel tuned his lute. <words>15</words>
The city below pulsed with neon, yet the stable’s concrete beams felt bizarrely typical under his fingertips. <words>32</words>
He sipped bitter coffee from a line that curled like a lazy river across the sky. <words>48</words>
Around him, other riders whispered about inherited rivalries between their families, a feud that stretched back to the first sky‑grazing horses. <words>69</words>
The minstrel, though solitary, felt the echo of those grudges in the rhythm of his verses. <words>85</words>
He carried a rubber stamp, its image unclear, as if the imprint were a secret code. <words>101</words>
When he pressed it onto parchment, the mark smeared into a cloud‑shaped sigil that seemed to breathe. <words>118</words>
He learned to bicker with the wind, arguing over which vapor drift signaled the next stanza of the cosmos. <words>137</words>
His method was simple yet arcane: by tracking cloud patterns, he read the silent cosmos for lyrical clues. <words>155</words>
Each puff that curled over the rooftop stables whispered a line of forgotten history, a verse of rivalry. <words>173</words>
The minstrel’s motivation was to translate those whispers into song, to read the silent cosmos and give it voice. <words>192</words>
He perched on a rusted beam, his eyes scanning the shifting white, while the horses below snorted in rhythm. <words>211</words>
A rival minstrel from the neighboring stable appeared, his own stamp bearing a jagged sun, and they began to bicker. <words>231</words>
Their argument rose like the city’s traffic, absurdly ordinary yet charged with the weight of centuries. <words>247</words>
Each claimed the clouds above foretold his family’s triumph, a claim as bizarrely typical as a sunrise. <words>264</words>
The coffee line below hummed, its patrons oblivious, their cups steaming like tiny nebulae against the steel. <words>281</words>
In the midst of their bickering, the minstrel pressed his unclear stamp onto a scrap of paper, releasing a faint glow. <words>302</words>
The glow formed a miniature cloud that drifted upward, aligning with the real sky and confirming his reading. <words>320</words>
His rival, seeing the sign, lowered his voice and offered a truce, the clouds now singing in unison. <words>338</words>
The minstrel accepted, realizing that inherited rivalries could be softened by shared wonder of the silent cosmos. <words>355</words>
Together they sang a duet, their verses weaving the city’s neon pulse with the horses’ hooves and the coffee steam. <words>375</words>
The rooftop stables glowed, a mundane enchantment that turned ordinary rivalry into a shared hymn to the sky. <words>393</words>
When the sun finally slipped behind the megacity’s towers, the clouds dissolved, but the song lingered. <words>409</words>
The minstrel tucked his unclear stamp into his satchel, a reminder that even the most vague imprint can guide a heart. <words>430</words>
He descended the stairs, coffee in hand, ready to face the next line of the city’s endless queue, his mind already reading the clouds above. <words>455</words>
