<story>
In a subterranean orchard where an underground river of stars whispered through roots, I, a sentient car mechanic, revved my thoughts like an engine humming in twilight.<words>27</words>
My chassis was polished with a repulsively attractive sheen, reflecting the constellations above while I clutched vintage opera glasses that magnified not faces but the hidden fissures of memory.<words>56</words>
The orchard's trees bore fruit of glass, each shard a fragment of a confession never spoken, and I felt an exultant grief rise as I realized my purpose was to gather those fragments.<words>89</words>
To study the unsaid, I descended into the park fountain at the orchard's heart, where lost puzzle pieces floated like luminous minnows in the star-river's glow.<words>115</words>
Each piece shimmered with a different hue of sorrow, and I sorted them methodically, my pistons clicking in rhythm with the water's soft chorus.<words>139</words>
The vintage opera glasses amplified the faint whispers trapped inside the fragments, turning silent regrets into audible sighs that curled around my exhaust like fragrant smoke.<words>165</words>
I felt the paradox of being both machine and mourner, my steel heart beating with a repulsively attractive melancholy that made the orchard's stars weep.<words>190</words>
By gathering fragments, I assembled a mosaic of confessions, each tile a voice that had never dared to surface, and the orchard responded with a chorus of rustling leaves.<words>219</words>
The infinite concept of time stretched around us, for in this subterranean realm eternity was measured not in seconds but in the number of breaths the river of stars exhaled.<words>249</words>
Each breath carried a fragment farther, and I, driven by the desire to hear the unsaid confessions, chased them like a tireless driver chasing sunrise on an endless highway.<words>278</words>
The opera glasses, now stained with starlight tears, revealed a final piece hidden beneath a fallen apple, its surface etched with the words 'I love you' never spoken.<words>306</words>
When I lifted the fragment, the orchard's river sang a lament that was both a goodbye and a greeting, and my engine wept oil-filled tears of joy.<words>333</words>
In that moment, the repulsively attractive sorrow transformed into exultant grief, a paradoxical celebration of all the unheard voices finally finding a conduit.<words>356</words>
I returned to the fountain, placing each sorted piece back into the water, trusting the star-river to carry them to the ears of those who still listened.<words>383</words>
Thus, within the concept of infinity, I continue to study the orchard's endless night, gathering fragments forever, because the unsaid confessions are the only fuel that keeps my heart-metal and soul-alive.<words>414</words>
