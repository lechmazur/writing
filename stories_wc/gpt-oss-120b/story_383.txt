The burnt-out general slumped into the dark matter diner, his uniform frayed like old constellations. <words>15</words>
Between rides on the interstellar tram, he sought a brief respite from the endless parade of commands. <words>32</words>
A server placed a plate of dried seaweed on his table, the kelp curled like ancient scripts waiting to be read. <words>53</words>
He recognized the seaweed as a token of shared anxieties, each brittle leaf a confession whispered across galaxies. <words>71</words>
The diner’s walls were lined with black‑and‑white photographs, arcs of light and shadow forming impossible loops that seemed to laugh at logic. <words>93</words>
He lifted his cup, and with a rationally absurd grin, declared that the arcs would renew his resolve. <words>111</words>
The photographs, however, were not mere images; they were portals that projected his inner battles onto the diner’s cracked floor. <words>131</words>
Each arc traced a curve of fear, and as he watched, the curves bent toward a throne of reason that trembled under the weight of dread. <words>157</words>
He whispered a mischievous wisdom: to dethrone fear, one must invite it to a banquet and serve it dried seaweed seasoned with humility. <words>180</words>
The seaweed crunched under his teeth, each bite echoing the collective sighs of soldiers who had once trusted his commands. <words>200</words>
Suddenly the arcs in the photographs flickered, their black lines turning silver as if the diner itself inhaled his resolve. <words>220</words>
In that rationally absurd moment, the general felt his burnt-out spirit rekindle, a spark drawn from the shared anxieties of the universe. <words>242</words>
He rose, the chair scraping the floor like a drumbeat, and declared that fear would no longer sit upon the throne of reason. <words>265</words>
The diner’s patrons, silhouettes of travelers between rides, nodded in silent accord, their own doubts dissolving into the black‑and‑white haze. <words>285</words>
With a final mischievous grin, he lifted the dried seaweed like a scepter and placed it atop the photograph’s brightest arc, a symbolic renewal. <words>309</words>
The arc glowed, and the diner seemed to pulse with a new rhythm, as if the cosmos itself had been rewired by his act. <words>333</words>
He stepped back into the hallway of the interstellar station, the scent of seaweed lingering like a promise of future battles won. <words>355</words>
Between rides, he would return to the dark matter diner, each visit a ritual to renew his mind and to keep fear dethroned. <words>378</words>
Thus the burnt-out general, now tempered by absurd wisdom, walked onward, his steps echoing the arcs of photographs that forever reminded him of shared anxieties turned into courage. <words>406</words>
