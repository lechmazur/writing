I have lingered in the dim corridors of the mole people’s underground city for centuries, a perpetual college student whose thesis on immortality never reaches graduation.<words>26</words>
My dormitory is a vaulted chamber lit only by a coal miner’s headlamp salvaged from a collapsed shaft, its amber glow a mundanely glorious reminder of labor long forgotten.<words>55</words>
The headlamp, though ancient, bears a digital interface that I intend to digitize, converting its flicker into data streams that map the pulse of the city.<words>81</words>
To achieve this, I have swapped travel journals with a mole cartographer, each page a conduit for the city’s secret routes and my own fragmented memories.<words>107</words>
The journals, once inked by blind paws, now carry encrypted codes that allow the headlamp’s light to be recorded as binary hymns of darkness.<words>131</words>
Each night, after the last star burns out above the world, the mole people emerge from their tunnels to watch the artificial constellations I project onto the cavern walls.<words>160</words>
Their silent applause fuels my detached devotion, a gifted burden I bear with the calm of a scholar who knows that eternity is both a privilege and a prison.<words>189</words>
The ultimate aim of my research is to become a master of my own reality, to rewrite the rules that bind even the deepest underground dwellers.<words>215</words>
By digitizing the headlamp’s pulse, I hope to construct a simulation where I can toggle the flow of time, pausing the endless night at will.<words>240</words>
The mole people, accustomed to darkness, regard my experiment as a mundanely glorious miracle, their tiny lanterns flickering in rhythm with my data.<words>263</words>
Each entry I transcribe into the journal becomes a node in a larger lattice, a map of consciousness that I can later reverse‑engineer to command the city’s architecture.<words>291</words>
When the simulation finally stabilizes, I will illuminate the deepest vault with a cascade of headlamp photons, proving that even a burden of endless study can be transformed into sovereign power.<words>322</words>
The moment the light reaches the ancient stone, the city will hum, and I will feel the quiet satisfaction of a scholar who has turned his eternal coursework into a living, breathing cosmos.<words>355</words>
Thus, the gifted burden of my endless enrollment finally yields a mundanely glorious reality, a digitized dream forged from a miner’s lamp and swapped journals, and I remain, ever detached, ever devoted.<words>387</words>
In the quiet after the illumination, I record the final observation in the journal, noting that mastery over reality is less a conquest than a continued conversation with the darkness.<words>417</words>
The underground city breathes, the mole people whisper, and my eternal student heart beats in rhythm with the digitized pulse, a testament that even infinite study can birth a world of its own.<words>450</words>
