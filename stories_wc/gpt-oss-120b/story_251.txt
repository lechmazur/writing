<story>
The ambivalent prophet drifted through the dim corridors of the lunar mining colony, humming a half‑hearted hymn. <words>17</words>
His eyes flickered between reverence and doubt, a happily sad glow that made the basalt walls feel like old confidants. <words>37</words>
In his satchel lay a cracked collection of marbles, each sphere a memory shattered by the colony’s endless drills. <words>56</words>
He claimed the marbles were the only map to the final oath, the promise that could rewrite the cosmic scoreboard. <words>76</words>
Between heartbeats, he whispered the oath to the dust, hoping the words would linger long enough to be heard. <words>95</words>
His motivation was simple yet grand: to scramble the cosmic scoreboard, swapping the fates of miners and stars alike. <words>114</words>
He approached the ancient rummage‑sale box left by the first settlers, its lid cracked like his own resolve. <words>132</words>
Inside, scattered jigsaw puzzle edges waited, each piece a fragment of a forgotten lunar legend. <words>147</words>
He lifted a corner piece, feeling its cold metal bite into his palm, and declared his bashful arrogance aloud. <words>166</words>
With a grin that trembled between pride and embarrassment, he began to defragment the shattered story of the colony. <words>185</words>
Each puzzle edge fit a marble groove, and as he pressed them together, the cracked marbles sang a low, resonant chord. <words>206</words>
The colony’s air thrummed, and the prophet felt the final oath coalesce like a nebula forming in his mind. <words>225</words>
He whispered the oath again, this time louder, letting the words ripple through the basalt like a shy comet. <words>244</words>
The scoreboard flickered, numbers rearranging as miners’ quotas swapped with the moon’s own tidal cycles. <words>259</words>
A sudden grin spread across his face, a bashful arrogance that declared victory before the universe could protest. <words>277</words>
Yet the prophet felt a pang of melancholy, knowing the score had been scrambled at the cost of forgotten souls. <words>297</words>
He placed the final marble, its crack now glowing, into the central slot of the puzzle, sealing the oath. <words>316</words>
The colony’s lights dimmed then surged, as if the moon itself inhaled and exhaled in approval. <words>332</words>
Between heartbeats, the prophet sensed the final oath ripple outward, touching distant starships that watched the lunar horizon. <words>350</words>
He bowed, half‑proud and half‑ashamed, his ambivalence now a quiet hymn of responsibility. <words>363</words>
The cracked marbles lay scattered again, each fragment reflecting a different future, a mosaic of hope and regret. <words>381</words>
As the lunar wind whispered through the shafts, the prophet’s voice faded, leaving only the echo of his final oath. <words>401</words>
