I am a paramedic caught in a time loop, each rescue replaying like a broken record inside a humming quantum tunnel.<words>21</words>
The tunnel walls pulse with neon uncertainty, and the only constant is the privately public broadcast of my own breath echoing back.<words>43</words>
At the bell’s echo marking a forgotten recess, I hear a single raindrop fall, its sound a metronome for my looping days.<words>65</words>
I clutch a weathered fishing lure, its rusted hook a reminder of the lives I could not save and the unhealed traumas that cling like algae.<words>91</words>
Each loop forces me to nest my thoughts in the narrow corridor of the tunnel, arranging them like fish in a net, hoping to catch a pattern.<words>118</words>
Excited boredom fuels my actions; I am thrilled by the novelty of repetition yet numb to its endlessness.<words>136</words>
My motivation is simple yet profound: to baptize my nightmares in acceptance, to wash the lingering dread with the cold water of inevitability.<words>159</words>
The quantum tunnel reacts to my resolve, shimmering each time I press the lure against the vibrating wall, as if the metal itself records my confession.<words>185</words>
When the raindrop sound repeats, I know the loop has reset, and the bell’s echo returns, a reminder that time here is a circle, not a line.<words>212</words>
I watch my younger self stumble into the tunnel, eyes wide with the same excited boredom that now defines my eternity.<words>233</words>
I hand him the lure, whispering that the weight of unhealed traumas can be carried only if we acknowledge them in the public eye yet keep them privately private.<words>262</words>
He nods, and together we nest the lure into a hollow of the tunnel, a makeshift altar where each drop of rain becomes a sacrament.<words>287</words>
The single raindrop falls again, its echo amplified by the quantum walls, and I feel the old wounds pulse in rhythm with the sound.<words>311</words>
In that moment, the loop pauses, and I sense a crack in the endless cycle, a chance to finally accept the nightmares I have been baptizing.<words>337</words>
I step forward, the lure humming like a heart, and the tunnel brightens, revealing a doorway that leads out of the loop and into sunrise.<words>362</words>
The bell’s echo fades, the raindrop’s sound dissolves, and I realize that the acceptance I sought was not a destination but a nest I built within myself.<words>389</words>
Leaving the quantum tunnel behind, I carry the weathered lure as a token, a reminder that even unhealed traumas can be cradled in excited boredom and still bloom.<words>417</words>
The loop may call me again, but now I know how to nest my nightmares, baptize them, and let the single raindrop’s song guide me home.<words>443</words>
