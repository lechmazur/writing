At a wind‑swept ridge, the high‑altitude tea house perched like a lone teacup on a cliff, its steam curling into the thin clouds.<words>23</words>
Inside, during intermission of the nightly poetry recital, a mad botanist named Dr. Vireo adjusted his worn‑out leather belt, the frayed buckle clinking like a warning bell.<words>50</words>
His eyes, half‑glazed with chlorophyll fumes, scanned the tea house’s vaulted ceiling where hidden sections of a black‑and‑white film reel flickered behind a cracked lantern.<words>75</words>
Comically serious, he declared that the reel contained the key to ionize the air, a process he believed will reveal ancient pathways etched in the mountain’s memory.<words>102</words>
The tea house’s patrons, a fickle loyalty of poets and travelers, whispered doubts while sipping oolong, their murmurs swirling like mist around the botanist’s carnivorous vines that crept from his satchel.<words>133</words>
He lifted the belt, revealing a pocket of copper wire tangled with dried orchid petals, and announced that the hidden film sections would act as a lens to focus the ionizing charge.<words>165</words>
When the projector sputtered, the monochrome frames burst into a cascade of static, each flicker aligning with the vines’ tiny jaws that snapped shut in rhythm with the crackling energy.<words>195</words>
The air tingled, and a faint blue glow traced the outline of a forgotten stone stair spiraling down the cliff, exactly the ancient pathway Dr. Vireo had been hunting for years.<words>226</words>
He whispered to the vines, promising them a share of the secret garden hidden at the pathway’s end, while his loyalty to the tea house’s owner wavered like a candle in the wind.<words>259</words>
The owner, a stoic monk who served tea with a smile that never quite reached his eyes, nodded reluctantly, his fickle allegiance shifting as the ionized mist curled around his robes.<words>290</words>
Suddenly, the vines erupted, their mouths opening wide to swallow the projected frames, converting the black‑and‑white ghosts into a pulsing green that seeped into the stone.<words>316</words>
The ancient pathway glowed, and the tea house trembled as if the mountain itself were inhaling the ionized breath of the botanist’s experiment.<words>339</words>
Dr. Vireo, comically serious even as his hair stood on end, stepped forward, his belt tightening around his waist like a ceremonial sash, and declared the moment a triumph of loyalty to curiosity.<words>372</words>
Yet as he placed a trembling foot onto the glowing stair, the vines recoiled, reminding him that their allegiance was as fickle as the tea house’s patrons, ready to bite if betrayed.<words>404</words>
The intermission ended with a soft applause, the poets oblivious to the unseen pathway now humming beneath their cups, while Dr. Vireo vanished into the stone, his loyalty to the unknown forever sealed.<words>437</words>
