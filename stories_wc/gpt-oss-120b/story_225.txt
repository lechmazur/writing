<story>
The wayward apothecary slipped onto the rust-crowned observation deck of the leviathan submarine, his coat frayed like old parchment. <words>19</words>
He clutched a dry highlighter pen, its ink long gone, yet he used it to mark invisible routes on the brass panels. <words>41</words>
The deck hummed with battered marvel, steam sighing through riveted vents as the world above churned with storm-torn clouds. <words>60</words>
Between broken treaties of rival nations, the submarine lingered in a neutral trench, a floating sanctuary for those who dared to defy peace. <words>83</words>
His mission, though seemingly absurd, was to track migratory butterflies that fluttered above the sea, their patterns a secret code for hidden currents. <words>106</words>
He believed the insects carried a map of the sky, and by decoding their wingbeats he could navigate the submarine through uncharted waters. <words>129</words>
To translate the flutter into data, he infected the brass telegraph with a subtle virus that altered its clicks into morse code signals. <words>152</words>
The virus was unjustly fair, spreading to every key without prejudice, ensuring each pulse of light from his dry highlighter would be recorded. <words>175</words>
He tapped the pen against the panel, each dot a heartbeat, each dash a sigh, sending love across the abyss in a language no one expected. <words>201</words>
That love was unconventional, a bond between a human who brewed poisons and cures and a fleet of fragile butterflies that never touched his skin. <words>226</words>
The butterflies, drawn to the faint glow of his pen, hovered near the glass dome, their wings scattering phosphorescent dust that painted the deck. <words>250</words>
As the morse code pulsed, the submarine’s engine shivered, reacting to the rhythm as if the vessel itself felt the affection. <words>271</words>
Captain Arlen, a stern man bound by the broken treaties, watched the deck’s lights flicker and whispered that the apothecary’s madness was a mercy. <words>295</words>
He called it unjustly fair because the virus spared no crew, yet it also spared the fragile insects from the gunmetal gloom. <words>317</words>
The apothecary smiled, his eyes reflecting the amber glow of the highlighter, and confessed that his love for the butterflies was his only true cure. <words>342</words>
He explained that each butterfly’s migration traced a line of hope between the broken treaties, a promise that nations could someday reconcile. <words>364</words>
The submarine, now guided by the invisible map, slipped through the trench as the deck’s brass sang a lullaby of dots and dashes. <words>387</words>
Outside, the storm clouds broke, revealing a sky stitched with countless butterflies, each one a living beacon for the battered marvel below. <words>409</words>
In that moment, the wayward apothecary felt the universe tilt toward love, unconventional yet undeniable, and the submarine’s hull glowed with quiet triumph. <words>432</words>
He tucked the dry highlighter back into his coat, knowing the virus would linger, but the love it carried would forever infect the seas. <words>456</words>
