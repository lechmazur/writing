<story>
The impassive deputy entered the cathedral, his eyes scanning the lush orchard that clung to the vaulted rafters like green veins.<words>21</words>
He was there during oil changes, a ritual he performed on the ancient engine of the building’s forgotten clock, a task that gave him a reason to linger among the fruit.<words>52</words>
The deputy’s demeanor was personally impersonal, a mask of neutrality that never cracked even as the scent of ripe apples pressed against his nostrils.<words>76</words>
He carried a twisted twist tie in his gloved hand, its metal coil a reminder of the small, stubborn connections that held the world together.<words>101</words>
The orchard’s branches stretched toward the cracked stained glass, each leaf humming with uncharted echoes of prayers long abandoned.<words>120</words>
He listened, not with ears but with the secret language of bees that fluttered unseen between blossoms, translating the silence into a map of intention.<words>145</words>
Cautious bravery guided his steps as he moved deeper, each footfall a negotiation between reverence and duty.<words>162</words>
The oil change ritual required him to unscrew the ancient gears, and as he turned the wrench, the orchard seemed to inhale, its branches stretching wider to accommodate his motion.<words>192</words>
A sudden buzz rose from the canopy, and a swarm of bees formed a living ladder, their wings spelling out a phrase only the deputy could hear: ‘Grace awaits.’<words>221</words>
He tightened the twist tie around the rusted hinge, a symbolic act to bind the present to the past, and felt the orchard’s echo ripple through his bones.<words>249</words>
The uncharted echoes grew louder, forming a chorus that seemed to map the hidden corridors of the cathedral’s memory.<words>268</words>
He understood that his personally impersonal stance was a shield, allowing him to witness a moment of pure grace without being consumed by it.<words>292</words>
The bees, communicating in their buzzing dialect, guided his hand to a single golden apple that glowed with an inner light.<words>313</words>
He reached out, his fingers trembling, and the twist tie slipped from his grip, spiraling down like a comet toward the fruit.<words>335</words>
The moment froze, the orchard holding its breath, and the deputy felt the uncharted echo resolve into a single, crystalline note of gratitude.<words>358</words>
He realized that the oil change was merely a pretext, a mundane cover for the true purpose of his visit: to stretch his perception beyond the ordinary.<words>385</words>
With cautious bravery, he lifted the golden apple, and the bees swarmed around it, their wings forming a luminous halo that bathed the cathedral in amber.<words>411</words>
The light revealed hidden frescoes depicting past deputies, each one impassive, each one tasked with guarding the orchard’s secret.<words>430</words>
He bowed his head, not out of reverence but to acknowledge the personal sacrifice required to become part of that uncharted chorus.<words>452</words>
The orchard’s echo faded as the bees departed, leaving the deputy alone with the apple, the twist tie, and the lingering promise of future grace.<words>477</words>
