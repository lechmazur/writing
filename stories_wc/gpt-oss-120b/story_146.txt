I am a faux fortune teller, a performer who pretends to read futures but secretly receives vivid, unbidden visions. <words>19</words>
When I arrived in the sprawling metropolis of Lira, I deliberately got lost, hoping the city's labyrinthine alleys would force me to explore beyond my rehearsed routes. <words>46</words>
The city whispered in an extinct language archive hidden beneath a forgotten library, where scholars preserved glyphs no living tongue could utter. <words>68</words>
I followed a faint melody drifting from a crypt beneath the archive, a sound that seemed to pulse with the rhythm of planting seasons, as if the earth itself were humming. <words>99</words>
Inside the crypt, among dust‑cloaked sarcophagi, I discovered a bone flute, its ivory surface etched with symbols that matched the extinct script above. <words>122</words>
When I lifted the flute to my lips, the visions surged, showing me a sacred development of language that blossomed only when people dared to take chances. <words>149</words>
The peace of the music clashed with a quiet anger inside me, a peaceful anger born from years of being dismissed as a charlatan while my true sight grew stronger. <words>179</words>
I realized that my regular performances were seldom enough to satisfy the deeper hunger for authentic revelation. <words>196</words>
Thus I resolved to study the sacred development by cataloguing every symbol on the flute and cross‑referencing it with the archive's extinct texts. <words>219</words>
Each night, as I planted seeds of research in the soil of my notebook, the visions guided me toward hidden meanings, like seedlings pushing through cracked stone. <words>246</words>
The more I delved, the more the city’s forgotten corners revealed themselves, and I found a hidden garden where the extinct language seemed to bloom in fragrant vines. <words>274</words>
There, I played the bone flute, and the air vibrated with a resonance that coaxed the vines to whisper the lost syllables, confirming my visions. <words>299</words>
The peaceful anger within me softened as I finally felt my faux persona aligning with the genuine gift I possessed. <words>319</words>
I decided to share the discovery, not as a spectacle, but as a scholarly offering to the archive’s curators, hoping they would recognize the value of chance‑driven insight. <words>347</words>
When I presented the bone flute and my annotated translations, the curators gasped, realizing the extinct language could be revived through the very music that had guided me. <words>375</words>
Their gratitude was tempered by the knowledge that such revelations only appear when scholars take chances as often as they fear the unknown. <words>398</words>
I left the archive that evening, the city lights flickering like the symbols on my flute, feeling a calm fury that the world would finally hear the ancient song. <words>427</words>
