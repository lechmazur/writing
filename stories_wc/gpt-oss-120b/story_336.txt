<story>
The weary undertaker slipped through the marble corridors of the ancient Persian palace reimagined, his steps echoing like distant prayers. <words>20</words>
Outside, a car backfired, its sudden crack shattering the night and leaving a hush that settled over the silent street like a thin veil. <words>44</words>
He paused beneath an astronomical clock whose gilded gears traced the heavens, each tick a reminder that time itself could be a map. <words>67</words>
The clock’s face was etched with tribal knowledge of sun paths, a rarely practical art that elders once used to imprison darkness within stone. <words>91</words>
He remembered the old legend that if one followed the sun’s arc across the sky, the shadows could be locked away, granting a flicker of hope in the absolute dark. <words>121</words>
The undertaker’s trade demanded he cradle bodies in silence, yet his heart beat with a placid ferocity, a calm rage against the inevitable night. <words>145</words>
He lifted the heavy lid of a sarcophagus, its interior black as void, and whispered the sun‑path prayer taught by his forebears. <words>167</words>
Each syllable aligned with the clock’s moving hands, and the palace walls seemed to pulse, as if the stone itself inhaled the dying light. <words>191</words>
Following the sun paths meant tracing the golden line on the clock’s rim, stepping forward when the hour hand pointed east and retreating when it turned west. <words>218</words>
He moved deliberately, each footfall a measured beat, imprisoning the darkness that threatened to swallow the palace’s forgotten souls. <words>237</words>
The ancient Persian tiles glimmered with amber motifs, reflecting the clock’s light like a river of molten gold flowing through vaulted arches. <words>259</words>
In that placid ferocity, the undertaker felt a surge of purpose, a quiet roar that steadied his hands as he sealed the sarcophagus with a sun‑kissed seal. <words>286</words>
The seal clicked into place, and a thin filament of light escaped, spiraling upward to join the astronomical clock’s own beacon. <words>307</words>
For a heartbeat the palace seemed to breathe, the darkness receding like a tide pulled back by an unseen moon. <words>327</words>
He knew the tribal knowledge was rarely practical, yet in this moment it became a weapon, imprisoning night with the precision of sun‑aligned steps. <words>351</words>
The car’s echo faded, leaving only the soft ticking of the clock and the faint hum of hope that resonated through stone and soul. <words>375</words>
In the hush after the backfire, the undertaker stood alone, his eyes reflecting the celestial gears, a promise that even absolute dark could be held at bay. <words>402</words>
