<story>
The forthright peddler drifted into the abandoned space station medical bay, his cart rattling like a nervous heartbeat.<words>18</words>
He carried a dried flower bouquet, each brittle blossom a silent witness to forgotten vows.<words>33</words>
The universe hummed its secret song through the cracked hull, a melancholy lullaby that made his solitary joy feel like a prayer.<words>55</words>
He was meekly assertive, offering his wares with a smile that hinted at both humility and unshakable resolve.<words>73</words>
His purpose was redemption's path, a pilgrimage to break an oath sealed in blood by the very hands that once sold him hope.<words>96</words>
The oath had bound him to silence, forbidding him from speaking the name of the tyrant who had razed his home.<words>117</words>
To shatter that chain, he needed to divide the truth, scattering it like seeds among the station’s lingering ghosts.<words>136</words>
He began by sifting through rumor-laden gossip columns etched into the rusted consoles, each fragment a clue to the tyrant’s hidden weakness.<words>158</words>
The columns whispered of a forgotten serum stored in the bay’s sealed locker, a cure that could dissolve the blood oath’s binding.<words>180</words>
He approached the locker, his hands trembling yet steady, and placed the dried flower bouquet atop it as a symbolic offering.<words>201</words>
The bouquet’s scent, though faint, filled the sterile air with a nostalgic perfume that reminded the station’s ghostly patients of life beyond decay.<words>224</words>
A soft chime echoed as the locker hissed open, revealing vials of luminescent liquid that pulsed in rhythm with the universe’s hum.<words>246</words>
He poured a single drop onto the dried petals, watching the flowers revive in a flash of crimson light.<words>265</words>
The revived blossoms sang a quiet hymn, each note a promise that the oath could be undone.<words>282</words>
With the serum in hand, he returned to the central hub, where the tyrant’s portrait still loomed over the broken walls.<words>303</words>
He whispered the tyrant’s name, a sound that had been forbidden, and let the crimson droplets fall upon the canvas.<words>323</words>
The portrait dissolved into ash, and with it the blood oath cracked, releasing a sigh that mingled with the station’s lonely joy.<words>345</words>
He felt the weight of his redemption lift, not as triumph but as a gentle relief that echoed the universe’s secret song.<words>367</words>
The peddler, now both seller and savior, divided his remaining wares among the lingering spirits, each transaction a quiet celebration of freedom.<words>389</words>
As he stepped back into the corridor, the dried flower bouquet in his cart glowed faintly, a reminder that even in joyful loneliness, hope can be cultivated.<words>416</words>
