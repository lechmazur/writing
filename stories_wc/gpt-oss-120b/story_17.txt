At dawn, I stride through the cobblestone alleys, my boots echoing against the silent city as I begin my morning walks, a ritual that steadies my guilt-ridden black market genealogist heart.<words>31</words>
The city’s market whispers of a witch’s incantation chamber hidden beneath the old apothecary, a place where broken objects are reborn, and I have been hired to retrieve a chipped bowl that once held the blood of a forgotten lineage.<words>71</words>
My motivation is simple yet fierce: to find a path to self-forgiveness, to stand at the brink of renewal and finally release the weight of the names I have sold to the highest bidder.<words>105</words>
I enter the chamber, its walls pulsing with violet smoke, and the witch, an atypically typical old woman with a smile that hides centuries of bargains, greets me with a brazen modesty that feels oddly reassuring.<words>141</words>
She tells me the bowl’s curse can only be lifted if I zoom into the hidden meanings of the funeral eulogies I have catalogued for years, by analyzing the subtext in funeral eulogies that echo the lives of the dead.<words>181</words>
Each eulogy is a thread, and as I pull them, the chamber’s fire flickers, revealing a tapestry of betrayals that mirror my own market sins, making the witch’s eyes glint with both pity and profit.<words>216</words>
The chipped bowl sits on a stone altar, its fissure a map of the families I have torn apart, and I sense that repairing it will also mend the fractured part of me that still clings to guilt.<words>254</words>
I begin the ritual by reciting the eulogies in reverse, letting the subtext rise like incense, and the bowl’s cracks glow amber as the incantation weaves the lost names back into the lineage.<words>287</words>
When the amber light fades, the bowl is whole again, and the witch nods, acknowledging that I have reached the brink of renewal not only for the artifact but for my own conscience.<words>320</words>
I leave the chamber with the bowl cradled in my arms, feeling the weight of my past lift like morning mist, and I promise myself that each future morning walk will be a quiet audit of the lives I have catalogued, ensuring I never trade souls for coin again.<words>369</words>
Back on the cobblestones, the sunrise paints the city gold, and I notice that even the most ordinary passerby now seems atypically typical, as if the world itself has been subtly rewritten by my confession.<words>404</words>
