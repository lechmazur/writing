The exorcist, whose hands trembled like a stage-light filament, entered the orbital debris field with a defiant hush. <words>18</words>
He was known for never usual rituals, preferring whispered incantations over the roaring applause of a theater. <words>35</words>
Amid toy assembly stations floating like ghostly cradles, he carried a bundle of pressed wildflowers, each petal a mute testimony to a family's inheritance of lies. <words>61</words>
The lies were not spoken but encoded in the metal fragments that circled the Earth, a silent ledger passed down through generations of salvagers. <words>85</words>
His motivation was to sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never," to prove that even a cursed lineage could bloom anew. <words>106</words>
He approached the central hub, a rusted locker whose lock sang a note each time a key turned, the sound reverberating like a heartbeat in vacuum. <words>132</words>
By the sound of a key turning in a lock, he felt the air thicken, the debris trembling as if awaiting confession. <words>154</words>
He placed the pressed wildflowers on the locker's lid, then whispered the incantation, his voice a trembling yet steady drum. <words>174</words>
The locker opened, revealing a vortex of micro-satellite shards that threatened to swallow the toy assembly platform whole. <words>192</words>
Without hesitation, he submerge his hands into the swirling metal, feeling each fragment pulse with the false narratives of his ancestors. <words>213</words>
The lies tried to cling, but the pressed wildflowers released a scent of earth that cut through the synthetic rot. <words>233</words>
A quiet defiance rose within him, a hush louder than any crowd, as the debris began to dissolve into harmless glitter. <words>254</words>
The toy assembly robots, programmed to build dreams, paused and watched the transformation, their metal eyes reflecting the blooming petals. <words>274</words>
He felt his stage fright melt away, replaced by a purpose that resonated louder than any applause could ever achieve. <words>294</words>
When the last shard vanished, the locker clicked shut, sealing the false inheritance and promising a new lineage of truth. <words>314</words>
He retrieved the wildflowers, now glowing faintly, and tucked them into his coat, a reminder that even in orbit's cold void, hope can be pressed into permanence. <words>341</words>
The exorcist stepped back onto the assembly line, the toys humming around him like a choir, each note a promise that the inherited lies had finally been exorcised. <words>369</words>
In that defiant hush, he realized that the true key was never a lock at all, but the courage to submerge fear beneath the scent of possibility. <words>396</words>
He lifted his gaze to the glittering horizon, where the sun's first rays pierced the debris, and whispered a promise to the universe: the next generation would inherit only truth. <words>426</words>
