I am a bruised fighter, my ribs still echoing the last bout, and I stand in a dusty attic where clockwork animals click and whirr like restless insects. <words>28</words>
The air smells of oil and old parchment, and a single shard of a clay pot lies on a cracked wooden table, its surface etched with a faded inscription that reads, “Stand for truth, not for comfort.” <words>65</words>
I feel skillfully incompetent, a paradox that lets me stumble into victories as easily as I trip over my own shadow. <words>86</words>
At the exact moment a sculptor’s chisel first strikes marble in a distant studio, a tremor ripples through the attic, as if the world itself were being carved. <words>114</words>
The shard vibrates, and a thin filament of forgotten dreams threads from its edge to my mind, pulling me toward a memory I never lived. <words>139</words>
Through that dream‑tide I abduct a phantom of my former self, a version that still clings to the lie that I fight for glory rather than for redemption. <words>167</words>
The phantom shivers, its eyes reflecting the inscription on the pot shard, and I realize that standing for something means confronting the very self‑deception that fuels my bruises. <words>195</words>
I raise my battered fists, not to strike an opponent, but to smash the illusion that I am invincible, hoping the blow will extinguish the last vestige of self‑deception. <words>224</words>
The clockwork animals, sensing the shift, halt their gears and stare with glassy eyes, their metal bodies humming a low, mournful chord. <words>246</words>
In that close distance, the attic feels like a crucible, each breath a furnace feeding the fire of my resolve. <words>266</words>
The shard’s inscription glows faintly, and I whisper the words back to the phantom, “Stand for truth, not for comfort,” as if sealing a pact. <words>291</words>
The phantom shatters like porcelain, releasing a cascade of dust that settles on the clockwork creatures, coating them in a thin veil of humility. <words>315</words>
I drop the clay pot shard onto the floor, and the sound of it cracking echoes the chisel’s first strike, a reminder that creation and destruction are twin breaths. <words>344</words>
Now, bruised but unbroken, I stand amid the silent mechanical menagerie, a fighter who has finally chosen a cause beyond his own pain. <words>367</words>
The attic breathes a sigh of relief, and I feel the weight of the inscription settle into my bones, a quiet oath to never again be fooled by false glory. <words>397</words>
Tomorrow, I will carve my own marble truth. <words>405</words>
