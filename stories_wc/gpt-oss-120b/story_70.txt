The uptight scribe entered the witch's greenhouse, a glassy cathedral clinging to a hill of gravestones, clutching a notebook as if it were a shield.<words>25</words>
Rain drummed on the iron panes, and the air smelled of moss and old incense, a quiet transformation humming beneath the wilted vines.<words>48</words>
He was certainly uncertain about the purpose of the prototype light bulb from Tesla’s workshop that lay on a cracked marble pedestal, its filament flickering like a hesitant heart.<words>77</words>
The scribe's mission, to cradle empathy in arms of steel, seemed absurd in a place where magic and machinery tangled like vines.<words>99</words>
He began to bellow a low chant, not out of anger but to coax the dormant energy of the bulb into waking.<words>121</words>
The chant resonated with the greenhouse's own sighs, and the walls seemed to lean closer, listening to his precise, hurried scribbles.<words>142</words>
He turned to the only clue left by the witch: a once‑sealed envelope whose adhesive still glistened on the edge of the desk.<words>165</words>
By analyzing the leftover adhesive from a once‑sealed envelope, he hoped to decode a hidden formula that would stabilize the bulb's erratic glow.<words>188</words>
The residue contained faint traces of copper and a whisper of lavender, a signature the witch used to bind compassion to circuitry.<words>210</words>
He noted each element in his ledger, his pen scratching like a nervous insect, each line a step toward the moment when a puzzle piece finally fits.<words>237</words>
Suddenly, the bulb surged, not with a blinding flash but with a soft amber that spread like sunrise through the greenhouse's cracked panes.<words>260</words>
The light revealed a hidden alcove where a rusted steel armature stood, waiting to be embraced by the newfound glow.<words>280</words>
In that buried optimism, the scribe saw his purpose: to wrap the steel armature in empathy, to let it hold the fragile light for others.<words>305</words>
He whispered a promise to the greenhouse, that even the most rigid iron could learn to feel, and the vines seemed to nod in agreement.<words>330</words>
The witch, unseen but present, smiled as the bulb's glow steadied, its filament now humming a lullaby of quiet transformation.<words>350</words>
He recorded the final observation, his ink no longer trembling, and felt the weight of his notebook lift as if the pages themselves breathed.<words>374</words>
Outside, the hill of gravestones glowed faintly, each stone reflecting a fragment of the amber light, a chorus of silent witnesses.<words>395</words>
The scribe, still uptight but softened by the experience, closed his ledger, knowing that the quiet transformation had begun within both glass and heart.<words>419</words>
