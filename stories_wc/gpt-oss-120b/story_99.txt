<story>
I’m a bookbinder who can lift a tome with a thought, and I stroll into an abandoned carnival prize booth like it’s a coffee break. <words>25</words>
The booth smells of rusted cotton candy and the echo of a cracked calliope, but my mind stays strictly casual, humming a half‑hearted joke about lost prizes. <words>52</words>
On the cracked counter lies a single chopstick wrapper, its paper thin as a whisper, and I sense the price of knowledge humming beneath its fibers. <words>78</words>
I pick it up, and the wrapper snaps, releasing a burst of sound bites—a child’s laugh, a carousel’s creak, a distant announcer’s chant—that trigger sudden flashbacks. <words>104</words>
Each flashback drags me across the tapestry of lost legends, where ancient scribes traded their souls for ink that could rewrite reality. <words>126</words>
In one vision I see a monk binding a cursed grimoire, his hands trembling as he realizes the transformation he sought demanded a sacrifice of memory. <words>152</words>
The memory cost feels familiar, like the price I’m paying now for the ability to revive forgotten stories with a flick of my mind. <words>176</words>
I set the chopstick wrapper on the dusty shelf, and the booth’s broken speaker crackles, replaying a carnival bark that says, ‘Step right up!’ <words>200</words>
The bark is a sound bite, and it pulls a final flashback of a phoenix feather hidden inside a prize ticket, promising rebirth. <words>223</words>
I focus, letting my telekinetic power glide over the wrapper, and the paper lifts, swirling like a silent banner of intent. <words>244</words>
The swirl gathers the echoing sounds, and I channel them into a single pulse that revives the booth’s long‑dead carousel horse, its wooden eyes flickering awake. <words>270</words>
When the horse lifts its head, a cascade of forgotten carnival myths pours out, each one a lesson on how transformation always extracts a toll. <words>295</words>
I realize the single chopstick wrapper was the key, a humble object that demanded the price of knowledge in exchange for the power to revive what was lost. <words>323</words>
My casual grin widens as I understand that the transformation I sought is not a magical shortcut but a disciplined rebinding of stories, page by page. <words>349</words>
With the horse now humming the old tune, I place the revived carousel on the booth’s cracked stage, offering the world a new prize: a bound volume that writes itself as you read. <words>382</words>
The price of that knowledge is a quiet promise to never let curiosity become careless, a reminder that every revival costs a fragment of memory. <words>407</words>
I walk away from the booth, the chopstick wrapper crumpled in my pocket, feeling the weight of legends behind me and the lightness of a story finally reborn. <words>435</words>
