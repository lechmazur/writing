At the edge of the sea, a tidal power monitoring station hummed like a restless heart. <words>16</words>
Inside its concrete belly, a naive gambler named Milo shuffled cards while the tide whispered promises of fortune. <words>34</words>
He had come to dock his hopes at this lonely outpost, hoping the sea’s rhythm could finally settle his restless bets. <words>55</words>
The station’s cafeteria glowed with candlelit dinners, each table lit by a single rustic candle mold that cast trembling shadows on the walls. <words>78</words>
Milo’s motivation was simple yet desperate: to capture one last spark before oblivion claimed his dwindling luck. <words>95</words>
He believed the spark could be forged in the unspoken bargains whispered between the flickering flame and the tide’s endless churn. <words>116</words>
Unpredictable as the sea, those bargains were rarely predictable, shifting like the tide’s own mood. <words>131</words>
Milo attended rebellious midnight lectures by unhinged professors who taught that luck could be mined from the very currents that powered the station. <words>154</words>
Their lectures were wild, a cacophony of equations and poetry, and they insisted that every gamble was a contract signed in silence. <words>176</words>
Milo listened with laughing tears, his heart cracking open like a cracked porcelain cup under the candle’s glow. <words>194</words>
When the professors vanished at dawn, they left behind a single rusted key and a note: ‘Dock your soul where the water meets the wire.’ <words>219</words>
Milo, naive but hopeful, slipped the key into the control panel, feeling the station’s machinery shudder as if acknowledging his plea. <words>240</words>
The turbines roared, and the candle mold on his table began to melt, releasing a thin column of wax that rose like a ghostly lighthouse. <words>265</words>
In that luminous column, Milo saw a flicker of his own future, a spark that promised a final gamble before the inevitable night. <words>288</words>
He reached out, his fingers trembling, and the wax solidified around his hand, binding him to the unspoken bargain of the sea. <words>310</words>
The professors’ midnight teachings echoed in his mind: luck is a tide, and you must dock your desires before it recedes. <words>331</words>
Milo laughed through tears as the candle’s flame sputtered, realizing the spark he captured was not a win but a release. <words>352</words>
The tide rose, swallowing the station’s lights, and the rustic candle mold cracked, spilling its remaining wax into the sea. <words>372</words>
In that moment, Milo understood that the unspoken bargain was his surrender, a final gamble that turned into a quiet surrender to oblivion. <words>395</words>
He smiled, tears of laughter mixing with salt, as the sea claimed his last spark and the station’s heart beat one final, unpredictable rhythm. <words>419</words>
