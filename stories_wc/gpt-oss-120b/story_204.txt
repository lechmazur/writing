The abandoned spaceport hangar loomed like a rusted cathedral, its vaulted steel ribs echoing the hush before an acceptance speech began.<words>21</words>
In the dim dust laden aisles, Mara, a professional cuddler known for her unusually usual calm, arranged a modest booth of plush cushions and scented oils.<words>47</words>
She had come to the farmer's market that morning, a chance encounter that had offered her a basket of heirloom carrots and a whispered invitation to confront a prejudice that had haunted her since childhood.<words>82</words>
The prejudice was simple yet deep: she believed that those who never asked for touch were somehow unworthy of comfort, a rule unspoken among the circles of her trade.<words>111</words>
When the market crowd thinned, an elderly farmer approached her booth, his hands cradling a phantom train ticket punch that seemed to flicker between reality and memory.<words>138</words>
He claimed the punch could stamp the soul with a reminder that all journeys, even those without rails, eventually decay into starlight.<words>160</words>
Mara, intrigued by the ancient novelty of the device, listened as he narrated a legend of a forgotten line that once linked distant colonies, its passengers bound by a pact of silent respect.<words>193</words>
The farmer offered her the punch as a token, insisting that using it before her speech would honor the unspoken rules of the old travelers and perhaps dissolve her bias.<words>223</words>
She accepted, feeling the cool metal against her palm, and imagined the ghostly imprint as a bridge between her tactile profession and the invisible journeys of strangers.<words>250</words>
Back in the hangar, the echoing silence pressed like dust on her shoulders, reminding her that the world outside the market was still a cavern of forgotten promises.<words>278</words>
She lifted the phantom punch, pressed it against the worn metal of a nearby console, and felt a faint vibration as if the ancient rails beneath the floor sighed.<words>307</words>
In that instant, a cascade of soft, amber light spilled across the hangar, illuminating rows of dormant spacecraft like sleeping leviathans awaiting their next departure.<words>332</words>
The light seemed to pulse in rhythm with the unspoken rules she had lived by, each beat urging her to let go of the notion that touch alone defined worth.<words>362</words>
She realized that the prejudice she feared was merely a rusted track, and the phantom punch was a tool to smooth it, allowing new travelers to board without judgment.<words>391</words>
With a steady breath, she placed the punch into the pocket of her jacket, a quiet promise that the upcoming speech would carry the same ancient novelty of renewal.<words>420</words>
When the announcer's voice finally cut through the stillness, Mara stepped onto the makeshift stage, her eyes reflecting the lingering glow of the phantom rails.<words>445</words>
