<story>
The unsteady sentinel paced the rusted hull of the abandoned space freighter docking bay, his joints trembling like a dying star. <words>21</words>
Between worlds colliding, the sky outside the bay cracked with violet lightning, a reminder that destiny itself was being torn asunder. <words>42</words>
He clutched a strange automaton bird, its metallic feathers humming with a low, mournful frequency that seemed to echo the emptiness of the void. <words>66</words>
The bird's eyes flickered amber, and the sentinel felt a coyly furious surge, as if the machine knew the ambush of fate waiting beyond the cracked hull. <words>93</words>
He had been sent by the Council of Echoes to clear the fog of a misguided prophecy that claimed the freighter would swallow the last hope of the surviving colonies. <words>123</words>
The prophecy was written in shredded letters scattered across the deck, each fragment humming with residual quantum ink. <words>141</words>
To decipher it, the sentinel would have to recommend a method by reassembling shredded letters, a task that felt both absurd and holy. <words>164</words>
He knelt, his breath fogging the cold metal, and began to piece together the torn script, each syllable snapping like brittle glass. <words>186</words>
The automaton bird perched on his shoulder, its beak clicking in rhythm with the sentinel's trembling hands, as if urging him onward. <words>208</words>
Every time a fragment fit, a flash of violet lightning illuminated the bay, and the sentinel felt the ambush of fate receding like a tide. <words>233</words>
Yet the fog thickened whenever he hesitated, a cruel reminder that the prophecy's error was not merely words but the very will of the universe. <words>258</words>
His mind swam in cheerless ecstasy, a paradoxical joy that thrummed beneath the dread of the collapsing cosmos. <words>276</words>
The bird suddenly sang a metallic aria, its notes rearranging the shredded letters into a new pattern that glowed with a soft amber light. <words>300</words>
The pattern revealed a single command: ‘Release the anchor, let the worlds part, and the fog will lift.’ <words>318</words>
Understanding that the ambush of fate was a test, the sentinel obeyed, pulling the rusted lever that held the freighter's gravity field in place. <words>342</words>
The docking bay shuddered, and the colliding worlds outside seemed to pause, as if the universe held its breath for his decision. <words>364</words>
When the lever gave way, a wave of bright plasma surged through the bay, erasing the fog that had clouded the prophecy's meaning. <words>387</words>
The sentinel felt the weight lift from his shoulders, replaced by a quiet, bitter triumph that matched the bird's coyly furious chirp. <words>409</words>
He whispered a recommendation to the empty hull: remember the cost of listening to false omens, and never trust a prophecy written in torn scraps. <words>434</words>
As the worlds beyond finally collided, the freighter's hull cracked open, spilling starlight into the bay and sealing the sentinel's fate with a final, cheerless ecstasy. <words>460</words>
