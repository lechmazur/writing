The uncertain alchemist drifted among the stalls of the floating marketplace, each tent tethered to a kaleidoscope of hot air balloons.<words>21</words>
She clutched a cracked scale from a mythical beast, its jagged edge humming with a promise that felt both cursed and coveted.<words>43</words>
The scale, technically wild in its composition, could weigh the intangible cost of immortality against a single breath of mortal life.<words>64</words>
Her motive was simple yet strange: she needed the exact weight to map forest trails that twisted like veins beneath the clouds.<words>86</words>
The judge of the market, a rotund man in a brass‑capped hat, was about to read the verdict that would seal the fate of every vendor.<words>112</words>
At the hush before the judge reads the verdict, the air thrummed with mundane miracles, like a kettle that boiled itself without fire.<words>135</words>
She had learned to safeguard the scale’s secret by tracing the coded scuffs on a centuries‑old marble floor beneath the market’s central dome.<words>158</words>
Each scuff was a glyph representing a fraction of a soul, and together they formed a map that only a mind willing to barter with eternity could read.<words>186</words>
She pressed the cracked scale onto the marble, and the glyphs glowed, revealing a hidden trail that spiraled down into the forest canopy beyond the balloons.<words>212</words>
The price of immortality, she realized, was not a single coin but the surrender of every ordinary miracle she ever performed.<words>233</words>
If she accepted the scale’s offer, she would become a living relic, forever cataloguing trails while the world forgot the simple joy of a sunrise.<words>258</words>
But the market’s judge, unaware of her inner conflict, lifted his gavel, and the hush deepened into a breath held by every onlooker.<words>281</words>
She whispered a promise to the forest, promising to safeguard its secret trails in exchange for a single, fleeting glimpse of eternity.<words>303</words>
The coded scuffs flickered once more, and the scale tipped, measuring not her soul but the weight of the decision she was about to make.<words>328</words>
In that suspended moment, the floating market seemed a garden of ordinary wonders, each stall a petal holding a miracle that could be bought for a breath.<words>355</words>
She lowered the scale, letting the cracked metal rest on the marble, and the glyphs dissolved into dust that drifted toward the forest below.<words>379</words>
The judge finally spoke, his verdict echoing like a distant thunder, yet she heard only the rustle of leaves promising new paths to chart.<words>403</words>
