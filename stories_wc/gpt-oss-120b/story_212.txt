<story>
The plains stretched like a pale canvas, an ethereal expanse where wind whispered the remnants of a world that had burned. <words>21</words>
In this after the last resource war silence, Mara, an apocalyptic farmer, tended seedlings that glowed with stubborn hope. <words>40</words>
Her motivation was simple yet fierce: to escape a life dictated by the overseer who claimed the soil as his own. <words>61</words>
She carried a magician’s deck of trick cards, each card a sealed promise of a different seed, bound by ink that sang the song of boundaries. <words>87</words>
The deck was typically atypical, its backs shimmering with symbols that shifted whenever Mara jabbered to the wind, as if the cards themselves understood her restless language. <words>114</words>
She whispered the seed names, and the cards fluttered, releasing a faint hum that resonated across the plains like a distant choir of borders being redrawn. <words>140</words>
Each hum was a message in a bottle carried by the sea of sky, drifting toward forgotten coasts where old maps still remembered the old world’s greed. <words>167</words>
Mara collected those drifting whispers, laying them beside her seedlings, believing the sea’s stories could teach the roots where to grow without trespassing. <words>190</words>
One twilight, a card slipped from the deck, its image a cracked fence that sang a low note, the very note of the song of boundaries humming through cracked earth. <words>220</words>
The note reminded her of the overseer’s iron rule, a line drawn in dust that never allowed a farmer to step beyond the allotted rows. <words>245</words>
She jabbered louder, her voice cracking the sky, and the cards responded, scattering seeds that sprouted instantly into vines that curled around the invisible fence. <words>270</words>
The vines sang back, a raw solace that filled the plains with a chorus of growth, each leaf a promise that boundaries could be rewritten. <words>295</words>
Mara gathered the new seedlings, placing them in the soil where the overseer’s boots had once pressed, feeling the earth pulse with a different rhythm. <words>320</words>
She sealed a final message in a bottle, writing that the song of boundaries was not a wall but a bridge, and tossed it into the sky sea, trusting the wind to deliver it. <words>354</words>
As the bottle vanished, the plains glowed with seedlings breaking the old lines, and Mara felt the overseer’s shadow recede, replaced by the quiet hum of her own making. <words>383</words>
In that raw solace, she finally escaped the dictated life, not by fleeing but by rewriting the song that bound them all. <words>405</words>
