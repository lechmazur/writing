The confident watchman paced the amber corridors of the giant beehive interior, his badge glinting like sunrise on waxed combs. <words>20</words>
He carried a cracked plastic ruler, its broken edge a reminder that even the most rigid tools can fracture under pressure. <words>41</words>
During the coloring sessions that stretched from dawn to dusk, the hive walls were painted with swirling hues that sang the echo of yearning. <words>65</words>
Each brushstroke released a softly booming note, a jubilant remorse that made the watchman smile while his heart ached for the lost drones. <words>88</words>
He knew his mission: to hush the voice of envy that whispered from the shadows of the queen’s chambers, a jealous hum that threatened the hive’s harmony. <words>115</words>
To mobilize the workers without stirring panic, he employed a strangely forcibly gentle approach, coaxing them with rhythmic taps of his ruler. <words>137</words>
The ruler’s cracked line traced invisible circuits on the honeycomb, each segment echoing a pattern he had once studied through the patterns in a fingerprint under a microscope. <words>165</words>
Those microscopic swirls reminded him of the way envy curled around ambition, a tiny spiral that could be unraveled by patient observation. <words>187</words>
He whispered to the bees, “Listen to the echo of yearning, not the jealous buzz, and let our colors bind us together.” <words>209</words>
The workers, sensing his confidence, gathered around the ruler like children around a storyteller, their wings trembling with a mix of pride and remorse. <words>233</words>
He mobilized them by assigning each bee a stripe of pigment, the cracked ruler serving as a guide that split the honeyed floor into orderly bands. <words>259</words>
As the bees painted, the hive resonated with a chorus of soft sighs, the echo of yearning turning into a lullaby that soothed the jealous hum. <words>285</words>
The watchman watched the colors bleed into each other, feeling a jubilant remorse for the envy he had once harbored, now dissolved in pigment. <words>309</words>
When the final stripe was laid, the cracked ruler snapped cleanly, releasing a bright crack that sounded like applause across the waxen walls. <words>332</words>
The echo of yearning lingered, now a gentle reminder that longing can be transformed into creation when one mobilizes compassion through precise, oddly gentle force. <words>357</words>
The watchman placed the broken ruler beside the queen, a symbol that even fractured tools can guide a hive toward harmony. <words>378</words>
In the glow of the newly colored chambers, the bees buzzed a soft hymn, their envy silenced, their spirits lifted by the watchman’s forcibly gentle resolve. <words>404</words>
He stepped back, feeling the jubilant remorse settle like honey on his tongue, a sweet reminder that every echo of yearning can be answered with a careful, compassionate hand. <words>433</words>
