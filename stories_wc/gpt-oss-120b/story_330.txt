<story>
The dejected knight floated in the zero‑gravity dance hall, his armor clinking like distant bells. <words>15</words>
He had been cast out from the kingdom of light, his honor tarnished by a battle he could not win. <words>35</words>
In his hand he clutched a trident prong salvaged from a sunken realm, its coral‑etched tip pulsing with forgotten tides. <words>55</words>
The object was normally abnormal in a place of music and weightlessness, yet it seemed to anchor his wandering spirit. <words>75</words>
When an old watchtower clock struck an unexpected hour—thirteen beats in a silent night—the hall’s luminous floor flickered to a rhythm of ancient war drums. <words>100</words>
The knight felt his heart quicken, as if the pulse of the trident synced with the strange beat. <words>118</words>
He remembered a silent vow he had whispered to the sea gods, a promise to voice the unheard cries of the drowned. <words>140</words>
Now, deepening horizons beyond the ruined citadel, he sought to fulfill that vow by navigating through forgotten paths of memory and light. <words>162</words>
The dance hall swirled with luminous ribbons that defied gravity, each strand a thread of history pulling him toward the center where the trident’s tip hovered above a crystal podium. <words>190</words>
In that sacred disorder, the knight raised the prong, and the hall erupted in a cascade of starlight that seemed to rewrite the very constellations. <words>215</words>
The starlight formed a bridge of luminous arches, a forgotten path that led upward through the vaulted ceiling of the tower that loomed beyond the hall’s walls. <words>242</words>
He stepped onto the bridge, feeling the weight of ages lift as his armor sang with the echo of his vow, reverberating through the void. <words>267</words>
Each footfall quickened the rhythm, and the forgotten paths beneath his boots glowed, revealing glyphs of the sunken realm that promised redemption. <words>289</words>
The trident’s prong pulsed brighter, its coral veins spreading like veins of the earth, and the knight felt his sorrow dissolve into a holy chaos. <words>314</words>
At the apex of the bridge, the old watchtower clock chimed again, this time announcing a sunrise that never existed in the night‑filled hall. <words>338</words>
The knight raised his voice, a trembling chant that carried his silent vow across centuries, echoing through the vaulted emptiness. <words>358</words>
The echo returned as a chorus of drowned spirits, their gratitude forming a luminous tide that washed over the dance hall, turning disorder into a reverent hymn. <words>385</words>
In that moment, the dejected knight understood that his horizons had deepened beyond any battlefield, that redemption lay not in conquest but in the sacred act of remembering. <words>413</words>
He let the trident’s light dissolve into the air, the prong vanishing like a sunrise swallowed by the void, leaving behind only the promise of future voyages. <words>440</words>
