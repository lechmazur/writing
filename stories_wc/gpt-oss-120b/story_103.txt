The weatherbeaten knight stood on the crumbling balcony of the lighthouse prison, its stone walls battered by relentless storms and the jagged reef below.<words>24</words>
Inside, a brass door knocker hung from a rusted iron hinge, its dull clang echoing like a mournful bell each time the tide slammed against the tower.<words>51</words>
He had been sentenced to guard the endless mirror that reflected the sea, a glass pane that showed not only the present but every possible future in a single shimmering frame.<words>82</words>
The reflection was a timeframe within a mirrored reflection, looping back on itself so that each decision he made rippled outward like a stone tossed into the abyss.<words>110</words>
His impossible choices were laid before him as a set of seemingly random items—a cracked compass, a wilted rose, a broken lute, and a tarnished key—each forming a hidden pattern only the lighthouse's pulse could reveal.<words>146</words>
He grudgingly sweetly appreciated the cruel beauty of the puzzle, feeling a joyful agony that made his heart pound like the lighthouse's lantern flashing against the night.<words>173</words>
Every time he placed an item on the cold stone altar, the brass door knocker rang, and the echo seemed to count down the seconds until the final cry of regret could be hushed.<words>207</words>
He knew that to silence that cry he must choose either to shatter the mirror, releasing all possible futures into the storm, or to seal it forever, condemning the world to a single, unchanging destiny.<words>242</words>
The impossible choice gnawed at him, each option a blade of joy and pain, and the lighthouse seemed to sigh with the weight of his indecision.<words>268</words>
He lifted the cracked compass, feeling its needle spin wildly, and sensed that the pattern demanded a sacrifice of direction for the sake of peace.<words>293</words>
Then he placed the wilted rose beside the broken lute, the scent of decay mingling with silent chords, a bittersweet hymn that made his tears taste like salt and honey.<words>323</words>
Finally, he set the tarnished key into the brass knocker, and the metal sang a low, resonant note that seemed to unlock the very air around the lighthouse.<words>351</words>
In that moment, the mirrored reflection fractured, showing a cascade of possible seas, each one whispering a different ending, and the knight felt the joyful agony of infinite possibility.<words>380</words>
He chose to hush the final cry of regret by stepping into the mirror, letting his own sorrow become the seal that would bind the endless tide of what-ifs.<words>409</words>
As his armor clanged against the glass, the brass door knocker rang one last time, a sweet, grudging applause for a choice made in the heart of agony and joy.<words>439</words>
The lighthouse prison sighed, its beacon flashing brighter than ever, as the jagged reef below glimmered with the reflected light of a world finally at peace.<words>465</words>
