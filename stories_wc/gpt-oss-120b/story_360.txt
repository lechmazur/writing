In the dim corridors of the underground city of the goblins, a meek necromancer named Lira whispered to the stone walls, hoping the echo would carry her plea. <words>28</words>
She clutched a fountain pen with a broken nib, its ink dried like ancient bone dust, yet she believed the instrument could still write the answer to the universal riddle that haunted her. <words>61</words>
The goblin children played above, their shrieks and laughter forming a strange playground soundtrack that mingled with the low hum of unseen machinery, creating a rhythm that felt oddly comforting. <words>91</words>
Lira’s heart was peculiarly sincere, beating with a quiet devotion that seemed out of place among the crude revelry, yet it guided her toward the tangled tapestry of fate woven through the city’s tunnels. <words>125</words>
She recalled an old legend that said the tapestry could be read by the light that danced on a single dew drop, a fleeting prism that revealed hidden symbols to those who truly listened. <words>159</words>
Guided by that promise, Lira slipped into a narrow alcove where a thin stream of water clung to the stone, forming a perfect droplet that caught the faint glow of phosphorescent moss. <words>191</words>
When the first ray of sunrise filtered through a crack in the ceiling, it struck the dew drop, scattering light like shattered glass across the walls, and the broken nib of her pen caught a glimmer. <words>227</words>
In that instant, the ink inside the pen seemed to stir, as if the reflected light coaxed the dormant spirit of the nib to awaken and write anew. <words>255</words>
She lifted the pen, feeling the weight of centuries, and let the shimmering beam guide the tip, tracing symbols that matched the tangled tapestry she had imagined for years. <words>284</words>
Each curve of the script resonated with the playground sounds above, turning giggles into a chorus that answered the universal riddle: the secret that all living things share is the desire to be remembered. <words>318</words>
The revelation flooded Lira’s mind, and she felt the lost part of herself—her confidence, her purpose—regain through the way light reflects off a dew drop, a simple miracle of clarity. <words>348</words>
She whispered the final line into the stone, the words echoing like a prayer, and the goblin children paused, sensing the shift in the air as the city itself seemed to breathe. <words>380</words>
In mystic simplicity, the meek necromancer walked back to the bustling courtyard, her broken pen now a conduit of hope, and the tangled tapestry of destiny unfurled anew for all who dared to listen. <words>414</words>
