<story>
The gentle swordsman slipped through the dim corridors of the dinosaur skeleton museum, his blade sheathed but humming with a quiet promise. <words>22</words>
Night had settled like a thick blanket, and the only sound was the distant sigh of ancient bones settling into the cool stone. <words>45</words>
He paused before a towering T-rex skull, its eye sockets empty as an empty matchbox, waiting for a spark that never came. <words>67</words>
The museum's lights flickered in coded angles, a half-painted sundial on the wall casting shadows that spelled out a map only a xenophile could read. <words>92</words>
He was a late bloomer among warriors, his kindness sprouting after decades of disciplined silence. <words>107</words>
Yet his heart was faithfully unfaithful, promising loyalty to the world while betraying his own doubts with a smile that cut sharper than steel. <words>131</words>
The orchard dog outside finally stopped barking, its silence a signal that the night had truly deepened. <words>148</words>
Inside, the swordsman lifted his hand, cupping the empty space as if to cradle the universe in a single, trembling palm. <words>169</words>
He whispered to the fossils, a brusque affection that brushed the cold marble with the warmth of a lover's sigh. <words>189</words>
The half-painted sundial's angles shifted, aligning the shadows into a cipher that pointed toward a hidden compartment beneath the diplodocus rib cage. <words>211</words>
He knelt, his fingers tracing the coded lines, and the empty matchbox slipped from his pocket, landing with a soft clink that echoed like a distant star. <words>238</words>
The box was empty, yet it held the promise of ignition, a metaphor for his own late-blooming resolve to spark something greater. <words>260</words>
With a swift motion, he placed the matchbox into the compartment, and the sundial's shadow fell upon a tiny crystal that pulsed like a heartbeat. <words>285</words>
The crystal erupted, bathing the museum in a soft, violet light that seemed to fold the distant cosmos into his cupped hand. <words>307</words>
He felt the universe settle, not as a burden but as a gentle weight he could carry, his brusque affection turning into reverent stewardship. <words>331</words>
The dinosaur bones, once silent witnesses to extinction, now glimmered with the same foreign wonder he cherished as a xenophile, each fossil a foreign language he loved to decode. <words>360</words>
Even the orchard dog, now still, seemed to listen, its ears perked as if the night itself had whispered a secret to the swordsman. <words>384</words>
He bowed low, his gesture both a promise and a farewell, acknowledging that his late bloom had finally opened a garden of stars. <words>407</words>
With the universe cradled in his hand, he stepped back into the night, the museum's shadows parting like curtains for a performance that had only just begun. <words>434</words>
