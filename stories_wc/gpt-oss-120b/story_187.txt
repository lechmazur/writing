The stoic wanderer stepped onto the witch's familiar training ground, his boots echoing against the moss soft earth. <words>18</words>
He carried a single floorboard from an abandoned cabin, its grain worn smooth by time and neglect. <words>35</words>
The board felt mesmerizingly bland, a plain relic that somehow held the weight of countless whispered spells. <words>52</words>
In this moment a teacher wiped the final formula away from the chalked stone, erasing the last visible trace of the rite. <words>74</words>
The wanderer knew that to archive ritual practices he must impose a necessary lie upon the empty air, a false promise that would bind the forgotten incantations. <words>101</words>
He followed a trail of nightmares that curled like black smoke from the shattered sigils, each vision a step toward the hidden archive beneath the ground. <words>127</words>
The nightmares whispered that the floorboard was a key, its blandness a disguise to keep the true power from prying eyes. <words>148</words>

Later, scholars would sift through the archive's pages, never suspecting the bland floorboard's quiet deception that held the rite's essence intact. <words>372</words>
The wanderer's legend grew, spoken in hushed tones that blended reverence with the same brash tenderness he had once wielded. <words>392</words>
