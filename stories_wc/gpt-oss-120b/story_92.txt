I walk the gilded leashes of the ultra‑rich, a dog walker whose clientele demand more than exercise. <words>17</words>
Tonight, the sky bleeds from day into night, casting a bruised violet over the horizon as I approach the haunted mansion’s dining room. <words>40</words>
Inside, a silent agreement hangs heavier than the chandeliers, an unspoken pact between the living and the lingering spirits to keep the night’s terror at bay. <words>66</words>
My client, Madame Voss, has left me a botanical collection of rare night‑blooming orchids to guard while she hosts a gala of ghosts and moguls. <words>91</words>
I am carefully careless, letting the dogs sniff the wilted petals while I pretend the scent is a perfumed excuse to justify my presence. <words>115</words>
A sudden knock interrupts the murmurs, and a nurse in a crimson coat steps through the doorway, announcing an urgent blood drive in the manor’s crypt. <words>141</words>
The method of my entry—an encounter at a blood drive—feels like a ritual, each donation a pact of life offered to the house’s lingering dread. <words>166</words>
I watch the donors line up, their veins glinting like silver threads, and I realize the silent agreement extends to them: they give blood, the mansion gives them a night free of fear. <words>199</words>
Madame Voss appears, her silhouette a dark brushstroke against the candlelight, and she whispers that the orchids will bloom only if the house’s fear is justified by our own daring. <words>229</words>
My motivation—to stand where fear dares not tread—pushes me toward the long oak table, where a silver platter holds the first orchid, its petals trembling like a heartbeat. <words>257</words>
I place a trembling hand on the table, feeling the cold wood echo the loud silence of the room, a paradox that makes the ghosts listen. <words>283</words>
The dogs, sensing the tension, circle the orchids, their paws barely touching the soil, as if to justify the fragile peace with a gentle, careless nudge. <words>309</words>
A sudden gust rattles the chandeliers, and the shadows coalesce into a shape that resembles a blood‑stained heart, reminding me that the mansion feeds on the very fear it pretends to mute. <words>341</words>
Yet the silent agreement holds; the heart recedes as the donors’ blood pools into the floor, turning the marble into a dark river that washes away the lingering dread. <words>370</words>
When the last drop settles, the orchids unfurl, their luminescent blossoms casting a soft green glow that outshines the moon outside. <words>391</words>
I step back, feeling the loud silence settle like dust, and I realize I have justified my own fear by standing exactly where it refused to go. <words>418</words>
The dogs bark once, a sound that echoes through the empty hall, sealing the silent agreement with a promise that the mansion will never again feast on unspoken terror. <words>447</words>
