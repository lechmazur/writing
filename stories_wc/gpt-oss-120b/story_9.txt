The soothsayer shuffled through the neon-lit desert, a maze of flickering billboards that whispered advertisements like dying cicadas. <words>18</words>
Mildly panicked, she clutched a pocket puzzle box with thirteen locks, each one humming a different warning about the planet's fevered breath. <words>40</words>
Between lost years—those unrecorded spans when the desert's dunes swallowed whole cities—she believed destiny could be reshaped by bare hands. <words>60</words>
Her method was absurdly precise: she would magnify the truth by reading the water rings on a battered wooden bar top she found lodged behind a billboard's broken neon. <words>89</words>
The rings, like tree‑rings of a drowned forest, recorded every spill, every drought, and every careless promise made to the sky. <words>110</words>
She argued, with molten sarcasm dripping from her tongue, that stewardship was not a slogan but a puzzle whose solution required unlocking each of the thirteen seals. <words>137</words>
Each lock corresponded to a specific environmental crime, and the key to each was a tiny fragment of truth she could only see when the desert's heat magnified the bar's water rings. <words>169</words>
The first lock clicked open when she confessed that the billboard's neon was powered by a coal‑fueled grid, a confession that made the desert wind howl in mock applause. <words>198</words>
She sighed, noting how probably unlikely it was for a panicked prophet to care about a billboard's carbon footprint, yet the sarcasm in her voice was as hot as the sand. <words>229</words>
The second lock required her to plant a seed in the cracked earth, a gesture that would magnify the bar's rings into a blooming timeline of recovery. <words>256</words>
She dug with her bare hands, feeling the desert's stubborn refusal, and whispered a promise that the seed would drink only rain, not runoff from oil‑slicked highways. <words>283</words>
When the seed sprouted, the water rings glowed green, and the third lock fell away, revealing a map of the desert's hidden aquifers. <words>306</words>
The map was a sarcastic joke from the universe, showing that the only way to save the water was to stop advertising it as a commodity on every billboard. <words>335</words>
She laughed, a molten chuckle that cracked the desert glass, and used the map to redirect the neon's power into a solar array that fed the hidden wells. <words>363</words>
Each subsequent lock demanded a more improbable act—like convincing a sandstorm to carry seeds instead of dust—yet she performed them with a panicked grace that made the desert sigh. <words>392</words>
By the twelfth lock, the desert's billboard maze glowed with a soft teal, the neon no longer screaming consumerism but humming a lullaby of regeneration. <words>417</words>
When she finally turned the thirteenth lock, the pocket box exploded—not with fireworks but with a cascade of seedlings that fell like rain onto the cracked dunes. <words>444</words>
The desert inhaled, the sand softened, and the neon billboards flickered into silhouettes of trees, a sarcastic tribute to the soothsayer's improbable stewardship. <words>467</words>
She stood, mildly panicked still, but now her sarcasm felt like molten gold, a reminder that even the most unlikely prophet can shape destiny with bare hands. <words>494</words>
