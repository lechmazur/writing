<story>
I am a somnambulist scout, drifting through midnight forests with a lantern that never burns out.<words>16</words>
My nightly wanderings are guided by a bottled lightning bug collection that glows like captured constellations, each jar humming with secret energy.<words>38</words>
Between flights of my restless mind, I embark on a yearly pilgrimage to my family's ancestral home, a crumbling manor perched above a sunken laboratory hidden beneath the mossy roots.<words>68</words>
The laboratory, long abandoned, is flooded with phosphorescent water that reflects the bugs' glow, turning the whole chamber into a living map of woodland secrets.<words>93</words>
I scout the damp corridors with unapologetically humble reverence, noting every cracked vial and every whisper of forgotten experiments.<words>112</words>
My purpose is to map spiritual wisdom hidden in the lab's old journals, believing that the insects' luminescence records the prayers of the forest.<words>136</words>
Each night I sleepwalk through the aisles, my somnambulant steps tracing the same routes my ancestors once walked, as if the walls themselves remember the cadence of my feet.<words>165</words>
The bottled lightning bugs pulse in sync with the lab's old generators, and I record each flicker as a data point on my hand‑drawn chart of ethereal currents.<words>193</words>
When the sunrise threatens to dissolve the glow, I hurriedly seal the jars, promising the forest that its secrets will survive the day’s indifference.<words>217</words>
Between flights of actual aircraft that ferry me back to the city, I linger in the lab’s echoing silence, cataloguing the patterns of light as if they were constellations on a map of the soul.<words>252</words>
My humility keeps me from claiming the knowledge as my own; instead I note each discovery with a simple footnote that reads, ‘observed by a wandering scout.’<words>279</words>
The deeper I delve, the more the lab reveals a network of tunnels that lead to a hidden grove where ancient trees whisper the names of the bugs, binding them to the land’s memory.<words>313</words>
In that grove I lay the jars on a stone altar, and the bugs' light rises like a choir of fireflies answering a question I have not yet learned to ask.<words>344</words>
The revelation is simple yet profound: the woodland secrets are not hidden in objects but in the humility of those who seek them, and my somnambulist nature allows me to listen while the world sleeps.<words>379</words>
When I finally return to the manor, the sunken laboratory seals behind me, but the map I have drawn glows faintly on the back of my hand, a reminder that curiosity, when loaded with reverence, can illuminate even the deepest shadows.<words>420</words>
