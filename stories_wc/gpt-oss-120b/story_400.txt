When the final human foot slipped away from the planet, the world fell silent, save for the wind humming through the glacial orchard suspended over a crevasse of blue ice.<words>30</words>
In that frozen canopy lived a guarded druid named Thalor, whose eyes flickered with a fiercely ambivalent grin as he tended the silvered trees.<words>54</words>
He kept his emotions locked behind bark and frost, yet a crippling fear of utter silence gnawed at his roots, urging him to break the hush that now ruled the world.<words>85</words>
To confront that dread, Thalor decided to gather the remnants of forgotten rituals, beginning with the only ceremony still permitted after humanity's departure: a special family meal prepared only on birthdays.<words>116</words>
He summoned the ancient pinecones that sang when cracked, the frost‑kissed berries that glowed like dying stars, and a dull safety pin forged from the last alloy of human industry, its purpose now absurdly ceremonial.<words>151</words>
The pin, though blunt, was the only thing capable of prying open the sealed bark of the oldest tree, which guarded the echo of the first human lullaby.<words>179</words>
With a sigh that tasted of iron and pine resin, Thalor pressed the pin into the bark, feeling the wood shiver as if remembering a forgotten word.<words>206</words>
The crack released a low hum, a chorus of frozen leaves that sang the silence back to life, and Thalor laughed—a dour amusement that echoed through the orchard's icy veins.<words>236</words>
Yet his grin was tinged with ambivalence, for the sound reminded him of the humans he had lost, and the fear of their absence still clung to his bark‑skin.<words>265</words>
He invited the wind, the snow, and the distant echo of a child's birthday song to join the feast, arranging the pinecones like candles and the berries like reluctant guests.<words>295</words>
The meal itself was a quiet rebellion: each bite cracked the frozen silence, each swallow forced the orchard to remember that even in desolation, laughter could be harvested.<words>323</words>
When the last crumb fell, the dull safety pin glimmered faintly, as if approving the druid's fierce ambivalence and the fragile triumph over his own terror.<words>349</words>
He stood amid the trembling branches, feeling the crevasse below pulse like a heart, and realized that breaking the silence was not a victory over the world but a concession to his own humanity.<words>383</words>
With a final, rueful chuckle, Thalor tucked the safety pin into his cloak, promising to gather another birthday feast when the next season of ice thawed, because fear, like frost, was meant to be melted.<words>418</words>
