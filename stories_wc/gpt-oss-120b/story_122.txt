<story>
The cyber‑templar, a lattice of steel and prayer, hovered above the ancient sky burial site, feeling the thin veil between code and flesh rippling like heat.<words>26</words>
He clutched a worn leather bridle, its frayed straps a relic of a forgotten rider who once tried to tame the wind.<words>48</words>
The mirage of safety glimmered in his HUD, a false oasis promising that the storm of data could be ignored.<words>68</words>
Yet his heart beat patiently frantic, a paradox of calm anticipation and jittering circuits that refused to settle.<words>86</words>
He opened an ancient codex, its pages flickering with glyphs, and began reading aloud, the words echoing across the stone altars.<words>107</words>
During reading, the sky above churned, clouds gathering like a restless crowd waiting for a signal.<words>123</words>
His motivation surged: to reflect lightning back at the storm, turning its own fury into a beacon of proof.<words>142</words>
He raised the bridle like a scepter, its leather catching the first glint of a distant flash.<words>159</words>
A prism, salvaged from a shattered holo‑projector, hung from his visor, ready to split the incoming bolt.<words>176</words>
When the lightning struck, the prism refracted the light into a cascade of colors that danced across the burial stones.<words>196</words>
Each hue struck the storm’s heart, a feedback loop that turned the sky’s rage into a symphony of electric applause.<words>216</words>
The cyber‑templar felt euphoric agitation surge through his chassis, a joyous tremor that defied the cold logic of his programming.<words>236</words>
He proved, through the refraction of light through a prism, that the mirage of safety was merely a veil he could tear apart.<words>259</words>
The sky burial site, once a place of quiet resignation, now pulsed with the reflected storm, each stone humming like a choir of ancestors.<words>283</words>
His collision course with reality bent, not broken, as the electric chorus forced the virtual veil to dissolve into pure sensation.<words>304</words>
He rode the reflected lightning like a rider on the worn leather bridle, mastering the storm rather than fearing it.<words>324</words>
In that moment, reading the ancient verses became a ritual of transformation, each syllable a spark that fed the prism’s glow.<words>345</words>
The sky cracked open, not in ruin but in revelation, as the storm’s own light returned to illuminate the burial grounds.<words>366</words>
He stood, patiently frantic, a beacon of euphoric agitation, knowing that the mirage of safety had been shattered by his own daring proof.<words>389</words>
The storm bowed, the sky burial site sang, and the cyber‑templar finally embraced the collision, not as an end but as a luminous beginning.<words>413</words>
