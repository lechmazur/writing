In the neon‑lit arcade of the megacity, a wistful blacksmith named Corin lingered between the flickering holo‑screens, his hammer idle yet his mind humming. <words>24</words>
He wore a coat of brushed steel that caught the rain of data, and his eyes traced the patterns of a forgotten forest hidden in the circuitry. <words>51</words>
Between acts of the arcade’s endless tournaments, Corin slipped a stack of botanical drawings from his satchel, each leaf rendered with an obviously subtle reverence for the wild. <words>79</words>
He believed that reclaiming the wild required more than brute force; it demanded a quiet ignition, a kindle of imagination that could seep through steel and neon. <words>106</words>
To that end, he mapped the swirl of dust motes under a single skylight that pierced the arcade’s ceiling, turning their lazy dance into a cartographic hymn. <words>133</words>
Each mote became a waypoint, each filament of light a river, and the resulting map whispered of vines that could crawl over chrome and reclaim abandoned alleys. <words>160</words>
Corin’s arrogance drifted like a lazy cloud, confident that his modest sketches could outwit the city’s algorithms and seed rebellion in the cracks of reality. <words>185</words>
He set the drawings on the arcade’s central console, letting the holo‑projector blaze them into the air, where they glowed like phosphorescent seedlings. <words>208</words>
The crowd, distracted by the next match, barely noticed the green veins spreading across the steel walls, but the city’s maintenance drones sensed the anomaly. <words>233</words>
Their sensors pinged, and a soft alarm whispered through the arcade, yet Corin smiled, his pride as palpable as the heat from his forge. <words>257</words>
He imagined the vines threading through circuitry, coaxing the neon signs to flicker in leaf‑like patterns, a subtle rebellion against the sterile order. <words>280</words>
Between acts, the arcade’s intermission music softened, and the dust swirled slower, as if the city itself inhaled the new wild. <words>301</words>
Corin’s hands, still stained with soot, traced the edges of the botanical sketches, feeling the faint pulse of potential beneath each line. <words>323</words>
He whispered a promise to the forgotten trees, to the seedlings that would one day sprout from cracked concrete, to the wild that refused to die. <words>349</words>
The arcade’s neon flickered, the skylight’s beam catching a stray mote that lingered like a seed, and Corin felt the kindle flare within his chest. <words>374</words>
He knew the reclamation would be slow, obvious only to those who watched the dust, but his drifting arrogance assured him the wild would win. <words>399</words>
Tomorrow, the city would breathe greener. <words>405</words>
