The morbid florist drifted onto the floating rock dojo, her dark garb fluttering like wilted petals in the thin air.<words>20</words>
She carried a plain white candle, its wax unblemished, as if it were a mute witness to every funeral bouquet she ever arranged.<words>43</words>
The dojo's stone floor, suspended above a sea of clouds, resonated with the soft hum of distant thunder, reminding her of the cyclical pulse she sought to decode.<words>71</words>
Her belief system was tempered, neither wholly nihilistic nor blindly hopeful, a balanced creed she called tempered beliefs, which guided every wilt she turned into art.<words>97</words>
She was neutrally passionate, feeling each blossom's decay with a calm intensity that made her both a mourner and a celebrant.<words>118</words>
In the last flicker of a guttering lantern, she obliged the candle to stay alight, promising the flame would not surrender to the night.<words>142</words>
She obliged herself to the ritual, arranging black roses around the candle, each petal a note in the cosmic ledger she hoped to read.<words>166</words>
Her motivation was to understand cosmic cycles, to see how death fed rebirth in the same breath that the universe inhaled.<words>187</words>
She opened the writer's trunk, a battered chest of leather, and sifted through the backlog of typed pages, each line a fragment of forgotten myth.<words>212</words>
Through those pages she found a diagram of the moon's waning and waxing, drawn beside a sketch of a lotus that never opened.<words>235</words>
She read aloud, her voice trembling boldly timid, as if the words themselves were a bridge between the silent stone and the swirling clouds.<words>259</words>
The candle's flame flickered in response, casting shadows that dance like specters of past ceremonies, each movement echoing the cycles she coveted.<words>281</words>
She obliged the ancient script to guide her hands, arranging the black roses in a spiral that mirrored the moon's own tempered belief in renewal.<words>306</words>
As the spiral completed, the candle's wick steadied, its light no longer guttering but burning with a steady pulse that matched the dojo's heartbeat.<words>330</words>
In that moment, the florist felt the universe exhale, the cosmic cycles aligning in a quiet chorus that sang of endings and beginnings alike.<words>354</words>
She smiled, a boldly timid grin, acknowledging that her tempered beliefs had finally found a tangible echo in the stone, the candle, and the pages.<words>379</words>
The floating rock dojo seemed to pulse once more, as if approving her quiet oath to oblige the cosmos with her morbid bouquets.<words>402</words>
She tucked the plain white candle back into the trunk, alongside the typed pages, promising to return whenever the lantern's last flicker called her back.<words>427</words>
Thus, the morbid florist left the dojo, her steps as light as a sigh, carrying the weight of cycles yet to bloom.<words>449</words>
