Jareth, an uptight scribe robed in starched linens, stood at the entrance of a witch’s greenhouse clinging to a hill of gravestones. <words>22</words>
He felt an odd mixture of certainly uncertain resolve and buried optimism. <words>34</words>
Between cracked glass panels, green vines snaked out, beckoning him inside. <words>45</words>
In his trembling hands, he clutched a prototype light bulb from Tesla’s workshop, wanting to protect its fragile glow. <words>64</words>
Moments earlier, by analyzing the leftover adhesive from a once-sealed envelope, he had pinpointed this exact location. <words>81</words>
The greenhouse’s sagging roof told stories of storms, each cobweb an unspoken memory. <words>94</words>
He stepped over twisted roots as thunder muttered in the distance. <words>105</words>
Inside, a thin-lipped witch reached for wilted blossoms, her eyes holding the weight of ages. <words>120</words>
Jareth cleared his throat, but instead of speaking quietly, he found himself forced to bellow a greeting. <words>137</words>
His voice shattered the hush, sending faint echoes across crooked tombstones outside. <words>149</words>
Her crooked eyebrows lifted with mild annoyance, yet a hidden kindness flickered beneath her stern facade. <words>165</words>
In that precise instant, like the moment when a puzzle piece finally fits, her suspicious gaze softened. <words>182</words>
Swallowing his pride, Jareth handed her the delicate invention, explaining its potential for quiet transformation. <words>197</words>
In all his years as a scribe, he had never dared to believe in intangible wonders. <words>213</words>
However, the faint hum within Tesla’s bulb gave him reason to hope. <words>225</words>
The witch inspected the glass with careful reverence, then placed it on a table surrounded by black roses. <words>243</words>
With a subtle flick of her fingers, she coaxed a glowing swirl of energy into the tiny filament. <words>261</words>
Jareth watched in awe, his heart pounding as a gentle light dawned from within the fragile device. <words>278</words>
This moment felt like stepping beyond fear, as if casting aside tangled regrets for a new path. <words>295</words>
Though certainly uncertain of what lay ahead, he sensed the greenhouse itself awakening with possibility. <words>310</words>
Those dusty pots, half-buried in tumbling foliage, now seemed pregnant with promise. <words>322</words>
He realized his mission was not simply to archive facts but to cradle empathy in arms of steel. <words>340</words>
Lightning flickered outside, illuminating the elaborate iron gate that stood guard over the hill of gravestones. <words>356</words>
In that flash, Jareth saw the greenhouse not as a place of dread, but a sanctuary waiting to blossom. <words>375</words>
The witch spoke softly, trusting him to understand the gravity of his vow. <words>388</words>
She plucked a single black rose and held it out in silent encouragement. <words>401</words>
Taking the rose, he stood straighter, carrying both the bulb’s fragile luminescence and the promise of renewal. <words>418</words>
In that ultimate second of clarity, the greenhouse, the witch, and the hill of gravestones all faded before hope’s subtle ascendance. <words>439</words>
