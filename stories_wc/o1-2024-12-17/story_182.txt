Behind him, the quiet hunger of the night seemed to beckon, a persistent plea for discovery. <words>48</words>
He felt a trivially monumental stirring in his heart, as if destiny brewed under the surface of his confusion. <words>67</words>
All around, the wind began to churn, rattling loose gravel and whistling through ancient crags. <words>82</words>
Legend whispered of hidden murals buried deep within the mountain, revealed only through the peel of paint layers in forgotten tunnels. <words>103</words>
