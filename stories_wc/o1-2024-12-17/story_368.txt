Returning to the entrance, he tested the cameo's power by holding it against the twisting vines.<words>330</words>
A subtle glow illuminated the orchard, reversing pockets of rot into fragile blooms that shimmered with possibility.<words>347</words>
He felt a distant echo from deep within himself, resonating with every step he took, urging him onward.<words>365</words>
