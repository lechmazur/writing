Hushed whispers filled the forgotten market, where a candy sculptor with a vendetta appeared each dusk. <words>16</words>
His precisely creative hands shaped sugar into delicate roses and fierce dragons alike. <words>29</words>
Throughout the rebellion, rumors circulated of his ardent scorn for those who wronged him. <words>43</words>
A forgotten locket once belonging to his family became the catalyst for his darkest creations. <words>58</words>
He had lost that memento under tragic circumstances, fueling his desire for a secret counterattack. <words>73</words>
Late at night, he scattered small sculptures around the labyrinth of stalls, each piece a silent warning. <words>90</words>
A trail of photographs leading to a forgotten memory emerged, carefully left by an unknown ally. <words>106</words>
At first, the sculptor assumed a trap, suspecting betrayal from rivals who shared no kindness. <words>121</words>

With ardent scorn, he offered a honey-sculpted phoenix, pretending compliance while plotting his counterattack. <words>307</words>
When the rebels relaxed, he flung shards of hardened sugar at them, forcing a chaotic retreat. <words>323</words>
None expected candy to bite back, and he vanished into the crowd, heart pounding with newfound zeal. <words>340</words>
In the winding alley, another photograph guided him to a decrepit fountain, where he found a tattered note. <words>358</words>
