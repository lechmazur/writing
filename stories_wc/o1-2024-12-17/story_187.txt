The stoic wanderer entered the witch's familiar training ground, feeling a surge of brash tenderness swell within his guarded heart. <words>20</words>
At the moment a teacher wipes the final formula away from the crooked slate, an uneasy hush spreads across the dim clearing. <words>42</words>
Hidden beneath a mesmerizingly bland demeanor, the wanderer clung to a battered floorboard from an abandoned cabin he once called home. <words>63</words>
He had traveled here by following a trail of nightmares that twisted through haunted forests and rancid marshes. <words>81</words>
His primary motivation for braving these horrors was to archive ritual practices that were rumored to alter destiny itself. <words>100</words>
Each step forward threatened to impose an even heavier burden on his stoic facade, though he refused to show weakness. <words>120</words>
The teacher, robed in swirling smoke, paused to observe the wanderer’s face, gauging whether his necessary lies would hold. <words>139</words>
One by one, other apprentices stepped aside, sensing an odd tension between brute earnestness and a gentler undercurrent in his gaze. <words>160</words>
They could not fathom how he balanced mesmerizing blandness with sudden spikes of raw empathy. <words>175</words>
All the while, that battered floorboard remained his last link to the forsaken truths he had abandoned long ago. <words>194</words>
Tattered scrolls and half-finished potions surrounded them, marking this place as a crucible of impending metamorphosis for budding familiars. <words>213</words>

However, the wanderer sought ancient knowledge, not acceptance, for his aim was to preserve every lost blessing and curse. <words>251</words>
He suspected that certain grim ceremonies required necessary lies to weave illusions strong enough to bend mortal senses. <words>269</words>
Now, with the teacher’s chalk smudges vanishing from the last symbol, the final lesson teetered on the brink of oblivion. <words>289</words>
In a rare moment of brash tenderness, the wanderer knelt down and placed the floorboard at the center of the circle. <words>310</words>
A hush reverberated as he quietly invoked runes he had memorized from a forbidden tome, determined to protect the knowledge. <words>330</words>
His mesmerizingly bland expression concealed layers of strategy, as he decided which revelations to reveal and which illusions to impose. <words>350</words>
Some truths, he believed, were too perilous to share, and the teacher’s watchful gaze amplified the weight of those secrets. <words>370</words>
With the formula erased, he enacted a dance of symbols that preserved the lore within the floorboard's grain forever, ensuring future generations would uncover each vital ritual's essence in time. <words>400</words>
