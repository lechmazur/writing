He clutched a plain cloth bag, the only token from his childhood, and breathed in the musty air. <words>43</words>
Though his eyes seemed droopy, there was a spark of defiance flickering deep beneath his fiercely apathetic gaze. <words>61</words>
Silence wrapped around the breakroom, where drifting incense mingled with the faint hum of distant prayers. <words>77</words>
He recalled the day he first arrived at this monastery, perched mysteriously on colossal shards of stone suspended in endless sky. <words>98</words>
Back then, his naive hope had guided him, like the meteor showers he once chased across the horizon. <words>116</words>

The floating rock halls echoed with whispers of those who had lost their way, yet he resolved to persevere. <words>390</words>
His body ached with every step, but his heart remained unwavering in its quest to fulfill his promise. <words>408</words>
Outside the breakroom, a gentle wind carried the faint chimes of bells, as if encouraging his resolution. <words>425</words>
With the plain cloth bag held close, he set his sights on the approaching meteor showers, standing ready to begin anew. <words>446</words>
In that luminous cascade of burning trails, the tired swordsman reclaimed his spark of defiance, forging a fierce new path forward. <words>467</words>
