The rattled exorcist stepped into the psychic research facility with measured caution. <words>12</words>
His inwardly social nature clashed with his tense nerves, fueling a strange restlessness. <words>25</words>
He was here amid dance lessons that doubled as experimental rhythmic therapy. <words>37</words>
Researchers choreographed intricate steps, hoping to entwine science with wonder through precise observation. <words>50</words>
Their coy aggression in demanding results gave the exorcist a reason to remain guarded. <words>64</words>
He carried a vintage postcard tucked into his coat, a memento of personal significance. <words>78</words>
Whenever he gazed at its faded image, he recalled cryptic messages scrawled on its back. <words>93</words>
Those letters were guarded disclosures from a mentor who specialized in supernatural phenomena. <words>106</words>
Now, each cryptic clue resonated with unspoken urgency, urging him to uncover hidden truths. <words>120</words>
He found himself in a training room draped with mirrors, where dancers swayed methodically. <words>134</words>
Their synchronized movements seemed to channel energy toward a sprawling puzzle board. <words>146</words>
Peculiar symbols adorned the board, prompting the exorcist to synthesize new interpretations. <words>158</words>
He laid the vintage postcard beside those symbols, aligning them to reveal potential patterns. <words>172</words>

Determined not to fail, the exorcist joined a small group of dancers practicing advanced steps. <words>264</words>
They swirled around him with graceful discipline, creating shapes that hinted at hidden knowledge. <words>278</words>
He noticed each motion corresponded to a glyph on the puzzle board, offering sequential clues. <words>293</words>
Together, they synthesized symbolic gestures that matched the markings on his treasured postcard. <words>306</words>
This choreographed dance became a key, unlocking a coded door in the facility's basement. <words>320</words>
Behind that door, an antechamber revealed more perplexing puzzles guarded by electromagnetic sensors. <words>333</words>
Yet the exorcist's outward hesitations melted as he carefully navigated each new challenge. <words>346</words>
He manipulated hidden levers and recited incantations, forging a bridge between science and mysticism. <words>360</words>
The final puzzle demanded a unique dance step that aligned every symbol with the postcard's cryptic lines. <words>377</words>
