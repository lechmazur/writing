Beneath flickering emergency lights, the forthright peddler paced through the abandoned space station medical bay. <words>15</words>
He clutched a dried flower bouquet close to his chest, its faded petals hinting at unspoken promises. <words>32</words>
For years, he had traveled galaxies, meekly assertive yet unwavering in his purpose. <words>45</words>
Now, while the universe hums its secret song, he searched for a path toward redemption. <words>60</words>
Holding onto the vow forged in a dark corner of the cosmos, he aimed to break an oath sealed in blood. <words>81</words>
Rumor-laden gossip columns had led him here, guiding each step like nebulous constellations in an endless night. <words>98</words>
He believed that by sifting through these columns, he could divide truth from falsehood, unearthing precious clues. <words>115</words>
Amid the haunting corridors, he recognized the sense of joyful loneliness echoing inside his heart. <words>130</words>
The medical bay's shattered monitors and overturned chairs whispered stories of past despair. <words>143</words>
Yet, the peddler pressed on, determined to find a final chance at absolution. <words>156</words>
His meekly assertive nature had often protected him, but it never stopped him from seeing life's raw edges. <words>174</words>
Through each world he visited, he offered small comforts to those in need, hoping to ease cosmic burdens. <words>192</words>
Some paid with credits, others with intangible secrets that fueled his quest. <words>204</words>
Every rumor he uncovered directed him toward the silent medical bay, hidden in the outer rim of civilization. <words>222</words>
Stories hinted that this was the place where vows turned sour, and hearts sought renewal. <words>237</words>
In a dim corner, he found a rusted surgical table still marked with ancient stains of regret. <words>254</words>
He placed the dried flower bouquet there, a quiet offering for the unspoken ghosts that lingered. <words>270</words>
His mind reeled with memories of the blood-sealed oath he had bound himself to so very long ago. <words>288</words>
It was an oath made in desperation, a hasty bargain struck to save someone he loved. <words>304</words>
Desire for redemption pushed him forward, forcing him to confront the shadows of his past. <words>319</words>
Within the hush of that lonely place, he felt a strange warmth stirring beneath the gloom. <words>335</words>
He scoured medical logs and rummaged through debris, hoping to discover the method for undoing his solemn pledge. <words>353</words>
Guided by sifting through rumor-laden gossip columns, he pieced together fragments of obscure knowledge once lost. <words>369</words>
Step by step, he began to divide illusions from reality, letting the truth emerge like morning light on a deserted plain. <words>390</words>
At last, he uncovered a hidden compartment containing a device said to break binding pacts, though it required honest sacrifice. <words>410</words>
He realized joy and loneliness together would guide him, urging him to set his conscience free. <words>426</words>
Carefully, he powered the device using raw emotion, his strangely uplifted spirit fueling its ancient circuitry. <words>442</words>
Electric surges danced along the walls, echoing in time with the universe's soft, secret hum. <words>457</words>
In that radiant moment, the peddler felt the oath dissolve, replaced by a gentle peace rippling through his veins. <words>476</words>
Leaving the device behind, he held the dried flower bouquet close, determined never again to forsake redemption's path. <words>494</words>
