The old-fashioned mage stepped gingerly into the arctic research greenhouse, carrying a rare fragment of a pharaoh’s coffin he had guarded for decades. <words>23</words>
Amid playground time, he sensed the distant echoes of children’s laughter reverberate through the glass walls. <words>39</words>
His purposefully aimless wanderings were spurred by an insatiable desire to claim an uncharted frontier of hidden magic. <words>57</words>
In every corner, mirror panels revealed ephemeral encounters with faint reflections, hinting at an unfolding riddle only he could solve. <words>77</words>
Despite the greenhouse’s warmth, a sanctified dread hung in the air, pressing upon his chest with each labored breath. <words>96</words>
He gently set the fragment of the pharaoh’s coffin on a wooden bench, feeling a pulse of ancient power emanate from its gilded edges. <words>120</words>
Outside the frost-laced windows, children scampered across the ice, their joyful squeals an unsettling contrast to the secrets entombed within this place. <words>142</words>
The old-fashioned mage paused to cuddle a shivering lamb nestled in a corner, hoping to calm his racing thoughts. <words>161</words>
He recalled the day he first discovered the coffin shard in a dusty museum, lured by tales of locked mysteries. <words>181</words>
Now, he believed each reflection in this arctic haven held a clue to where his final conquest might lie. <words>200</words>
His eyes roamed the dripping foliage, glimpsing fleeting silhouettes that vanished whenever he turned to chase them. <words>217</words>
Each silhouette, in truth, was a piece of his own reflection, beckoning him to interpret fragments of a cryptic puzzle. <words>237</words>
Through these ephemeral encounters with mirror reflections, he began to see that the coffin fragment was only the start of an immense revelation. <words>260</words>
His arms quivered with reverence as he lifted the artifact again, sensing its silent command to solve the unfolding riddle sealed within its hieroglyphs. <words>284</words>
Outside, the playground time was winding down, yet the mage paid no heed, consumed by the mystic signals within the greenhouse. <words>305</words>
With trembling purpose, he pressed his palm against a frosted mirror, and a spectral panorama erupted before his gaze. <words>324</words>
He saw swirling dunes, half-buried statues, and a half-remembered city afloat in a dazzling snowscape, as if the desert and ice had merged. <words>347</words>
In that vision, the fragment resonated with a thunderous chant, summoning him to venture deeper into realms untouched by mortal explorers. <words>368</words>
A voice, neither living nor dead, whispered that his final triumph lay beyond the greenhouse’s glass, where the uncharted frontier awaited. <words>389</words>
Though purposefully aimless in his outward demeanor, he burned with curiosity for revelations that could reshape history. <words>406</words>
In a hushed chant, he recited centuries-old incantations to quiet his heart, longing for the day this sanctified dread would dissolve into glory. <words>429</words>
As he knelt beside the coffin fragment, the reflection of a child’s face in the glass reminded him of innocence lost to ambition. <words>452</words>
But he pressed on, determined to decipher the swirling hieroglyphs promised by each flickering mirror. <words>467</words>
Stepping into the silent whirl of snow outside, the old-fashioned mage clutched the coffin shard, ready to claim the final answer awaiting him on the untrodden horizon. <words>494</words>
