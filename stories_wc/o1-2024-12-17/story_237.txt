Within a cramped cell, a psychic genealogist contemplates the puzzle of destiny that brought her here. <words>50</words>
Her goal is to hush the alarm bells of heartbreak still resonating in her mind. <words>65</words>
She remains proudly humble about her abilities, never flaunting her extraordinary talent in tracing ancestral lines. <words>81</words>
Nearby, a battered pair of dice, one chipped, sits on a wooden stool like a silent sentinel of fate. <words>100</words>
She picked them up back on Earth, believing they might help lengthen her odds of survival. <words>116</words>
Behind the thick iron door, she hears the distant clank of chains as pirate guards patrol the corridor. <words>134</words>

A coded reference to the chipped dice finally led her to this cursed pirate vessel. <words>331</words>
