I am an overworked detective, fumbling through half-hearted clues with a grin that fools no one.<words>32</words>
Standing inside the Vanishing Point Gallery, I realize I've forgotten what peace even means.<words>46</words>
Molten sarcasm drips from my every thought, forming a protective shield against looming despair.<words>60</words>
They told me I'd find clarity here, but I'd rather rummage through illusions than face the truth.<words>77</words>
A single playing card slips from my jacket pocket, mocking my drooping spirits with royal arrogance.<words>93</words>
That card reminds me of last night's tempest of memories, swirling and colliding in relentless chaos.<words>109</words>

I rummage through the gallery's dim corners, searching for clues that might quiet this persistent dread.<words>157</words>

My motivation to outdance this inevitability borders on the irrational, yet I can't forsake it now.<words>225</words>
I despise giving up, even if the Universe is spinning me around for its personal amusement.<words>241</words>
A half-damaged kaleidoscope sits on a crooked pedestal, cracked lens shimmering like sorrowful confetti.<words>255</words>
I peer inside, hoping the fleeting images might tie together these loose threads of my investigation.<words>271</words>
Shapes contort into the faces of old suspects, while memories slip past me like seasoned criminals.<words>287</words>
I catch glimpses of a single playing card in every reflection, tormenting me with its silent signature.<words>304</words>

Only by merging both impulses can I outdance the inevitability that lurks behind each ticking minute.<words>447</words>
With molten sarcasm as my partner, I charge forward, determined to unravel this puzzle once and for all.<words>465</words>
