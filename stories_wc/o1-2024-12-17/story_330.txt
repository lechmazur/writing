He rose, summoning courage from the swirling ether, and echoed words of faith that bridged mortal and mythic worlds. <words>293</words>
Thunderous silence erupted, a sacred disorder that shattered illusions and revealed the depth of his conviction. <words>309</words>
The swirling lights pulsed with renewed chemistry, and each observer felt an indescribable connection to the knight's cause. <words>327</words>
