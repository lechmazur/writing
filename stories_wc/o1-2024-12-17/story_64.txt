In the hush before the judge reads the verdict, an uncertain alchemist stands near a floating marketplace tethered to hot air balloons. <words>22</words>
Though his hands tremble at the thought of mortality, he clutches a cracked scale from a mythical beast. <words>40</words>
He believes this scale, revered in hidden circles, might grant a clue to the price of immortality. <words>57</words>
The entire marketplace, technically wild in design, sways gently with each gust of wind. <words>71</words>
Vendors hawk potions and amulets, unaware of the quiet tension building amid the patterned balloons. <words>86</words>
He stands on the edge of a centuries-old marble floor, deciphering coded scuffs that sprawl across its surface. <words>104</words>
They reveal a labyrinthine path long used by explorers to map forest trails nearby. <words>118</words>
Yet only the alchemist recognizes the deeper secrets hidden in these markings, whispered about in half-finished tomes. <words>135</words>
Some believe the markings safeguard a potent formula, one that spans centuries of magical research. <words>150</words>
He was once told that to decipher them fully was to hold the key to perpetual life. <words>167</words>
But the alchemist, hesitant and uncertain, wonders if immortality is worth the moral cost. <words>181</words>
With each swirl of wind that lifts the marketplace, he feels his resolve sway. <words>195</words>
Traders pass by, offering everything from gilded seeds to whispering crystals, all reminiscent of mundane miracles. <words>211</words>
He recalls an old archivist who once proclaimed that every pursuit has a cost, and some prices bend destinies. <words>230</words>
Now, as the hush thickens before the judge’s announcement, he contemplates whether immortality might chain him eternally. <words>247</words>
His gaze drifts to the balloon cables overhead, swaying with rhythmic creaks that underscore his apprehension. <words>263</words>
He decides to complete his reading of the scuffs, determined to unravel the formula but also to safeguard it from misuse. <words>284</words>
Slowly, he runs a finger along the cracks in the marble, matching them to the grooves on the beast’s scale. <words>304</words>
The synergy between stone and scale reveals a hidden verse about forging unnatural longevity. <words>318</words>
His heart pounds as he realizes the ancient symbols describe a ritual that demands blood from the innocent. <words>336</words>
He recoils, sensing the brutality behind such a practice, weighed against the temptation of eternal life. <words>352</words>
Alchemical principles swirl in his mind, but his conscience warns that this path might sever his own humanity. <words>370</words>
He touches the scale again, feeling a pulse of raw power that reminds him just how technically wild such forces can be. <words>392</words>
Around him, the balloon-tethered stalls creak as watchers anticipate the judge’s final statement. <words>405</words>
In that prolonged silence, he decides to seal the knowledge within the coded scuffs, burying the blood requirement forever. <words>424</words>
He will still learn enough to map forest trails, yet he refuses to unleash a cursed immortality upon the world. <words>444</words>
Gently, he positions the scale so that it transmits a faint glow into the floor’s markings, rendering the lethal portion unreadable. <words>465</words>
Though uncertain of the consequences, he feels relief knowing that he has safeguarded countless souls from a terrible bargain. <words>484</words>
Above, a balloon shifts as the judge speaks, and the alchemist finally breathes with renewed hope. <words>500</words>
