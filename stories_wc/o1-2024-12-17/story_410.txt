The astute hermit paced gloomily within the towering cavern cathedral, its phosphorescent flora shimmering with unsettling life. <words>17</words>
He clutched a blunt scissor in his left hand, oddly determined to trim the creeping vines. <words>33</words>
For weeks, he had lived alone amid these bioluminescent chambers, waiting for an elevator to arrive on an empty floor far above. <words>55</words>
Isolation weighed on him like an ancient anchor, fueling a despairing humor that crept into his every thought. <words>73</words>
He was determined to restore the long-defunct water systems hidden behind the cathedral walls. <words>87</words>
Yet progress seemed impossible, and every attempt at plumbing repairs ended in comedic futility. <words>101</words>
His determination, however, was strangely effective at keeping him focused despite the bleak environment. <words>115</words>
Sometimes he would amplify his optimism via the scent of a fresh loaf of bread he kept recalling from memory. <words>135</words>
Whenever he imagined that yeasty aroma, a glimmer of hope flickered in the darkness. <words>149</words>
But the solitude still gnawed at him, and he found himself talking to the stalagmites more often than not. <words>168</words>
Late one evening, consumed by frustration, he swung the blunt scissor at an entangling vine and nearly sprained his wrist. <words>188</words>
Instead of severing the vine, he triggered a hidden mechanism that caused the entire cavern cathedral to tremble. <words>206</words>
This sudden quake illuminated more phosphorescent flora, which revealed conduits and valves he had never noticed before. <words>223</words>
Heart pounding, he realized these new discoveries could be the key to reviving the water supply. <words>239</words>
Driven by a mix of despair and humor, he tried to pry open a corroded valve using the scissor's dull blades. <words>260</words>
To his surprise, the contraption released a rush of stale air that echoed like distant thunder within the cathedral halls. <words>280</words>
Yet still no water emerged, and he cursed under his breath at the cosmic joke of being alone here. <words>299</words>
A distant clang reverberated through the caverns, signaling that somewhere, an elevator had just arrived to an empty floor. <words>318</words>
He felt a pang of absurd hope, imagining a grand rescue that would never materialize in this desolate underground world. <words>338</words>
In a final, desperate attempt, he inhaled deeply, recalling the scent of a fresh loaf of bread, letting it amplify his resolve. <words>360</words>
With renewed vigor, he followed the newly lit paths, searching for a main pump hidden beneath an overgrown alcove. <words>379</words>
Grunting in frustration, he tried to move a massive lever, only to find it rusted in place. <words>396</words>
Summoning a last bit of comedic defiance, he braced the blunt scissor against the lever and forced it downward. <words>415</words>
A metallic groan erupted, and water began to trickle from overhead pipes, forming glistening droplets that nourished the glowing flora. <words>435</words>
He allowed himself one weary chuckle, imagining the absurdity of welcoming a bedtime rescue from a broken elevator. <words>453</words>
In that moment, the hermit felt triumph despite his isolation, for he had redeemed his lonely vigil by restoring the faint flow of hope. <words>477</words>
