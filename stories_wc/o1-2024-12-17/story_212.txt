The ethereal plains stretched out in a silent hush, bearing the scars of the last resource war. <words>17</words>
Jonas, a typically atypical apocalyptic farmer, wandered across the desolate fields in search of a new beginning. <words>34</words>
He clutched a magician's deck of trick cards in his coat pocket, a relic from a forgotten age of illusions. <words>54</words>
Every night, he jabbered to himself about the goodness of life before everything fell apart, his voice echoing in the emptiness. <words>75</words>
Rumors of a hidden phenomenon called the song of boundaries reached him through the messages in a bottle carried by the sea. <words>97</words>
He believed these cryptic notes offered a path to raw solace, a respite from the chaos surrounding his existence. <words>116</words>
His dream was to escape a life dictated by another, forging a destiny carved out by his own hands. <words>135</words>
He discovered that the seeds he bred possessed an uncanny strength, as if they too sang with the same boundary-defying melody. <words>156</words>
Their roots thrived in acidic soil, cracked earth, and salt-laden dust, refusing to give in to the harsh world they inhabited. <words>177</words>
One dawn, he encountered a battered fisherman on the shore who claimed to have deciphered the cryptic bottles' codes. <words>196</words>
The fisherman, eyes glazed with sorrow, revealed that the messages pointed toward an elusive gateway in the ethereal plains. <words>215</words>
Jonas felt drawn to that place, suspecting that the deck of trick cards might unlock the mysterious tune whispering across the horizon. <words>237</words>
He trudged across desert wastelands and navigated broken highways, always clutching those cards like tokens of lost illusions. <words>255</words>
The further he ventured, the more distinctly he heard the song of boundaries pulsing through the wind. <words>272</words>
At last, he reached the outskirts of the ethereal plains, where the air shimmered with pale luminescence. <words>289</words>
There, he found a half-buried archway that glowed each time he touched the trick cards, as though testing his resolve. <words>309</words>
He jabbered quietly, reciting half-remembered incantations from childhood, convinced the power lay not just in the seeds he nurtured but also in his willingness to believe. <words>335</words>
As the deck of trick cards illuminated, a haunting melody permeated the sky, mirroring the deep thrum of the boundary song he had pursued. <words>359</words>
His seeds vibrated with energy, roots trembling in their pouches as if yearning to take hold beyond the known dimensions. <words>379</words>
Straightening his shoulders, Jonas stepped through the arch, understanding that the boundaries of this world were but one chapter in an endless cosmos. <words>402</words>
On the other side, the plains shimmered with possibility, no longer merely a bleak backdrop but a canvas for rebirth. <words>422</words>
He planted his seeds in the spectral soil, feeling the currents of the boundary song guide their growth. <words>440</words>
With each sprout, his heart felt lighter, as though he, too, transcended the confines imposed by a world scarred by war. <words>461</words>
He still carried the trick cards, yet now they resembled instruments of liberation rather than illusions from a dying past. <words>481</words>
At last, Jonas realized the key was in embracing his typically atypical gifts and trusting the boundary song. <words>499</words>
