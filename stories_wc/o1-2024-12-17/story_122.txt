The cyber-templar paced across the ancient plateau, couched in euphoric agitation as thunderheads gathered overhead. <words>15</words>
He clutched a worn leather bridle in one hand, a curious artifact from a long-forgotten age. <words>31</words>
During reading, the sky seemed to tremble, reflecting the cyber-templar's quietly building tension. <words>44</words>
He carried a patiently frantic expression, eager yet composed, reminiscent of a pilgrim on a divine mission. <words>61</words>
Clouds churned above, forming swirling shapes that teased the mirage of safety before transforming into roiling tempests. <words>78</words>
A jagged fork of lightning split the horizon, illuminating a sky burial site perched on a precarious cliff. <words>96</words>
Scores of bones and vulture feathers lay scattered in silent testament to ceremonies older than memory. <words>112</words>
A sudden gust lifted the bridle from the templar’s grip, but he snatched it back with athletic precision. <words>130</words>
He needed that tether for a singular purpose: to prove his worth against this ominous storm. <words>146</words>
Legends said a harness of old harnessed cosmic power, bridging mortal flesh with the fury of the heavens. <words>164</words>
He fixed the bridle around his armor’s gauntlet, hoping it might channel ethereal currents in perfect harmony. <words>181</words>
With a primal roar, he stood braced upon a rock ledge, facing the storm’s crescendo of darkness. <words>198</words>
Euphoric agitation filled every nerve as bolts flickered overhead in savage arcs of fiery brilliance. <words>213</words>
He recalled the prophecy that claimed only through the refraction of light through a prism could a knight truly ride the storm. <words>235</words>
From beneath his cloak, he produced a small prism, holding it aloft against the swirling gloom. <words>251</words>
As lightning sparked, the prism caught and scattered the radiance, painting his visage in fractured rainbows. <words>267</words>
He felt the mirage of safety dissolve, replaced by a raw, electrifying truth of imminent risk. <words>283</words>
Yet he pressed on, determined to reflect lightning back at the storm in a final, defiant stand. <words>300</words>
The cyber-templar was on a collision course with reality, driving himself beyond mortal thresholds to claim triumph. <words>317</words>
His armor’s circuits hummed with a dissonant melody, coaxing every spark of cosmic energy from the storm. <words>334</words>
Patiently frantic, he shifted his stance, raising the prism to intercept the next imminent bolt. <words>349</words>
A searing flash erupted, dancing across the crystal and cascading back into the clouds with thunderous recoil. <words>366</words>
He roared again, feeling raw energy surge through the worn leather bridle as the storm briefly faltered. <words>383</words>
Steadying his shaking limbs, he realized that his mission was more than a grand show of dominance. <words>400</words>
