After the final petal drops from the old rosebush, the neon sign repair shop hums with electric tension. <words>18</words>
A guilty swordswoman, cloak swaying around her knees, carefully enters through the back door. <words>32</words>
She carries a tribal mask with labyrinthine carvings, a relic rumored to reveal hidden paths. <words>47</words>
In her reservedly bold manner, she glances around the flickering signs, seeking guidance buried in shadows. <words>63</words>
Determined to open a door to the unknown, she grips the mask as if it were a trusted friend. <words>82</words>
The shop’s proprietor, busy repairing a faulty neon tube, barely acknowledges her presence. <words>95</words>
Yet the swordswoman knows his silence conceals a wealth of information gleaned from half-truth historians. <words>110</words>
She proceeds to pursue the truth about the door of release, rumored to exist behind the shop’s heavy cabinets. <words>129</words>
Her guilty conscience prods her forward, a constant reminder of the wrongdoing that brought her here. <words>145</words>
Long ago, she wronged an entire village, and the labyrinthine face of the mask symbolizes her atonement. <words>162</words>
In the dim glow of flickering lights, she offers coin for repairs, hoping this gesture will loosen tongues. <words>180</words>
The proprietor, intrigued by her reservedly bold demeanor, sets aside his tools and inspects the mask. <words>196</words>
He recalls reading a cryptic journal, half-lies scrawled by historians who withheld critical truths. <words>210</words>
From these fragments, the swordswoman learns how to align the carved paths with her own regrets. <words>226</words>
The mask’s twisting channels, when illuminated by neon light, respond to her intent, glowing faintly. <words>241</words>
She remembers that only when she fully accepts her guilt can she truly unlock the door of release. <words>259</words>
Determined, she bows her head, allowing painful memories to wash over her like a silent tide. <words>275</words>
The proprietor nods solemnly, as if witnessing a rite older than the neon lights themselves. <words>290</words>
He gestures toward a hidden panel, revealing a tarnished hinge and a faint outline of a door. <words>307</words>
This, she believes, is the threshold she has sought, the very gateway mentioned in every half-truth history. <words>324</words>
Her heart thuds with mellow intensity, torn between fear of the unknown and yearning for absolution. <words>340</words>
She rests the mask upon her face, allowing the labyrinthine edges to meld with her skin. <words>356</words>
A soft glow emanates from the carvings, synchronized with the red and blue flash of the unsteady neon tube. <words>375</words>
Pitting her shame against possibility, she sets her trembling hand upon the hinge to push the door open. <words>393</words>
The faintest click resonates, and the hidden door creaks ajar, revealing an inky corridor beyond. <words>408</words>
She exhales, bracing herself for the unknown while the neon sign flickers like a distant star. <words>424</words>
A swell of guilt and hope coalesces within her, fueling the final step toward the door of release. <words>442</words>
She steps into darkness, mask aglow, prepared to face whatever truth awaits beyond. <words>455</words>
