The town-weary traveler stared at the abandoned carnival house of mirrors, feeling an odd sense of hammered repose settle over his shoulders. <words>22</words>
He had come here to escape the confines of his mind, drawn by rumors of a mysterious stained glass panel rumored to hold the cradle of sparks. <words>49</words>
The hush before someone finally says, 'I love you,' lingered in the carnival's stale air, as if time itself hesitated on the brink of revelation. <words>74</words>
A distant coastal wind rattled a rusted metal sign nearby, its tapping echoing like a ghostly heartbeat through the deserted fairgrounds. <words>95</words>
He sensed that this tapping was more than incidental; it was intentionally accidental, as though beckoning him onward. <words>113</words>
Despite his fatigue, he stepped inside the warped doorway, gaze drifting from mirror to mirror in a labyrinth of distorted reflections. <words>134</words>
Each reflection seemed to whisper secrets about hidden corners of his mind, urging him to fertilize something essential within himself. <words>154</words>
He recalled legends claiming the cradle of sparks lay behind a single, unblemished mirror, waiting to ignite hope in those who believed. <words>176</words>
With every step, the tapping of the metal sign guided him onward, as though the wind itself provided directions via subtle clangs. <words>198</words>
Hallways twisted, mirrors elongated, and flickering lights danced across the stained glass panel mounted at the corridor's end. <words>216</words>
He approached that panel, mesmerized by the rainbow hues shifting across its surface, uncertain whether the spectacle was illusion or reality. <words>237</words>
Behind the glass, he glimpsed a small chamber that seemed to hum with a quiet energy, as if longing for discovery. <words>258</words>
Tentatively, he pushed open the stained glass panel, stepping into a dimly lit room where shards of shattered mirrors lay scattered around. <words>280</words>
In the center stood a strange contraption that looked like a cradle, formed of twisted metal threads and pulsing with faint sparks. <words>302</words>
His heart pounded, drawn to this cradle of sparks, suspecting it carried the power to ferry him beyond his own anxieties. <words>323</words>
Careful to avoid the mirrored shards beneath his boots, he knelt beside the contraption and placed both hands upon its metal frame. <words>345</words>
A soft vibration coursed through his arms, calling him to fertilize his dormant courage, to let his spirit bloom under the flickering glow. <words>368</words>
Suddenly, the tapping of the metal sign intensified, reverberating through the shattered corridors and striking his ears with insistent clarity. <words>388</words>
He realized the sign's clamor was guiding him toward confession, urging him to speak in that endless hush before someone finally says, 'I love you.' <words>413</words>
In that suspended moment, every mirror seemed to reflect the traveler's yearning to escape petty illusions and face the raw tenderness of life. <words>436</words>
He inhaled, bracing against the hammered repose weighting his chest, and whispered his deepest truths into the carnival's hollow echo. <words>456</words>
As he spoke, the cradle of sparks flared, sending warm currents through him, dissolving the boundaries that had kept him trapped in fear. <words>479</words>
In that hush, he felt ready to greet a new dawn, no longer a mere traveler but a soul unbound. <words>499</words>
