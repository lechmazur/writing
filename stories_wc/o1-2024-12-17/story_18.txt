Throughout planning their next move, passersby offered careful glances, searching for the truth behind the statue's haunting aura. <words>55</words>
In this steam-powered world, each gear turned on the fuel of rumor, stirring gloom and hope in equal measure. <words>74</words>
Amid the hissing valves, a threadbare hair tie lay abandoned under a flickering gaslamp, echoing the city's persistent despair. <words>93</words>

From the statue's vantage, the entire plaza pulsed with a gloomly cheerfulness, as though secrets coexisted with ephemeral joys. <words>126</words>
