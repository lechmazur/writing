Marcus, a memory tradesman with scarred hands and cynical eyes, crouched in the spongiform chamber of the giant mushroom house, watching dust motes spiral through bioluminescent air. <words>26</words> The torn corner of a flyer trembled between his fingers—all that remained of the contract that had brought him here, its edges yellowed like old teeth. <words>52</words> Outside, the forgotten windmill groaned through its final rotation, each creak measuring time in ways his synchronized watches couldn't capture. <words>72</words>

"Memory work," he muttered, his voice comfortingly pessimistic, "always ends the same—truth dissolving into what people need to believe." <words>91</words> The client had hired him to vectorize her husband's final memory, to chart its trajectory through neural pathways before it faded completely. <words>113</words> But memories, Marcus knew, were never straight lines; they curved and twisted, especially here where the mushroom's spores made everything shimmer with blurry vividness. <words>137</words>

He checked his array of synchronized watches, each face showing a different moment of the same memory. <words>154</words> The husband had been a candlemaker, and his dying thought was of carrying a flickering candle through an endless void—not metaphor, but literal experience. <words>178</words> The mushroom house had grown around that memory, feeding on it, distorting it into these curved walls that breathed with forgotten purpose. <words>200</words>

Marcus began the vectorization, his instruments humming as they traced the memory's path. <words>213</words> Each watch ticked in perfect unison, marking coordinates in time rather than space. <words>226</words> The torn flyer fragment showed only three words: "UNTIL THE END." <words>237</words> He'd thought it meant the job's deadline, but now understood it referred to the windmill's final turn, when all memories stored in its grinding stones would release. <words>265</words>

The memory shifted, revealing the truth: the husband hadn't died—he'd transformed, become part of the mushroom house's living architecture. <words>283</words> His consciousness flickered like candleflame in the building's neural network, endlessly walking through voids between synaptic chambers. <words>299</words> Marcus laughed, a harsh sound that echoed off breathing walls. <words>309</words> "Of course," he said, "even death gets distorted here." <words>318</words>

As the windmill completed its last rotation, Marcus finished vectorizing the memory's trajectory. <words>331</words> The synchronized watches all stopped at once, their purpose fulfilled. <words>341</words> He tucked the torn corner into his toolbelt—evidence that reality, too, could fray at the edges. <words>357</words> The mushroom house sighed, its bioluminescence dimming as it digested another truth transformed into comfortable lie. <words>372</words> Marcus stood, joints creaking like old wood, and prepared to tell the widow her husband was simply gone—a kindness sharper than honesty. <words>394</words> After all, some voids were meant to stay endless, some candles meant to flicker without ever quite going out. <words>413</words>
