Captain Elara Voss circled her flying library above the abandoned spaceport, its vast shelves casting shadows through the grimy skylights of the baggage claim below. <words>22</words> She landed with practiced precision, the ancient books humming with the vibration of touchdown. <words>36</words> In her weathered coat pocket, she fingered the space where a button had once been—torn away during her last attempt to save the Reading. <words>60</words>

The Reading was humanity's oldest tradition: divining collective futures from coffee stains left by travelers in transit lounges across the galaxy. <words>81</words> But the practice was dying, dismissed by the spiritually secular age as mere superstition, neither sacred enough for believers nor rational enough for skeptics. <words>105</words>

Elara entered the desolate terminal, her footsteps echoing with fractal sorrow—each step containing the grief of all the empty airports before this one, and all that would follow. <words>133</words> On the dusty conveyor belt, a single coffee cup waited, its stains already forming patterns. <words>149</words>

She knelt, studying the dark blooms against porcelain. <words>157</words> The stains showed two paths: unity or obliteration. <words>166</words> Humanity stood at a crossroads where a simple yes or no would determine whether they embraced their shared story or scattered forever into isolated fragments. <words>191</words>

"The bridge to unity," she whispered, recognizing the formation—a rare pattern that appeared only when civilizations teetered on transformation. <words>210</words> Her flying library contained the last copies of texts that taught this ancient art, books that bridged the sacred and secular, proving that meaning existed beyond both faith and logic. <words>240</words>

A movement caught her eye. <words>245</words> There, wedged beneath the carousel's rubber flap, gleamed her missing coat button—brass and worn, engraved with the reader's compass rose. <words>265</words> As she reached for it, the coffee stains shifted, revealing the question humanity would soon face: Would they board the libraries? <words>287</words>

In that second, Elara understood. <words>292</words> The flying libraries weren't just repositories but lifeboats, carrying the stories that made strangers into kin. <words>308</words> If people said no, chose isolation over connection, the tradition wouldn't just fade—it would obliterate the very possibility of shared understanding. <words>330</words>

She pocketed the button, knowing she couldn't reattach what time had severed. <words>342</words> Like the tradition she guarded, some things could only be carried forward, not restored. <words>356</words> The coffee had shown her the question; now she had to ensure humanity gave the right answer. <words>374</words>

Returning to her library, Elara prepared to fly to every remaining settlement, offering stories like bridges across the void. <words>393</words> The future hung on a single word, but first, people had to remember they were worth saving. <words>411</words>
