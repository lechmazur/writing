Mira's calloused hands, once rough from braiding horse manes, now sorted meteorite fragments in the orbital studio. <words>17</words> The space debris art collective had rescued her from Earth's dying ranches, but she'd smuggled one treasure aboard: her grandmother's antique oil lamp. <words>40</words> 

During the long car rides between stables in her youth, she'd studied its brass curves while her mother drove through dust-choked highways. <words>63</words> Now it floated beside her workstation, its wick forever unlit in the oxygen-regulated environment. <words>78</words>

"Still playing with dead tech?" <words>83</words> Kai drifted past, gesturing at her latest sculpture—a constellation of metal shards held by invisible magnetic fields. <words>100</words>

Mira smirked, her feisty nature unchanged by zero gravity. <words>109</words> "Ancient methods deserve preservation." <words>113</words> She'd been experimenting, you see, with something the others would mock. <words>124</words> Hidden in her pocket were half-torn carnival tickets she'd found wedged in the lamp's base—tickets from a booth that supposedly granted wishes through transformation. <words>149</words>

The irony wasn't lost on her intellectually playful mind: carnival magic in a space station. <words>164</words> But during those childhood car rides, watching the lamp catch sunset light, she'd believed in metamorphosis. <words>180</words> Horses became pegasi in her imagination; rusty trucks morphed into spaceships. <words>191</words>

Tonight, she would attempt her redemptive act. <words>198</words> The studio's mission was recycling space junk into art, but Mira envisioned more. <words>211</words> She pressed the torn tickets against the lamp while whispering the carnival booth's faded inscription she'd memorized. <words>228</words>

The transformation began subtly—brass warming impossibly in the cold void. <words>238</words> Her sculpture's metal fragments started flowing like liquid starlight, reshaping into forms both ancient and futuristic. <words>254</words> The debris morphed into a golden mare, its mane streaming with comet trails, hooves striking sparks off dark matter. <words>273</words>

Other artists gathered, witnessing her quiet boldness. <words>280</words> She'd merged her past with humanity's future, proving that stablehands and space sculptors shared the same transformative spirit. <words>298</words> The lamp pulsed once, acknowledging her success. <words>305</words>

"How?" Kai breathed. <words>308</words>

Mira's fingers traced the mare's ethereal neck, feeling phantom warmth. <words>318</words> "Some methods transcend time and space." <words>324</words> She thought of her grandmother, her mother, all those car rides when dreams seemed impossible. <words>339</words> "We preserve what matters by letting it evolve." <words>347</words>

The orbital studio had gained its first living sculpture, a bridge between Earth's forgotten carnivals and humanity's stellar destiny. <words>366</words> And Mira, the feisty stablehand turned space artist, had proven that redemption meant honoring the past while embracing transformation. <words>385</words> Her lamp now glowed softly, fed by starlight instead of oil, a beacon for other lost souls seeking metamorphosis among the debris. <words>408</words>
