Lin Wei pressed the tattered doll's dress against the lacquered column, watching sunlight filter through the debris of the collapsed roof above. <words>19</words> The ancient Chinese palace had been reimagined as a theater after the last drop of oil was extracted, its gilded halls now hosting performances that blurred truth and illusion. <words>48</words> As a chameleon stage actor, Lin specialized in reproducing cold-case mysteries, embodying victims and suspects with such precision that witnesses often remembered details they'd forgotten decades ago. <words>74</words>

Tonight's case haunted the vermillion corridors: a missing child from the palace's final imperial days. <words>89</words> Lin's rationally impulsive nature served her well—she'd calculate every emotional beat, then leap into character without hesitation. <words>106</words> The dress had been discovered wedged behind a decorative screen, its silk flowers faded but intact. <words>122</words>

She began her performance in the Hall of Supreme Harmony, where paying audiences gathered on cushions. <words>138</words> "I am Mei-Ling," she whispered, her voice carrying the anxious serenity of a child trying to be brave. <words>156</words> "I hid here when the soldiers came." <words>163</words> Her movements shifted, becoming an elderly chambermaid, then a young guard, each transformation revealing another fragment of truth. <words>181</words>

As Lin portrayed the final witness—a Western diplomat's daughter—something clicked. <words>191</words> The dress hadn't belonged to the missing child but to a doll, a gift that had sparked jealousy between two young girls. <words>213</words> One had hidden the other in the palace's ancient ventilation shafts, intending only brief revenge. <words>228</words> But the revolution came that night, and in the chaos, the hidden child was forgotten. <words>243</words>

Lin's breath caught as she realized she wasn't just solving the mystery—she was channeling the actual terror of that night. <words>263</words> This was her gift and curse: to weave emotional honesty into illusions until even she couldn't distinguish performance from possession. <words>283</words> The audience sat transfixed as she crumpled, becoming the child again, fingers clawing at imaginary walls. <words>299</words>

"She survived," Lin gasped, breaking character momentarily. <words>306</words> "The ventilation shafts led to the servants' quarters. <words>314</words> She escaped during the evacuation, became someone else entirely." <words>323</words> The revelation rippled through the crowd—several patrons had come seeking closure for their own family mysteries. <words>339</words>

As moonlight replaced the sun's rays through the damaged ceiling, Lin held the doll's dress aloft. <words>355</words> Some mysteries weren't meant to be solved but transformed, their pain alchemized into understanding. <words>369</words> She'd reproduced not just events but the emotional archaeology of loss itself. <words>381</words> The palace walls, which had witnessed centuries of secrets, seemed to exhale with her. <words>396</words>

Tomorrow she would inhabit new ghosts, solve new puzzles. <words>405</words> But tonight, in this moment of anxious serenity, she was simply Lin Wei—actor, detective, and bridge between the living and the lost. <words>428</words> The tattered dress fluttered like a prayer flag in the breeze that swept through the ruins of empire. <words>446</words>
