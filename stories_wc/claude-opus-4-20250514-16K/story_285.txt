Kael's gloved fingers trembled against the frost-covered hilt as he surveyed the tundra orchard, where ancient apple trees grew impossibly around steaming geothermal vents. <words>24</words> The blank postcard in his breast pocket burned cold against his chest—the final piece of evidence the Council had just filed away, condemning the old ways forever. <words>51</words> His naturally awkward gait betrayed him as he stumbled between the ice-glazed roots, a swordsman who'd spent more time in archives than battlefields. <words>75</words> 

The vents hissed their perpetual rage, matching the ephemeral rancor that flickered through him—how dare they abandon the traditional systems that had kept both worlds separate for millennia? <words>103</words> He'd discovered their secret: beings had been emerging between realms like hermit crabs abandoning shells, slipping from one world to another through these thermal rifts. <words>128</words> Each migration left behind an empty husk of identity, a discarded life that decomposed into the permafrost. <words>145</words>

Drawing his blade with practiced hesitation, Kael approached the largest vent where reality shimmed like heat mirages in winter. <words>164</words> The postcard had shown him nothing—blank as the Council's compassion—yet holding it near the steam revealed invisible ink: coordinates, times, names of those who'd crossed. <words>190</words> His mission was clear despite his reluctance; seal the passages, restore the barriers, preserve the ancient separation that had defined civilization. <words>212</words>

But watching the thermal pools bubble with otherworldly phosphorescence, he understood why they fled. <words>227</words> His own world grew colder each year while theirs burned too bright—two dying extremes that could only survive through mixture. <words>248</words> A shadow emerged from the largest vent, translucent and shifting, wearing faces like borrowed shells. <words>264</words> It extended something toward him: another blank postcard, this one warm to the touch. <words>279</words>

Kael's sword wavered as his bitterness dissolved into understanding. <words>288</words> The traditional systems hadn't preserved their worlds—they'd been slowly killing them, maintaining a fatal divide. <words>304</words> He thought of hermit crabs, how they survived not through stubborn attachment but through knowing when to abandon what no longer fit. <words>327</words> 

The figure gestured again, and Kael saw his choice clearly: enforce dead traditions with his blade, or drop it and take the offered card—an invitation to help build something new. <words>358</words> His fingers, still trembling but no longer from cold, released the sword into the snow. <words>374</words> As he accepted the warm postcard, he felt himself beginning to emerge, shell by shell, into something that could bridge both worlds rather than divide them. <words>401</words> The orchard's impossible trees suddenly made sense—they'd learned to bloom despite the ice, drawing life from both frost and fire. <words>422</words> Kael tucked both postcards away and stepped toward the vent, ready to document a different kind of evidence. <words>440</words> The old systems would end not with his sword, but with his witness. <words>453</words>
