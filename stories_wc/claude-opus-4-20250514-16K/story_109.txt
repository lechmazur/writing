Knight-Commander Vera pressed her gloved palm against the bulletproof glass of the secret agent center, watching snow fall on the deserted intersection below. <words>19</words> Her colleagues called her cold-natured, but they didn't understand that frost preserves what fire destroys. <words>34</words> 

At midnight, she descended to the makeshift shrine in Sub-Level Three, where agents maintained incomplete family altars—photographs without frames, candles without holders, offerings without ceremony. <words>59</words> The agency permitted these tributes as "morale support infrastructure," a lawful loophole Vera had argued for during her rebellious first year. <words>80</words> Each altar missing pieces, deliberately unfinished, so technically they weren't religious displays in the government facility. <words>96</words>

She knelt before her own sparse arrangement: her grandmother's medicine bottle, dried herbs, a copper bowl. <words>113</words> For months, she'd been collecting folk remedies from other agents' homelands, copying them into her field journal with mechanical precision. <words>134</words> Bulgarian rose oil for grief, Korean mugwort for dreams, Mexican rue for protection—data points in her mission to preserve what modernization erased. <words>157</words>

Then she saw it: a child's mitten, robin's-egg blue, placed carefully beside Agent Chen's altar. <words>173</words> Not his child's—Chen had no children. <words>180</words> She lifted the small knitted thing, and inside found a note: "My daughter dropped this at the intersection above. <words>199</words> She said give it to someone cold." <words>206</words>

Vera's breath caught. <words>209</words> The mitten's wool was soft, hand-knit with tiny mistakes that spoke of human care. <words>224</words> She thought of her rigid cataloging, her clinical distance from the remedies she collected like specimens. <words>240</words> But this mitten—this was different. <words>245</words> Someone had made it with love, stitch by patient stitch. <words>255</words>

She placed it on her altar, and suddenly understood. <words>264</words> The incompleteness wasn't just regulatory compliance—it was truth. <words>272</words> Every remedy, every tradition, every family was incomplete, always becoming. <words>282</words> Her fingers moved without thinking, sketching the mitten's pattern in her journal's margins. <words>295</words> Then the herbs, their leaves and roots flowering into drawings around her grandmother's careful instructions. <words>310</words>

By dawn, her journal had transformed from database to illuminated manuscript. <words>321</words> Other agents found her there, surrounded by pages where data bloomed into art. <words>334</words> "The cold preserves," she explained, holding up the mitten, "but hands must warm what matters." <words>349</words>

They understood. <words>351</words> One by one, they added their own incomplete offerings—sketches, songs, stories—supporting each other's altars with fragments that, together, made something whole. <words>372</words> The secret agent center's sterile walls became gallery, sanctuary, home. <words>382</words> And Vera, the cold-natured knight, learned that some awakenings come not as fire, but as spring thaw: patient, inevitable, alive. <words>402</words>
