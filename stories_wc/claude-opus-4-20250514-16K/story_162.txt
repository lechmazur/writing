Marcus traced his fingers over the torn blueprint fragment, its edges yellowed like the island sand he'd never forget. <words>18</words> The reverse engineering workshop hummed around him, shelves lined with dusty videotapes nobody watched anymore—relics from before everything went digital. <words>37</words> He'd won this scrap of paper in a poker game three nights ago, the other player's hands shaking as he folded. <words>58</words> Most people saw Marcus as just another carefree gambler drifting through Singapore's underground casinos, but that reputation served as perfect camouflage. <words>79</words> 

The blueprint showed partial schematics for something revolutionary—he could tell that much from the quantum encryption markers. <words>96</words> But it was the handwritten coordinates in the margin that made his breath catch: 1°17'N 103°51'E. <words>112</words> Those numbers matched the island where he and Chen had made their pact fifteen years ago, sworn to silence over what they'd discovered in the abandoned research facility. <words>140</words>

"You came," Chen's voice emerged from the shadows between workbenches. <words>150</words> 

Marcus didn't turn, maintaining his studied nonchalance even as relief flooded through him. <words>163</words> "You knew I would." <words>167</words> His uniquely trustworthy nature—the trait that made him invaluable in his real work—had always puzzled those who only saw the gambling facade. <words>190</words>

Chen approached, her footsteps measured against the concrete floor. <words>199</words> "The fragment you have—it's from the prototype we buried." <words>208</words>

"I figured." <words>210</words> Marcus finally looked at her, seeing the same exhaustion that weighted his own bones. <words>224</words> They'd both been running for so long, their shared secret binding them across continents and years. <words>240</words> "Someone's trying to rebuild it." <words>245</words>

"Then we need to refocus," Chen said, pulling out her own fragment. <words>257</words> "Find the other pieces before—"

"Before they understand what we hid." <words>264</words> Marcus completed her thought, remembering the pristine beaches that had hidden such darkness, the laboratory where brilliant minds had pursued terrible ends. <words>286</words>

In the workshop's hammered repose—that peculiar stillness of a place beaten down by secrets and time—they spread both fragments on the scarred wooden table. <words>311</words> The blueprints aligned imperfectly, like their memories of that island summer when they'd been young scientists who'd chosen conscience over career. <words>333</words>

"You still dream about it?" <words>338</words> Chen asked quietly. <words>341</words>

"Every night." <words>343</words> Marcus's gambling had always been about finding harmony in chaos, the same way they'd found peace in their decision to destroy the original device. <words>367</words> "The waves, the birds, the fire we set." <words>375</words>

She nodded, understanding passing between them like electricity. <words>383</words> Together, they would hunt down every fragment, honor their old promise, and ensure some secrets remained buried beneath island sand. <words>403</words>
