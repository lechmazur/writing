Dr. Elena Vasquez had predicted solar flares, meteor showers, and cosmic radiation bursts with uncanny accuracy, yet somehow always arrived just as the clouds rolled in. <words>24</words> Her latest misfortune led her through maintenance tunnels beneath the observatory—a shortcut to the greenhouse where her true passion lay: studying how plants responded to celestial events. <words>51</words>

The tunnel opened into vast caverns she'd never seen on any map. <words>63</words> Bioluminescent fungi cast green shadows across carved stone streets where scaled beings moved with purposeful grace. <words>79</words> Elena clutched her antique mariner's sextant—a family heirloom she used to measure stellar positions affecting plant growth cycles—as a Lizard Person approached. <words>102</words>

"Surface dweller," it hissed, tongue flicking. <words>108</words> "You carry instruments of the sky-watchers." <words>114</words>

"I study how cosmic events influence photosynthesis," Elena replied, her voice steady despite her racing heart. <words>130</words> In this underground city, she'd learned, only spoken truths held power—lies literally burned the tongue. <words>146</words>

The creature's pupils dilated. <words>150</words> "Our fungal gardens wither when your kind's satellites cross certain constellations. <words>161</words> We suspect deliberate interference." <words>165</words>

"That's systematically chaotic thinking," Elena countered. <words>171</words> "Correlation without causation." <words>174</words>

They began to spar—not with fists but with theories, equations scratched onto luminous walls. <words>189</words> Elena's meteorological models collided with ancient lizard astronomical knowledge. <words>198</words> Hours passed in fierce debate until patterns emerged: satellite launches did coincide with fungal die-offs, but only when specific cosmic alignments occurred. <words>221</words>

"Your corporations plan these launches," the Lizard Person accused. <words>230</words> "They harvest cosmic energy while poisoning our realm." <words>238</words>

Elena's throat tightened. <words>241</words> The truth-compulsion of this place forced her admission: "I've... noticed. <words>251</words> My surface plant studies show similar disruptions. <words>258</words> That's why I really came down here—my greenhouse experiments kept failing during launches." <words>272</words>

The confession tasted like bitter honey. <words>278</words> Sweet relief at finally speaking it aloud, poisoned by the implications. <words>289</words> Her unlucky timing hadn't been coincidence; someone had been sabotaging her weather predictions to hide these correlations. <words>307</words>

"Then we share enemies," the creature said, extending a clawed hand toward her sextant. <words>322</words> "Your instrument measures sky-angles. <words>326</words> Our crystals amplify earth-resonance. <words>330</words> Together, perhaps we map the intersection where both our interests survive." <words>341</words>

Elena smiled grimly, remembering her grandmother's words: sometimes the worst luck leads to the most necessary destinations. <words>358</words> She handed over the sextant, watching as scaled fingers adjusted its mirrors with surprising delicacy. <words>373</words> Above them, satellites traced their careful paths while below, two unlikely allies began charting resistance. <words>389</words> The bitter honey truth was this: saving the plants meant exposing those who profited from their destruction. <words>406</words> Elena's misfortune had finally served a purpose. <words>413</words>
