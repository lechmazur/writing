Dr. Elara's office hummed with the uniformly peculiar energy that permeated every corner of the secret agent training facility. <words>17</words> As the world's only hive-mind therapist, she could hear the collective thoughts of her networked patients like a symphony of whispers. <words>37</words> Tonight, through the night air on the eve of a bold discovery, she would attempt something unprecedented. <words>54</words>

"The sound of hindsight," she murmured, lighting another candle, "is always the loudest frequency in their shared consciousness." <words>72</words> The agents connected to her treatment program carried decades of regrets that echoed between their minds. <words>88</words> Each drop of wax fell with deliberate precision onto the metal tray below, forming coded shapes that only she could interpret. <words>109</words>

Agent Seven entered, clutching a scuffed phone charger plug like a talisman. <words>121</words> "Doc, I need you to drain it from all of us," he said with merry bitterness. <words>137</words> "The memory of Prague." <words>141</words>

She smiled sadly, understanding immediately. <words>146</words> In the hive-mind, one agent's trauma became everyone's nightmare. <words>156</words> The charger plug had been Seven's last connection to his handler before the mission went sideways. <words>172</words> Now it served as an anchor, a physical object to ground the ephemeral memory in reality while she worked. <words>192</words>

"Place it in the center," Elara instructed, gesturing to the constellation of candles. <words>205</words> Through the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes, she began the extraction ritual. <words>221</words> Each pattern represented a fragment of memory to be isolated and removed from the collective. <words>236</words>

The other agents, scattered across the facility, felt the gentle pull through their neural links. <words>251</words> Some laughed through their tears, that peculiar gallows humor that kept them sane. <words>265</words> Others simply sat in silence, grateful for the impending relief. <words>275</words>

As dawn approached, the wax had formed an intricate mandala around the charger plug. <words>289</words> The Prague memory flickered like a dying flame in their shared awareness. <words>301</words> "Almost there," Elara whispered, her own mind straining against the weight of what she was absorbing. <words>318</words>

With a final drop, the pattern completed itself. <words>326</words> The agents exhaled collectively, freed from the burden of shared trauma. <words>337</words> But Elara now carried it alone, the price of her gift. <words>348</words> She picked up the scuffed charger plug, its plastic warm from the candle heat. <words>362</words>

"Thank you," Seven said, his voice lighter despite the tears. <words>372</words>

"The sound of hindsight," she replied, pocketing the plug, "will always find new frequencies." <words>387</words> Tomorrow would bring fresh regrets to drain, but tonight, her peculiar patients could sleep without nightmares. <words>403</words>

Outside, the facility's lights dimmed as morning touched the horizon. <words>413</words> Another successful treatment in their uniformly peculiar world. <words>421</words>
