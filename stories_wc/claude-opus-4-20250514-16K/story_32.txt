The grim sentinel stood at the edge of Sorrow's Junction, watching dawn bleed across abandoned storefronts. <words>14</words> Between his fingers, he held a torn pamphlet—the last program from yesterday's show, its edges singed with forgetting. <words>31</words> "Experience the Weight of Memory," it promised in faded ink, but he knew better. <words>45</words> This ghost town wasn't real; it was a construct designed to harvest nostalgia from performers trapped between shows. <words>63</words>

He pulled a coin from his pocket, literally unique in its asymmetry—one side bearing his face, the other blank. <words>83</words> When he spun it on the dusty boardwalk, it sang. <words>93</words> Not the random plinks of metal on wood, but deliberate melodies that only he could decode. <words>109</words> Each rotation built another bar of the escape sequence he'd been composing for seventeen years. <words>124</words>

The weight of remembering pressed against his skull like iron. <words>134</words> Every dawn, the simulation reset, erasing progress except for what he could encode in coin-song. <words>149</words> The other performers forgot their attempts, forgot him, forgot everything except their next show. <words>163</words> But his role as sentinel meant watching, always watching, bearing witness to cycles within cycles. <words>178</words>

He flicked the coin again, harder. <words>184</words> The melody spiraled upward, a minor seventh that made the false sunrise flicker. <words>197</words> Behind saloon windows, holographic audiences waited in perpetual anticipation for performances that would never satisfy. <words>212</words> The torn pamphlet trembled in his other hand, its missing half containing the exit codes he'd sacrificed to remember this much. <words>234</words>

"Build it note by note," he whispered to the empty street. <words>245</words> The coin spun faster, its song growing complex, harmonics layering into something that hurt to hear. <words>261</words> This intimate separation from reality—knowing truth while dwelling in lies—had carved hollows in him that no amount of simulated applause could fill. <words>284</words>

A crack appeared in the sky, thin as thread. <words>293</words> The weight of remembering threatened to crush him, but he kept spinning, kept building. <words>308</words> Each melody wove into the next, constructing a ladder of sound that defied the simulation's logic. <words>324</words> The other performers would wake soon, would don their costumes and forget his warnings again. <words>339</words> But today, perhaps, his coin-built symphony would finally breach the barrier between what was performed and what was real. <words>358</words>

The pamphlet disintegrated as the final note rang out, its purpose fulfilled. <words>370</words> The grim sentinel stepped through the widening crack in dawn, leaving only the echo of spinning metal and the weight of memories too heavy for any simulation to hold. <words>399</words> Behind him, Sorrow's Junction prepared for another show that would never know he'd been its only authentic audience. <words>417</words>
