Marcus arranged the leashes with carefully careless precision, his fingers trembling as twilight bled through the stained glass windows of the Ashford mansion's dining room. <words>23</words> The three Borzois sat motionless beneath the table where their deceased owner's botanical collection wilted in crystal vases, specimens she'd gathered from graveyards across Europe. <words>48</words> He'd discovered the silent agreement two weeks ago at the blood drive, when Mrs. Ashford's nurse had gripped his wrist and whispered, "Keep walking them after she passes." <words>76</words> "The dogs," she'd added, her eyes darting, "they're the only things keeping it contained." <words>90</words>

Now, as purple dusk painted shadows across the empty plates still set for twelve, Marcus understood what she meant. <words>109</words> The botanical collection—deadly nightshade, wolfsbane, cemetery orchids—pulsed with something that made the dogs' hackles rise yet kept them obediently seated. <words>130</words> This was why he earned ten thousand per walk, why the ultra-rich paid him to stand where fear dares not tread. <words>151</words>

The silence in the room was deafening, broken only by the plants' impossible breathing and the dogs' synchronized heartbeats. <words>170</words> Marcus had to justify his presence here each evening, not to the estate lawyers who signed his checks, but to whatever watched from behind the withered petals. <words>197</words> The Borzois knew the truth—they weren't being walked for exercise but as guardians, their aristocratic bloodline somehow essential to maintaining the barrier. <words>219</words>

He moved with studied negligence, letting a leash drag across the Turkish carpet, disturbing nothing yet acknowledging everything. <words>237</words> The nurse's words echoed: "Mrs. Ashford made arrangements, but they only work if someone living honors them." <words>255</words> The dogs stood as one, their movements liquid mercury in the dying light. <words>268</words>

Outside, normal people hurried home from normal jobs, never knowing that in this dining room, Marcus performed his carefully careless ritual. <words>289</words> The botanical collection shuddered as he led the dogs past, and for a moment, he glimpsed what they contained—faces in the foxglove, hands in the hemlock. <words>316</words> Mrs. Ashford hadn't just collected plants; she'd trapped something in them, and only the daily walk of these specific dogs kept the binding intact. <words>341</words>

As they reached the doorway, the largest Borzoi turned back and whined, a sound that filled the loud silence with meaning. <words>363</words> Marcus understood: tomorrow he would return, honoring the silent agreement that kept the darkness fed and chained. <words>380</words> In the threshold between day and night, between duty and horror, he was the unlikely guardian of secrets that money couldn't buy but certainly could contain. <words>406</words> The leashes pulled taut as they stepped into twilight, three ancient dogs and one carefully careless man, walking the edge between worlds. <words>428</words>
