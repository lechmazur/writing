Brother Kael shuffled into the dimension door repair shop, his robes smelling of quantum dust and disappointment. <words>16</words> The proprietor, a woman whose fingers sparked with interdimensional residue, barely glanced up from her work. <words>32</words> "Another monk seeking passage to witness the Convergence," she muttered, her voice carrying that particular brand of cynical warmth reserved for repeat customers who never paid on time. <words>60</words>

"The cosmic event occurs in three days," Kael replied, producing a rusty skeleton key from his sleeve. <words>77</words> "This opens the Vault of Echoes where the haunted melodies are stored." <words>89</words> He'd spent decades collecting those spectral songs, each one a lightly unbearable reminder of dimensions that had collapsed, leaving only their death-hymns behind. <words>113</words>

The woman finally looked up, her expression softening despite herself. <words>123</words> "You're still chasing that fool's dream?" <words>130</words> She gestured at the broken portals lining her walls, each one a testament to the radical changes sweeping through the multiverse. <words>152</words> "The old pathways are dying, monk." <words>158</words>

"Which is why I need your help, Vera." <words>166</words> Their relationship was built on ties of forged trust—literally forged, as she'd once welded his soul back together after a particularly nasty dimensional mishap. <words>191</words> "The melodies I've collected can stabilize a portal long enough to reach the Convergence point." <words>206</words>

Vera sighed, taking the skeleton key and turning it over in her calloused hands. <words>220</words> "These haunted melodies of yours—they'll crush any door mechanism I build." <words>232</words> Her fingers traced the rust patterns. <words>238</words> "The resonance alone could shatter reality in a three-block radius." <words>248</words>

"Only if we use traditional materials," Kael countered. <words>256</words> "But with soul-glass from the melodies themselves..." <words>263</words>

"You want me to crystallize ghost songs into door components?" <words>273</words> Vera laughed, a sound like grinding gears wrapped in velvet. <words>284</words> "That's either brilliance or madness." <words>289</words>

"In my experience, they're often the same thing." <words>298</words> Kael's weathered face cracked into a smile. <words>306</words> "The Convergence happens once every ten thousand years—a chance to witness the birth and death of infinite realities simultaneously." <words>326</words>

Vera was already pulling out her tools, her cynicism crumbling like old mortar. <words>340</words> "Fine, but if this kills us both, I'm haunting your next seventeen incarnations." <words>354</words>

As she began working, Kael felt the lightly unbearable weight of hope settling on his shoulders again. <words>371</words> The haunted melodies hummed in their container, eager to crush themselves into something new, something that might bridge the gap between faith and engineering. <words>396</words> In this ramshackle shop where broken doors went to die, two unlikely partners prepared to forge one last miracle from trust and spectral music. <words>421</words> The cosmos waited, indifferent yet somehow inviting, for those brave enough to witness its rarest dance. <words>437</words>
