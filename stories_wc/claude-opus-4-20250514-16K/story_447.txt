Meredith stirred the soup pot, watching tomorrow's headlines shimmer above the steam. <words>11</words> As Willowbrook's gossip columnist, she'd dutifully reported every petty feud for twenty years—until the future bulletins began arriving three weeks ago. <words>33</words> 

The first appeared while she'd been frying eggs: "MAYOR'S AFFAIR EXPOSED, TOWN COUNCIL DISSOLVES." <words>47</words> By the time her omelet finished, the ethereal newsprint had deteriorated into wisps. <words>60</words> Each cooking session brought new revelations—scandals that would tear their already fractured community apart. <words>74</words>

She clutched the lonely stuffed toy ear, all that remained of her daughter's bear after the factory explosion that divided Willowbrook into warring factions. <words>98</words> The accident had trapped everyone in an amber prison of blame and bitterness. <words>111</words> 

Tonight's bulletin materialized as she added carrots: "COLUMNIST REVEALS ALL: NEIGHBORS TURN VIOLENT." <words>124</words> Her hands trembled, but she continued chopping with abandoned caution, the knife moving in dutifully defiant rhythm. <words>141</words> She could publish these future scandals, watch them self-fulfill, maintain her role as the town's information broker. <words>158</words> 

Or she could stage her gentle rebellion. <words>165</words>

As the soup simmered, more headlines appeared and deteriorated: "SHERIFF'S GAMBLING DEBTS," "PASTOR'S HIDDEN PAST," "TEACHER'S FAKE CREDENTIALS." <words>182</words> Each revelation could destroy another life, deepen another wound. <words>191</words> Meredith understood now why the bulletins came while cooking—creation and destruction dancing together over flame. <words>206</words>

She lifted the pot and poured the soup down the drain, watching the last bulletin dissolve: "GOSSIP COLUMNIST DIES PROTECTING TOWN'S SECRETS." <words>228</words> Her tomorrow column would be different. <words>234</words> Instead of exposing affairs and feuds, she'd write about Mrs. Chen's prize roses, the Henderson boy's piano recital, the library's new reading program. <words>257</words> 

The stuffed ear seemed to warm in her pocket as she typed, each word an act of defiance against the cynical future trying to manifest itself. <words>283</words> She would unravel these dark prophecies by refusing to weave them into reality. <words>296</words> Her rebellion wasn't loud protests or grand gestures—it was the quiet determination to see goodness where the future promised only ruin. <words>317</words>

By morning, her column was finished. <words>323</words> "Willowbrook Weekly: Celebrating Our Neighbors" ran the headline. <words>331</words> She knew the risk—those future bulletins had shown her fate. <words>342</words> But some prisons could only be escaped through sacrifice, some communities only mended through someone willing to catch the falling pieces. <words>363</words> 

As she submitted the column, another bulletin flickered into existence: "TOWN BEGINS HEALING." <words>376</words> It lasted just long enough for her to smile before deteriorating into hope. <words>389</words> Tomorrow, she would cook again, and perhaps the futures would be brighter. <words>401</words>
