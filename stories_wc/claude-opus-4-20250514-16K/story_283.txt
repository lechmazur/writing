The weathered forager adjusted her makeshift antenna, fashioned from the old circus ringmaster's whip she'd found decades ago in the heel of the giant's shoe. <words>26</words> Throughout harvesting season, Mara lived here in the colossal footwear—a leather cavern abandoned when the last titan departed, leaving only their shoes scattered across the valley like monuments. <words>54</words> She twisted the whip's braided handle, trying to catch fragmented radio frequencies that would let her order the specialized equipment she needed. <words>76</words> 

"Come in, Supply Station Seven," she muttered with apathetic eagerness, the contradiction that defined her—desperately wanting what she pretended not to care about. <words>99</words> Static crackled back, broken voices discussing shipments and coordinates. <words>108</words> 

Mara was sensibly eccentric, as the valley folk called her—mad enough to live in a giant's shoe, sane enough to map every microbiome within it. <words>133</words> The urgings of the soul had brought her here twenty years ago, that inexplicable pull toward abandoned places where soil told stories no one else could read. <words>160</words> 

"—need three dozen petri dishes—" she transmitted. <words>167</words> "—soil density meters—" <words>170</words> The whip-antenna sparked. <words>173</words> "—for patterns in decomposition layers—" <words>178</words>

Each harvesting season, when farmers worked the regular fields, Mara studied the unique ecosystem inside the shoe. <words>194</words> Giants' feet had compressed earth differently, created pressure patterns that fostered bacterial colonies found nowhere else. <words>210</words> She'd discovered seventeen new species already, named them after circus acts—the Trapeze Bacterium, the Tightrope Fungus—honoring the whip's previous life. <words>230</words>

"Order confirmed," came through the static finally. <words>237</words> "Delivery to Giant's Shoe, Left-Foot Valley, in four days." <words>246</words>

Mara allowed herself a small smile, then caught herself and resumed her practiced indifference. <words>259</words> The soul's urgings were embarrassing things—too earnest, too revealing. <words>268</words> Better to pretend this was just routine work, not a calling that made her heart race whenever she uncovered a new pattern in the compressed soil layers. <words>295</words>

She coiled the whip carefully, its leather still supple after decades of use as her only connection to the outside world. <words>316</words> Tomorrow she'd dig deeper into the toe section, where the darkness had preserved samples from the giants' era. <words>334</words> The radio frequencies would fade until evening, when atmospheric conditions improved. <words>345</words> 

Outside, harvesters sang in distant fields, gathering ordinary crops from ordinary soil. <words>357</words> Inside the giant's shoe, Mara prepared her instruments with the careful movements of someone who'd found exactly where they belonged—in the strangest, most sensible place imaginable. <words>384</words> The urgings of the soul, she'd learned, led to peculiar destinations, but they were never wrong. <words>401</words>
