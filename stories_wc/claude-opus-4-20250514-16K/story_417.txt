Brother Cornelius pressed the plain metal bottle cap against his fevered forehead, muttering theorems of divine botany as vines strangled the Victorian parlor's mahogany columns. <words>24</words> The jungle had reclaimed most of the missionary school, but here in this room of cracked leather and mildewed books, their unspoken agreement persisted: he would continue his studies, and the wilderness would wait. <words>56</words>

"The theoretically playful nature of God's design," he scrawled frantically, "manifests in the root systems of parasitic orchids." <words>74</words> His fellow missionaries had fled months ago, but Cornelius remained, convinced that salvation lay hidden in the botanical texts scattered across the Persian rug. <words>98</words>

The bottle cap—salvaged from Father Augustine's last communion wine—had become his talisman, a reminder of civilization's fragile membrane. <words>116</words> Each night, he pressed it to different pressure points, believing it channeled electromagnetic frequencies that kept the green chaos at bay. <words>137</words>

But tonight, something shifted. <words>141</words>

The parlor's gas lamp flickered and died, plunging him into velvet darkness. <words>153</words> From the corner where the wallpaper peeled like diseased skin, a voice emerged—not human, but the collective whisper of ten thousand leaves. <words>176</words>

"Why do you resist?" <words>180</words>

Cornelius clutched his bottle cap tighter. <words>186</words> "I study to understand God's garden," he whispered back, his voice cracking. <words>198</words> "To find the formula that will restore order." <words>206</words>

"Order is the illness," the jungle breathed. <words>213</words> "Your vulnerability is strength." <words>217</words>

In that darkness, surrounded by the sweet rot of orchids and the scratch of insects behind walls, Cornelius felt his certainty uproot itself. <words>240</words> The confession tumbled from his lips: "I'm terrified that I've wasted my life on equations that mean nothing." <words>258</words>

The bottle cap grew warm in his palm. <words>266</words>

"But what if meaninglessness is the most playful theorem of all?" he continued, laughing and sobbing simultaneously. <words>283</words> "What if God's grandest joke is that we search for patterns in pure chaos?" <words>297</words>

The vines responded by blooming—violent purples and electric yellows erupting through floorboards. <words>309</words> Cornelius understood then that his zealotry had been a shield against this terrible, beautiful truth: that surrender was the only scholarship that mattered. <words>333</words>

He opened his hand, letting the bottle cap fall. <words>342</words> It clinked against the floor with a sound like breaking chains. <words>353</words> The jungle rushed in, not as conqueror but as teacher, and Brother Cornelius finally began his true education—learning to dance with chaos, to find strength in admitting he knew nothing, to embrace the earnest absurdity of existence itself. <words>391</words>

When morning came, the parlor had become a cathedral of green, and Cornelius sat cross-legged among the ruins, finally free. <words>411</words>
