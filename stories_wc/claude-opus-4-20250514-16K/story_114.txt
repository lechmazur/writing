The shared dream recording studio hummed with residual divine energy, though its god had breathed her last three days ago. <words>19</words> Kaia, the studio's apathetic summoner, ground coffee beans in her grandmother's rustic grinder, each turn of the handle a meditation on her enthusiastically lazy approach to cosmic duty. <words>47</words> She'd perfected the art of doing nothing with great passion, which paradoxically made her the only one capable of this particular task. <words>69</words>

The deserted hall stretched before her, its matching empty frames waiting like patient mouths. <words>83</words> Each frame once held a dream recording—memories of coral reefs from when oceans sang with life instead of silence. <words>102</words> Now they hung vacant, their wisdom dissolved like salt in rain. <words>113</words>

Kaia sipped her coffee, its bitterness cutting gently through her indifference. <words>124</words> The dying god had whispered of river wisdom—how water knows its destination without rushing, how it shapes stone through persistent presence rather than force. <words>148</words> This was why Kaia had been chosen: her apathy wasn't emptiness but a strange fullness, like a river so complete it appeared still. <words>171</words>

She approached the first frame, pressing her palm against its hollow center. <words>183</words> The summoning began to unfold not through her will but through her magnificent lack of it. <words>199</words> Dreams of living coral materialized in the frames—not memories but possibilities, each one a blueprint borrowed from rivers that remembered when they met the sea. <words>224</words>

The studio's equipment captured these visions automatically, its crystals resonating with Kaia's lazy precision. <words>238</words> She moved between frames like water finding its level, letting each empty space pull the necessary dream from her unfocused mind. <words>259</words> This was her gift: to summon by not summoning, to rebuild by surrendering to the current of what wanted to exist. <words>279</words>

Other summoners had failed because they tried too hard, their eager hands grasping at smoke. <words>294</words> But Kaia understood what the river knew—that coral reefs couldn't be forced back to life. <words>309</words> They needed to be dreamed into being by someone who cared deeply about not caring, who could hold space without holding on. <words>331</words>

By dawn, all twelve frames glowed with potential reefs, each one a patient seed waiting for the right ocean to accept its gift. <words>354</words> Kaia ground more coffee, the rustic tool's rhythm matching her heartbeat. <words>365</words> The god's last breath still echoed in the studio, but it no longer sounded like an ending. <words>382</words> It sounded like rivers learning to remember their way back to the sea, carrying coral dreams in their enthusiastically lazy current. <words>404</words>
