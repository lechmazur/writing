Brother Tide clutched the waterlogged octopus plush—won decades ago at the Surface Carnival—as he descended the crystalline steps of New Atlantica's coral cathedral. <words>23</words> During his mandatory nature walks through the reef gardens, the zealot assassin had begun experiencing something troubling: doubt. <words>41</words> The plush toy, faded purple tentacles barely holding their stuffing, had belonged to his first mark—a child who'd grown into the tyrant he'd later executed. <words>67</words> 

He paused beside a brain coral formation where the city's reversed echo chambers captured and inverted every whispered confession. <words>87</words> "Testing, testing," he said with calculated playfulness, watching his words bounce back as their moral opposite: "Destroying, destroying." <words>105</words> The technology had been designed to help citizens understand their enemies, but Tide used it differently. <words>121</words>

Each morning's walk, he'd consolidate another fragment of his victims' stories, speaking their lives into the coral and hearing back his own justifications turned inside-out. <words>147</words> Today, he began retelling the epic of the Tyrant King—the monster who'd enslaved thousands—but from the perspective of a frightened boy who'd once cherished this very octopus. <words>176</words>

"He built the first underwater cities to escape the hunters above," Tide intoned solemnly. <words>190</words> The echo returned: "He destroyed the last surface havens to trap the hunted below." <words>205</words> 

Tide chuckled darkly at the reversal, a habit that disturbed fellow Brothers who mistook his gallows humor for madness. <words>225</words> But the assassination guild didn't understand his method—how each reversed echo forced him to confront the duality within every righteous kill. <words>247</words>

"The boy loved this octopus because eight arms meant eight hugs from his absent mother," he continued. <words>264</words> Back came: "The man hated this octopus because eight arms meant eight ways his present mother could strike." <words>283</words>

A school of parrotfish swam past, their methodical crunching of coral providing nature's own commentary on destruction and renewal. <words>303</words> Tide had killed forty-three tyrants, liberators, and prophets—all villains in someone's story, all heroes in their own. <words>321</words>

He squeezed the plush tighter, salt water seeping from its synthetic skin like tears. <words>336</words> The reversed echoes had taught him that morality wasn't a reflection but a refraction—bent by perspective, colored by pain, impossible to see clearly from only one angle. <words>364</words>

"Every villain was once someone's carnival prize," he whispered. <words>373</words> The coral answered: "Every hero was once someone's nightmare." <words>383</words>

Brother Tide tucked the octopus into his vestments and continued his walk, knowing tomorrow he'd return to consolidate more fractured truths, one reversed echo at a time. <words>411</words> After all, the most dangerous assassins were those who understood their targets were the heroes of their own stories. <words>431</words> His calculated playfulness wasn't cruelty—it was the only way to bear the weight of necessary murders in a world where even coral cities were built on bones. <words>459</words>
