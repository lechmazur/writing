The shepherd Enki had never meant to steal the jade hairpin from the Sumerian palace, but his habitually spontaneous fingers had plucked it from the dust where it lay forgotten. <words>30</words> Now, three moons later, he clutched the delicate ornament as he crept through marble corridors, his calloused hands trembling not from fear but from the weight of what he'd discovered. <words>59</words> The hairpin had belonged to a slave girl murdered by the high priest, and etched along its length were coordinates—numbers that led to a chamber where conspirators met to plan their vengeance. <words>91</words> 

"Justice demands blood," they'd whispered when he'd first stumbled into their gathering, drawn by his sentimental need to return the hairpin to the girl's sister. <words>116</words> He'd tried to boast of his shepherding wisdom, claiming violence would only birth more violence, but they'd laughed at his naivety. <words>137</words> Now, as dawn approached and the harbor bells announced the lifting anchor of the royal vessel's maiden voyage, Enki realized the conspirators planned to strike while the king sailed. <words>167</words> 

The price of justice, he understood with sudden clarity, wasn't measured in blood but in the courage to embrace uncertainty. <words>187</words> Racing through the palace gardens, sheep bells still jingling at his belt, he burst into the throne room where the king prepared to depart. <words>212</words> "Your Majesty," he gasped, holding up the hairpin, "I bring evidence of murder and conspiracy, though speaking it may cost my life." <words>234</words>

The king's guards seized him, but Enki welcomed the chaos—it had always been his teacher, showing him that spontaneous acts could topple empires or save them. <words>261</words> As they dragged him forward, he thought of his flock wandering untended, of the dead girl whose hairpin had led him here, of justice's strange and winding path. <words>290</words> 

"A shepherd speaks truth to power," the king mused, examining the hairpin's coordinates with interest. <words>305</words> "Perhaps the gods send wisdom through unexpected vessels." <words>313</words> He ordered the ship's departure delayed, the conspirators arrested, the high priest questioned. <words>326</words> But when he offered Enki gold for his service, the shepherd refused with a laugh that echoed through the pillared halls. <words>347</words> 

"Keep your gold, Majesty," Enki said, bowing with the awkward grace of one unaccustomed to palaces. <words>363</words> "I seek only to return this hairpin to its rightful keeper and my sheep to their pasture." <words>381</words> As he departed, sandals slapping against ancient stone, he understood that justice wasn't a destination but a journey—chaotic, humbling, and as unpredictable as his own spontaneous heart. <words>408</words> The murdered girl's sister wept when he pressed the jade hairpin into her palm, and in her tears, Enki found his reward. <words>431</words> Sometimes the greatest justice was simply remembering the forgotten, and a sentimental shepherd could change the world by following his wandering feet. <words>454</words>
