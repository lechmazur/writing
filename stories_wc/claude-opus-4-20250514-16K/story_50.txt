Sister Margot pressed the tarnished silver fork against her palm, its weight the only certainty in the glass desert that stretched endlessly before her. <words>24</words> The last monarch butterfly trembled on her shoulder, its orange wings catching light from the crystalline dunes that sang with each wind's touch. <words>47</words> She had come here forty days ago, an unconvinced missionary sent to document miracles she no longer believed in, carrying only provisions and an untuned piano left by previous pilgrims. <words>77</words>

The fork had belonged to her grandmother, a woman who claimed angels spoke through kitchen utensils. <words>93</words> Margot's faith, once absolute, had become capriciously consistent—appearing only when convenient, vanishing when truly needed, yet somehow always returning in the same predictable patterns. <words>117</words> Now, in this place where sand had turned to glass after some ancient catastrophe, she sought something beyond belief: to become a conduit for magic itself. <words>144</words>

Each sunset, she struck the piano's warped keys, listening to how the echoes bounced off the glass formations. <words>162</words> The butterfly would dance to these broken melodies, tracing shapes in the air that reminded her of scripture she'd memorized but never understood. <words>186</words> Tonight was different—the echoes held patterns, mathematical sequences hidden in the decay of each note. <words>202</words>

She began to decode them, using the fork's tines to scratch symbols into the glass beneath her feet. <words>220</words> The butterfly's migration was ending; she could feel its tiny heartbeat slowing against her neck. <words>235</words> This was the last of its kind, carrying genetic memories of routes that no longer existed, flowers that had forgotten how to bloom. <words>259</words>

The patterns revealed themselves: instructions for concealing not objects, but possibilities. <words>270</words> She understood now why the desert had called her here, why her wavering faith had been the qualification, not the flaw. <words>291</words> Magic required doubt—the space between believing and knowing where transformation lived. <words>302</words>

As the butterfly's wings stilled, Margot pressed the fork into the glass, and the symbols she'd carved began to glow. <words>322</words> The piano's echoes shifted, harmonizing with frequencies she felt rather than heard. <words>334</words> Her body became a tuning fork, vibrating with energies that had been waiting for someone exactly faithful enough to doubt, exactly doubtful enough to believe. <words>359</words>

She concealed the butterfly's last breath within the piano's soundboard, encoding its essence into music that would play forever in the glass desert's acoustics. <words>384</words> The fork dissolved into light between her fingers, and Margot finally understood: she hadn't come here to find faith, but to transform it into something more honest—a bridge between the missionary she was and the magician she was becoming. <words>425</words> Alone in the intimate vastness, she had discovered that some kinds of belief could only be born from their own absence. <words>447</words>
