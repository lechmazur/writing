Lady Pemberton adjusted her gardening gloves, pretending to prune the hedges outside the converted greenhouse that served as the estate's "toolshed"—though everyone knew it housed the government's most clandestine workshop. <words>25</words> Her reputation as a pushover aristocrat made her invisible to the agents inside, who never suspected that someone so eager to please could possess such razor-sharp awareness. <words>51</words> The dull letter opener tucked in her apron pocket pressed against her hip, a reminder of why she was really here. <words>72</words>

Through the workshop's faulty ventilation system—an echo chamber that carried whispers like shouts—she overheard Agent Morrison describing the new chemical compound. <words>94</words> "It'll liquify organic matter on contact," he bragged, "perfect for eliminating evidence." <words>107</words>

Lady Pemberton's heart clenched. <words>111</words> Yesterday, she'd discovered a nest of rare moonwing moths in the workshop's crawlspace, their chrysalises hanging like jeweled pendants. <words>130</words> The agents planned to fumigate tomorrow. <words>136</words>

She continued her theatrical trimming, each snip broadcasting her harmlessness while her mind raced. <words>150</words> "Oh, butterfingers me!" she exclaimed, deliberately dropping her shears near the workshop door. <words>163</words> As she fumbled to retrieve them, she slipped the letter opener between the door and frame, jamming the lock mechanism. <words>183</words>

That evening, she returned under moonlight. <words>189</words> The jammed door yielded to her touch, and she crept through the workshop's shadows, her aristocratic bearing replaced by purposeful stealth. <words>210</words> The echo chamber effect worked both ways—she moved in perfect silence, aware of every sound that might betray her. <words>229</words>

The chemical sat in a reinforced container, its warning labels practically screaming danger. <words>242</words> With trembling hands, she used the letter opener to pry open the ventilation grate above the counter. <words>259</words> One careful push sent the container tumbling into the shaft, where it shattered, the compound harmlessly liquifying the accumulated dust and debris as it drained into the estate's industrial waste system. <words>290</words>

She rescued the chrysalises next, cradling them in a silk handkerchief like the precious cargo they were. <words>307</words> "Terribly sorry about your evidence-melting juice," she whispered to the empty workshop, allowing herself a small smile. <words>324</words>

The next morning, she greeted the frustrated agents with tea and sympathy. <words>336</words> "Chemical accident? How dreadful!" she gasped, pressing a hand to her chest. <words>348</words> "Though I did notice the ventilation seemed rather dodgy yesterday—made the most peculiar echoing sounds while I was weeding." <words>368</words>

Agent Morrison barely glanced at her, too focused on the investigation to notice her fingers gently stroking the handkerchief in her pocket, where tiny wings were just beginning to stir. <words>398</words> Sometimes the greatest strength was letting others mistake your kindness for weakness, and your silence for ignorance. <words>415</words> Lady Pemberton smiled sweetly and offered more tea. <words>423</words>
