The lukewarm mage pressed her palm against the observation window, Earth hanging distant and fragile in the void beyond Luna Station Seven. <words>20</words> In her other hand, she clutched the torn doormat corner—frayed synthetic fibers that once welcomed visitors to her terrestrial home, before the Burning. <words>43</words> 

She'd been loyally peculiar about keeping it, this mundane relic that security had almost confiscated during evacuation. <words>60</words> Now, in the recycled air of humanity's last refuge, she understood why her magic had cooled from blazing to merely tepid. <words>81</words> Fear had doused her flames. <words>86</words>

The meditation chamber's stage fog generators hissed to life, filling the space with swirling vapor that caught the earthlight. <words>105</words> She watched ephemeral silhouettes form and dissolve—ghosts of her past self, fragments of power she'd once wielded without restraint. <words>124</words> The shadows began to clash, violent pantomimes of the day her uncontrolled fire had consumed everything she'd meant to protect. <words>144</words>

But she wasn't here to relive that agony. <words>152</words> She was clinging to echoes of something deeper—the memory of why she'd first learned magic at all. <words>169</words> To create, not destroy. <words>173</words> To paint futures with possibility rather than ash. <words>181</words>

The journal lay before her, leather-bound and patient. <words>189</words> In the hush before she opened it, she felt the universe pause, as if even the cosmos recognized this threshold moment. <words>210</words> The torn doormat corner seemed to pulse with remembered warmth—not of fire, but of home, of welcome, of belonging. <words>229</words>

She'd carried this fragment across 384,400 kilometers of vacuum because it represented what she hoped to rebuild. <words>245</words> Not with the reckless heat of her former power, but with the measured warmth of a hearth. <words>262</words> Her magic might be lukewarm now, but perhaps that was exactly the temperature needed to nurture rather than incinerate. <words>281</words>

The silhouettes in the fog shifted, no longer clashing but dancing, weaving together in patterns of potential. <words>298</words> She opened the journal and began sketching with fingers that glowed softly amber. <words>311</words> Each line was a promise, each curve a commitment to master her gift properly this time. <words>327</words> The lunar base might be sterile metal and regulated atmosphere, but she would make it home. <words>343</words>

The torn doormat corner rested beside her journal, a talisman of charred serenity. <words>356</words> She would paint this future free from fear, one careful stroke at a time, her loyally peculiar heart finally understanding that true power sometimes meant choosing restraint. <words>384</words> In the silence of space, she began to write, her lukewarm magic flowing like honey onto the page, sweet with hope and tempered by wisdom. <words>409</words>
