Kira's fingers traced the cursed cameo brooch, its ivory surface cold against her calloused palm. <words>16</words> The lost orchard temple sprawled before her, ancient fruit-laden vines strangling columns that reached toward a forgotten sky. <words>34</words> She'd survived twelve winters on the streets, learning that theoretically random events—a merchant's dropped coin, a guard's turned back—were never truly random at all. <words>59</words> 

The brooch whispered. <words>62</words> Not words, but a distant echo that rippled backward through time, carrying fragments of conversations that hadn't happened yet. <words>81</words> Kira had stolen it from a dying prophet who claimed it revealed truth through reversed patterns—what seemed like chaos was actually destiny running in reverse. <words>107</words>

She pressed deeper into the temple, where pomegranates hung like blood-drops and figs split with impossible ripeness despite the ruin's age. <words>129</words> The echoes intensified, contrasting sharply with the deathly silence that cloaked the sacred ground. <words>143</words> Future-voices overlapped past-screams, creating a temporal symphony only she could hear. <words>154</words>

"The unwritten calendar speaks," she murmured, understanding flooding through her with confident uncertainty. <words>167</words> She'd always known she was meant for something beyond stealing bread and dodging city guards. <words>182</words> The brooch showed her: in three days that had already passed but hadn't occurred yet, she would plant a seed here that would grow backward through time. <words>210</words>

The curse wasn't a curse at all—it was a gift wrapped in paradox. <words>224</words> Each echo revealed another piece of the pattern: how suffering birthed joy, how endings became beginnings when viewed from the proper angle. <words>246</words> She could harvest hope from darkness because she understood now that they were the same thing, separated only by the direction of observation. <words>270</words>

Kira climbed the altar where wild grapes had burst through stone, their sweetness defying decay. <words>285</words> She placed the brooch among the vines, watching it sink into green shadows. <words>298</words> The echoes quieted, then reversed themselves, flowing forward now instead of back. <words>310</words> She heard her own voice, years hence, teaching other orphans what she'd learned: that chaos was merely order wearing a disguise. <words>332</words>

The temple shuddered, not with age but with recognition. <words>341</words> Time folded like origami around her presence, past and future creasing together. <words>353</words> She plucked a single grape, its juice staining her lips purple—the first food she'd ever taken without stealing. <words>371</words> It tasted like tomorrow's sunrise, like yesterday's rain, like the precise moment when despair transforms into determination. <words>388</words>

Kira walked back toward the city, no longer an orphan but a keeper of reversed truths, carrying within her the certainty that nothing was certain except the patterns hidden in randomness. <words>419</words> The temple would wait, as it always had and always would, across its unwritten calendar of possibility. <words>436</words>
