Sir Elias adjusted his earbuds as the subway rumbled beneath the city, his armor reduced to a business suit, his sword to a briefcase. <words>19</words> The prudent knight—as his colleagues jokingly called him for his cautious investment strategies—maintained his mysteriously cheerful demeanor despite the crowded car. <words>40</words> 

The museum brochure in his lap advertised "Knossos After Dark: Experience the Minoan Palace Reimagined," but his attention fixed on something else entirely. <words>63</words> From his pocket, he withdrew a manila envelope containing photocopied letters, their edges worn from handling. <words>79</words> A loose binder ring, oxidized bronze and ancient, rolled free as he opened it. <words>93</words> His grandmother's final gift—found among her effects with only these cryptic documents and no explanation. <words>108</words>

The letters, purchased from estate sales according to faint pencil marks, seemed random at first. <words>123</words> But Elias had discovered patterns: repeated symbols, matching the ring's engravings, appearing in correspondence spanning centuries. <words>139</words> Each writer mentioned dreams of bull dancers and labyrinthine corridors, of honey-colored stones and dolphins leaping across impossible skies. <words>158</words>

As the train approached Museum Station, his pulse quickened with that familiar unknown feeling—like recognizing a stranger's face in a mirror. <words>179</words> The letters spoke of guarded secrets, bloodlines hidden in plain sight, descendants of those who served in the palace of the Double Axe. <words>202</words> One phrase appeared again and again: "We who remember what never was." <words>214</words>

The subway doors opened to his stop, and Elias stood, carefully returning the letters to his briefcase. <words>231</words> Tonight's exhibition promised authentic reconstructions, but he suspected he'd find more than tourist displays. <words>246</words> The binder ring—too perfectly sized for modern paper, yet ancient beyond doubt—clinked against his keys. <words>262</words> 

His mysteriously cheerful nature, which puzzled everyone who knew him, suddenly made sense. <words>275</words> It wasn't optimism but recognition—the joy of someone approaching home after an impossibly long journey. <words>290</words> The letters suggested others like him existed, drawn to reimaginings of the palace, understanding through cryptic patterns what archaeologists could only guess. <words>313</words>

Ascending the station stairs toward the museum's illuminated entrance, Elias felt the weight of his unknown ancestry lightening with each step. <words>334</words> The prudent knight had spent years tracing cautious paths through financial markets, but tonight he would navigate corridors his blood remembered. <words>355</words> The evening commute that brought thousands home had delivered him to something altogether different—a familiar unknown that whispered of bull leapers and sacred serpents, of genealogies written in dreams rather than documents. <words>388</words>

The museum doors reflected his smile as he approached, binder ring clutched like a signet, ready to understand what the guarded secrets had always been telling him. <words>416</words> He was going home. <words>420</words>
