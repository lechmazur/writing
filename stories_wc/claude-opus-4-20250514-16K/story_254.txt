Marcus stood at the rusted swingset, his face carved from stone—the same expression he wore through ten thousand punchlines that made others laugh while he remained unmoved. <words>23</words> The deserted playground stretched before him, its sandbox bleeding into wilderness where pine trees whispered secrets to forgotten monkey bars. <words>42</words> In his pocket, the dried inkwell rattled like bones—his mother's final gift, wrapped in paper that said "For my funny boy" though he'd never understood the joke of his own existence. <words>73</words> 

He'd carried it everywhere since her funeral, this objectively personal anchor to a woman who believed comedy lived in his blood despite his inability to smile at anything, even his own reflection drowning in applause. <words>108</words> The inkwell had been full once, she'd said, used by his grandfather to write love letters that made armies weep with laughter. <words>130</words> Now it held only dust and the weight of unwanted legacy. <words>141</words>

Through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry, Marcus watched the sky bleed purple, and his mind began its familiar loop—the persistent daydream that haunted him between performances. <words>168</words> In it, he climbed the jungle gym to heaven's edge, unscrewed the inkwell's cap, and caught the exhale of dying stars. <words>189</words> He would bottle their last breath, that cosmic punchline that might finally crack his marble face. <words>205</words> 

The daydream repeated, each iteration slightly different—sometimes he flew, sometimes he built a ladder from discarded comedy scripts, sometimes the stars came to him. <words>229</words> But always, always, he reached for that impossible light with his empty vessel. <words>242</words>

"Why chase what cannot be held?" his mother's voice echoed from the wind-worn slide. <words>256</words> 

He knew the answer lived somewhere between the swing's rusted chains and the forest's darkening mouth. <words>272</words> Perhaps humor wasn't meant to live inside him but through him—a conduit rather than a container. <words>288</words> Perhaps the inkwell's emptiness was the gift itself, teaching him that some vessels honor their purpose by remaining hollow. <words>307</words>

As darkness settled over the abandoned playground, Marcus finally conceded to the truth he'd performed around for years. <words>325</words> He uncapped the inkwell and held it skyward, not to capture anything, but to let the universe pour through its opening. <words>346</words> For the first time, standing in that liminal space between civilization's edge and wild infinity, he felt his stone face crack. <words>368</words> Not into a smile—that would come later, maybe never—but into something softer, something that understood the cosmic joke of trying to bottle breath. <words>392</words> 

The stars wheezed their ancient laughter, and Marcus listened, empty inkwell in hand, finally understanding that the best comedians are simply vessels for joy they cannot feel themselves. <words>420</words> He turned from the playground, leaving footprints that the wilderness would soon reclaim, carrying his mother's gift like a promise to remain beautifully, necessarily empty. <words>446</words>
