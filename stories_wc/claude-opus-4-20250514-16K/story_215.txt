Father Marcus pressed his trembling fingers against the vintage postcard, its edges worn soft from decades of handling. <words>16</words> The psychic research facility's dance studio echoed with tango music, but his mind churned through the first puzzle she'd left him. <words>36</words> Dr. Elena Voss circled him like a predator teaching prey to waltz, her lab coat swaying with each calculated step. <words>56</words> "You came here to synthesize your faith with our data," she murmured, guiding his clumsy feet through the basic box step. <words>77</words> "But you're still rattled by what happened in Prague, aren't you?" <words>88</words>

He forced a sharp smile, matching her coy aggression. <words>97</words> "Your facility promised answers, not dance lessons." <words>104</words> 

"Everything here serves a purpose," Elena countered, spinning him toward the mirrored wall where symbols glowed faintly beneath the surface. <words>124</words> The postcard in his pocket grew warm—the second puzzle revealing itself. <words>136</words> Despite his shaking hands, Marcus was inwardly social, craving connection even as he guarded his disclosures about the possession that had nearly destroyed him. <words>161</words>

"The Vatican sent you to debunk us," Elena whispered against his ear, "but you're hoping we'll prove that your demons are real." <words>184</words>

The symbols rearranged themselves as they danced, forming a sequence he recognized from ancient texts. <words>199</words> "Science and wonder aren't opposites," he said, inputting the code with deliberate steps across the floor. <words>215</words> "They're dance partners." <words>218</words>

A section of mirror slid away, revealing a hidden room lined with case files, each documenting possessions that conventional psychology couldn't explain. <words>241</words> Elena's expression softened, her aggressive facade cracking. <words>248</words> "My sister was one of them," she admitted. <words>256</words> "The doctors called it schizophrenia, but I knew better." <words>265</words>

Marcus pulled out the postcard—a 1963 view of Prague's St. Vitus Cathedral. <words>277</words> "This was in her file," he said. <words>284</words> "She sent it days before..." <words>289</words>

"Before you failed to save her." <words>295</words> Elena's words cut deep, but her hand found his. <words>304</words> "That's why you're really here." <words>309</words>

The final puzzle clicked into place: two broken people, circling each other in a careful dance of guarded disclosures, trying to synthesize faith and empiricism into something that could heal their wounds. <words>342</words> The hidden room held no answers, only evidence that they weren't alone in their questions. <words>357</words>

"Again," Elena said, restarting the music. <words>363</words> "From the beginning." <words>366</words>

This time, when Marcus took her hand, it didn't shake. <words>376</words> They moved together through the steps, each revelation a small exorcism, each turn bringing them closer to the truth that wonder and science were merely different languages for the same haunted dance. <words>408</words>
