The insomniac poet pressed her face against the subway window, counting seven stops until home, where botanical samples crowded her haunted attic in meticulously messy rows. <words>26</words> Between this stop and the next, she rehearsed her plan: eliminate her rival through calculated vulnerability, spilling secrets at gallery after-parties where wine loosened tongues and witnesses multiplied. <words>53</words> The ghost in her attic had taught her this—whispering warnings through dried leaves and pressed flowers, showing how violence bloomed from violence like spores from decay. <words>79</words> She'd tried confrontation once, her fists clenched around stolen verses, but the specter's cold breath through specimen jars reminded her: destruction came easier through confession than collision. <words>106</words> 

The train lurched forward. <words>110</words> In her coat pocket, she fingered the botanical evidence—a rare orchid cutting her rival had stolen from the university greenhouse, proof he'd built his reputation on theft. <words>136</words> She would plant the story like seeds at three different parties, each drunken admission calculated to seem accidental: "I saw him that night," "The greenhouse key," "Such beautiful specimens in his apartment." <words>166</words> The ghost had shown her how whispers traveled faster than screams, how the right words at the right moment could uproot a career without drawing blood. <words>191</words>

Her attic studio overflowed with specimens—an empty abundance of preserved beauty that couldn't sleep, just like her. <words>208</words> Each plant carried warnings in its withered form: nightshade spoke of hidden poison, venus flytraps of patient hunger, kudzu of slow strangulation. <words>230</words> The ghost moved through them nightly, rearranging their meticulous chaos, teaching her that non-violence wasn't passive—it was precise as taxonomy, deliberate as preservation. <words>253</words>

Another stop passed. <words>256</words> She thought of her rival's latest reading, how he'd performed her unpublished work as his own, his voice steady where hers would have trembled. <words>280</words> The ghost had whispered through the rafters that night, rustling paper labels on glass jars: "Let him confess his own undoing." <words>301</words> So she began attending his after-parties, drinking just enough to loosen her tongue, never enough to lose control, planting doubts like specimens between conversations. <words>326</words>

The train slowed again. <words>330</words> Tomorrow night's gallery opening would be the third party, the final confession that would complete the pattern. <words>347</words> She would mention the orchid cutting casually, watch recognition dawn in listening eyes, let others connect the dots she'd carefully arranged. <words>369</words> The haunted attic had taught her patience—how preservation required time, how the most powerful eliminations happened without violence, through the slow pressure of truth taking root. <words>395</words> Between these subway stops, she practiced her final whispered warning, knowing that by morning, his reputation would wither like her carefully pressed flowers, eliminated by his own reflected guilt. <words>424</words>
