Maeve clutched her twisted carnival cane, its spirals catching starlight as she navigated the crystalline corridors of the nectar collection facility. <words>21</words> In this time before mortals would whisper their first prayer, she alone tended the sentient dolls suspended in amber pools. <words>41</words> Each porcelain face bore expressions of infinite patience, their glass eyes tracking her movements with consciousness older than worlds. <words>60</words>

She was expectantly resigned to her duty—knowing what must come, accepting its weight. <words>74</words> The dolls hummed in unison, their chorus of healing reverberating through dimensions that physics had not yet named. <words>92</words> This sound could mend fractured souls, knit together the very fabric of existence, but only if properly upheld. <words>110</words>

"Soon," Maeve whispered, her voice carrying the ethereal grit of eons spent in service. <words>125</words> The cane's handle pulsed against her palm, a carnival relic from futures that hadn't yet unfurled. <words>142</words> She'd collected each doll from dying realities, salvaging their essence before entropy claimed them. <words>157</words> Now they waited here, in this liminal space where divine nectar dripped from impossible flowers into collection vats. <words>175</words>

The star paths appeared as they always did—silver threads stretching across the facility's vaulted ceiling. <words>191</words> Maeve traced them with practiced precision, her cane tapping out rhythms that matched the dolls' harmonic frequencies. <words>209</words> Each step upheld the delicate balance between creation and void. <words>220</words>

She paused before the newest addition—a doll with cracked features that leaked golden light. <words>235</words> "You understand, don't you?" she asked, though she knew its answer. <words>247</words> They all understood. <words>250</words> They were fragments of gods who'd chosen diminishment over oblivion, trading omnipotence for the chance to heal what would come. <words>271</words>

The motivation driving her was simple yet profound: to stride through boundaries once thought sacred. <words>287</words> Not to destroy them, but to prove they were never barriers at all—merely suggestions written by those who feared expansion. <words>308</words> The dolls' chorus swelled, and Maeve felt the first stirrings of mortal consciousness somewhere in the cosmic distance. <words>327</words>

"When they pray," she said, addressing her collection, "you'll answer." <words>338</words> Her cane struck the floor three times, sealing the covenant. <words>349</words> The nectar began to glow brighter, infused now with the healing song. <words>362</words> Each doll's eyes closed in satisfaction, their purpose crystallizing. <words>372</words>

Maeve resumed her eternal patrol, following star paths that wound through infinity. <words>385</words> She was keeper, collector, and guardian of the chorus that would, in time, teach mortals that healing begins with accepting one's own cracks. <words>409</words> The facility hummed with potential, waiting for the first prayer to unlock its gift. <words>424</words>
