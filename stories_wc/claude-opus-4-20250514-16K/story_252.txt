The memory thief pressed her palm against the frost-glazed door of the fruit preservation vault, feeling the familiar sting of stolen recollections burning beneath her skin. <words>24</words> Inside, rows of crystallized apples and pears hung suspended in time, each one a testament to methods forgotten centuries ago. <words>44</words> She clutched the simple wooden toy block in her other hand—the last fragment of a childhood she'd stolen from herself in penance. <words>67</words> 

The crack in reality had started here, in this vault where her grandmother once taught the old ways of preserving not just fruit, but moments themselves. <words>94</words> Now cherry blossom petals drifted through the fissure, impossible pink against the silver-rimmed shelves, leaving a trail she could follow to recalibrate what she'd broken. <words>120</words> Each petal landed with the weight of a whisper, marking the path between what was and what should never have been. <words>141</words>

She moved through the vault with lovingly hateful precision, despising herself for the thefts while cherishing each memory she'd preserved from those who would have lost them anyway. <words>170</words> The wooden block grew warm in her grip as she traced the petal trail deeper, past jars of suspended plums that hummed with the echoes of harvests long past. <words>200</words> 

At the vault's heart, she found it—the moment frozen at the hush as an empty swing set slows to a stop, that peculiar silence when childhood ends and something else begins. <words>232</words> Her grandmother's final memory floated there, wrapped in frost and waiting. <words>243</words> The memory thief had stolen it to save it, but in doing so had torn the fabric of proper preservation itself. <words>264</words>

She knelt among the scattered petals, pressing the toy block against the shimmer where reality had cracked. <words>281</words> The wood remembered what she'd forced herself to forget—the proper words, the correct temperatures, the precise way to capture sweetness without destroying its source. <words>306</words> As she whispered the old preservation chants her grandmother had taught her, the petals began to spiral upward, each one pulling a stolen memory from her skin. <words>334</words>

The pain was exquisite, a lovingly hateful release as she returned what she'd taken. <words>348</words> The crack began to seal, reality knitting itself back together with threads of frost and fragments of borrowed time. <words>367</words> When the last petal settled and the final memory fled her flesh, she stood empty but finally clean in the quiet vault. <words>389</words> The ancient methods had been restored, written now in ice and absence rather than theft and preservation. <words>406</words> She left the wooden block among the fruit, a small monument to the thief who'd learned that some things must be lost to be truly saved. <words>432</words>
