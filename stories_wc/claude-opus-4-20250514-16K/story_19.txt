The feral ranger stood knee-deep in the dandelion field, her weathered hands clutching the brass balance scale as the newborn's cry pierced the twilight air. <words>26</words> In that suspended moment before the child drew its second breath, time folded upon itself like origami made of memory. <words>46</words> She had tracked the pregnant woman here through code words hidden in grocery receipts—"milk" for north, "bread" for danger, "eggs" for sanctuary—a language she'd invented during her years of self-imposed exile. <words>77</words> The receipts had blown across the wilderness like paper birds, precisely random in their flight patterns yet carrying desperate messages from a world she'd abandoned. <words>102</words> Now, watching through the cottage window as the midwife lifted the squalling infant, the ranger's body began to quiver with recognition. <words>123</words> This was her sister's child. <words>128</words> 

The brass scale in her hands had once weighed medicinal herbs in their mother's apothecary, back when she still wore shoes and answered to a civilized name. <words>155</words> She'd fled that life after the fire took everything, choosing the honesty of weather and wildlife over the suffocating sympathy of townspeople. <words>177</words> But her sister had never stopped searching, leaving those coded receipts at crossroads and creek beds, trusting that love could decode what logic couldn't comprehend. <words>202</words> The ranger's unfiltered perception—sharpened by seasons of solitude—caught every detail: the baby's perfect fingers grasping at air, her sister's exhausted smile, the dandelion seeds drifting past the window like tiny parachutes carrying wishes. <words>237</words>

She set the balance scale among the dandelions, its brass gleaming like a small sun in the fading light. <words>256</words> On one pan she placed a handful of seeds; on the other, a folded receipt bearing the final message: "Come home." <words>277</words> The scale trembled, perfectly balanced between her feral freedom and this unexpected summons to rejoin humanity. <words>293</words> Through the glass, her sister's eyes found hers—no surprise, only patient hope. <words>305</words> The baby's cries had quieted to hiccups, and in that holy pause, the ranger understood that wildness and belonging weren't opposites to be weighed but threads to be woven. <words>334</words>

She approached the cottage door with bare feet that remembered the way, her heart a tangle of sorrow for the years lost and joy for the years possible. <words>362</words> The dandelions bent in the evening breeze, releasing their seeds into the unknown. <words>375</words> She knocked—three times, like their childhood secret—ready to embrace whatever answer waited behind that weathered wood. <words>391</words> The door opened, and she stepped across the threshold, feral and family both. <words>404</words>
