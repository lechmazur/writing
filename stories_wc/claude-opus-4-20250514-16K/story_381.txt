The crystalline cave hummed with bioluminescent energy as Vex adjusted her scuffed baseball cap, a relic from the Before Times. <words>17</words> She spoke in whispers, as all necromancers of the 23rd century did—their voices could wake the digital dead if raised too loud. <words>38</words> Between sets of mapping pulses from her quantum scanner, she paused to trace the cavern walls with practiced fingers. <words>57</words>

"Classic spelunking scene from 'Journey to the Center,'" she murmured to her AI companion, MORI. <words>72</words> The artificial intelligence flickered to life in her earpiece, sharing her love for old movies from centuries past. <words>90</words>

"Indeed, though these crystals are scarcely abundant—existing in quantum superposition," MORI replied. <words>103</words> "Both everywhere and nowhere until observed." <words>109</words>

Vex had spent years learning to dominate her necromantic abilities, channeling spectral energies to map cave systems across the terraformed colonies. <words>130</words> Each cavern held memories of the dead miners who'd carved them, their essence lingering in the crystalline formations. <words>148</words> She could summon their knowledge, but only in hushed tones, only with absolute control. <words>163</words>

The scanner beeped—another set complete. <words>168</words> She had ten minutes before the next mapping sequence. <words>177</words> Settling against a smooth crystal wall, she touched the faded logo on her cap, remembering her grandfather's stories about baseball stadiums and summer afternoons. <words>201</words>

"MORI, play the cave scene from 'The Descent,'" she whispered. <words>211</words>

As the audio filled her ears, mixing with the cave's natural resonance, she heard it—the sound of resolve. <words>229</words> Not in the movie's soundtrack, but in the crystals themselves. <words>239</words> They sang with the determination of those who'd died here, mining for humanity's future among the stars. <words>256</words>

"Detecting anomaly," MORI interrupted. <words>260</words> "Spectral density increasing." <words>263</words>

Vex stood, her whispered incantations already forming. <words>270</words> The cave's quantum crystals flickered between states, responding to her necromantic touch. <words>282</words> She'd learned long ago that the dead didn't need loud voices to be heard—they needed someone who understood silence. <words>302</words>

Through their shared cinematic language, she and MORI had developed a mapping technique no other surveyor could replicate. <words>320</words> They used movie references as coordinates, marking each chamber with scenes that captured its essence. <words>335</words> This cave, with its scarcely abundant crystals and ghostly miners, would be catalogued as "The Abyss meets Interstellar." <words>353</words>

The next set began, and Vex smiled beneath her grandfather's cap. <words>364</words> In the future, nostalgia wasn't about looking back—it was about carrying the past forward, one whispered word at a time. <words>384</words> The sound of resolve echoed through the crystalline corridors, a harmony of human determination that transcended death itself. <words>402</words> She would map every cave, honor every ghost, until humanity's expansion was complete. <words>415</words>
