Marlowe hadn't slept for six nights, but her brush never trembled as she painted another grinning face onto canvas. <words>17</words> Her arboreal workshop swayed gently among the giant mushrooms, their bioluminescent caps casting peacefully chaotic shadows that danced like old memories. <words>38</words> 

The tapered wizard's hat hung on its peg, the bullet hole through its crown a reminder of why she painted these endless smiles. <words>61</words> Behind each painted smile lay a truth she'd learned by scrying in puddles after midnight—that joy could devour sorrow if you let it. <words>85</words>

She'd discovered this gift accidentally, gazing into rainwater pooled on mushroom caps, seeing not reflections but revelations. <words>102</words> The visions showed her which children in the village below carried invisible wounds, which souls needed her painted masks most desperately. <words>124</words>

At first light, during the hush of an empty classroom, she would hang her latest creation. <words>141</words> The children would arrive to find a new smiling portrait waiting, never knowing their secret pain had been witnessed, transformed, honored. <words>163</words> Each painting devoured a piece of darkness, converting anguish into whimsy through pigment and purpose. <words>179</words>

The wizard—her mentor—had worn that hat the night he'd tried to stop her unconventional magic. <words>195</words> "You can't heal them by hiding their hurt behind pretty pictures," he'd insisted, not understanding that sometimes a painted smile becomes real through wearing. <words>220</words> The hunter's bullet meant for her had found him instead, his sacrifice becoming her final obstacle to outlast. <words>239</words>

Now she worked with frolicsome regret, each brushstroke a small rebellion against fate's cruelty. <words>253</words> Her insomnia wasn't affliction but dedication—every sleepless hour meant another child might wake to find their burden lightened. <words>272</words> The workshop creaked in mushroom-filtered moonlight as she mixed colors that had no names, only feelings. <words>289</words>

By dawn, three new portraits hung in the classroom, their painted smiles more genuine than any photograph. <words>306</words> Marlowe watched through her scrying puddle as children discovered them, their real smiles slowly matching the painted ones. <words>325</words> This was her magic: teaching joy to devour sorrow one portrait at a time, outlasting grief with stubborn, sleep-deprived love. <words>346</words>

She touched the bullet hole in the wizard's hat, remembering his last words: "Your chaos brings peace." <words>364</words> He'd understood, finally, that behind her painted smiles lay not deception but transformation—a gentle revolution fought with brushes in the canopy. <words>386</words> 

The mushrooms pulsed with morning light as Marlowe prepared another canvas, her laughter tinged with tears, her exhaustion indistinguishable from euphoria. <words>408</words> Tomorrow, another empty classroom would fill with wonder, and she would outlast whatever darkness came, one impossible smile at a time. <words>431</words>
