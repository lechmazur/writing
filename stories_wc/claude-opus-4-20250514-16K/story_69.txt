Moss clutched the dented lunch tin against her robes, its uniquely common appearance masking the chaos seed within. <words>16</words> She'd promised her mentor she'd find someone worthy of its power before the equinox. <words>30</words> Now, uncertain of her druidic path in this chrome-and-glass city, she wandered through the hologram repair shop's back entrance. <words>49</words>

Throughout library hours, when respectable folk studied, the shop transformed. <words>59</words> Behind flickering projection screens, desperate artists auditioned for underground theater troupes. <words>70</words> Moss had discovered this pattern weeks ago—actors channeling raw emotion while technicians mended fractured light. <words>86</words>

"Next!" barked a director through blue static. <words>93</words>

A trembling performer stumbled forward, holographic makeup glitching across her face. <words>104</words> She began a monologue about trees that remembered being forests. <words>114</words> Moss's fingers tightened on the tin. <words>120</words>

The ties of obligation pulled at her—not just to her mentor, but to something deeper. <words>136</words> These artists, scrambling for roles in back-alley productions, understood transformation. <words>146</words> They knew how to forge beauty from anarchy, just as nature did. <words>158</words>

"Pathetic," the director yawned, his lethargic excitement barely masking genuine interest. <words>169</words> "But there's something there. Again, with feeling." <words>177</words>

The actress tried once more, her words painting ancient groves in the sterile air. <words>191</words> Around them, repair drones hummed, stitching together broken advertisements and shattered entertainment programs. <words>205</words> 

Moss drifted closer, drawn by an energy she recognized. <words>214</words> This wasn't mere performance—it was ritual, communion, prayer. <words>222</words> The actress spoke of roots seeking water through concrete, of leaves that dreamed in binary. <words>237</words>

When the audition ended, Moss approached. <words>243</words> "You understand the green spaces between things," she said quietly. <words>253</words>

The actress turned, mascara running through pixelated tears. <words>261</words> "I just need the part. Rent's due." <words>268</words>

But Moss saw deeper—the way she'd cradled invisible branches, how her voice had trembled with genuine loss. <words>285</words> She opened the dented tin, revealing a seed that pulsed with bioluminescent promise. <words>298</words>

"This belongs to someone who can plant forests in people's minds," Moss explained. <words>311</words> "Theater is just another kind of grove." <words>318</words>

The actress stared, then laughed—tired but suddenly alive. <words>326</words> "You're either crazy or the answer to everything." <words>334</words>

"Both," Moss admitted, passing her the tin. <words>341</words> "That's what makes us druids." <words>346</words>

As holographic advertisements reformed around them, the actress accepted the gift. <words>357</words> The seed's glow reflected in the shop's countless mirrors, multiplying like stars. <words>369</words> Moss felt her obligation lifting, replaced by something new—a network of possibility spreading through the city's electronic veins. <words>387</words>

Tomorrow, during library hours, she'd wander again. <words>394</words> But tonight, she'd watch this tired actress plant impossible gardens on back-alley stages, transforming urban decay into something achingly alive. <words>415</words>
