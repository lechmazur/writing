Brother Matthias pressed his damp forehead against the greenhouse glass, watching acid rain streak down the panes while his followers tended orchids below. <words>23</words> The ceramic owl figurine in his trembling hands seemed to mock him with its painted eyes—so certain, so permanent, everything he wasn't. <words>44</words> "The flowers speak," he whispered to no one, his voice cracking like dried soil, "but I can't hear them anymore." <words>64</words>

In the sprawling greenhouse city of New Eden, where toxic clouds painted the sky purple-green, Matthias had built his following on a simple promise: he could translate what the plants were saying. <words>96</words> His congregation hung faded photographs throughout the sanctuary, each one stained with the shimmer of long-dried tears—memories of the world before the poison came. <words>121</words> These images influenced the faithful more than his sermons ever could, their ghostly water-marks catching light like trapped souls. <words>140</words>

"Brother, the new converts are waiting," Sister Alma called up, her doleful cheer as practiced as breathing. <words>157</words> Matthias clutched the owl tighter, its ceramic coolness a statically dynamic presence—unchanging yet somehow alive in his sweating palms. <words>177</words> He descended the spiral stairs, each step blurring the boundary between prophet and fraud. <words>192</words>

The congregation swayed among the tomato vines, humming hymns that mixed mourning with hope. <words>206</words> Matthias had discovered that people would follow anyone who promised meaning in meaninglessness, beauty in decay. <words>222</words> The rain drummed harder against the glass ceiling, its rhythm almost like language. <words>236</words> He placed the owl on the altar—his grandmother's last gift before the toxins took her—and opened his mouth to preach. <words>257</words>

But the words wouldn't come. <words>262</words> The roses whispered secrets he couldn't decode, the lilies sang in frequencies beyond his failing faith. <words>278</words> His followers watched expectantly, their faces greenhouse-humid and patient. <words>287</words> In the photographs behind him, those ancient tears caught the grow-lights, creating tiny rainbows of remembrance. <words>303</words>

"Today," Matthias finally managed, his voice finding that strange space between sorrow and joy, "the flowers tell us to wait." <words>323</words> His spine bent like a wilting stem, but somehow the congregation nodded, satisfied. <words>337</words> They dispersed among the plant beds, tending their green cathedral with careful hands. <words>351</words>

Sister Alma approached, touching the ceramic owl gently. <words>359</words> "You know, Brother, maybe understanding isn't about translation," she said. <words>369</words> "Maybe it's about growing alongside them until we speak the same silence." <words>381</words>

Matthias felt the boundaries dissolve—between leader and lost, between human and plant, between the toxic outside and their verdant refuge. <words>402</words> The rain continued its percussion against their glass world, and somewhere among the petals, he heard something that might have been meaning, or might have been nothing at all. <words>432</words> The owl's painted eyes reflected both possibilities, forever frozen in ceramic wisdom. <words>444</words>
