The sleepy nomad drifted between realms like smoke through fingers, his eyes half-lidded with the arrogance of one who believed he could traverse any boundary. <words>26</words> For years, he'd masqueraded as a master of the spiritually material—those rare objects that existed simultaneously in flesh and phantom. <words>45</words> But today, lost on what appeared to be an ordinary hiking trail, his certainty began to crack. <words>62</words>

The path twisted impossibly, leading him to a door marked "Disguise Room 7" carved into an ancient oak. <words>80</words> Inside, mirrors reflected not faces but souls, and shelves held masks of every human pretense imaginable. <words>96</words> At the room's heart lay two broken barbells, their iron bars bent and twisted like failed prayers. <words>113</words>

"Those belonged to the strongest man who ever lived," said a voice. <words>125</words> The nomad turned to find his oldest friend, Chen, wearing the uniform of a celestial border guard. <words>142</words> "He thought physical strength could break spiritual barriers, just as you think spiritual wandering can shatter material ones." <words>160</words>

The nomad's drowsy confidence flared. <words>165</words> "I've walked through walls, Chen. <words>170</words> I've touched stars while my body slept." <words>177</words>

"And yet you're lost on a simple trail." <words>185</words> Chen's words hung in the air like incense. <words>193</words> "This room appears only to those whose arrogance blinds them to their limits." <words>206</words>

The broken barbells began to glow, revealing inscriptions: "Strength without humility is weakness." <words>219</words> The nomad reached for them, but his hands passed through like mist. <words>231</words> His ability to touch the spiritually material—his greatest pride—had abandoned him. <words>242</words>

Chen removed his guard uniform, revealing the simple robes of a monk. <words>254</words> "I've spent centuries learning what you refuse to see: true power comes from accepting our boundaries, not denying them." <words>273</words>

The room began to fade. <words>278</words> In the hush of their impending farewell, the nomad felt his first genuine emotion in decades: humility. <words>295</words> "How do I find my way back?" <words>302</words>

"Stop trying to blaze trails through intangible limits," Chen said softly. <words>313</words> "Walk the paths that already exist, with eyes fully open." <words>323</words>

As Chen dissolved into morning mist, the nomad found himself on the trail again, the broken barbells now solid in his hands. <words>345</words> They were impossibly heavy—not with metal, but with the weight of every boundary he'd arrogantly dismissed. <words>361</words> For the first time in his wandering life, he set them down and chose to walk unburdened. <words>378</words> The path ahead was ordinary dirt and stone, but he saw it clearly now: sometimes the greatest journey is accepting where you stand. <words>401</words>
