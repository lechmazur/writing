The weatherbeaten knight pressed his palm against the lighthouse prison's cold mirror, watching his reflection age backward through decades of war. <words>18</words> Within the glass, he saw himself young again, standing before a brass door knocker shaped like a weeping angel. <words>36</words> Three items lay scattered on the stone floor: a child's wooden sword, a withered rose, and a letter sealed with blood. <words>57</words> He understood the pattern now—each object marked a moment when he'd chosen duty over love. <words>73</words>

"The reflection shows you what could have been," whispered the lighthouse keeper, her voice carrying the joyful agony of one who'd made the same impossible choice. <words>100</words> The knight watched his younger self raise the knocker, knowing that behind that door waited his daughter, dying of plague while he rode to meaningless glory. <words>127</words> In the mirror, time flowed differently; he could still change things, still choose her over his oath to the crown. <words>148</words>

But changing the past meant erasing the lives he'd saved, the peace his battles had won. <words>165</words> His reflection's hand trembled on the knocker as tears carved new channels down weathered cheeks. <words>181</words> The lighthouse keeper placed a fourth item beside the others: a tiny silver bell, his daughter's final gift. <words>200</words> "Ring it in the reflection," she said, her smile grudgingly sweet, "and her last cry of regret will be hushed forever." <words>222</words>

The knight reached through the mirror's surface, feeling time ripple like water around his scarred fingers. <words>239</words> His reflection grasped the bell, and for one impossible moment, both versions of himself existed—the father who stayed and the knight who left. <words>264</words> The bell's chime echoed between worlds, a sound of pure forgiveness that shattered and healed him simultaneously. <words>282</words>

Through the brass knocker's keyhole, he glimpsed his daughter grown old, surrounded by grandchildren he'd never known. <words>299</words> She'd lived—not the life he'd imagined, but one filled with its own fierce joy. <words>315</words> The pattern was complete: sword, rose, letter, bell—war, love, choice, redemption. <words>327</words> As the mirror's surface stilled, the knight finally understood what he'd come to appreciate through decades of imprisonment. <words>346</words> Some regrets weren't meant to be erased but transformed, like base metal into gold through the alchemy of acceptance. <words>366</words>

The lighthouse keeper touched his shoulder gently. <words>373</words> "Your penance is complete, Sir Knight." <words>380</words> Outside, waves crashed against the jagged reef, singing their eternal song of things lost and found. <words>397</words> He walked toward the lighthouse door, no longer weatherbeaten but somehow made whole by his beautiful breaking. <words>415</words> Behind him, the mirror reflected only empty air, while ahead, the brass knocker gleamed with promise of the life still left to live. <words>439</words>
