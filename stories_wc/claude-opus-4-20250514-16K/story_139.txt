Brother Aldric jolted awake in the swaying aerial gondola, his weathered fingers clutching the visually unappealing antique flute as mountain peaks drifted below like frozen waves. <words>25</words> In that heartbeat after his dream returned—the same nightmare that had haunted him for seven years—he knew his dark reflection had finally revealed itself. <words>49</words> The creased shipping label wrapped around the flute's tarnished silver body bore an address he recognized: the monastery where his twin brother had died. <words>73</words>

The stubborn monk had spent years harvesting the past, collecting fragments of memory like scattered seeds, but this flute held the final answer. <words>96</words> Through the gondola's frosted window, he watched clouds part to reveal the jagged peaks where Brother Marcus had fallen—or been pushed. <words>118</words> Aldric lifted the instrument, studying the peculiar tooth marks etched deep into its mouthpiece with the cautious enchantment of one approaching forbidden knowledge. <words>141</words>

Those marks told a story only he could read. <words>150</words> Each indentation mapped to their childhood code, the secret language twins had invented when words felt too dangerous. <words>168</words> As the gondola creaked through thin mountain air, Aldric deciphered the message his brother had desperately bitten into silver before his death. <words>190</words>

"Trust not the morning bell," the marks spelled. <words>198</words> "Your shadow walks among us." <words>203</words>

Aldric's breath misted in the cold cabin as understanding dawned. <words>213</words> The dark reflection he needed to outsmart wasn't metaphorical—someone wearing his face had infiltrated the monastery, had murdered Marcus when he'd discovered the deception. <words>237</words> This imposter still lived there, praying in Aldric's abandoned cell, wearing robes that mirrored his own. <words>253</words>

The shipping label's return address confirmed what the tooth marks revealed: the package had been sent from inside the monastery, posted the day after Aldric had supposedly left on pilgrimage. <words>283</words> But he'd departed three days earlier. <words>289</words>

As the gondola descended toward the distant monastery, Aldric tucked the ugly flute inside his robes. <words>305</words> To avenge Marcus, he would need more than righteous fury. <words>315</words> He would need to harvest every memory, every mannerism, every prayer he'd ever spoken in those halls. <words>332</words> His reflection had studied him well enough to fool everyone for seven years. <words>345</words>

Now Aldric would return the favor. <words>351</words>

The bells began tolling across the valley—morning prayers. <words>359</words> Aldric smiled grimly, remembering his brother's warning. <words>366</words> When he arrived, he wouldn't announce himself at the morning bell. <words>377</words> He would wait, watch, and strike when his shadow least expected the true monk's return. <words>393</words> After all, who better to catch a perfect reflection than the original himself? <words>406</words>
