Maya hired another actor at the farmers market, her typically unique approach to finding her twin growing desperate. <words>18</words> The morning crowd bustled around vegetable stalls while she studied the man's face, searching for traces of shared DNA in his hired performance. <words>40</words> "Higher cheekbones," she instructed, watching him adjust his expression to mirror the only photograph she possessed—herself at birth, before the separation. <words>62</words>

The baseball felt heavy in her pocket, its leather surface bearing an impossible signature: "Champions 2047 - Remember the mountain." <words>82</words> The time traveler who'd pressed it into her palm last week had whispered about forbidden knowledge before vanishing into the market's crystal shadows. <words>106</words> Maya understood now why she'd been hidden from her twin—together, they would remember something the world wasn't meant to know. <words>127</words>

"Follow me," she told the actor, leading him through the crowd toward the trail nobody else seemed to see. <words>146</words> The mysterious mountain peak loomed above the market, accessible only to those who carried objects from tomorrow. <words>163</words> Other hired actors waited at predetermined points along the ascent, each one closer to her twin's true appearance, breadcrumbs of identity leading upward. <words>187</words>

At the summit's hidden chamber, carved from black crystal that cast angular shadows, Maya found her. <words>203</words> Not another actor, but her actual twin, Lila, holding an identical baseball. <words>215</words> "You came," Lila breathed, and suddenly Maya remembered everything—the apocalyptic prophecy that claimed only one twin would survive unless they could subdue the knowledge itself. <words>240</words>

The clandestine meeting had been orchestrated across timelines, the time traveler visiting each twin separately with basedballs containing half-truths. <words>259</words> Together in this sacred space above the world's noise, they compared signatures: "Champions 2047" on Maya's, "If you remember" on Lila's. <words>281</words> The complete message unlocked their suppressed memories of the future they'd witnessed as children before being separated for humanity's protection. <words>302</words>

"We know how it ends," Maya said, gripping her sister's hand. <words>313</words> "But knowing isn't controlling." <words>317</words>

Lila nodded, understanding their true purpose—not to prevent the apocalypse through forbidden knowledge, but to outlive it by choosing ignorance. <words>337</words> They hurled both baseballs into the mountain's crystal core, watching tomorrow's artifacts dissolve into shadow. <words>352</words> The hired actors below would vanish with the timeline, but the twins would remain, their identities finally whole in their refusal to remember. <words>376</words>

Descending through morning mist, they returned to the farmers market as strangers who shared only faces, having subdued the terrible knowledge that survival sometimes means forgetting who you were meant to become. <words>408</words> The mountain kept their secret. <words>413</words>
