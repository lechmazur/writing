Marcus clutched the empty tape dispenser, his fingers tracing its useless spindle as the farmhands gathered for evening story time. <words>19</words> In this dystopian commune where genetic crops withered and hope grew thinner than wheat stalks, he'd carved out his niche: speaking to the dead. <words>43</words>

The lull of remorse settled over him like morning fog. <words>53</words> Three years of false séances, of interrogating ghostly apparitions that existed only in his imagination, had worn grooves in his conscience. <words>75</words> Yet here they came again, these broken workers seeking comfort from loved ones lost to the agricultural wars. <words>93</words>

"Who seeks the veil tonight?" Marcus intoned, his voice carrying mild fervor despite the weight in his chest. <words>111</words>

Sarah stepped forward, her calloused hands trembling. <words>118</words> "My daughter. The pesticide floods took her." <words>125</words>

Marcus pressed the tape dispenser to his temple—his signature move, claiming it channeled frequencies between worlds. <words>141</words> The absurdity felt unusually normal now, this theater of grief. <words>151</words> He closed his eyes, summoning the performance that had become second nature. <words>163</words>

"She comes," he whispered, then louder: "Emma, is that you? Your mother waits." <words>176</words>

What followed was his usual routine: pointed questions disguised as spectral interrogation, cold reading masked as otherworldly communication. <words>194</words> Sarah's tears fell as Marcus wove details gleaned from previous story times into a tapestry of false reunion. <words>212</words>

"She says... she says the pain is gone. She tends flowers now, in fields untouched by poison." <words>229</words>

The lie tasted bitter, but Sarah's sob of relief cut deeper. <words>240</words> This was his purpose, his defiance—to taunt the jaws of defeat and grin, to offer comfort where none existed. <words>259</words> The empty dispenser grew warm in his grip, as if it too bore witness to this necessary cruelty. <words>277</words>

When Sarah finally smiled through her tears, Marcus felt both triumphant and hollow. <words>290</words> Tomorrow would bring another story time, another performance, another ghost to interrogate. <words>302</words> The remorse would return in quiet moments, but for now, he'd given these people what the dystopian landscape couldn't: hope. <words>322</words>

As the gathering dispersed into the toxic twilight, Marcus pocketed his prop. <words>334</words> His con wasn't about money anymore—it never really had been. <words>344</words> In a world where death came too easily and comfort too rarely, even a small-time con artist could become something more. <words>365</words> He walked back to his quarters, the weight of fabricated spirits on his shoulders, knowing he'd return tomorrow to interrogate the ghosts that lived only in broken hearts and his own guilty imagination. <words>397</words>

The empty tape dispenser held no tape, but it held something else: the strange power of unusually normal lies told with mild fervor in service of healing. <words>425</words>
