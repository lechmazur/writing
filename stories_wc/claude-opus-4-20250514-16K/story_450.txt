Marina's movements spoke what her tongue never could. <words>9</words> The sharp-witted dancer clutched the scorched patch from her grandmother's crashed Mars mission, its edges still smelling of cosmic failure. <words>28</words> She lowered herself into the thought experiment chamber's porcelain tub, bubbles rising around her like miniature universes. <words>45</words>

"Prophecy say... must..." she muttered, her linguistic ineptitude transforming eloquence into fragments. <words>57</words> The chamber's walls displayed every yearly family photo since 2089, each showing her lineage posed identically: right hand raised, left touching earth. <words>79</words> Marina studied them through the steam, her body unconsciously beginning to mimic the gesture. <words>93</words>

She'd denied it for years—the prophecy's claim that the first linguistically broken descendant would complete what the mission couldn't. <words>113</words> The patch burned against her palm. <words>119</words> Her grandmother had returned from that disaster speaking in perfect equations but unable to form simple sentences, just like Marina. <words>139</words>

"Dance is... words?" <words>142</words> Marina whispered, sinking deeper into the philosophical bathwater. <words>150</words> The thought experiment chamber hummed, designed to blur reality and possibility during its occupants' most vulnerable moments. <words>167</words> She watched her family's photos shimmer on the walls, recognizing the hidden choreography in their rigid poses. <words>184</words>

Each year, they'd stood precisely, unknowingly encoding instructions through body language. <words>195</words> Marina's trained muscles read what her ancestors' mouths couldn't say—coordinates, velocity, trajectory. <words>208</words> The dance of return. <words>212</words>

She rose from the water, bubbles clinging like space debris, and began the movement sequence her family had preserved without understanding. <words>233</words> Her feet traced vectors across the chamber floor while her arms carved mathematical arcs through humid air. <words>250</words> The patch glowed, responding to motions its original owner had been too damaged to complete. <words>266</words>

"Prophecy wrong," Marina gasped, her body spelling out what her vocabulary couldn't. <words>278</words> "Not about... going. <words>281</words> About... knowing." <words>283</words>

The weight of her family's denial pressed down—they'd spent decades funding new missions, never realizing the solution lived in their annual portraits. <words>306</words> Marina danced faster, each gesture unlocking dormant systems in the patch. <words>317</words> The chamber's walls flickered between bathroom and spacecraft interior. <words>326</words>

She felt it then—the twist the prophecy promised. <words>335</words> The patch wasn't from a crashed mission at all. <words>344</words> It was from a ship that had never left, hidden beneath generations of refusing to see. <words>361</words> Marina's dance reached crescendo, her wordless language finally speaking truth. <words>371</words>

The chamber dissolved, revealing the intact vessel her grandmother had concealed through seven decades of elaborately staged failure. <words>389</words> Marina stood dripping, caught between triumph and vertigo, understanding flooding through her movement-wired mind. <words>403</words>

Sometimes the most eloquent statements require no words at all. <words>413</words>
