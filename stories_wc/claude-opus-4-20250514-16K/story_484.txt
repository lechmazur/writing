The groggy brewer stumbled through the haunted mansion graveyard, his uniquely generic appearance—flannel shirt, artisanal beard, protest sign reading "HOPS NOT CORPSES"—blending perfectly with the other demonstrators who'd gathered to oppose the cemetery's conversion into luxury condos. <words>37</words> During the lull in the protest when voices gathered again, murmuring strategies and sipping from thermoses, Marcus noticed something peculiar through his exhaustion-blurred vision. <words>61</words> A dusty spiral staircase, half-hidden behind a mausoleum, bore the slightest discoloration on its third step—a muddy footprint that seemed impossibly fresh. <words>84</words>

"Well, that's not ominous at all," he muttered, approaching with the kind of flippant solemnity one adopts when confronting potential doom while severely under-caffeinated. <words>108</words> The footprint led him to initiate what he'd later describe as "the world's stupidest investigation," climbing the staircase that groaned beneath his weight like disappointed ancestors. <words>134</words> At the top, wedged between two stones, glinted a piece of a broken mirror that reflected not his face, but writhing shadows that seemed to reach toward him. <words>162</words>

The encroaching darkness wasn't metaphorical—it literally seeped from the mirror shard like spilled ink, spreading across the stone floor with deliberate hunger. <words>184</words> Marcus laughed, because what else does one do when supernatural horror interrupts social activism? <words>198</words> "Of course the evil real estate developers are using actual darkness," he said, pocketing the shard. <words>214</words> "Probably cheaper than hiring security." <words>219</words>

As the darkness crept closer, Marcus realized this was it—his chance to become a living embodiment of his values. <words>238</words> Not just someone who brewed ethical beer and attended weekend protests, but someone who'd literally stand against the consuming void of gentrification made manifest. <words>262</words> He raised the mirror shard, and in its fractured surface, he saw the truth: the darkness feared reflection, feared being seen for what it was. <words>287</words>

"You want this graveyard?" Marcus shouted down to where protesters and darkness alike waited. <words>301</words> "You'll have to go through every small business owner, every artist, every brewer who's tired of running!" <words>318</words> The shard caught the moonlight, sending the darkness recoiling like a bad Yelp review. <words>332</words>

Below, the protesters saw him silhouetted against the moon, mirror shard raised high, looking absolutely ridiculous and absolutely necessary. <words>351</words> They began to chant, not slogans, but laughter—genuine, defiant laughter that made the darkness shudder and retreat. <words>368</words> Marcus descended the staircase, each step crushing shadow beneath his sensible brewing boots. <words>381</words> By dawn, the darkness had withdrawn entirely, leaving only the graveyard, the protesters, and one groggy brewer who'd learned that sometimes standing for something means standing against nothing—literally. <words>409</words> The mirror shard became his talisman, a reminder that even the most generic person can reflect extraordinary light. <words>427</words>
