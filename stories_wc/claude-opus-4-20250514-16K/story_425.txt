Brother Kaine stood in the solar flare observatory's lavishly austere chamber—marble floors polished to mirror brightness, yet furnished only with a single iron bench. <words>23</words> The morose paladin watched the monitors flicker, displaying the sun's dying convulsions in real-time. <words>37</words> It had been three centuries since the last star was named, and humanity's light was fading with them. <words>55</words>

His fingers traced the dull sewing needle tucked in his gauntlet—a relic from when people still mended things instead of discarding them. <words>77</words> The observatory's purpose had shifted from scientific study to desperate vigil, watching for the solar flares that powered what remained of civilization. <words>99</words>

Then darkness fell. <words>101</words>

The city-wide blackout struck without warning, monitors dying like snuffed candles. <words>112</words> Emergency protocols should have engaged, but the ancient systems had finally failed. <words>124</words> Kaine felt the familiar bored excitement—that weary thrill of impending catastrophe that came from witnessing humanity's slow collapse for too long. <words>145</words>

Footsteps echoed in the darkness. <words>150</words> A woman emerged from the shadows, her face illuminated by bioluminescent tattoos—visible changes that marked her as a Flux Engineer. <words>170</words> "You're the one trying to restore the old networks," she stated. <words>181</words>

"The ancient systems are our only hope," Kaine replied, his voice heavy with centuries of disappointment. <words>197</words>

She laughed bitterly. <words>199</words> "Hope? <words>200</words> The Council wants to confine you for heresy. <words>208</words> They say your restoration attempts caused this blackout." <words>216</words>

Kaine pulled out the needle. <words>221</words> "This belonged to my grandmother. <words>226</words> She used it to repair solar collection fabric before we forgot how to make it." <words>241</words> He pressed it into her palm. <words>247</words> "The old code is woven into the observatory's foundation circuits—literal stitches in the stone. <words>261</words> You'll need this to trace them in the dark." <words>270</words>

Her tattoos pulsed brighter, casting strange shadows. <words>277</words> "Why trust me?" <words>280</words>

"Because in darkness, even enemies become allies," he said, his morose demeanor cracking slightly. <words>294</words> "The Council can confine me after we save what's left of the world." <words>307</words>

Together, they descended into the observatory's bones, following the needle's path through circuits older than memory. <words>323</words> Each connection restored brought visible changes—lights flickering to life, systems humming awake. <words>335</words> The bored excitement transformed into genuine hope as ancient and modern knowledge merged. <words>348</words>

When the sun's light finally returned to the monitors, it revealed not death but transformation—solar flares dancing in patterns the old systems could harness. <words>372</words> The last star may have been named, but the first sustainable future had just been born. <words>388</words> Kaine smiled—a foreign expression on his weathered face—as the Flux Engineer began teaching others the forgotten art of mending rather than abandoning. <words>411</words>
