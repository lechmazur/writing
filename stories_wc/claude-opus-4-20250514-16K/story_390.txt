The assassin known as Silent Jade hummed tunelessly while pressing butterfly wings between sheets of rice paper, her movements as methodical as a tea ceremony. <words>20</words> In the ancient palace's eastern tower, she had discovered that whispers of longing could be captured—quite literally—if one knew the proper technique. <words>41</words> The court's desires floated through marble corridors like invisible moths, and she collected them with the same calm precision she once reserved for throats. <words>66</words>

"Amalgamate by the pattern of a butterfly's wings," the prophecy had instructed, which seemed poetic until Jade realized it was a recipe. <words>88</words> She layered each pressed wing according to its species: Emperor moths for ambition, Luna moths for forbidden love, Death's-heads for the obvious. <words>111</words> Between them, she sandwiched the captured whispers—actual wisps of breath that writhed like silk threads, desperately trying to return to their speakers' lips. <words>135</words>

The botanical press groaned under the weight of accumulated yearning. <words>145</words> Tomorrow, the imperial interrogator would arrive, and before he could ask his first question, Jade needed to transform prophecy into possibility. <words>166</words> She'd spent three moons learning that metaphors in this palace had an alarming tendency to become flesh. <words>183</words>

"Please," wheezed a minister's whisper from between two Swallowtail wings, "let me see my daughter again." <words>199</words>

Jade patted the press affectionately. <words>204</words> "Soon you'll all be one magnificent creature," she promised, though the thought made her queasy with amusement. <words>221</words> What exactly did one call a being made entirely of compressed desires and insect wings? <words>237</words>

She'd killed seventeen men to reach this position, only to discover the real power lay in flower-pressing equipment and a steady hand. <words>260</words> The irony wasn't lost on her. <words>267</words> The prophecy spoke of "spinning raw possibility," but Jade suspected it meant something more literal—perhaps a cocoon of pure potential. <words>289</words>

As midnight approached, the whispers grew louder, rattling the press like trapped birds. <words>302</words> She added another layer: Morpho wings for transformation, their blue iridescence catching moonlight through latticed windows. <words>318</words> The palace slept, unaware that its collective longing was being reorganized into something unprecedented. <words>332</words>

"Figuratively literal," Jade muttered, remembering her master's last words. <words>341</words> "When wordplay becomes foreplay with reality itself." <words>348</words>

She'd laughed then, thinking him mad. <words>355</words> Now, pressing the final wing—a simple Cabbage White for innocence—she understood. <words>367</words> The amalgamation beneath her hands pulsed with impossible life, ready to emerge before dawn's first question could poison the air with truth. <words>390</words>

Silent Jade, calm assassin turned cosmic midwife, tightened the botanical press one last revolution and waited for her monstrous butterfly of pure desire to be born. <words>416</words>
