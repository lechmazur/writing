The sellsword Gareth stumbled into the witch's herb garden, his usual jovial demeanor intact despite the withering vow gnawing at his soul. <words>19</words> "Madam Thornweave!" he bellowed cheerfully, though his hand trembled on his sword hilt—boldly reluctant, as always. <words>35</words>

The witch emerged from between towering foxglove, carrying an astronomical telescope wrapped in burlap. <words>49</words> "You're early," she said, setting the instrument among her moonwort. <words>59</words> "The transformation won't begin for hours." <words>65</words>

"About that," Gareth laughed nervously. <words>70</words> "My family has this tradition—every generation, we make a time capsule." <words>82</words> He produced a silver box from his pack. <words>90</words> "We treasure our doubts inside, bury them deep." <words>98</words> His smile faltered. <words>101</words> "But this vow you've placed on me—" <words>108</words>

"—will wither your joy completely by dawn unless you complete the ritual," Thornweave finished. <words>123</words> She adjusted the telescope, pointing it skyward. <words>130</words> "Your grandfather made the same bargain." <words>136</words>

Throughout the transformation, Gareth's laughter grew hollow, his skin graying like autumn leaves. <words>149</words> The witch crushed herbs—belladonna, vervain, sage—their scent creating elegant mayhem in the air, sweet poison dancing with salvation. <words>168</words> 

"Look," she commanded. <words>171</words>

Through the telescope, Gareth saw his grandfather's star, bright among the constellations. <words>183</words> "He treasured his doubt too," Thornweave whispered. <words>190</words> "Buried it in your family's tradition." <words>196</words> She handed him a vial of starlight-infused tincture. <words>204</words> "But doubt is meant to be dethroned from the mind, not hidden away." <words>217</words>

The sellsword understood. <words>220</words> With characteristic bravado fighting his reluctance, he shattered the time capsule against the garden stones. <words>235</words> Centuries of crystallized fears exploded in prismatic chaos, each doubt dissolving in the moonlight. <words>249</words>

"My grandfather's vow," Gareth gasped as color flooded back to his cheeks. <words>261</words> "He never broke it—just passed it down." <words>269</words>

"Disguised as tradition," the witch agreed. <words>275</words> "Elegant mayhem, these family curses." <words>280</words> She poured the tincture over the shattered remains. <words>288</words> "But you've treasured something better than doubt tonight." <words>296</words>

"What's that?" <words>298</words>

"Courage to break the pattern." <words>303</words>

As dawn approached, Gareth's transformation reversed completely. <words>310</words> His jovial nature returned authentically—no longer a mask over ancestral fear. <words>322</words> He left the herb garden whistling, the telescope under his arm, a gift from Thornweave. <words>338</words> "For seeing clearly," she'd said. <words>343</words>

The withering vow lay broken among the herbs, its power finally treasured for what it truly was—not a curse to hide, but a lesson to transform. <words>370</words> And Gareth, boldly reluctant no more, strode into morning with doubt dethroned and joy restored. <words>386</words> The witch smiled, tending her elegant mayhem of a garden where fears came to die and warriors learned to truly live. <words>407</words>
