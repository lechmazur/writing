Marina's calloused fingers traced the mother-of-pearl buttons inside her grandmother's vintage box, each one humming with a frequency only she could feel. <words>23</words> The broken planetarium's dome flickered above, its shattered projectors now strobing neon through smoke-filled air where stars once danced. <words>43</words> She was patiently impatient, waiting tables at Nebula while her true work unfolded in the mirrors lining the vintage clothing boutique next door. <words>67</words>

As an underwater welder by day, Marina understood pressure—how things held together until they didn't. <words>83</words> Tonight marked the crossing where two timelines should never meet, when her grandmother's death in 1973 would overlap with her own birth in 2003. <words>108</words> The button box was the key, inherited along with mysteries her mother refused to discuss. <words>124</words>

She pampering herself with stolen moments between serving drinks, slipping into the boutique to glimpse the mirrors. <words>141</words> Each reflection showed a different timeline: her grandmother young and fierce, welding ships during wartime; herself in diving gear, torch blazing beneath crushing depths. <words>166</words> The moments of unraveling had begun three weeks ago when she'd first opened the box and felt time fracture like safety glass. <words>189</words>

"Last call," the DJ announced, but Marina was already moving. <words>200</words> The button box thrummed harder as midnight approached, each button a node of possibility. <words>215</words> She'd discovered that pressing them in sequence while watching the mirrors could splice timelines—a terrible, improbable power that explained her grandmother's sudden disappearance. <words>239</words>

In the boutique mirror, she saw her: the woman who'd welded Liberty ships and liberty itself, who'd discovered what Marina now knew. <words>263</words> Time was just another medium to work in, another surface to join or cut apart. <words>279</words> The planetarium's broken star projector suddenly blazed to life, casting constellations across both spaces. <words>294</words>

Marina pressed the final button—carved obsidian, cold as deep water. <words>305</words> The mirror shimmered, and her grandmother stepped through, young as Marina herself, still wearing her welding mask pushed up on her forehead. <words>328</words> "You found it," she said simply. <words>334</words> "The crossing only happens once a generation." <words>341</words>

They stood facing each other in the throbbing bass of the nightclub-planetarium, two welders separated by decades yet standing in the same impossible moment. <words>366</words> Marina understood now why her mother had hidden the box, why she'd never spoken of the family gift. <words>385</words> Some powers were too heavy to wield alone. <words>393</words>

Her grandmother extended her hand, and Marina took it, feeling the familiar calluses of their shared trade. <words>411</words> Together, they would mend what had been fractured, or fracture what needed mending. <words>425</words> The button box sang between them, and the broken stars above began to heal. <words>440</words>
