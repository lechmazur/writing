Marcus had spent seventeen years guarding the abandoned circus dressing room, his scarred hands trembling each time he checked the rusted lock. <words>19</words> The tortured protector never spoke of why he stayed, only that something slept behind those peeling walls. <words>35</words>

Yesterday's chance encounter at the planetarium show changed everything. <words>44</words> A woman with a suspiciously sweet smile had pressed a key into his palm during the cosmic display. <words>62</words> "The stars align tomorrow," she'd whispered, her breath like cotton candy and cyanide. <words>75</words> "Across the hush of dawn's second breath, you'll know what to do." <words>87</words>

Now, as pink light crept through broken windows, Marcus turned the key. <words>99</words> The door groaned open, revealing mirrors draped in cobwebs and a single spotlight illuminating a cracked porcelain doll on a velvet cushion. <words>121</words> Its painted smile matched the woman's exactly. <words>128</words>

Marcus laughed—a sound both bitter and delighted. <words>135</words> Of course she'd been here all along, trapped in porcelain by the same curse that bound him to this vigil. <words>155</words> The doll's eyes, impossibly, blinked. <words>160</words>

"Ready to embrace a fate once denied?" the doll asked, voice tinkling like broken glass wrapped in silk. <words>178</words>

He'd run from the circus fire that night, abandoning his partner in her dressing room. <words>193</words> The universe had punished them both—her sealed in ceramic, him condemned to guard what he'd failed to save. <words>211</words> But the planetarium woman had been her future self, escaped through some cosmic loophole to deliver salvation's key. <words>229</words>

"Time to unleash what we really are," Marcus said, lifting the doll gently. <words>242</words> 

The porcelain cracked further, light spilling through fractures like trapped stars. <words>253</words> Marcus didn't flinch as the light burned his skin away, revealing his own ceramic shell beneath. <words>269</words> They'd both been dolls all along, playing at being human, denying their strange truth. <words>283</words>

As the dressing room filled with impossible light, two porcelain figures danced among the mirrors. <words>298</words> Their laughter echoed—crystalline and ancient—while dust motes swirled like tiny planets. <words>309</words> The abandoned circus had always been their home, their prison, their stage for confronting the unknown. <words>325</words>

By the time dawn's second breath faded, only glitter remained on the floorboards. <words>338</words> The door swung shut, lock clicking into place. <words>346</words> Somewhere in the cosmos, two stars winked into existence, finally free to burn as bright as they'd always feared they might. <words>368</words> The tortured protector had found peace not in guarding against the unknown, but in becoming it—suspiciously sweet smile and all. <words>389</words>

The planetarium would add two new constellations to its show, though no one would remember their names. <words>406</words>
