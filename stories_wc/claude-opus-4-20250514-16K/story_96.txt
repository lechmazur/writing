The underground poet volunteered at the witch's familiar menagerie not for love of creatures, but because unpaid labor in strange places kept her statically unique—unchangeable in her oddness, reliable in her unpredictability. <words>31</words> She crocheted blankets for the familiars with the same disinterested passion she brought to her verses: methodical, precise, utterly committed yet somehow distant. <words>54</words> 

Each stitch was a word unspoken, each row a line that would never grace the underground readings where she performed to crowds of twelve. <words>78</words> The witch paid in peculiar currencies—dried moonbeams, bottled sighs—but the poet came for neither payment nor purpose. <words>95</words> She simply appeared, Tuesdays and Thursdays, settling into the corner where a three-eyed raven watched her work. <words>112</words>

Today, the yarn snagged on something beneath the cushions. <words>121</words> An antique map, torn precisely through Madagascar, yellowed like old teeth. <words>132</words> The poet studied it with the same detachment she studied everything, noting the tear's trajectory, how it split the world unevenly. <words>154</words> 

"That's mine," the witch said, not looking up from grinding beetles. <words>165</words> "Was mine. <words>167</words> Yours now, if you want it." <words>173</words>

The poet's hands never paused their crocheting. <words>180</words> "Why?" <words>181</words>

"Your cup brims," the witch replied. <words>187</words> "All that carefully contained passion, that cultivated indifference—it spills over whether you acknowledge it or not. <words>203</words> The map knows where overflow goes." <words>209</words>

The poet considered this, needles clicking like typewriter keys composing invisible stanzas. <words>221</words> She had volunteered in morgues, libraries, abandoned theaters, each stint another verse in her life's strange poem. <words>239</words> But here, among the purring shadows and luminous eyes, something shifted. <words>250</words>

"I don't follow maps," she said. <words>256</words>

"No," the witch agreed. <words>260</words> "But you might seize one." <words>265</words>

The poet's fingers found the map's edge, traced the tear that divided known from unknown. <words>281</words> Her motivation had always been to surprise fate with an unplanned encore—to sidestep destiny by walking backwards through its choreography. <words>302</words> This torn map, discovered while creating warmth for creatures that served darkness, felt like another improvisation in her repertoire of accidental purposes. <words>326</words>

She folded it into her pocket without ceremony, resuming her crocheting. <words>337</words> The blanket grew, row by patient row, while around her the familiars stretched and yawned. <words>353</words> The poet understood then that her brimming cup had always been this: the overflow of caring disguised as apathy, the passion that wore indifference like a winter coat. <words>382</words> 

She would finish the blanket, leave it for whatever creature needed warmth, and walk out with the map pressed against her ribs—another volunteer stint complete, another small seizure of meaning from a world that offered too much or too little, never exactly enough. <words>427</words> The tear in the map matched the one in her carefully maintained facade, and perhaps that was the only geography that mattered. <words>449</words>
