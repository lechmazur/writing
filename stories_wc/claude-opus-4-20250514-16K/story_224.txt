The minstrel had lingered three days too long in the giant's dining room, his lute gathering dust while enormous platters clattered overhead. <words>22</words> Amid rush hour, when lesser beings scurried between the giant's table legs delivering steaming courses, he remained perfectly still in his corner, openly private in his contemplation. <words>49</words> Everyone could see him lost in thought, yet none could guess the depths of his yearning to escape a mundane existence of performing the same tired ballads. <words>77</words>

The giant's silence affirmed what the minstrel had always suspected—he was invisible, another decoration among the tapestries. <words>94</words> This wordless acknowledgment of his insignificance sparked gentle turmoil in his chest, a soft revolution brewing beneath his weathered doublet. <words>114</words>

During the evening feast, a kitchen witch dropped her gnarled wooden ladle near his feet. <words>129</words> As he bent to retrieve it, his fingers brushed something embedded in its handle—a fragment of meteorite, its surface rough with cosmic memory. <words>153</words> The texture spoke of distances beyond any minstrel's wandering, of transformations more profound than any song could capture. <words>171</words>

He pressed his palm against the meteorite's ancient ridges, feeling its otherworldly geography rejuvenate something long dormant within him. <words>190</words> The ladle hummed with possibility, and he understood why the witch had "accidentally" let it fall. <words>207</words> She too knew the burden of entertaining those who barely noticed your existence. <words>221</words>

The giant continued eating, mountainous jaw working mechanically, while hundreds of servants flowed around his ankles like troubled water. <words>240</words> The minstrel stood slowly, cradling the ladle as one might hold a compass pointing toward an unknown horizon. <words>258</words> His fingers traced the meteorite's pockmarked surface again and again, each pass awakening memories of who he'd been before the endless cycle of performance and applause. <words>285</words>

Without a word, he walked toward the dining room's towering doors. <words>296</words> The giant's continued silence—no thunderous command to stay and sing—was the only blessing he needed. <words>312</words> Other servants parted before him, recognizing something changed in his bearing, some cosmic dust now glittering in his eyes. <words>331</words>

He paused at the threshold, looking back at the cavernous space that had been his entire world for too long. <words>351</words> The witch emerged from behind a massive chair leg and nodded once, her knowing smile both farewell and beginning. <words>370</words> The minstrel tucked the ladle inside his cloak, its meteorite heart beating against his ribs like a second, wilder pulse. <words>390</words> Then he stepped into the corridor beyond, leaving behind the din of rush hour service for the quiet thunder of genuine transformation. <words>413</words>
