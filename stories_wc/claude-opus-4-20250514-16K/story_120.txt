Marcus clutched the weathered fishing lure, its rusted hooks catching fluorescent light as another quantum tunnel loop began. <words>18</words> The paramedic uniform hung loose on his frame—forty-seven iterations of saving the same cardiac arrest victim had carved hollows beneath his eyes. <words>39</words> Each loop was privately public; he performed CPR before crowds who would forget him when the bell echoed, marking that forgotten recess between life and death. <words>65</words> His unhealed traumas had learned to nest in the spaces between chest compressions, growing comfortable in repetition's embrace. <words>83</words> The victim—a child who'd swallowed water at the lake—always clutched this same lure when Marcus arrived. <words>100</words> Loop one: panic. <words>103</words> Loop twelve: desperation. <words>106</words> Loop thirty: excited boredom, that peculiar numbness of knowing every futile outcome while still hoping. <words>121</words> The quantum tunnel compressed time into a möbius strip where endings birthed beginnings, and Marcus existed everywhere and nowhere. <words>140</words> He'd tried everything—different medications, altered techniques, prayers whispered between compressions—but the child always died at 3:47 PM. <words>158</words> The lure had belonged to the boy's grandfather, who'd drowned in the same lake decades earlier. <words>174</words> Marcus discovered this in loop twenty-three, when the mother screamed about cursed water and inherited fate. <words>190</words> Now, in loop forty-eight, Marcus knelt beside the small body, pressing rhythmically while studying the lure's chipped paint. <words>208</words> A single raindrop struck the metal—impossible, since they were indoors—and suddenly Marcus understood. <words>222</words> The sound wasn't water but time itself, leaking through quantum fissures. <words>233</words> He'd been trying to save the wrong person. <words>241</words> The boy was already gone, had been gone since loop one, but Marcus's refusal to accept failure had trapped them both. <words>262</words> His own trauma—losing his daughter to drowning years ago—had created this purgatory. <words>275</words> The lure wasn't the boy's talisman but his own, from that terrible day when he'd been fishing instead of watching her. <words>296</words> Marcus stopped compressions, held the lure to his chest, and spoke to the quantum tunnel itself: "I accept." <words>314</words> The words felt like baptism, his nightmares finally given permission to exist without shame. <words>328</words> The loop shuddered, reality cracking like ice. <words>335</words> The boy gasped, coughing lake water across the sterile floor—not because Marcus had saved him, but because Marcus had finally saved himself. <words>357</words> The bell echoed one last time, not marking another loop but announcing recess's end. <words>371</words> Marcus helped the child sit up, handed him the weathered lure, and watched the quantum tunnel collapse into ordinary hospital corridor. <words>392</words> His excited boredom transformed into simple exhaustion—the honest fatigue of a paramedic who'd finally learned that some traumas heal not through repetition, but through release. <words>418</words> The raindrop's sound still echoed in his bones, a reminder that time's loops break only when we stop running from what we've already lost. <words>443</words> Marcus walked away, leaving his ghost behind in the dissolved tunnel, finally free to inhabit linear time where mistakes stay made and forgiveness grows possible. <words>469</words>
