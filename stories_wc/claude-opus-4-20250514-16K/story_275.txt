The hermit stood motionless in the ghostly orchard, watching the half-bent weathervane atop the abandoned farmhouse spin lazily against the burning comet's light. <words>24</words> For seventeen years, she had lived here alone, her existence theoretically rebellious—defying the evacuation orders that emptied the valley when the comet first appeared. <words>48</words> In her weathered hands, she clutched a pressed flower album, its pages filled with specimens from before the orchard died. <words>68</words> Each dried bloom represented a mindful choice: which species to preserve, which memories to keep, which ghosts to honor. <words>87</words>

The weathervane creaked to a stop at thirty-seven degrees northeast. <words>97</words> She opened the album to page thirty-seven, where a pressed apple blossom lay brittle and brown. <words>114</words> This was her method—to translate the weathervane's exact angles into pages, converting wind patterns into botanical knowledge. <words>131</words> The comet had scorched the earth, but she believed its tail carried seeds from distant worlds, seeds that needed precise conditions to germinate. <words>155</words>

Throughout her constant moving between the skeletal trees, she scattered soil mixtures, each blend corresponding to a weathervane reading. <words>174</words> The other settlers had called her mad before they fled, but madness and wisdom often wore the same tattered cloak. <words>194</words> Her rebellion wasn't political but biological—a refusal to accept that death was final, that barren ground couldn't be coaxed back to life. <words>217</words>

Page after page, angle after angle, she worked with deliberate wilderness in her methods. <words>231</words> The pressed flowers weren't just memories; they were blueprints, showing her which root systems had thrived here, which mycorrhizal networks had connected the trees. <words>255</words> When the weathervane pointed to fifteen degrees south, she knew to plant where the old cherry trees had stood. <words>274</words> At ninety degrees east, the soil needed ash from burned applewood, mixed with compost she'd made from comet dust. <words>293</words>

On this night, as the comet blazed overhead, something shifted. <words>303</words> The weathervane spun wildly, then stopped at an angle she'd never seen—pointing straight up. <words>317</words> She flipped through the album frantically until she found the page she'd never dared open: the one holding seeds, not flowers. <words>339</words> Ancient seeds her grandmother had pressed there, labeled simply "for when the sky burns." <words>353</words>

The hermit smiled, understanding at last. <words>359</words> The comet wasn't destroyer but messenger, and the weathervane had finally translated its true meaning. <words>374</words> She scattered the seeds throughout the ghostly orchard, each placement a mindful choice, each motion deliberate. <words>390</words> By dawn, as the comet faded, green shoots pushed through the barren ground, answering her seventeen-year rebellion with life. <words>409</words>
