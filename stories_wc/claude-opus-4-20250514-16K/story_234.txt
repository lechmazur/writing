Kenji had been forty-seven when he first touched a sword, making him the oldest student at the dojo. <words>16</words> Now, at sixty-two, the gentle swordsman stood among towering dinosaur skeletons, his katana reflecting moonlight through the museum's skylights. <words>35</words> He'd waited decades for this moment—when the orchard dog finally stops barking at night, as the old texts promised. <words>55</words>

The empty matchbox in his pocket pressed against his ribs. <words>65</words> Once it held the ashes of his master's final incense stick, but Kenji had scattered them across seven continents, feeding his hunger for foreign wisdom. <words>90</words> "Faithfully unfaithful," his master had called him with gruff fondness. <words>100</words> Loyal to the art, yet refusing its boundaries. <words>108</words>

The half-painted sundial stood beneath the Tyrannosaurus, its unfinished surface deliberate. <words>119</words> Kenji traced the coded angles with calloused fingers—instructions hidden in shadows that only late bloomers could read, those who'd lived enough to understand patience. <words>144</words> Each angle corresponded to a vertebra in the prehistoric spine above. <words>155</words>

"You're too soft for a swordsman," tourists often said. <words>164</words> They didn't understand that gentleness was his rebellion. <words>172</words> While others sought to cut the world, Kenji collected it—languages, customs, stories from strangers in night markets and border towns. <words>193</words> His xenophilia wasn't weakness but strength refined. <words>200</words>

The sundial's final angle pointed to the smallest bone, a delicate piece most visitors ignored. <words>215</words> Kenji climbed the maintenance ladder, his movements still fluid despite his years. <words>227</words> Behind the bone, exactly as promised, lay a crystal no larger than a child's marble. <words>242</words>

He descended carefully, cradling the sphere. <words>248</words> Inside swirled galaxies—actual galaxies, impossibly compressed. <words>255</words> The universe in a cupped hand, just as he'd dreamed. <words>265</words>

"Took you long enough," said the security guard, appearing from shadows. <words>276</words> Another late bloomer, another keeper of secrets. <words>283</words> "Most find it by thirty." <words>288</words>

"Good thing I'm not most," Kenji replied, his tone sharp but warm. <words>300</words> He'd learned that brusque affection was the language of those who'd waited too long for gentleness. <words>317</words>

The empty matchbox would hold the crystal perfectly. <words>325</words> Some vessels needed to be empty before they could contain infinity. <words>336</words> Kenji had spent fifteen years as a salaryman, twenty as a translator, before finding his true path. <words>353</words> Each delay had been necessary, each foreign shore a preparation. <words>363</words>

The dinosaurs watched with hollow eyes as two old men shared tea from a thermos, discussing how the universe feels when held gently. <words>387</words> Outside, dawn approached, and somewhere an orchard dog began its morning song. <words>399</words> But here, in the stillness between extinct giants and infinite possibility, time meant nothing to those who'd learned to wait. <words>419</words>
