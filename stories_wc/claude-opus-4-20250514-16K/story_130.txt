The apprentice found the fallen bird's nest wedged between hydroponic apple roots, three decks below where anyone bothered to look anymore. <words>18</words> She'd been lost for hours in the orchard ship's labyrinthine groves, but Mira wasn't really trying to find her way back. <words>39</words> The Starharvest had been drifting between galaxies for seven years now, and she'd learned that getting lost was sometimes the only way to be found. <words>65</words>

"Privately open," Master Chen had called her once, with that mocking affection she'd perfected over decades of shepherding wayward souls across the void. <words>89</words> Mira understood now—she bloomed in solitude but wilted under observation, a peculiar trait for someone supposedly learning the ancient art of stellar horticulture. <words>113</words>

The nest cradled something unexpected: an old cordless phone, its plastic yellowed like autumn leaves from Earth-that-was. <words>130</words> Static whispered through its speaker, punctuated by confessions from travelers long past—fragments of wisdom recorded and re-recorded across the promise of changing winds that swept between star systems. <words>158</words>

"Day 2,847," crackled a voice. <words>163</words> "I finally understand... the trees don't grow for us. <words>173</words> We grow for them." <words>177</words>

Mira pressed the phone to her ear, reverse-engineering meaning from these ghost-voices while synthetic birds sang overhead, oblivious to their fallen home. <words>200</words> Each confession revealed another traveler's truth: how they'd shed their old selves like snakeskin somewhere between Andromeda and here. <words>219</words>

"The gardens mirror us," whispered another recording. <words>226</words> "Lost apprentices, all of us, pretending we know which way the branches should grow." <words>241</words>

She laughed—a sound caught between bitter and sweet, like the genetically modified citrus that somehow thrived in artificial starlight. <words>260</words> Master Chen would appreciate the irony: Mira had spent months fleeing her training, only to discover the deepest lesson in a tangle of roots and abandoned technology. <words>288</words>

The static cleared momentarily, revealing her own voice from weeks ago—a confession she didn't remember making: "I'm terrified that accepting myself means accepting I'll always be alone." <words>316</words>

But here, cradling the nest like a broken promise, she felt the ship's vast loneliness transform into something else entirely. <words>336</words> Not isolation, but space—room to grow wild and strange, to branch in directions no manual prescribed. <words>352</words>

She tucked the phone back into the nest and climbed toward the artificial sunset, where Master Chen would be waiting with that knowing smirk. <words>376</words> The old woman would pretend to scold her for vanishing, but they both knew the truth now: some apprentices needed to lose themselves in the vast orchard between galaxies to discover they'd been free all along. <words>412</words>

The changing winds whispered through fabricated leaves, carrying the promise that tomorrow, she might finally stop running from herself. <words>431</words> After all, even failed nests had taught the birds to fly. <words>442</words>
