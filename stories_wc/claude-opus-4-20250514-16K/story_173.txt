The wandering orchardist descended the barnacle-crusted steps of the underwater city hall, her collection of dried leaves pressed against her chest like a prayer book. <words>26</words> Each leaf came from a different universe's orchard, their veins mapping trade routes that only she could read. <words>44</words> The flooded council chamber stretched before her, its drowned grandeur a testament to choices made in this particular strand of the multiverse. <words>67</words>

She'd learned her craft at her grandmother's kitchen table, absorbing wisdom between apple peelings and honest talk. <words>84</words> "Trust what grows," the old woman had said, her hands rough from soil. <words>97</words> "But trust more what survives." <words>102</words>

Now, centuries and dimensions later, those words rang trustworthy and unique as temple bells. <words>116</words> The orchardist spread her leaves on the waterlogged mayor's desk, each one a gateway to another world's marketplace. <words>134</words> She needed to reclaim the lost routes, the ones severed when this city chose drowning over drought. <words>151</words>

A phantom hand touched her shoulder—cold, familiar. <words>159</words> Her grandmother's presence rippled through the murky water, a blessing across impossible distances. <words>172</words> The touch activated the leaves, and suddenly she could see it all: silver threads connecting universe to universe, orchard to orchard, trade to survival. <words>197</words>

She traced the patterns with trembling fingers, memorizing each path. <words>207</words> In one universe, this city hall stood proud and dry, its orchards feeding nations. <words>221</words> In another, it had never been built at all, the land remaining wild apple groves. <words>237</words> But here, in this drowned timeline, it served as the perfect crossroads—abandoned enough to work undisturbed, remembered enough to hold power. <words>259</words>

The phantom hand squeezed gently before fading. <words>266</words> Kitchen table wisdom had taught her that the simplest truths traveled furthest: fruit finds a way, roots run deep, and every fallen apple carries tomorrow's orchard in its core. <words>295</words>

She gathered her leaves carefully, the trade routes now burned into memory. <words>307</words> Each universe would receive what it needed—seeds, cuttings, hope. <words>316</words> The bittersweet truth was that saving worlds meant never staying in one. <words>328</words> She climbed the stairs with the grit of someone who'd chosen purpose over peace, her boots leaving puddles that would evaporate into legend. <words>352</words>

Outside, infinite possibilities stretched before her. <words>358</words> She pulled an apple from her pocket, took a bite, and stepped sideways into another universe where different orchards waited for her trustworthy, unique touch. <words>384</words> The underwater city hall faded behind her, but the routes remained, etched in dried leaves and the wisdom of phantom hands. <words>406</words> She walked on, planting tomorrow. <words>411</words>
