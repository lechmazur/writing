Dr. Marlene Chen smiled warmly at the night nurse while her fingers traced the rusted ice skates she'd smuggled into the obsidian skyscraper's fortieth floor—the hospital's psychiatric ward. <words>27</words> "Just a family heirloom," she explained with practiced charm, though her real interest lay in the ancient symbols etched along the blades, barely visible beneath decades of oxidation. <words>55</words> The quiet shift before sunrise was perfect for her work; fewer witnesses to notice how she scattered seeds of doubt among the patients, each conversation carefully designed to weaken their grip on whatever reality they clung to. <words>91</words> She wasn't cruel—quite the opposite—but her pleasant demeanor masked an openly manipulative nature that she'd long ago accepted as necessary for her true purpose: decoding the cryptic language that appeared in her patients' delusions. <words>125</words> Tonight's subject, Marcus, had been drawing the same symbols she'd found on the skates, his fingers moving across the window's condensation as he stared at the city's sleeping lights below. <words>155</words> "Tell me about the beach," she suggested gently, knowing from his file that he'd never left the landlocked state, yet he spoke constantly of receding footprints in sand, of following a nighttime wanderer whose path dissolved with each tide. <words>194</words> Marcus turned, his eyes clear despite the medication, and began describing how the footprints weakened with each wave, how they led to a door that shouldn't exist, how the symbols above it matched the ones in his dreams. <words>233</words> Dr. Chen's pulse quickened as she compared his drawings to the skate's engravings—identical, impossible, undeniable. <words>247</words> "The seeds," Marcus whispered suddenly, "you've been planting them in all of us, haven't you?" <words>262</words> She maintained her smile, neither confirming nor denying, but inside she felt the familiar sensation of lucid confusion—that state where truth and madness danced together, where her manipulation served a purpose she didn't fully understand. <words>298</words> The skates had belonged to her grandmother, who'd died in this very ward fifty years ago, raving about doorways and wanderers and seeds of consciousness scattered across realities. <words>326</words> Now, as dawn approached and Marcus drew another symbol—one she'd never seen before—Dr. Chen wondered if she was the manipulator or the manipulated, the decoder or merely another seed scattered by forces beyond her comprehension. <words>361</words> The obsidian walls seemed to pulse with reflected light as Marcus smiled knowingly, and she realized with crystalline clarity that perhaps the pleasant meddler had always been him, guiding her here through decades of careful planning, using her own nature against her. <words>404</words> "The footprints led you here too," he said softly, and she clutched the rusted skates tighter, finally understanding that some doors open from both sides. <words>430</words>
