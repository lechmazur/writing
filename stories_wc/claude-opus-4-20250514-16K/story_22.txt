Margaret, the small-town librarian with perfectly flawed handwriting, discovered the stolen museum artifact tag wedged between volumes of forgotten lore. <words>21</words> Of course, she recognized it immediately—the tag from the Mesopotamian tablet that supposedly mapped the portal-strewn canyon where ancients practiced harvesting grace. <words>42</words> How delightfully predictable that it would surface in her humble library, as if destiny itself were winking at her through dusty shelves. <words>64</words>

Through generations of silent watchers, her family had guarded the secret: they alone knew how to dismantle the barriers between worlds. <words>85</words> Each watcher before her had failed to decode the final ritual, dying with baklava honey still sweet on their lips—for it was their shared love for this particular dessert that bound the bloodline to their eternal vigil. <words>122</words> Margaret savored the irony as she prepared her grandmother's recipe, knowing full well that every flaky layer represented another generation's spectacular failure. <words>144</words>

The canyon welcomed her like an old friend with sharp teeth. <words>155</words> Portal light danced across ancient carvings that seemed to mock her scholarly pretensions, as if the universe found her quest adorably naive. <words>177</words> She pressed the stolen tag against the central glyph, feeling the stone pulse with what could only be described as bemused anticipation. <words>199</words>

"Harvesting grace," she murmured, tasting the absurdity of the phrase. <words>209</words> The ancients had been collecting fragments of divine favor like baseball cards, hoarding them in this dimensional junction box. <words>228</words> How wonderfully human of them. <words>233</words>

As she began to dismantle the seal—each gesture precise despite her trembling hands—Margaret understood why her ancestors had failed. <words>252</words> They'd approached this moment with reverence, when what it required was the perfect balance of sincerity and self-mockery. <words>270</words> One must believe completely while simultaneously acknowledging the cosmic joke of it all. <words>283</words>

The portals erupted in kaleidoscopic fury, and through them poured the accumulated grace of millennia. <words>298</words> It tasted, inexplicably, of honey and pistachios. <words>305</words> Margaret laughed—a sound both triumphant and sardonic—as the power coursed through her imperfect form. <words>320</words>

She would indeed become a legend whispered through time, though not quite as she'd imagined. <words>335</words> Future generations would speak of the librarian who unlocked eternity with a stolen tag and a sweet tooth, who understood that the universe's greatest mysteries were best approached with a wink and a shrug. <words>369</words> They would call her the Harvester, the Perfectly Flawed, the one who dismantled heaven's gates while critiquing their architectural choices. <words>389</words>

And somewhere, in a small town that would never quite be the same, her library would wait—patient, dusty, and infinitely amused. <words>411</words>
