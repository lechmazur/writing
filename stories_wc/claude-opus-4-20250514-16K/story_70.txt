Elias, the castle's most rigid scribe, pressed his spectacles higher as he entered the witch's greenhouse, its vines strangling tombstones on the hillside below. <words>20</words> The prototype light bulb from Tesla's workshop trembled in his gloved hand, its copper filaments dormant but somehow still warm. <words>39</words> He'd stolen it from the archives, certainly uncertain whether this transgression would cost him everything he'd built. <words>56</words> 

The witch appeared between hanging roots, her fingers stained with grave-soil and lightning. <words>69</words> "You've brought it," she whispered, gesturing toward her workbench cluttered with opened letters. <words>82</words> Elias had spent years cataloging magical correspondence, never believing until he'd analyzed the leftover adhesive from a once-sealed envelope—Tesla's final letter to this very witch. <words>107</words> The adhesive contained microscopic runes that rewrote themselves, revealing instructions for what Tesla called "the empathy engine." <words>124</words>

"Place it here," the witch commanded, pointing to a glass dome surrounded by steel framework. <words>139</words> As Elias lowered the bulb into position, something shifted in his chest—a quiet transformation beginning. <words>154</words> The witch began to bellow an incantation that made the greenhouse windows rattle and the gravestones below seem to lean closer. <words>175</words> 

Light erupted—not harsh electricity, but something softer, warmer. <words>183</words> Through the glow, Elias saw them: ghostly figures rising from the graves, not as horrors but as people with stories untold. <words>204</words> His rigid posture crumbled as understanding flooded through him. <words>213</words> All those years transcribing death certificates, never seeing the lives behind the names. <words>226</words> 

"This is why Tesla sent it to me," the witch said gently. <words>238</words> "His greatest invention wasn't the bulb—it was discovering how to cradle empathy in arms of steel." <words>254</words> The metal framework around the bulb pulsed with each ghost's whispered story, capturing their essence. <words>269</words> 

Elias felt tears streak his face as he watched a child's spirit dance between the tombs. <words>285</words> In that moment when the puzzle piece finally fit, he understood: his meticulous nature wasn't a flaw to overcome but a gift to transform. <words>309</words> He could document these lost souls with the same precision he'd once reserved for dry legal texts, but now with heart. <words>330</words> 

The witch smiled, her ancient eyes reflecting the bulb's glow. <words>340</words> "Will you stay and be their scribe?" <words>347</words> 

Elias removed his gloves, feeling the greenhouse's warm earth beneath his fingers for the first time. <words>363</words> "Yes," he said, his voice breaking with buried optimism finally unearthed. <words>374</words> "Their stories deserve more than death certificates." <words>381</words> 

As dawn broke over the graveyard, the prototype bulb continued its gentle illumination, powered not by electricity but by the quiet transformation of one uptight scribe who'd learned that precision and compassion could share the same pen. <words>418</words>
