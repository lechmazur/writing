Marcus had sold fabricated bloodlines to desperate souls for fifteen years, but the witch's incantation chamber promised something different during his morning walks. <words>24</words> The atypically typical brownstone concealed its true nature behind mundane brick, revealing itself only to those who carried sufficient guilt. <words>44</words> He pushed open the heavy door, finding her hunched over a chipped bowl filled with swirling smoke. <words>61</words>

"Another genealogist seeking absolution?" she asked without looking up. <words>70</words> "Your kind always zoom through life, creating false histories, never considering the families you've fractured." <words>85</words>

Marcus nodded, though she couldn't see him. <words>92</words> "I've analyzed the subtext in funeral eulogies for years, mining grief for profitable lies." <words>107</words> The words tumbled out with brazen modesty, each confession both bold and diminished. <words>121</words> "I told the Hendersons their daughter descended from royalty, knowing she'd die believing that comfort." <words>137</words>

The witch finally turned, her eyes reflecting the bowl's ethereal light. <words>148</words> "You stand on the brink of renewal, but first you must understand what you've truly done." <words>165</words> She gestured to the chipped bowl, where images began forming in the smoke. <words>178</words>

Marcus watched his victims' faces materialize—people who'd discovered their purchased histories were fiction, relationships severed by his deceptions. <words>197</words> Each morning walk to this chamber revealed more damage, yet he returned, drawn by the possibility of redemption. <words>216</words>

"The eulogies tell truth through omission," the witch explained. <words>225</words> "When families speak of 'complicated histories' or 'surprising discoveries,' they mean your lies unraveled at death's door." <words>242</words>

The bowl's chip caught the light, reminding Marcus of his own fractures. <words>254</words> "How do I find a path to self-forgiveness?" <words>263</words>

"By reversing your work," she said simply. <words>271</words> "Spend your remaining years revealing true genealogies to those you've deceived." <words>283</words> She dipped her fingers in the bowl, and the smoke cleared. <words>295</words> "Each morning, you'll walk here and report your progress." <words>305</words>

Marcus understood the elegant justice—his expertise in falsification would now serve truth. <words>318</words> The atypically typical punishment fit perfectly: a black market genealogist becoming an honest researcher. <words>333</words>

As he left the chamber, the morning sun seemed different, sharper. <words>344</words> The chipped bowl had shown him that brokenness could still hold purpose. <words>357</words> His morning walks would continue, but now they led toward redemption rather than deeper into shadow. <words>374</words>

Three years later, Marcus still visited the witch weekly, each session peeling back another layer of his guilt. <words>392</words> The path to self-forgiveness stretched long, but he walked it steadily, one corrected family tree at a time. <words>411</words> His brazen modesty had evolved into genuine humility, understanding that some chips never fully mend, but can still hold something sacred. <words>433</words>
