The titanium walls of Section Seven gleamed like mercury dreams, but Advisory Officer Chen knew paradise had cracks. <words>16</words> In the hush of a simmering future, where thought-crimes bloomed before dawn, she clutched her clearance badge with trembling fingers. <words>36</words> The rumor had started three weeks ago: somewhere in the abandoned east wing, they kept a brain in a jar labeled "duplicate." <words>58</words> Her brain. <words>60</words>

Chen's footsteps echoed through empty corridors as she abandoned her post, chasing a rumor beyond all reason. <words>77</words> The headquarters hummed with its usual efficiency—agents phasing through quantum doors, holographic briefings flickering—yet she felt clearly ambiguous, neither fully present nor absent. <words>101</words> Was she the original Chen, or merely the consciousness they'd extracted? <words>112</words>

The dreamer's calling had always been her curse and gift. <words>122</words> While others infiltrated physical spaces, Chen slipped through sleeping minds, extracting secrets from REM cycles. <words>137</words> But lately, her own dreams felt borrowed, recycled, as if someone else had dreamed them first. <words>153</words>

She found the laboratory through the echo of footsteps in an abandoned place—not her own, but footsteps that matched her gait perfectly, reverberating from somewhere deeper. <words>180</words> The door unsealed at her touch, recognizing her biometrics with disturbing ease. <words>192</words>

Inside, suspended in synthetic fluid, floated a perfect replica of her cerebral cortex. <words>205</words> The label read: DUPLICATE – ADVISOR CHEN, ITERATION 3. <words>214</words>

Her hand moved involuntarily, delivering a sharp jab to the glass. <words>225</words> The container cracked, amber preservation fluid seeping through. <words>233</words> As the brain shuddered, Chen's vision fractured—she saw herself from two perspectives simultaneously, standing both inside and outside the room. <words>253</words>

"Every dreamer needs a backup," Director Voss materialized from the shadows, his smile razor-thin. <words>267</words> "You've died twice already in the field, Chen. <words>275</words> Your consciousness uploaded, downloaded, duplicated. <words>280</words> The question isn't whether you're real—it's whether it matters." <words>289</words>

Chen stared at the dying brain, understanding blooming like a toxic flower. <words>301</words> Her insecurity hadn't been paranoia but instinct, her subconscious recognizing what her conscious mind couldn't accept. <words>317</words> She was both original and copy, dreamer and dream, clearly ambiguous in her very existence. <words>333</words>

The abandoned wing's acoustics carried her bitter laugh through empty halls, multiplying it into a chorus. <words>349</words> In this fractured idyll of immortal agents and disposable minds, she'd discovered the price of perfection. <words>365</words> The headquarters continued its pristine operations above, while below, forgotten iterations of their best operatives floated in jars, waiting to be activated or discarded. <words>389</words>

Chen turned away, her footsteps echoing with new purpose. <words>398</words> If she was a copy, she'd make herself indispensable. <words>407</words> If she was the original, she'd ensure no more duplicates. <words>417</words> Either way, the dreamer's calling demanded she wake others to this beautiful, terrible truth. <words>431</words>
