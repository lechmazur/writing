The gravedigger Manuel pressed his vintage magnifying glass against the temple stone, examining hieroglyphs that shouldn't exist in this reimagined Aztec sanctuary-turned-cemetery. <words>24</words> His diligently whimsical nature meant he arranged corpses with mathematical precision while humming forgotten lullabies, preserving ritual practices that bridged ancient and modern death. <words>48</words> 

"I see them," he confessed suddenly to the wind. <words>57</words>

The hush that followed swallowed even the crows' complaints. <words>66</words> In that raucous silence—where unspoken truths screamed louder than any sound—the worlds began their inevitable overlap. <words>83</words> Through his magnifying glass, Manuel watched as ghostly priests materialized between the headstones, their obsidian blades catching moonlight that belonged to another era. <words>107</words>

He knew what must be done. <words>113</words> Moving toward the broken fence line that bordered the sacred grounds, Manuel positioned himself where past and present grew thinnest. <words>133</words> The wind came as it always did at midnight, threading through splintered wood with a hush that carried centuries. <words>153</words> 

This was how one kindrelized—sparked into being what already existed, just hidden. <words>165</words> The wind brought smoke from sacrificial fires that hadn't burned for five hundred years, mingling with fresh grave dirt under Manuel's fingernails. <words>188</words> His magnifying glass revealed the truth: every burial he'd performed had been witnessed by phantom priests, every shovelful of earth blessed by gods whose names he whispered while working. <words>218</words>

The overlapping worlds pulsed with contradictions—electric lights illuminating stone altars, cell phone towers rising beside pyramid shadows, his steel shovel ringing against earth that remembered obsidian. <words>243</words> Manuel's steady hands had always known this truth, even when his mind resisted. <words>257</words> He was not just a gravedigger but a keeper of thresholds, maintaining rituals that allowed the dead their proper passage through both worlds. <words>280</words>

The temple's reimagined form—part cemetery, part museum, part sacred space—suddenly made perfect sense. <words>294</words> It had never stopped being what it was; humanity had simply forgotten how to see. <words>310</words> Through the magnifying glass, Manuel watched his own hands become transparent, revealing the priest's hands beneath, the same hands that had always guided his work. <words>336</words>

The fence line sang its broken song as wind passed through, and Manuel smiled his whimsical smile. <words>353</words> Tomorrow, visitors would see only a peculiar gravedigger with an antique magnifying glass, meticulously tending graves. <words>369</words> They wouldn't notice how the shadows fell wrong, how the earth breathed with two rhythms, how carefully he preserved the rituals that kept both worlds properly aligned. <words>397</words> 

In the raucous silence of overlapping realities, Manuel returned to his work, steady as stone, light as wind. <words>415</words>
