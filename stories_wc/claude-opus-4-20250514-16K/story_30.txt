Captain Vera Blackwood rolled her telekinetic dice across the star-chart table, their carved faces flickering with impossible angles as she bent probability itself. <words>20</words> The space pirate navigation room hummed with whispered secrets—crew members exchanging coded warnings about her legendary ability to cheat fate. <words>38</words> 

"Double or nothing," she said, her philosophically practical nature calculating odds while accepting the universe's fundamental chaos. <words>55</words> Her opponent, the antiquities smuggler Korvash, pushed forward a fragment of medieval tapestry showing dragons breathing onto tiny trees. <words>74</words>

"You know what this is?" Korvash hissed. <words>81</words> 

Vera's fingers traced the woven symbols—a lost language her grandmother had taught her during childhood summers on the colony farms. <words>101</words> The dragons weren't destroying; they were creating, their flame nurturing seedlings in an ancient agricultural technique humanity had forgotten. <words>120</words>

"My family," Vera began, dice suspended mid-air, "maintained a tradition of planting a tree for each new member." <words>138</words> She remembered her grandmother's gnarled hands in the soil, whispering in that same dead tongue the tapestry bore. <words>157</words> "Not just trees—genetic archives, encoding farming methods in their very rings and roots." <words>171</words>

The navigation room's holographic stars cast sacred disorder across their faces as understanding dawned. <words>186</words> This fragment wasn't just art; it was a key to feeding billions on barren worlds. <words>202</words> The dragons' flame represented solar collectors, their positions mapping irrigation patterns lost when Earth's languages died. <words>219</words>

"My grandmother was the last speaker," Vera admitted. <words>228</words> "She encoded everything in our grove before the corporate fleets burned our world." <words>242</words>

Korvash leaned back. <words>245</words> "Then you can translate this?" <words>250</words>

"For the right price." <words>254</words> The dice spun faster, creating a small cyclone above the table. <words>265</words> "But not credits—seeds." <words>268</words> Her philosophically practical side had already calculated the exchange: ancient knowledge for future harvests. <words>282</words>

"Seeds?" <words>283</words> 

"From every world you've plundered." <words>288</words> She smiled, remembering her grandmother's words: chaos and order dance together in every garden. <words>303</words> "I'll translate your tapestry, preserve these farming methods for the colonies." <words>315</words> The dice clattered down—all sixes, naturally. <words>321</words> "But you'll help me plant a new grove, one tree for each species we save." <words>337</words>

Around them, the crew's whispered secrets grew louder, spreading news of the gambler who'd won the future with loaded dice and lost words. <words>362</words> Korvash extended his hand across the star charts, sealing a deal that would transform barren moons into gardens. <words>381</words>

Vera pocketed her dice and the tapestry fragment, already composing the letters she'd write in her grandmother's tongue—love songs to seeds and soil, preserved in the sacred disorder of growth itself. <words>413</words>
