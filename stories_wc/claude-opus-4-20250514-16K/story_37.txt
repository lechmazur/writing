Marina smoothed the crumpled sheet music against her knee, its yellowed edges trembling in the antiseptic breeze of the doctor's waiting room. <words>21</words> The silence here pressed against her ears, nothing like the cacophony of parrots and howler monkeys that had become her morning alarm in the rainforest canopy village. <words>48</words> She'd arrived there three years ago by accident—a construction zone had forced her rental car onto a jungle road that dead-ended at rope bridges swaying between mahogany giants. <words>76</words> 

The sheet music bore a simple melody, one she'd forged herself during her con artist days when she'd convinced wealthy tourists she was a Swiss opera singer stranded in the Amazon. <words>107</words> "I cannot lie," she would tell them, which was itself a lie, her dishonestly honest trademark that somehow made every fabrication more believable. <words>130</words> But the village elder, Tomás, had seen through her immediately when she'd tried her routine there, desperate for shelter. <words>149</words>

"Sing," he'd commanded, pointing to the treetop stage where children performed for rain ceremonies. <words>163</words> Marina had panicked, attempted an operatic scale, then—absurdly—broke into a yodel that echoed through the canopy like a wounded bird. <words>183</words> The children had laughed until their sides hurt, and something in Marina's chest had cracked open. <words>199</words>

That was the first revelation: she couldn't actually sing, but she could make children laugh. <words>214</words> The second came weeks later when Tomás asked her to teach the village children "the music of the outside world." <words>234</words> She'd almost confessed her fraud then, but instead began composing simple melodies, teaching them honestly for the first time in her life. <words>257</words>

The third revelation arrived during the dry season when developers came, offering millions for the village's land. <words>274</words> Marina recognized her old self in their slick promises and forged documents. <words>286</words> She'd yodeled a warning—their secret signal now—and helped the village secure legal protection for their forest home. <words>303</words>

"Marina Cloudbridge?" the nurse called, using the name the village children had given her. <words>317</words> She folded the sheet music carefully, this evidence of her transformation from deceiver to protector. <words>333</words> The doctor would confirm what she already knew—the growth was benign, she would live to continue her work. <words>351</words> She stood, thinking of the music school she was building in the canopy, where children would learn both traditional songs and her strange yodeling hymns. <words>376</words>

Tomorrow's flame wasn't some mystical concept—it was those children's voices, their laughter, their future she now guarded with the fierce devotion of someone who'd spent half a lifetime extinguishing lights. <words>407</words> The crumpled sheet music in her pocket was her reminder: even the most elaborate deceptions could become foundations for truth, if you were brave enough to sing your real song, however ridiculous it sounded. <words>441</words>
