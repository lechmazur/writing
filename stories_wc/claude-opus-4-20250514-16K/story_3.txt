The surly watchman of Mariner's Rest had kept vigil among the weathered headstones for thirty winters, but tonight felt different. <words>20</words> Between autumn's death and winter's birth, when the veil grew thin, old Grissom pulled a short piece of yarn from his pocket. <words>42</words> His grandmother had taught him this craft—the reading of market winds through string—claiming that trade routes mirrored the stars themselves. <words>63</words>

He twisted the crimson thread with serenely frantic fingers, each loop a calculation of supply and demand, each knot a celestial conjunction. <words>86</words> The sailors buried here had understood: cargo manifests were cosmic riddles written in hemp and tar. <words>102</words> Their granite markers leaned like masts in the fog, each inscription a ledger of voyages that mapped both earthly ports and heavenly harbors. <words>126</words>

"Tell me," Grissom muttered to the graves, his voice carrying the dignified chaos of a man addressing parliament and madness simultaneously. <words>148</words> "If wool rises with Venus and silk falls with Saturn, what thread binds profit to prophecy?" <words>165</words>

The yarn danced between his calloused hands, forming patterns his grandmother called "the merchant's constellation." <words>181</words> She'd learned it from her grandmother, who'd learned it from hers—women who read fortunes in inventory, futures in fabric. <words>201</words> They knew that every marketplace was a microcosm, every transaction a planetary dance. <words>215</words>

A gull cried overhead, and Grissom's fingers paused. <words>223</words> In the yarn's configuration, he saw it: the answer to the riddle that had haunted these grounds since the first sailor was laid to rest. <words>249</words> Markets rose and fell like tides because they were tides—pulled by the same lunar logic that drew ships to rocks and souls to shores. <words>274</words>

He held the string up to the between-season sky, where neither summer's gold nor winter's silver reigned. <words>291</words> Through its frame, the stars aligned with the headstones, creating a chart no navigator had ever drawn. <words>309</words> This was the cosmic pattern he'd sought: the dead sailors hadn't just carried goods across oceans, they'd been threading humanity itself through the universe's vast loom. <words>337</words>

The watchman smiled grimly, pocketing the yarn. <words>344</words> Tomorrow, when merchants came seeking advice about their investments, he'd speak in riddles as his grandmother had. <words>361</words> They'd think him mad, this surly keeper of graves, never knowing he guarded the greatest trade secret of all: that every market crash and boom was written in the stars, and the wise could read it in a simple piece of string. <words>404</words> The sailors knew. <words>407</words> They'd always known. <words>410</words> That's why they rested here so peacefully, their eternal cargo delivered at last. <words>424</words>
