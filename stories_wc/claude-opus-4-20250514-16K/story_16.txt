The engine room hummed its metallic lullaby as Marlow adjusted another brass valve, the airship's pistons beating with the rhythm of waves against a cliff. <words>20</words> As a freelancer who took any job—translator, cook, mechanic, whatever paid—she'd been hired to maintain the wedding vessel during its voyage. <words>42</words> Now, in the hush after the final guest had disembarked at dawn, she remained below, ostensibly checking gauges but truly pursuing her real commission: chronicling the elder captain's wisdom before his retirement. <words>74</words>

Captain Thorne descended the iron stairs, his amber ring catching the boiler's glow. <words>88</words> "Still here, Marlow?" <words>91</words> His voice carried the scattered harmony of age—notes missing, others doubled, yet somehow more beautiful for its imperfection. <words>110</words>

"The compressor needs attention," she lied, knowing he'd come to retrieve the ring—his late wife's heirloom, which the bride had worn for tradition. <words>134</words> But Marlow needed more time; the captain's stories were slipping away like steam through cracks. <words>150</words>

"You know," Thorne said, settling onto a toolbox, "my Elena believed every person carries one last good intention—something pure they mean to do but never quite manage." <words>178</words> He twisted the amber ring absently. <words>184</words> "Mine was to write down everything she taught me about reading the sky's moods." <words>199</words>

Marlow's pencil moved across her hidden notebook as she pretended to inspect a pressure gauge. <words>215</words> This was how she had to outwit him—through misdirection, capturing his memories while he thought her merely working. <words>234</words>

"Funny thing about good intentions," he continued, inadvertently profound in his rambling. <words>247</words> "They're like this engine's rhythm—constant, necessary, but we stop hearing them until something breaks." <words>262</words>

The pistons churned their ancient beat as Marlow scribbled furiously. <words>272</words> She'd taken this job precisely for moments like these, collecting the wisdom of skyfarers before their words dissolved into silence. <words>293</words> Each story she preserved was another good intention fulfilled—not hers, but theirs. <words>306</words>

"The ring," Thorne said suddenly. <words>311</words> "I promised to return it to the bridge." <words>319</words> He stood, then paused. <words>323</words> "You're not really fixing that compressor, are you?" <words>331</words>

Marlow looked up, caught. <words>335</words> But Thorne smiled, tapping his temple. <words>341</words> "Elena taught me to recognize a chronicler's hunger." <words>349</words> He settled back down. <words>353</words> "Ask your questions properly, then." <words>358</words> He held up the amber ring, its golden depths swirling with captured sunlight. <words>371</words> "This ring has heard sixty years of sky wisdom." <words>380</words> His eyes crinkled. <words>383</words> "Time someone wrote it down before my last good intention becomes just another ghost in these pipes." <words>400</words>

The engine room filled with scattered harmony—steam hissing, metal groaning, and an old man's voice weaving memory into permanence. <words>420</words> Marlow pulled out her notebook openly now, ready to catch every word before they escaped like exhaled breath into the morning sky. <words>443</words>
