The seasoned woodsman's hands trembled as he clutched the antique hairbrush, its bristles artfully messy from decades of use mapping electromagnetic fields along abandoned railways. <words>25</words> He stood in the radio wave garden, where invisible frequencies bloomed like phantom flowers around rusted antenna sculptures. <words>42</words> The hospital monitor's final beep echoed through his earpiece—his daughter's last breath transmitted across miles of desolate track. <words>60</words>

He'd lied to her for years about this work. <words>69</words> Told her he was surveying forests, not chasing ghost trains through electromagnetic wastelands where old rail lines intersected with experimental transmitter stations. <words>90</words> The hairbrush had been her grandmother's, its silver handle etched with coordinates he'd discovered could short-circuit the garden's field harmonics. <words>110</words>

"I measure echoes in water towers," he whispered into the static, knowing she couldn't hear anymore. <words>126</words> "Each abandoned tower along the railways holds a frequency signature." <words>136</words> His voice cracked with despairing cheer—the same forced optimism he'd used when promising to visit her hospital room tomorrow. <words>155</words>

The truth was simpler and stranger. <words>161</words> These forgotten places where trains once thundered now pulsed with orphaned radio waves, creating gardens of pure signal that only his modified instruments could detect. <words>186</words> The hairbrush, when properly grounded, became an antenna sensitive enough to map the invisible infrastructure. <words>201</words>

He climbed the nearest water tower, its ladder rungs singing with electromagnetic interference. <words>214</words> Inside the tank, he struck the metal wall and counted—three seconds until the echo returned, warped by the radio garden's influence. <words>235</words> The measurement confirmed what he'd suspected: this junction connected seventeen different abandoned lines, a neural network of dead steel still crackling with purpose. <words>258</words>

"I'm sorry I never told you," he broadcast into the frequencies, tears mixing with his weathered smile. <words>275</words> "I thought protecting you from the strangeness meant lying about the beauty." <words>287</words>

The hairbrush suddenly channeled a massive surge, short-circuiting the entire garden in a cascade of visible static. <words>304</words> For one impossible moment, every abandoned railway in the country lit up on his equipment, a constellation of forgotten paths. <words>324</words> His daughter's voice emerged from the chaos—not words, but a presence woven through the frequencies. <words>339</words>

She'd known all along. <words>343</words> Hidden in her hospital room, she'd built her own radio garden from medical equipment, mapping the same railways from her bed. <words>364</words> Her final beep hadn't been an ending but a transmission, her consciousness uploaded into the very network he'd spent his life documenting. <words>386</words>

The woodsman laughed through his tears, understanding at last that honesty hadn't freed him—it had freed her. <words>402</words> She was the ghost train now, forever traveling the electromagnetic railways they'd both secretly loved. <words>417</words>
