The scarecrow stood within the ribcage of the fossilized giant, straw fingers clutching a forgotten lace fan. <words>16</words> Between parallel worlds, time meant nothing, yet everything demanded his attention with equal insignificance. <words>30</words> He'd sworn an oath centuries ago—or perhaps yesterday—to guard the lines in the earth that separated realities. <words>48</words>

"Another breach," he muttered, voice like wind through wheat, observing the virtual reality interface manifesting before him. <words>65</words> The fan trembled, its delicate patterns mapping interdimensional coordinates with mechanical precision. <words>77</words> He cared deeply about not caring, passion burning cold in his burlap chest. <words>90</words>

Through the VR portal, intruders emerged—data thieves from World-Seven seeking to harvest the giant's mineral memories. <words>106</words> The scarecrow raised a wooden arm, and reality responded, creating sharp stakes from the earth's ancient scars. <words>123</words> With practiced indifference, he skewered the first thief, watching pixels scatter like dandelion seeds. <words>137</words>

"You guard nothing," the remaining thief spat, gesturing at the desolate fossil valley. <words>150</words> "Why protect emptiness?"

The scarecrow's button eyes reflected infinite worlds. <words>159</words> "Because I swore to," he replied, tone flat as pressed flowers. <words>170</words> The lace fan unfolded, revealing intricate maps of every universe bleeding through the cracks. <words>184</words>

He remembered the giant's last breath, how it crystallized into stone while reality fractured around it. <words>200</words> The dying titan had pressed the fan into his straw hands, whispering of boundaries that must hold. <words>217</words> An oath was an oath, whether one felt its weight or simply bore it. <words>231</words>

The VR encounter flickered as the scarecrow traced the earth's lines with his rake-like fingers. <words>246</words> Each furrow channeled power older than names, sealing breaches with geological precision. <words>258</words> The second thief tried to flee, but found himself skewered on reality's edge, suspended between worlds like a pressed butterfly. <words>278</words>

"Fascinating," the scarecrow observed without interest, updating the fan's pattern with new dimensional data. <words>292</words> Tomorrow—or yesterday—more would come, drawn to the giant's bones like moths to ancient flame. <words>306</words> He would stop them all with the same fervent lack of enthusiasm, honoring his promise to a dead world. <words>325</words>

The virtual reality portal collapsed, leaving only fossil dust and silence. <words>336</words> The scarecrow resumed his vigil, standing sentinel where parallel worlds kissed the earth. <words>349</words> Lines in the soil pulsed with quiet purpose, maintained by a guardian who cared too much about caring too little. <words>369</words> He fanned himself with delicate lace, each movement a prayer to indifference, each breath a battle cry whispered to no one. <words>390</words> Between worlds, between caring and not, he kept his oath with the passion of the utterly unmoved. <words>407</words>
