Marcus had perfected the art of being energetically lethargic, moving through the reclaimed orchard with calculated slowness that masked his true intentions. <words>18</words> The toppled skyscraper, now a vertical farm where apple trees grew through shattered windows, housed more secrets than fruit. <words>36</words> He fingered the blank price tag in his pocket—his signature calling card as the Settlement's most notorious bluffing swindler. <words>56</words>

His invisible allies whispered through the leaves, wind patterns only he could interpret after years of con games. <words>74</words> They warned him: today's mark was different. <words>81</words> Today, he would finally bare the truth no one dared to handle. <words>93</words>

At the instant his frozen computer finally restarted, its ancient screen flickering to life among the moss-covered debris, Marcus dropped his book. <words>116</words> The thud magnetized her attention—Vera, the Settlement's data keeper, who bent to retrieve it. <words>131</words> Their fingers brushed, and she saw through his façade immediately. <words>142</words>

"Agricultural Mutations: A History," she read, her voice carrying gentle harshness. <words>153</words> "Strange reading for a swindler." <words>158</words>

Marcus straightened, abandoning pretense. <words>162</words> "Strange times when the truth becomes the ultimate con." <words>171</words>

She studied him, understanding dawning. <words>176</words> The blank price tags he left at every swindle weren't taunts—they were messages. <words>190</words> Each one marked a location where the Settlement's leaders had buried evidence of the catastrophe they'd caused. <words>207</words>

"You're not stealing," Vera whispered. <words>212</words> "You're documenting." <words>214</words>

Marcus nodded, his perpetual exhaustion suddenly making sense. <words>222</words> Playing the fool while gathering proof had drained him, but his invisible allies—the survivors hiding in the vertical gardens—depended on his performance. <words>245</words>

The computer screen displayed coordinates. <words>250</words> Together, they climbed through the tilted floors where pear trees grew sideways and tomatoes cascaded like curtains. <words>267</words> At each blank price tag location, they excavated small truths: contaminated soil reports, covered-up radiation readings, silenced whistleblowers' testimonies. <words>287</words>

"Why now?" Vera asked, her hands dirty with both earth and revelation. <words>299</words>

"Because the trees are finally bearing fruit," Marcus replied, plucking an apple that shouldn't exist—mutated, beautiful, honest. <words>316</words> "Nature exposed their lies simply by surviving." <words>323</words>

His invisible allies emerged from their hiding spots among the branches—scarred, changed, but alive. <words>338</words> The Settlement's greatest swindler had pulled his final con: making people believe he was the criminal while the real criminals wore respectability like armor. <words>363</words>

Vera held up a blank price tag, understanding its power. <words>373</words> "The price of truth?" <words>377</words>

"Priceless," Marcus said, his energetic lethargy finally lifting. <words>385</words> "That's why we leave them blank." <words>391</words>

Together, they began broadcasting the evidence, their gentle harshness echoing through the vertical orchards, magnetizing the attention of those ready to finally listen. <words>415</words>
