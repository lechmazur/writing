High in the gnarled forest village of Thornweave, where crooked houses clung to twisted branches like wooden barnacles, the soothsayer Mirin bent over her blacksmith's hammer. <words>28</words> She was pragmatic about prophecy—visions were tools, nothing more—yet lavishly humble in her workshop, bowing to each client as if they were royalty visiting her treetop forge. <words>56</words> The hammer had belonged to her grandmother, who'd discovered that miracles could be manufactured like horseshoes, if one knew the proper technique. <words>78</words>

Across the hush of memory's corridors, Mirin had spent decades learning the craft. <words>91</words> Each manufactured miracle required precision: heat the metal of possibility until it glowed, then shape it with hammer-strikes timed to the echo of a long-forgotten song. <words>118</words> The melody drifted up from the forest floor, where ancient roots remembered melodies that predated human speech. <words>135</words>

"Another harvest blessing?" asked her apprentice, watching Mirin work. <words>144</words>

"A storm," Mirin corrected, her voice carrying that peculiar quality of dreadful hope—the sound of someone who'd seen too much future to be optimistic, yet refused to surrender to despair. <words>175</words> "The village needs rain, but rain brings rot to our wooden bridges." <words>187</words>

She struck the glowing metal, each blow perfectly synchronized with the ghostly song only she could hear. <words>204</words> This was her true motivation, hidden beneath decades of humble service: to manufacture so many miracles that she'd transcend mere flesh and become a force of nature herself. <words>232</words> Already, bark grew along her forearms where she'd touched too much raw possibility. <words>246</words> Her eyes reflected seasons that hadn't yet turned. <words>254</words>

The apprentice shivered, recognizing the danger. <words>260</words> "Master, the old stories warn—"

"The old stories didn't know what I know," Mirin interrupted, her hammer ringing against metal and memory alike. <words>279</words> "They thought miracles were gifts from gods or nature." <words>288</words> Another strike, another echo. <words>292</words> "But I've learned the truth: gods were just the first soothsayers who successfully became the storms they summoned." <words>310</words>

The metal cooled into the shape of a cloud, dense with promise and threat. <words>324</words> Outside, the first drops began to fall on Thornweave's ancient branches. <words>336</words> Mirin smiled, feeling her bones beginning their slow transformation into lightning. <words>348</words> She had perhaps a dozen more miracles to forge before the metamorphosis completed. <words>361</words>

Her apprentice understood now why she bowed so deeply to each client. <words>373</words> Every manufactured miracle was both a service and a farewell, each hammer-blow bringing her closer to the inhuman perfection she craved. <words>394</words> The echo of that long-forgotten song grew louder, calling her home to a time before names, when the world was nothing but force and fury and endless becoming. <words>423</words>

She raised the hammer again, pragmatic even in her transcendence. <words>433</words> The storm was just the beginning. <words>439</words>
