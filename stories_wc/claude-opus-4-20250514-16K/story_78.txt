Elena had never considered herself special until the world ended. <words>11</words> Now, at sixty-seven, she commanded the rooftop farm with a softly militant grace that made younger survivors defer to her weathered hands. <words>32</words> The gravity of loss hung over everything—each tomato plant a memorial, each corn stalk a monument to the billions who would never taste fresh vegetables again. <words>59</words>

She raised the mariner's spyglass, its brass tarnished but lens still true. <words>71</words> Through it, she could see the abandoned city below, where nature had begun to reclaim concrete with a patience that filled her with reluctant awe. <words>96</words> The spyglass had been her grandfather's, discovered while scouring dusty attics for seeds in those first desperate months. <words>114</words> Now it served a different purpose. <words>120</words>

"You must come," Elena said to Marcus, the holdout who refused to join their community. <words>136</words> She didn't shout or threaten—her coercion was gentler, persistent as rain. <words>148</words> "I've seen what you're growing in that tower. <words>157</words> We need your knowledge." <words>161</words>

Marcus stood at the roof's edge, his face gaunt. <words>170</words> "Why should I help rebuild what was meant to fall?" <words>181</words>

Elena studied him through the spyglass, though he stood mere feet away. <words>193</words> The lens revealed more than distance—it showed the tremor in his hands, the first tear gathering in his eye. <words>212</words> She understood his resistance; she too had spent months dissecting the architecture of cosmic balance, trying to comprehend why humanity had been pruned so severely. <words>237</words>

"Because," she said, lowering the instrument, "the universe doesn't explain its designs. <words>249</words> We can only tend what remains." <words>255</words>

The rooftop farm sprawled behind her—potato mounds, bean trellises, makeshift greenhouses cobbled from scavenged windows. <words>270</words> Each plant grew from soil she'd hauled up twenty flights of stairs, bucket by bucket, her body discovering strength it had never possessed in the old world. <words>298</words>

Marcus's shoulders sagged, the fight leaving him in a long, final sigh. <words>310</words> "I have heirloom seeds," he admitted. <words>316</words> "Varieties I saved from my grandmother's collection." <words>323</words>

Elena nodded, unsurprised. <words>326</words> She'd suspected as much from the green glimpsed through his windows. <words>337</words> "Then you understand why we must preserve what we can." <words>347</words>

He followed her across the rooftop, past rows of carefully tended life. <words>359</words> The spyglass swung from her belt, a reminder that sometimes the most important discoveries come from looking closely at what seems lost. <words>381</words> Together, they would coax abundance from absence, finding in their late-blooming partnership a defiant answer to loss. <words>398</words> The world had ended, but here, between sorrow and hope, something essential endured. <words>411</words>
