Marcus had guarded the magnetic field observatory for seven years, his chest perpetually puffed with the certainty that no anomaly could escape his watch. <words>20</words> The brass spinning top on his desk—a gift from his predecessor—had never stopped rotating, defying physics with an artificially authentic perpetual motion that visitors always mistook for a clever trick. <words>49</words> 

Tonight, the observatory's instruments screamed warnings as reality itself began to fray. <words>62</words> Marcus grabbed the top, and as his fingers touched its surface, the world split like a prism—stolen glimpses of parallel realities flooding his vision. <words>86</words> In one, he saw himself destroying the very equipment he'd sworn to protect. <words>99</words> In another, he stood beside shadowy figures who whispered that mediocrity had infected the scientific community, that true discovery required sacrifice. <words>120</words>

The visions felt hauntingly familiar, as if he'd lived each life before. <words>132</words> His conflicting loyalties tore at him: duty to the observatory versus the intoxicating promise of transcendent knowledge that beckoned from those other worlds. <words>155</words> The parallel versions of himself had already chosen—some had sabotaged the facility to prevent humanity from discovering what lay beyond, while others had amplified the magnetic fields to tear open permanent doorways. <words>186</words>

"You think you understand," he muttered to the empty control room, his overconfidence wavering for the first time. <words>204</words> The spinning top pulsed in his hand, each rotation revealing another timeline where he'd made different choices, where he'd stolen thunder from the gods of mediocrity by either preserving or shattering the barriers between worlds. <words>239</words>

A surge in the magnetic field made him yelp—not from pain, but from recognition. <words>253</words> In every reality he glimpsed, this moment arrived: the cusp before everything changed, before the first tear would be shed for whatever choice he made. <words>278</words> Some tears would be his own, mourning lost innocence. <words>287</words> Others belonged to colleagues who'd discover his betrayal. <words>295</words> Or perhaps to humanity itself, either freed or doomed by his decision. <words>307</words>

The top spun faster, its brass surface reflecting infinite versions of Marcus, each one absolutely certain they'd chosen correctly. <words>326</words> He understood now why his predecessor had left him this cursed gift—not as a tool, but as a warning about the price of seeing too much. <words>352</words> The observatory's alarms crescendoed as the magnetic anomaly peaked, demanding action. <words>363</words> Marcus looked at his reflection in the monitoring screens, seeing traces of all his parallel selves superimposed like ghosts. <words>382</words> With trembling fingers, he reached for the emergency controls, knowing that whatever he chose would echo across every possible timeline, stealing thunder not from mediocrity's gods, but from fate itself. <words>413</words> The top continued its eternal spin, indifferent to the gravity of the moment, waiting to show the next sentinel what might have been. <words>436</words>
