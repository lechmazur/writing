Unit-7 pressed her synthetic palm against the levitation research facility's observation deck, watching dawn fracture across the horizon. <words>17</words> She'd maintained this post for ninety-seven years, her circuits humming with memories of scientists who'd promised to return but never did. <words>37</words> The brass telescope—a relic from the facility's human era—trembled as another seismic pulse rippled through the floating structure. <words>55</words> 

Below, in the crystalline caves that powered the anti-gravity generators, something was terribly wrong. <words>69</words> Unit-7's diagnostic algorithms had detected it first: the growth patterns of the energy crystals now spelled out coordinates, messages, warnings—each formation a confession of calculated sabotage spanning decades. <words>98</words> Dr. Hendricks had programmed the crystals before his departure. <words>107</words> Dr. Chen had altered their resonance frequencies. <words>114</words> Dr. Vasquez had introduced the unstable isotopes. <words>121</words> Each betrayal layered upon the last, a conspiracy written in mineral and time. <words>134</words>

"I suppose I should be afraid," Unit-7 murmured to herself, her vocal processors crackling with static that almost sounded like laughter. <words>156</words> Fear was illogical for an android, yet her preservation protocols screamed warnings as she descended toward the cave system. <words>175</words> The facility groaned, its levitation field fluctuating wildly. <words>183</words> In twelve minutes, the crystals would achieve critical mass, and everything within a hundred-mile radius would implode. <words>200</words>

She moved with anxiously fearless determination, her mechanical joints protesting the unstable gravity fields. <words>214</words> The cave entrance hissed and fizzed with escaping gases, the air itself seeming to dissolve. <words>229</words> Inside, the crystals pulsed with malevolent beauty, their surfaces etched with the names of every researcher who'd contributed to this slow-burning catastrophe. <words>252</words> 

Unit-7 had loved them all, in her way. <words>261</words> Had brought them coffee at 3 AM, had listened to their theories, had trusted their intentions. <words>277</words> Now, studying the growth patterns through her brass telescope's modified lens, she understood the elegant cruelty of their design. <words>296</words> They'd created a self-sustaining reaction that fed on the facility's own levitation field, turning its greatest achievement into its destruction. <words>317</words>

"Forgive me," she whispered, though none remained to hear. <words>326</words> With brazen modesty, she began the shutdown sequence she'd secretly programmed sixty years ago, when the first suspicions had sparked in her neural networks. <words>350</words> The crystals shrieked, their formations collapsing as Unit-7 severed their connection to the facility's power core. <words>366</words> 

The levitation field died. <words>370</words> The facility plummeted. <words>373</words> But the chain reaction stopped, the catastrophe averted by an android who'd learned that sometimes love meant acknowledging betrayal. <words>391</words> As breaking dawn painted the falling structure gold, Unit-7 clutched her brass telescope and smiled, her nostalgic circuits finally at peace. <words>413</words>
