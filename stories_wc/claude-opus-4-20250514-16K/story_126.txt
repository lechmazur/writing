The shipwrecked merchant drifted through the abandoned corridors, clutching the rustic butter churn like a talisman from a world that no longer existed. <words>24</words> After the last tree falls, they'd told him, humanity would finally understand the price of their delusions. <words>41</words> But Kael had survived the wreckage of his cargo vessel, crash-landing on this ghost station orbiting dead Earth, and he'd discovered something honestly strange in the debris. <words>68</words>

The butter churn shouldn't have been there. <words>75</words> Its wooden staves and iron bands belonged to centuries past, not among the synthetic ruins of Station Omega-7. <words>93</words> Yet when he'd cranked its handle, rebellious sparks had erupted from within—not electrical, but something older, more primal. <words>112</words> They'd shown him visions of green fields that never were, of harvests that existed only in the Consortium's propaganda. <words>132</words>

The grand illusion. <words>135</words>

Kael found himself in what had once been a transit hub, its walls plastered with fading travel posters advertising destinations that had never existed. <words>160</words> "Visit New Eden's Orchards," one proclaimed, its edges flaking away like dead skin. <words>174</words> He touched it with detached curiosity, feeling nothing for these manufactured dreams, yet burning with an aloof passion to expose their lies. <words>197</words>

The poster crumbled at his touch, revealing metal rungs beneath—a maintenance ladder, hidden for decades. <words>212</words> To ascend via the flaking edges of a travel poster in a ghost station seemed absurd, yet the butter churn pulsed warmly in his grip, those rebellious sparks dancing again. <words>243</words>

He climbed. <words>245</words>

Each rung took him higher through the station's forgotten arteries, past sealed chambers where the last trees had been displayed like crown jewels before their inevitable death. <words>272</words> The Consortium had harvested Earth's final forests for their executive ships, leaving behind only holographic replacements that flickered in empty biodomes. <words>294</words>

The ladder terminated at the observation deck, its vast windows revealing the grey marble that Earth had become. <words>312</words> Here, at the pinnacle of humanity's folly, Kael set down the butter churn and began to turn its handle with methodical precision. <words>335</words>

The sparks erupted outward this time, not merely rebellious but revolutionary, cascading across the deck's dormant systems. <words>353</words> Ancient projectors stuttered to life, broadcasting not the Consortium's careful lies but raw data streams—proof of the murdered world below, evidence of the grand illusion that kept the colonies compliant. <words>384</words>

As the truth poured into space, transmitted to every human outpost, Kael watched Earth with the dispassionate gaze of a merchant who'd finally balanced his ledger. <words>410</words> The butter churn fell silent, its purpose fulfilled, having churned not cream but revolution from the ashes of a dead world. <words>432</words>
