Elena had three hours between flights at O'Hare, enough time to review her grandfather's journal about the woodland secrets he'd discovered as a somnambulist scout. <words>26</words> Her fingers traced the worn leather binding, unapologetically humble in her reverence for his legacy. <words>42</words> Tomorrow marked her yearly pilgrimage to the family's ancestral home, where the sunken laboratory waited beneath moss and memory. <words>61</words>

The journal detailed how her grandfather would sleepwalk through the Pennsylvania forests, unconsciously scouting paths that conscious minds couldn't perceive. <words>81</words> His bottled lightning bug collection, preserved in the underground lab, held more than insects—each glass vessel contained luminous traces of the forest's spiritual wisdom. <words>106</words> Elena had inherited his gift, though hers manifested differently. <words>115</words> She could sense what he'd mapped, feel the pull of sacred groves and hidden springs even while awake. <words>133</words>

Loading her connecting flight's gate number, she studied his meticulous drawings of firefly flight patterns. <words>149</words> Each species glowed differently near power spots—emerald for healing waters, amber for ancestor grounds, violet for doorways between worlds. <words>169</words> The sunken laboratory had been built around a natural cave where three ley lines converged, its stone walls amplifying the subtle energies her grandfather tracked. <words>194</words>

Elena's loaded curiosity deepened with each visit. <words>201</words> Last year, she'd discovered that the lightning bugs responded to her presence, their preserved light flickering when she entered certain chambers. <words>223</words> Her grandfather's notes suggested the insects had absorbed something from their sacred territories, becoming living compasses for spiritual cartography. <words>243</words>

She'd learned to approach the work with his same unapologetically humble manner—never claiming to understand fully, always listening more than theorizing. <words>264</words> The woodland secrets revealed themselves slowly, requiring patience and respect. <words>274</words> Her role as scout meant observing without disturbing, mapping without claiming ownership of mysteries that predated human memory. <words>292</words>

The boarding announcement interrupted her reading. <words>298</words> Soon she'd walk the overgrown path to the concealed entrance, descend the carved steps, and stand among hundreds of glowing bottles. <words>320</words> Each jar held a fragment of her grandfather's nocturnal journeys, his unconscious wisdom preserved in chitin and phosphorescence. <words>339</words> This year, she carried new equipment—special cameras that could capture the bugs' spectral emanations, tools to finally translate their light into readable maps. <words>363</words>

The real work happened in those sleepwalking hours, when the conscious mind released its grip. <words>378</words> Elena had begun experiencing her own somnambulant wanderings, waking with dirt beneath her fingernails and coordinates scrawled on her camping gear. <words>400</words> The forest was teaching her its language, one unconscious footstep at a time. <words>413</words> Tomorrow, she would finally understand what the bottled lightning bugs had been trying to show her family for generations. <words>432</words>
