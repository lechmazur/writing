Marcus positioned his laptop in the abandoned hospital waiting area, its dusty chairs bearing witness to countless forgotten anxieties. <words>18</words> The antique funhouse mirror across from him warped his reflection into grotesque shapes—perfect for what he needed. <words>35</words> During virtual therapy calls, his counselor never suspected that Marcus tracked minute distortions in the mirror's surface, reading heat signatures from adjoining rooms where war profiteers conducted their business. <words>64</words>

He rolled the plain wooden bead between his fingers, a meditation technique from the monastery where he'd learned to harness rage into purpose. <words>87</words> The monks had called it "artfully clumsy"—appearing harmless while positioning oneself for maximum impact. <words>102</words> Marcus let his words stumble during sessions, flattering his therapist's expertise while his true attention focused on the mirror's revelations. <words>122</words>

"The nightmares are better," he lied, watching crimson heat bloom across silvered glass as weapons changed hands next door. <words>141</words> The price of war wasn't just measured in bodies—it festered in boardrooms where men grew rich on others' suffering. <words>161</words> His therapist smiled from the screen, unaware that Marcus had chosen this location specifically, that each session provided cover for his surveillance. <words>184</words>

The wooden bead clicked against his wedding ring—both artifacts from before he'd understood war's true cost. <words>201</words> His wife had strung prayer beads for soldiers; now he carried the last one, transforming its purpose from comfort to vengeance. <words>223</words> The ancient art he sought to master wasn't meditation but patience itself, the discipline to strike only when justice demanded it. <words>245</words>

"You seem distracted today," his therapist noted. <words>252</words>

Marcus fumbled with his coffee, spilling drops on his shirt—calculated clumsiness that shifted focus from his dilated pupils tracking mirror distortions. <words>274</words> "Sorry, just tired," he murmured, cataloging faces reflected in warped glass, memorizing the men who sold death for profit. <words>294</words>

The session ended with scheduling pleasantries, but Marcus remained in the screaming silence of the waiting room. <words>311</words> Here, where families once hoped for healing, he prepared his own cure for society's sickness. <words>327</words> The subdued vigilante understood that true justice whispered rather than roared, striking from shadows cast by funhouse mirrors and forgotten spaces. <words>349</words>

Tomorrow he would return, laptop ready, wooden bead smooth between practiced fingers. <words>361</words> Another virtual call, another opportunity to flatter and deflect while gathering intelligence through ancient glass. <words>376</words> The mirror knew truths that screens couldn't capture—revealing monsters who hid behind respectability, profiting from conflicts they'd never fight. <words>396</words>

In war's arithmetic, Marcus had become a different kind of soldier, one who fought with patience, mirrors, and the weight of a single wooden bead. <words>422</words> The abandoned waiting area held its breath, complicit in his screaming silence. <words>434</words>
