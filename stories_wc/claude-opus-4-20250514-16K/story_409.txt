The bruised fighter climbed the narrow stairs, each step echoing like a sculptor's chisel striking marble—that first decisive blow that commits stone to form. <words>19</words> His knuckles, split and swollen, trembled as he pushed open the attic door. <words>32</words> Dust motes swirled through shafts of light, illuminating rows of clockwork animals frozen mid-motion: brass owls with gears for eyes, tin rabbits wound too tight to hop. <words>60</words>

He moved with skillful incompetence, his trained body betraying him at crucial moments—a boxer who'd mastered the art of taking hits rather than giving them. <words>86</words> Among the mechanical menagerie, he found what he'd come for: a clay pot shard, its ancient inscription barely visible. <words>105</words> "Stand for something," it read in a language he shouldn't understand but did. <words>118</words>

The shard cut his palm as he gripped it, blood mixing with dust. <words>131</words> This was why he'd come—to abduct himself from the comfortable lies he'd built. <words>145</words> The clockwork animals began to tick, their gears whirring to life. <words>156</words> A copper fox turned its head, eyes clicking open. <words>165</words> "You know what you must do," it seemed to say. <words>175</words>

He closed his eyes, letting forgotten dreams surface—memories he'd buried beneath years of deliberate failure. <words>190</words> In those dreams, he saw himself winning, standing tall, unbruised. <words>200</words> But that wasn't him anymore. <words>205</words> He'd chosen to lose, to take the punches, because losing was easier than facing what winning meant: that he'd have to become someone his father would recognize. <words>232</words>

The inscription pulsed warm against his skin. <words>239</words> Standing for something didn't mean standing victorious. <words>246</words> Sometimes it meant choosing your own particular way of falling. <words>256</words>

Through the attic window, he watched a sculptor in the building across the street raise her chisel. <words>273</words> The moment stretched infinite—that breath before creation, before decision, before the marble knows what it will become. <words>290</words> He understood now why he'd been drawn here, to this dusty sanctuary of broken timepieces and stillborn automata. <words>308</words>

The clockwork animals watched as he pressed the shard to his chest. <words>320</words> Its inscription burned through his shirt, through skin, through the last vestige of self-deception. <words>335</words> He wasn't incompetent—he was skilled at a very specific kind of survival. <words>347</words> He stood for the right to choose your own damage, to fail on your own terms. <words>363</words>

The fighter exhaled, releasing years of shame. <words>370</words> The mechanical creatures resumed their frozen poses, gears grinding to stillness. <words>381</words> He pocketed the shard and descended the stairs, no longer bruised but scarred—scarred with purpose. <words>396</words> Outside, the sculptor's chisel finally met stone, and somewhere, something new began. <words>408</words>
