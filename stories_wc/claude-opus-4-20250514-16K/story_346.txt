Thrakk the Unconquered had slain dragons, but here in the hexagonal chambers of papery walls, his sword hung useless. <words>18</words> The giant wasp's nest stretched endlessly, each cell identical, each turn leading nowhere. <words>31</words> Pop. <words>32</words> Another balloon burst somewhere beyond the fibrous walls—the fourth since he'd begun counting, marking time in this intimately impersonal prison where every surface knew his shape yet remained alien. <words>61</words>

His fingers found the lint-filled pocket of his battle-worn tunic, worrying the soft detritus like prayer beads. <words>79</words> "I am Thrakk!" he bellowed into the amber-lit corridors. <words>88</words> "I have conquered the Screaming Peaks!" <words>94</words> Pop. <words>95</words> The sound echoed wrong, too clean, too measured. <words>104</words>

Through the translucent walls, he heard it—an unguarded soliloquy bleeding through: "Subject seventeen still believes the nest narrative. <words>123</words> Increase the balloon intervals. <words>127</words> His reality matrix holds." <words>131</words>

The words sliced through his boasts like ice through marrow. <words>141</words> Thrakk pressed his ear against the wall, and beneath the surface chaos, an undercurrent of clarity emerged—conversations about dosages, projections, constructs. <words>164</words> Pop. <words>165</words> Each balloon marked not time but injections, each burst a fresh dose of manufactured memories. <words>181</words>

"The warrior archetype was Dr. Hendricks' idea," another voice drifted through. <words>192</words> "Easier to contain aggressive subjects when they believe they're heroes." <words>202</words>

Thrakk's hand trembled in his pocket, lint catching under his nails as rage crystallized into purpose. <words>219</words> The nest wasn't real. <words>223</words> His victories, perhaps fabrications. <words>227</words> But his desire to escape—that burned true. <words>234</words>

He began to rewire himself, not through grand gestures but through systematic doubt. <words>248</words> Each boast he'd made became a question. <words>255</words> Each memory, suspect. <words>258</words> Pop. <words>259</words> Closer now. <words>261</words> He could feel the needle's approach in the rhythm. <words>270</words>

"I am," he whispered, then louder, "I am—" But not Thrakk. <words>281</words> The name dissolved like sugar in rain. <words>288</words> He was someone else, someone real beneath the warrior's skin. <words>299</words>

The walls began to shimmer, hexagons warping into right angles, organic curves straightening into institutional corridors. <words>316</words> Through the failing projection, he glimpsed white coats, clipboards, the truth of his captivity. <words>331</words>

Pop. <words>332</words> But this time, he caught the syringe before it could deliver its payload, his fingers—still lint-dusted—surprisingly steady. <words>350</words> The orderly's eyes widened. <words>354</words> "He's awake. <words>356</words> Subject seventeen is—" <words>359</words>

Thrakk—no, just a man now—smiled with precise madness. <words>368</words> "I am leaving," he said, each word deliberate as footsteps. <words>379</words> The boastful warrior was dead. <words>384</words> What remained was harder, quieter, and infinitely more dangerous: someone who knew the difference between what was real and what was performed. <words>408</words> He walked through doors that had always been there, hidden beneath hexagonal lies, toward whatever truth awaited beyond the nest. <words>429</words>
