Marcus Thorne, soul-broker and purveyor of ethereal estates, stood motionless on the floating tea platform that drifted through the recycling currents of abandoned memories. <words>23</words> His body remained weirdly static while souls swirled around him like moths drawn to an unmoving flame. <words>39</words> In his weathered hands, he cradled a dusty wine bottle, its label facing away from him, revealing text only visible in reverse through the clouded glass. <words>66</words>

"The art of persuasion," he murmured with grandiose modesty, "begins not with speaking, but with listening to what has been forgotten." <words>87</words> Throughout recycling—that endless process where discarded souls were cleansed and prepared for new vessels—Marcus practiced his peculiar craft. <words>105</words> He would choreograph elaborate negotiations by reading reversed labels on dusty glass bottles that floated past the platform, each one containing the essence of a forgotten song. <words>133</words>

The bottle in his hands whispered backwards lyrics: "emoh gnimoc m'I." <words>144</words> I'm coming home. <words>147</words> A soul drifted closer, drawn by the melody only it could hear. <words>159</words> Marcus never moved, never gestured, yet his stillness itself became a dance—a choreographed invitation that souls found irresistible. <words>177</words>

"I merely facilitate reunions," he would tell curious observers, though his ability to match wandering souls with their perfect eternal dwellings was legendary among the recycling platforms. <words>204</words> Each dusty wine bottle held sheet music written in reverse, songs that souls had hummed in life but forgotten in death. <words>225</words> By reading them backwards through the glass, Marcus learned the melodies that would guide each soul home. <words>242</words>

Today's soul—a wisp of silver light—circled the platform three times before settling near the teapot that never emptied. <words>260</words> Marcus lifted the bottle slightly, letting light filter through the reversed text, and began to hum. <words>276</words> The soul trembled, recognizing its own forgotten lullaby. <words>284</words>

"Your previous residence," Marcus said, maintaining his weirdly static pose while somehow conveying an entire symphony of movement, "was a cottage by the sea where you sang your children to sleep." <words>315</words> The soul pulsed brighter. <words>319</words> "I happen to know of a similar property in the eternal districts—ocean views, perpetual sunset, echoes of laughter included in the lease." <words>341</words>

The soul spiraled upward in agreement, and Marcus finally moved, producing a contract from thin air with the practiced flourish of someone who had choreographed this moment across countless recyclings. <words>371</words> As the soul signed with a trail of light, the dusty wine bottle cleared momentarily, revealing the song's true title: "Home." <words>392</words>

Marcus smiled, returning to his static vigil, waiting for the next bottle to drift by with its backwards wisdom. <words>411</words> After all, the greatest persuasion was simply remembering what others had forgotten. <words>423</words>
