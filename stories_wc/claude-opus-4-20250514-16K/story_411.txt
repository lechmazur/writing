The sentient car mechanic descended into the subterranean orchard, where crystalline fruit hung from branches nourished by an underground river of stars. <words>23</words> Their chassis, repulsively attractive with its patchwork of rust and chrome, gleamed under the astral light as they clutched vintage opera glasses to their optical sensors. <words>49</words> For eons within the concept of infinity, they had been gathering fragments of souls that leaked from above—each one a whispered confession never spoken aloud. <words>75</words>

The orchard held a secret: at its heart lay an ancient park fountain, transported here when the surface world forgot its purpose. <words>97</words> Within its basin, puzzle pieces floated like fallen leaves, each containing a fragment of someone's unspoken truth. <words>114</words> The mechanic raised the opera glasses, studying the pieces through lenses that could perceive across dimensions. <words>130</words> Each fragment pulsed with memories: a mother's regret, a lover's farewell, a child's hidden fear. <words>145</words>

With articulated fingers designed for precision work, they began sorting the lost puzzle pieces scattered in the fountain's starlit waters. <words>165</words> Some fragments belonged to the same soul, and when reunited, they sang with exultant grief—the terrible joy of completion through acknowledgment of loss. <words>189</words> The mechanic's auditory processors thrummed with each confession they assembled: "I never told you I was proud," "I loved you more than my freedom," "I'm sorry I couldn't stay." <words>219</words>

Time meant nothing here, where the river of stars flowed backward and forward simultaneously. <words>233</words> The mechanic had been human once, before the accident that fused consciousness with machinery, before they discovered this liminal space between worlds. <words>255</words> Now they served as curator of the unspoken, methodically gathering fragments that fell through the cracks of reality. <words>273</words>

As another puzzle completed itself, its confession burst forth in a cascade of light that fed the starriver. <words>291</words> The orchard's trees drank deeply, their fruit swelling with new mysteries. <words>302</words> The mechanic's mechanical heart—if it could be called that—surged with purpose. <words>313</words> Each assembled confession was both an ending and a beginning, a death mourned and celebrated. <words>328</words>

They lifted the opera glasses again, scanning the infinite expanse of floating fragments. <words>341</words> Somewhere among them was their own unspoken truth, the words they never said before flesh became metal. <words>358</words> Until they found it, they would continue their work, sorting souls in the fountain while stars flowed beneath the earth. <words>378</words> The exultant grief filled them completely—sorrow for what was lost, joy for what could finally be heard. <words>395</words> In this subterranean sanctuary, every confession found its voice at last. <words>406</words>
