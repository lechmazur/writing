Brother Matthias shuffled into the storm chasing headquarters, his robes rustling against radar screens that tracked hurricanes instead of holy visions. <words>17</words> The other meteorologists had grown accustomed to his presence over the decades, this weary monk who spoke in whispers that somehow filled entire rooms—timidly loud, they called it. <words>45</words> In his weathered hands, he clutched a cedar box containing his collection of mismatched buttons: pearl, wood, brass, bone—each one salvaged from garments worn by those who had witnessed great tempests through eons of silent wonder. <words>82</words>

He was breaking the mold of both monastery and meteorology. <words>92</words> While his brothers prayed in cloisters, Matthias decoded the forgotten languages written in wind patterns, believing storms spoke in tongues lost since Eden. <words>116</words> His method seemed mad: he would arrange the buttons on weather maps while reciting cryptic references from fairy tales—"East of the sun, west of the moon," marking pressure systems where Baba Yaga's hut might spin. <words>151</words>

"The wolf's breath brings the northern gale," he murmured, placing a mother-of-pearl button over Saskatchewan. <words>167</words> The younger scientists initially mocked him, but his predictions proved unnervingly accurate. <words>179</words> Storms moved like dancers following choreography from a forgotten dance, steps encoded in Grimm's tales and Buddhist sutras alike. <words>198</words>

Today's supercell was different. <words>202</words> The buttons trembled on the map, arranging themselves without his touch. <words>213</words> Through the headquarters' reinforced windows, the sky churned with colors that had no names in modern language—hues that enriched reality itself, painting impossible geometries. <words>238</words> Matthias recognized them from illuminated manuscripts describing the Tower of Babel's destruction. <words>250</words>

"It's speaking," he announced, his whisper booming. <words>257</words> The storm wasn't just weather—it was a rosetta stone of primordial communication, every lightning strike a consonant, every thunder roll a vowel from the first language. <words>284</words> His fingers danced across the buttons, each one now glowing with its own inner light, translating the tempest's message. <words>303</words>

The lead meteorologist approached, drawn by the strange luminescence. <words>312</words> "What does it say?" <words>316</words>

Matthias smiled, exhaustion lifting from his features for the first time in forty years. <words>330</words> "It says the dance never stopped—we simply forgot the steps." <words>340</words> He pressed a final button, carved from lightning-struck oak, and the storm responded with a sound like cathedral bells made of rain. <words>363</words> In that moment, everyone in the headquarters understood: weather wasn't chaos but conversation, and Matthias had finally found his polyglot paradise in the marriage of ancient wisdom and modern science. <words>394</words>

The buttons settled into stillness, but their work was complete—the first words of a recovered language echoed through the storm chasing headquarters, forever changing how humanity would listen to the sky. <words>425</words>
