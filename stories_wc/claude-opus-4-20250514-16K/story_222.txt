The secretive conjurer pressed the threadbare washcloth against her grandmother's sapphire brooch, wiping away centuries of cosmic dust inside the extraterrestrial embassy's preparation chamber. <words>22</words> Her fingers trembled—not from fear, but from calculated dreams of what this evening might yield. <words>37</words> 

Ambassador Vex'hai had promised her fifteen minutes before the first dance begins, enough time to demonstrate her proposal. <words>55</words> She'd spent years studying the embassy's bio-luminescent gardens, learning how Andromedan flora responded to human emotion. <words>71</words> Despite her philosophically shallow understanding of why compassion worked—she'd never cared for the theory, only results—she'd discovered something remarkable. <words>91</words>

The brooch caught the alien moonlight filtering through crystalline walls. <words>101</words> "My grandmother tamed the wind-serpents of Europa with this," she whispered to herself, though the story was likely fabricated. <words>120</words> Still, stories had power here, where reality bent like light through water. <words>132</words>

She entered the embassy's main hall, where diplomats from twelve star systems mingled beneath floating chandeliers of living light. <words>151</words> The Andromedans' natural phosphorescence pulsed with curiosity as she approached the ambassador. <words>163</words> "Your gardens are dying," she stated simply, knowing directness worked better than Earth's diplomatic dancing. <words>178</words>

Vex'hai's tendrils darkened—anger, perhaps, or grief. <words>185</words> "The Parliament believes we've grown too disconnected from our world-spirit." <words>195</words>

She smiled, unfolding the washcloth to reveal seeds she'd blessed with her particular magic. <words>209</words> "Compassion has layers," she said, scattering them across the embassy's central planter. <words>221</words> "First, we feel for ourselves. <words>226</words> Then for others like us. <words>231</words> Then for the different. <words>235</words> Finally, for the land itself." <words>240</words>

The seeds sprouted instantly, but not with violent growth—instead, they reached gently toward the dying Andromedan plants, offering support. <words>259</words> Her magic wasn't about forcing nature's power into submission, but about revealing the compassion already within it. <words>276</words>

"How?" Vex'hai breathed, watching his people's sacred flora respond, color returning to translucent leaves. <words>290</words>

She touched the brooch, its weight both burden and blessing. <words>300</words> "My grandmother's story taught me that to truly harness the power of nature, we must first tame our need to dominate it." <words>322</words> She paused, watching the ambassador's expression shift through spectrums invisible to human eyes. <words>335</words> "Your Parliament is wrong. <words>339</words> Connection isn't lost through distance—it's lost through forgetting that every world speaks the same language of growth, decay, and renewal." <words>359</words>

The embassy's chimes announced the evening's festivities. <words>366</words> As diplomats paired for the first dance, she noticed the Andromedans touching the newly-vitalized plants with reverent appendages. <words>384</words> Her calculated dreams had manifested exactly as planned, though she kept her satisfaction hidden beneath practiced modesty. <words>401</words>

"Stay," Vex'hai offered, extending a phosphorescent tendril. <words>408</words> "Teach us more about these... layers." <words>414</words>

She accepted, knowing that the real magic had only just begun. <words>425</words>
