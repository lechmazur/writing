Marina floated among the orbital debris, her hands trembling as she assembled another toy spacecraft, knowing hundreds watched her performance through the station's cameras. <words>21</words> The exorcist-engineer had inherited this position through generations of family lies—her grandmother claiming divine gifts, her mother perpetuating the fraud, and now Marina, crippled by stage fright whenever she performed the station's monthly "cleansing rituals." <words>59</words> Nothing about her life was ever usual. <words>66</words>

The pressed wildflowers in her breast pocket—smuggled aboard despite regulations—reminded her of Earth's truth beneath the inherited deceptions. <words>85</words> She worked in defiant hush, assembling toys for the colony children while the debris field sparkled outside like frozen screams. <words>105</words> Each miniature rocket she crafted became her rebellion, her way to sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never"—never brave enough to expose the lie, never free from performing fake exorcisms for superstitious colonists. <words>138</words>

By the sound of a key turning in a lock, she knew Director Chen approached. <words>153</words> "The Karakov module reported another possession," he announced through the airlock. <words>164</words> Marina's stomach churned; she would have to perform again, chanting meaningless words while her audience expected miracles. <words>181</words>

She let herself submerge into the familiar panic, then surfaced with sudden clarity. <words>194</words> The toys scattered around her workspace weren't just distractions—they were her truth. <words>206</words> She grabbed the latest creation, a small mechanical angel with pressed wildflower wings. <words>219</words>

"Tell them I'll come," she whispered, her voice steady for once. <words>231</words> "But this time, I bring my own tools." <words>240</words>

She floated toward the airlock, past the drifting metal cemetery of failed satellites and shattered dreams. <words>256</words> The colony had inherited lies about demons in the darkness, but Marina would give them something real—wonder, imagination, the honest magic of human creativity. <words>281</words>

In the Karakov module, she found the "possessed" child, frightened and isolated. <words>293</words> Instead of false Latin incantations, Marina produced the mechanical angel. <words>303</words> "This isn't an exorcism," she announced to the watching crowd, her stage fright transforming into purposeful determination. <words>320</words> "This is truth." <words>323</words>

She wound the toy's key, and it danced through the air, wildflower wings catching the artificial light. <words>340</words> The child laughed—the first genuine sound in the module for days. <words>352</words> Marina continued assembling toys from her pockets, creating a floating constellation of possibilities. <words>366</words>

"My family lied," she declared, each word a small revolution. <words>377</words> "There are no demons here, only fear and isolation." <words>387</words> She pressed a toy into the child's hands. <words>396</words> "But we can build better truths together." <words>403</words>

The defiant hush that followed spoke louder than any fraudulent prayer ever could. <words>417</words>
