Mara's consciousness snapped back into her body on the rusted roller coaster track, the antique brass key burning cold against her palm. <words>22</words> The revelation hit her like vertigo: the children trapped in the carnival's astral echo weren't memories—they were real souls, sometimes always returning to relive their final moments. <words>49</words> Her secret gift of projection had shown her their endless loop of terror, and her unyielding compassion wouldn't let her abandon them, even as the shadow entity she'd awakened began manifesting in the physical world. <words>82</words>

She had to flee—not from cowardice, but to preserve the survival skills she'd need to free them. <words>99</words> The entity couldn't track her if she moved between the sun shadows cast by the coaster's skeletal frame, a technique learned through years of practiced spontaneity in the astral realm. <words>128</words> Each beam created a blind spot in both dimensions. <words>137</words>

Mara vaulted over a broken rail, calculating the shadow angles as naturally as breathing. <words>151</words> The brass key had belonged to the carnival's first victim, a child psychic like herself who'd tried to help but became trapped instead. <words>174</words> Now it pulsed with stored astral energy—the only tool that could unlock the souls' prison. <words>189</words>

The entity's presence pressed against reality, warping the metal tracks behind her. <words>201</words> She leaped between shadows, each movement deliberate yet seemingly random, a choreography of survival she'd perfected through countless projections. <words>220</words> The children's whispers echoed in her mind, pleading for release. <words>230</words>

Her compassion had sometimes always been her strength and vulnerability—she couldn't turn away from suffering, even when logic demanded self-preservation. <words>250</words> But this wasn't recklessness; it was calculated risk. <words>258</words> Every projection had taught her that true survival meant more than protecting yourself. <words>271</words>

The track's highest point loomed ahead, where the shadows converged at noon. <words>283</words> The entity couldn't follow there—the overlapping shadows would blind it completely. <words>294</words> Mara's fingers traced the key's worn engravings, feeling the psychic child's last desperate hope embedded in the metal. <words>312</words>

She reached the summit and turned, holding the key high. <words>322</words> The entity recoiled from the combined light and shadow, giving her the seconds she needed. <words>337</words> With practiced spontaneity, she projected herself back into the astral carnival, key in hand, ready to shatter the loops that bound innocent souls. <words>361</words> Her body remained balanced on the track, protected by shadows and sustained by compassion that refused to yield. <words>378</words>

The real work began now—not fleeing from darkness, but racing toward the light she could create for others. <words>396</words> Sometimes always, salvation required both courage and wisdom. <words>404</words>
