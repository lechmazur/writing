Margot descended into the champagne vault beneath Paris, her pockets bulging with salvaged treasures, the fragment of medieval stained-glass window wrapped carefully in yesterday's Le Monde. <words>25</words> She'd forgotten, as usual, that tonight was the avant-garde collective's final performance in these limestone chambers where Dom Pérignon once aged. <words>45</words> The artists had transformed the ancient cellars into an installation space, their projected holograms clashing violently with the dusty bottles and centuries-old stone. <words>69</words> 

"You cannot be here," announced Claude, the collective's leader, his chrome-painted face reflecting the laser lights. <words>85</words> Margot shrugged, pulling a moldy baguette from her coat—dinner, salvaged from behind the Monoprix. <words>99</words> "Met your programmer at the science fair last week," she said, chewing thoughtfully. <words>112</words> "Lucien, right? <words>114</words> Told me about your show." <words>119</words> She'd actually forgotten his name immediately, but the invitation had stuck somehow. <words>131</words>

Claude's expression softened slightly as electronic music thundered through the vaults. <words>142</words> "This is about progress, about leaving the past behind," he gestured at his collective's digital projections consuming the walls. <words>161</words> Margot watched a holographic snake devour a pixelated Virgin Mary, then carefully unwrapped her stained-glass fragment. <words>177</words> 

"Found this in a demolition site," she said, holding the glass up to catch the laser light. <words>194</words> Colors exploded through the ancient glass—azure, crimson, gold—cutting through the digital display with analog beauty. <words>209</words> The performers stopped, transfixed. <words>213</words> "Your lights are impressive," Margot continued, voice flat despite her racing heart, "but they need something real to shine through." <words>233</words>

Claude frowned, but she could see him considering. <words>241</words> "We reject tradition," he said. <words>246</words>

"Then reject it through something that matters," Margot replied, forgetting she'd used this same argument at three other galleries this month. <words>267</words> She needed to protect this fragment, this fragile wonder that developers would have crushed into dust. <words>283</words> "Let your future consume my past. <words>289</words> Make it part of the performance." <words>295</words>

The negotiation was brief—artists understood survival. <words>301</words> As the final performance continued, Margot's stained glass became the show's unconscious heart, refracting their digital rebellion into something accidentally sacred. <words>323</words> She munched her moldy baguette in the corner, watching tourists gasp at the unplanned beauty, forgetting already that she'd saved another piece of Paris. <words>348</words> Tomorrow she'd search the 13th arrondissement, pockets empty, mind foggy, but tonight the old glass sang through new light. <words>367</words> The cultural clash had found its synthesis in the champagne-scented darkness, and Margot, champion of forgotten things, had already forgotten her victory. <words>390</words> She simply watched, disinterested and deeply satisfied, as the centuries danced together in the vault. <words>405</words>
