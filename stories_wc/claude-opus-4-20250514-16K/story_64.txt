The uncertain alchemist clutched the cracked scale from a mythical beast, her fingers trembling as the floating marketplace swayed beneath her feet. <words>22</words> Around her, hot air balloons creaked against their tethers while vendors pretended not to watch the makeshift courtroom erected between the spice stalls and dream merchants. <words>48</words> 

She had spent decades mapping forest trails, not for cartography but to find the technically wild ingredients that grew only where civilization feared to tread. <words>73</words> Each path led to another fragment of the immortality formula, another piece of the price she'd slowly assembled like a mosaic of obsession. <words>96</words> The dragon scale in her palm—cracked during her final harvest—had been the last component, stolen from a sleeping guardian who dreamed of younger centuries. <words>121</words>

Now, at the hush before the judge reads the verdict, she understood the true cost. <words>136</words> The Merchant's Council had discovered her work, deemed it too dangerous for their carefully balanced economy of finite lives and predictable deaths. <words>159</words> But they didn't know what she knew. <words>166</words>

Her bare feet found the coded scuffs on the centuries-old marble floor—a message left by the last alchemist tried here, three hundred years ago. <words>190</words> The worn grooves spelled out coordinates in the old tongue, directions to safeguard the formula beyond their reach. <words>208</words> She had memorized every indent during the long hours of testimony, tracing the pattern with her toes while prosecutors droned about public safety. <words>231</words>

The judge cleared his throat, parchment rustling like autumn leaves. <words>241</words> Below, the forest stretched endlessly, its canopy punctuated by the shadows of the floating market. <words>256</words> She had mapped those trails for this moment, knowing that immortality's price wasn't paid in dragon scales or rare herbs, but in the willingness to leap. <words>282</words>

"Guilty," the judge pronounced, but she was already moving. <words>291</words> The cracked scale cut into her palm as she vaulted the rail, formula secured in her mind, body plummeting toward the trees she knew better than her own heartbeat. <words>320</words> 

The vendors gasped—then laughed. <words>324</words> Another alchemist choosing the forest over the noose, another mundane miracle in their skybound lives. <words>339</words> They'd tell the story for weeks, embellishing her certainty, never mentioning how she'd hesitated at the edge, caught between immortality and impact. <words>361</words>

But the trees caught her as they always did, branches breaking her fall in a cascade of technically wild mercy. <words>381</words> She landed hard but whole, the scale still clutched tight, already orienting herself toward the hidden laboratory where her life's work waited. <words>404</words> Above, the floating marketplace drifted on, its verdict meaningless to someone who had already paid immortality's price: everything she'd been, for everything she might become. <words>429</words>
