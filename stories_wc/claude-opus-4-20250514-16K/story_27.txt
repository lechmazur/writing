Eliza adjusted her binoculars, watching sparrows nest in the rusted Ferris wheel while manning the abandoned prize booth. <words>15</words> The haunted amusement park had become her sanctuary since the curse—every word she spoke emerged as naked truth, stripping away social niceties. <words>35</words> 

"Your mind has calcified," she told the ghost who haunted the booth nightly. <words>49</words> "You've been dead forty years, yet you still count the same dusty stuffed animals." <words>64</words>

The specter, Harold, materialized beside the vintage pencil box she'd placed on the counter. <words>78</words> Inside lay pencils sharpened during each lunar phase, their graphite cores infused with her peculiar magic. <words>94</words> 

"That's unnecessarily cruel," Harold protested. <words>99</words>

"Truth often is." <words>102</words> Eliza smiled with layered tranquility—serene surface, turbulent depths. <words>111</words> "But stagnation is crueler." <words>115</words>

She'd discovered the pencil box here months ago, understanding immediately how fate's tapestry had woven their meeting. <words>132</words> Harold needed evolution, and she, cursed with honesty, could deliver it through politely vindictive lessons. <words>148</words>

"Tonight's the new moon," she continued, tracking a cardinal's flight. <words>158</words> "Perfect for beginnings." <words>161</words>

"I don't want to begin anything." <words>167</words>

"Lies you tell yourself don't count as lies." <words>175</words> She opened the box, selecting a pencil. <words>182</words> "You're terrified that moving forward means accepting you're truly dead." <words>192</words>

Harold flickered, agitated. <words>195</words> "Stop." <words>196</words>

"Write one thing you've never admitted," she said, offering the pencil. <words>207</words> "Or I'll use the waxing moon pencil next week to petrify your essence, freezing you between worlds forever." <words>225</words>

Her tone remained gentle, almost musical—the polite vindictiveness of someone who cared enough to be cruel. <words>241</words> The birds sang overhead, oblivious to the supernatural standoff below. <words>251</words>

Harold's translucent hand trembled as he grasped the pencil. <words>260</words> "You're horrible." <words>262</words>

"I'm effective." <words>264</words> She watched him write slowly: 'I choose to stay because I'm afraid of what comes next.' <words>280</words>

The moment graphite touched paper, Harold solidified slightly, gaining substance. <words>290</words> His eyes widened with the first original thought he'd had in decades. <words>302</words>

"The pencils don't petrify," Eliza explained, her curse ensuring absolute honesty. <words>313</words> "They crystallize truth into change." <words>318</words> She gestured at the moon phase chart taped inside the booth. <words>329</words> "Each phase offers different transformations." <words>334</words>

A blue jay landed on the booth's awning, tilting its head at Harold's newfound opacity. <words>350</words>

"Why help me?" <words>353</words> Harold asked, his voice stronger. <words>358</words>

"Because watching you repeat the same patterns for eternity offends my sensibilities," Eliza replied, adjusting her binoculars again. <words>376</words> "And because fate's tapestry connected us—a truth-cursed cynic and a ghost afraid of truth." <words>391</words>

Harold smiled, the first genuine expression in four decades. <words>400</words> "What happens when I use all the pencils?" <words>408</words>

"Evolution," she said simply. <words>412</words> "Or whatever comes after ghosts learn to grow." <words>420</words>

Above them, the sparrows finished their nest, weaving twigs into tomorrow's shelter. <words>432</words> Harold picked up another pencil, ready to write himself free. <words>442</words>
