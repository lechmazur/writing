Professor Elara Vex clutched the seashell with its strange symbol—a spiral that seemed to pulse with inner light—as she hurried through the witch's flying carpet garage. <words>25</words> The outcast scholar had discovered the truth in the most unlikely place: diaries hidden behind a loose tile in the university's public restroom, their pages detailing an ancient ritual of soul-mirroring. <words>54</words> 

In the hush of a half-lit corridor between the parking stalls where enchanted carpets hovered restlessly, she felt the jolt of recognition. <words>76</words> The symbol on the shell matched the one drawn repeatedly in those hidden journals—the mark of the Midnight Curse that trapped souls in eternal reflection. <words>101</words>

"You came," a voice whispered, and Elara turned to see the garage owner, old Madame Thorne, emerging from shadows with eyes that held centuries. <words>125</words> Despite her reputation as a witch, something about Thorne was strangely trustworthy, perhaps the way her wrinkled hands trembled with the same desperate hope Elara felt. <words>151</words>

"The diaries spoke of you," Elara said, her voice maintaining that frantic peace she'd perfected during years of academic exile. <words>171</words> "They said you've been searching for someone who could complete the reversal ritual." <words>184</words>

Thorne nodded, gesturing to the largest carpet, its edges shimmering with trapped starlight. <words>197</words> "My daughter's soul has been mirroring itself for three decades, splitting and fragmenting each midnight." <words>212</words> Her voice cracked. <words>215</words> "But you found the key—that shell proves midnight only lasts so long, that even the darkest magic must yield to dawn." <words>236</words>

Elara placed the seashell on the carpet's center, watching as its symbol began to glow brighter. <words>252</words> The garage filled with a humming resonance as dozens of carpets responded to the shell's call. <words>268</words> "The diaries mentioned that soul-mirroring could be reversed if someone willingly took the curse's weight," she said quietly. <words>286</words>

"Which is why I need you," Thorne whispered. <words>294</words> "An outcast scholar with nothing left to lose, yet everything to prove." <words>306</words>

As midnight approached, Elara felt another jolt—not of fear, but of purpose. <words>318</words> She'd spent years studying forbidden texts in secret, branded a heretic for questioning the university's dogma about soul permanence. <words>337</words> Now, in this strange garage filled with impossible vehicles, she finally understood why she'd been drawn to those hidden diaries. <words>357</words>

The shell's light exploded outward as the clock struck twelve, and Elara saw her own soul reflected in its surface—not splitting, but finally whole. <words>381</words> Thorne's daughter materialized on the carpet, gasping as her fragmented essence reunited. <words>393</words> 

Dawn would come, Elara thought with fierce satisfaction. <words>401</words> Midnight only lasts so long, and she had proven it. <words>411</words>
