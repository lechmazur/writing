Magnus stood at the greenhouse entrance, his massive frame dwarfing the glass doors as tribal drums thundered from speakers hidden among the vines. <words>19</words> The docile bruiser clutched fragments of yellowed parchment—a treasure map he'd discovered beneath his apartment's rotting floorboards three nights ago. <words>39</words> Despite speaking no English and understanding only broken phrases, he'd deciphered enough symbols to know this labyrinth held the conductor's baton rumored to raise the dead. <words>66</words>

He pushed inside with disturbingly calm movements, his weathered face betraying no emotion as carnivorous pitcher plants snapped at his shoulders. <words>87</words> The map's torn pieces showed pathways through the botanical maze, though half the instructions were written in languages he couldn't comprehend. <words>108</words> Magnus relied on universal symbols—skulls meant danger, arrows indicated direction—while drum solos crescendoed through the humid air like ancient heartbeats. <words>128</words>

A Venus flytrap lunged; he sidestepped with surprising grace for someone his size. <words>141</words> His grandmother's stories echoed in his native tongue: "To mold a myth from the mud of reality, one must first touch death's instrument." <words>165</words> The language barrier had always isolated him, but here among wordless plants that communicated through violence, he felt oddly at home. <words>186</words>

Deeper he ventured, assembling map fragments like a puzzle while thorny tendrils tested his resolve. <words>201</words> His calloused hands, instruments of gentleness despite their strength, traced the baton's location marked in faded ink. <words>218</words> The drums intensified, their solos becoming frantic warnings in a tongue older than words. <words>232</words>

At the labyrinth's heart, he found it—the conductor's baton, gleaming silver amid corpse flowers. <words>246</words> Magnus reached out, then twisted sharply as a massive sundew dropped from above. <words>259</words> His movement was pure instinct, muscle memory transcending language. <words>268</words>

Grasping the baton, he felt its power surge through him like music given form. <words>282</words> The plants recoiled, recognizing an authority beyond botanical comprehension. <words>291</words> Magnus understood now why the map had been hidden, shredded, scattered—some myths were meant to remain mud. <words>308</words>

But he was tired of being voiceless in a world of words. <words>320</words> With brash tenderness, he conducted the greenhouse like an orchestra, each plant bending to his silent commands. <words>337</words> The drum solos faded as he carved a path back through the labyrinth, no longer needing maps or languages. <words>356</words> He possessed something more profound—the ability to resurrect understanding from silence itself. <words>368</words>

Outside, Magnus paused beneath streetlights, the baton hidden in his coat. <words>379</words> Tomorrow, the world would discover that some bruisers wield batons instead of fists, conducting symphonies of redemption for those whom words had failed. <words>403</words> Tonight, he simply walked home, disturbingly calm, carrying death's instrument with the gentle grip of one who finally understood his grandmother's myth. <words>426</words>
