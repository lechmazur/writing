The balloon drifted past the neural-glass ceiling, its red skin reflecting the ward's sterile biolights. <words>15</words> In that hush—that peculiar silence when a child's fingers first learn loss—Mira heard it: the rhythmic clang of metal on metal, impossible yet undeniable. <words>43</words>

She'd been mapping consciousness patterns for seven years, a perceptive cartographer of minds rather than lands. <words>59</words> The children's ward held the purest signals, untainted by adult deceptions. <words>70</words> But tonight, something else pulsed beneath the quantum monitors. <words>79</words>

Following the sound through maintenance corridors, Mira clutched her grandmother's dictionary—the one with the dragonfly pressed between pages 437 and 438, its wings still iridescent after forty years. <words>108</words> She'd discovered it the day they told her about cellular reconstruction, about how nothing stayed innocent forever in these chrome halls of healing. <words>132</words>

The clanging grew louder. <words>136</words> Behind a forgotten door marked "Obsolete," she found him: Dr. Chen, the ward's chief surgeon, bent over an ancient forge. <words>157</words> Sparks danced across his surgical visor as he shaped something that shouldn't exist here—a horseshoe, glowing orange-hot. <words>174</words>

"You followed the sound," he said without turning, their connection distantly intimate—mentor and student separated by understanding. <words>191</words> "Good. I need to convince you of something before the board discovers this." <words>204</words>

Mira watched him work, this man who rebuilt children's bodies by day and hammered iron by night. <words>221</words> "The corruption isn't in disease," he continued, plunging the metal into water that hissed like memories dissolving. <words>239</words> "It's in forgetting what we were before we learned to cure everything." <words>251</words>

He handed her the horseshoe, still warm. <words>258</words> "Every child I save with nanobots and synthetic organs—I steal something. Their right to be fragile. Their place in the universe as mortal beings." <words>283</words> The forge's glow caught the dictionary's edges. <words>290</words> "That dragonfly knew one summer. Perfect in its brevity." <words>299</words>

Mira understood then why she'd always felt displaced among the eternal promises of modern medicine. <words>314</words> Her maps showed consciousness, but never souls. <words>321</words> The children upstairs would live forever, but would they ever truly live? <words>333</words>

"Keep the forge secret," Chen said, returning to his hammer. <words>343</words> "Some of us need to remember." <words>349</words>

Walking back through corridors that smelled of tomorrow, Mira pressed the warm horseshoe against the dictionary. <words>365</words> The dragonfly's wings crumbled slightly, time finally claiming its due. <words>375</words> She thought of the child who'd lost the balloon, already sedated for morning's immortality treatment. <words>390</words> In her pocket, metal cooled against pressed wings, two relics of a world that knew when to let go. <words>409</words>
