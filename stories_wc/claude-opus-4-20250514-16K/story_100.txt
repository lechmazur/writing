Margot had always been a vivid dreamer, but tonight her pressed penny collection whispered truths that even her wildest visions couldn't conjure. <words>22</words> She stood at the edge of the enchanted orchard, where stone sentinels shifted their granite gazes with calculated suspicion, forever policing boundaries between the real and the imagined. <words>49</words> The copper discs in her pocket bore the imprints of a hundred tourist destinations, each one a breadcrumb in the cosmic deception she'd spent seven years trying to unravel. <words>78</words>

As the patient guardian of these metallic memories, she understood that truth rarely arrived in straight lines. <words>95</words> Tonight, she would oscillate between the silver moon paths that crisscrossed the orchard like luminous veins, a rationally mischievous plan forming behind her tired smile. <words>120</words> The living statues couldn't follow those ethereal roads—their stone feet were bound to earth, their purpose limited to watching, never pursuing. <words>142</words>

She pressed her thumb against the smoothest penny, feeling the flattened Lincoln almost apologize for what he'd witnessed. <words>160</words> This was the threshold moment, the breath before confession, when the universe teetered on admitting its grandest lie. <words>178</words> Margot's dour amusement bubbled up as she realized the cosmic deception wasn't hidden in distant galaxies or ancient texts—it lived in the pressed pennies themselves. <words>204</words>

Each coin had been crushed at locations where reality wore thin: Niagara Falls, Mount Rushmore, the Golden Gate Bridge. <words>223</words> Tourist traps, she'd thought with bitter humor, but now understood them as dimensional anchors, holding together a patchwork reality that someone, somewhere, had stitched from dreams. <words>250</words>

The first moon path appeared beneath her feet, a ribbon of light that made the nearest statue's eyes widen with something like fear. <words>274</words> Margot stepped onto it, oscillating between here and there, between what was and what someone desperately wanted to keep hidden. <words>295</words> Her collection clinked softly—fifty-one coins for fifty-one places where the truth had been literally pressed out of existence. <words>313</words>

As she walked the luminous trail, weaving between frozen guardians who could only watch her dance through their jurisdiction, she felt the weight of her discovery. <words>340</words> The ultimate cosmic deception was heartbreakingly simple: someone had been dreaming this world all along, and the pressed pennies were their way of marking which parts were real. <words>369</words> 

The apology hung in the air, unspoken but inevitable, as Margot followed the moon paths deeper into the orchard. <words>389</words> She would find the dreamer eventually, and when she did, her dour amusement would serve as armor against the terrible kindness of their confession. <words>414</words> After all, even patient guardians deserved to know whether they existed beyond someone else's fitful sleep. <words>430</words> The pennies sang their flattened song, and Margot listened with the rationally mischievous heart of someone who had already decided to wake the dreamer up. <words>456</words>
