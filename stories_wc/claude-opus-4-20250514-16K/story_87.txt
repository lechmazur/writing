The brass gears clicked overhead as Eliza entered the steampunk dining hall, her fingers clutching the wrinkled sticker sheet. <words>17</words> Twenty years had passed since she'd last seen Marcus, yet her hyperactively serene composure never wavered—a patient librarian's mask perfected through decades of silent rage. <words>42</words> The forgotten mixtapes lined her leather satchel, each one a weapon she'd preserved with meticulous care. <words>58</words>

Marcus sat alone beneath the copper pipes, his temples beginning to throb as recognition dawned. <words>73</words> "Eliza?" <words>74</words> His voice caught on the steam-warmed air. <words>81</words>

She glided forward with savage grace, placing the first cassette on his table. <words>94</words> "Track three," she whispered. <words>98</words> "You recorded it the night before you destroyed my thesis." <words>108</words>

The dining hall's mechanical orchestra whirred to life, but in the hush of a memory reclaimed, only their shared history mattered. <words>129</words> She'd spent two decades preparing for this moment, learning to bury an old hatred beneath layers of scholarly patience. <words>148</words> Now, as she laid out tape after tape, each labeled with dates of his betrayals, she felt the hollow victory approaching. <words>169</words>

"I kept everything," she continued, her voice a velvet blade. <words>179</words> "Every recording you made while stealing my research." <words>187</words> The wrinkled sticker sheet—once bright with stars they'd used to mark their favorite songs—unfurled between them like a battle flag. <words>208</words>

Marcus's hands trembled as he recognized his own handwriting on the cassette labels. <words>221</words> "Eliza, I can explain—" <words>225</words>

"No need." <words>227</words> She produced a brass player from her satchel, its gears meshing perfectly with the dining hall's steam-powered acoustics. <words>245</words> His voice filled the space, young and cruel, detailing his plans to claim her work. <words>260</words> Other diners turned, whispered, pointed. <words>265</words>

The throbbing in his temples intensified as she revealed the final tape—not evidence, but the mixtape he'd made when they were friends, before ambition poisoned everything. <words>291</words> The songs played, achingly innocent, while his reputation crumbled around him like rust from old pipes. <words>307</words>

Eliza gathered her things with the same hyperactive serenity, each movement precise despite the energy humming beneath her skin. <words>326</words> She'd won. <words>328</words> The academic council would revoke his tenure by morning. <words>337</words> Yet as she left him sobbing beneath the mechanical chandeliers, she felt only emptiness where satisfaction should have lived. <words>355</words>

Outside, she peeled a single star from the wrinkled sticker sheet and let it flutter away on the steam-scented breeze. <words>375</words> Twenty years of hatred, perfectly executed revenge, and all she'd gained was proof that some victories arrive too late to heal the wounds that birthed them. <words>401</words> The patient librarian adjusted her spectacles and walked into the gaslit night, forever changed yet somehow exactly the same. <words>419</words>
