Marcus had traded his rifle for binoculars when he became a conscientious objector, but the neighborhood watch gave him purpose—tracking something far more sinister than petty thieves. <words>26</words> Throughout craft fairs held in the hanging orchard, where storm-bent apple trees clung to the ravine's edge like desperate fingers, he maintained his post with valiant boredom. <words>53</words> Visitors assumed he was just another vendor's drowsy husband, but Marcus mapped migration routes with meticulous precision—not of birds, but of people who shouldn't be there. <words>79</words> 

The rusty nail in his pocket had been his grandfather's, passed down each Thanksgiving in their peculiar family tradition: whoever held it became the watcher. <words>104</words> His grandfather had tracked Nazi sympathizers; his father, Soviet spies; now Marcus hunted something that wore a friendlier face. <words>123</words> The craft fair organizers moved through the orchard with xenial grace, offering hot cider and warm smiles to vendors, their hospitality so excessive it practically screamed deception. <words>150</words>

Week after week, as autumn storms lashed the ravine and sent apples tumbling like grenades, Marcus noted their patterns. <words>169</words> They always arrived early, always left late, always paused at certain stalls where no money changed hands but small packages did. <words>190</words> His conscientious objection to violence didn't extend to observation—he'd learned that watching could be its own form of warfare. <words>209</words>

The nail grew warm in his pocket whenever they passed, an old family trick involving iron filings and hidden magnets sewn into their clothes. <words>233</words> These weren't ordinary smugglers; they were part of something older, something his bloodline had opposed for generations. <words>250</words> Marcus yawned theatrically, adjusting his binoculars as if bird-watching, while documenting another exchange near the candlemaker's booth. <words>267</words>

The storms were getting worse, and soon the craft fairs would end for the season. <words>282</words> Marcus would have to act, but not with violence—never with violence. <words>293</words> Instead, he'd use their own xenial customs against them, accepting their invitation to the harvest closing ceremony where all the "friendly" vendors gathered. <words>317</words> His grandfather's nail would identify the others like him, the scattered watchers maintaining their vigil across seemingly innocent community events. <words>337</words>

The orchard groaned under another assault of wind, and Marcus smiled with coy malevolence. <words>351</words> Let them think him a harmless objector, valiantly bored at his post. <words>363</words> The migration routes he'd mapped led to something much larger than local crime—a network that had survived by hiding in plain sight, wrapped in small-town hospitality. <words>390</words> This Thanksgiving, when he passed the nail to his daughter, she'd inherit more than tradition; she'd inherit a war fought with patience, observation, and the quiet subversion of evil dressed as kindness. <words>422</words>
