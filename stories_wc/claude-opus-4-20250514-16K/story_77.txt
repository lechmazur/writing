Kira pressed the dried starfish against her temple, feeling its ancient whispers pulse through her introverted empath's mind as she drifted through the abandoned space pirate hideout. <words>22</words> The asteroid's hollow chambers echoed with memories of lawless souls who'd once called this place home. <words>38</words> 

In the captain's quarters, she discovered it: a forgotten journal, its pages yellowed like old teeth. <words>55</words> The final entry spoke of mountain wisdom—that peculiar philosophy pirates had adopted from Earth's vanished peaks, teaching patience in the void. <words>77</words> 

"The marionette holds truth," the closing page read, and Kira's drowsy enthusiasm stirred as she noticed the shattered wooden figure scattered across the floor. <words>102</words> Its pieces were obviously hidden in plain sight, camouflaged among debris yet glowing faintly to her peculiar perception. <words>121</words> 

She began to marshal the fragments, her fingers moving with the careful precision of someone who'd spent years listening to unspoken pain. <words>144</words> Each splinter hummed with stored knowledge, and the dried starfish in her pocket grew warm, resonating with the puppet's broken wisdom. <words>166</words>

As she worked, Kira understood why she'd been drawn here. <words>176</words> The pirates hadn't been mere criminals—they'd been outcasts of reason, philosophers who'd chosen the stars over society's suffocating logic. <words>196</words> Their marionette wasn't a toy but a repository, each joint and string encoding truths too dangerous for conventional minds. <words>216</words>

The torso clicked into place, and visions flooded her consciousness: equations that bent reality, poems that unlocked wormholes, songs that could heal fractured souls. <words>240</words> This was why the authorities had scattered them, why their hideout lay forgotten. <words>254</words> They'd discovered something beyond acceptable thought. <words>260</words>

With drowsy determination, Kira fitted the final piece—the marionette's head, carved with symbols that made her eyes water. <words>278</words> The complete figure shuddered once, then whispered coordinates through wooden lips. <words>289</words>

She smiled, exhausted but exhilarated. <words>294</words> The journal's last words suddenly made sense: "Let the strange ones find us." <words>308</words> The pirates had left this puzzle for someone like her, someone who could champion their lost cause. <words>326</words>

Tucking the reassembled marionette under her arm, Kira activated her ship's beacon. <words>338</words> Other introverted empaths would feel its call, would come to learn what the pirates had discovered. <words>355</words> The dried starfish pulsed one final time, approving. <words>364</words>

Mountain wisdom taught that the highest truths were found in isolation, but even mountains eventually crumbled to share their secrets with the valleys below. <words>389</words> The space pirates had understood this, had built their hideout as a beacon for future outcasts. <words>406</words> Now Kira would ensure their legacy lived on, one reassembled truth at a time. <words>421</words>
