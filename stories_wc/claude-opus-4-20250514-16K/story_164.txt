The blacksmith stood beneath the arcade's only skylight, her leather apron incongruous among the neon and chrome. <words>17</words> Between acts, when the holographic performers dissolved into static, she would unfurl her botanical drawings across the anvil she'd installed in the abandoned ticket booth. <words>43</words> The arcade's owners tolerated her presence with the drifting arrogance of those who believed themselves too evolved to notice anachronisms. <words>64</words> 

She traced the dust motes spiraling through the shaft of natural light, mapping their dance with charcoal-stained fingers. <words>82</words> Each particle's trajectory revealed the air currents that the city's architects had forgotten, the breathing spaces they'd paved over. <words>102</words> Her drawings—ferns, vines, impossible flowers—weren't mere nostalgia but blueprints for reclaiming what the concrete had swallowed. <words>119</words>

The method was obviously subtle: kindle life where none should exist. <words>130</words> She'd learned that metal remembered its origins in ore veins threading through living stone, that even synthetic alloys yearned for roots. <words>152</words> During performances, while crowds gawked at digital acrobats, she'd hammer botanical forms into salvaged circuit boards, each strike synchronized with the show's crescendos. <words>176</words>

A young hacker paused at her booth, drawn by the impossible sight of penciled leaves. <words>191</words> "What's the point?" he asked, gesturing at her sketches of extinct trees. <words>203</words> 

She smiled, wistful for futures that hadn't been permitted to bloom. <words>214</words> "Watch the dust," she said, pointing to where motes gathered in helical patterns above her latest drawing—a mechanical rose whose petals were memory chips. <words>239</words> "The air remembers how to nurture growth, even here." <words>248</words>

He scoffed, but lingered as she began working metal with movements both brutal and tender. <words>263</words> The forge-heat made the botanical drawings curl at their edges, releasing the faint scent of mulch that shouldn't exist in this sterile space. <words>287</words> Between hammer strikes, she explained how each creation would be planted in the city's forgotten corners—fire escapes, maintenance shafts, the spaces between walls where reality grew thin. <words>316</words>

"Fantasy," the hacker muttered, but his eyes followed the dust motes now, seeing the patterns. <words>331</words>

"Fantasy is what grows in reality's cracks," she replied, holding up a brass seedpod that pulsed with bioelectric potential. <words>350</words> "The wild finds a way, especially where it's least expected." <words>361</words>

When the next act began, flooding the arcade with artificial thunder, she returned to her work. <words>377</words> The skylight's dust-dance had shown her where to kindle the next garden—in the space between two amplifiers where forgotten soil still dreamed. <words>401</words> Her botanical drawings fluttered in the forge-breath, obviously subtle maps to a rewilded tomorrow that was already taking root in the city's electronic heart. <words>426</words>
