The solitary summoner prowled along the quantum beach, where sand particles existed in multiple states until observed. <words>17</words> Her family had always celebrated the Dissolution Festival here, marking entropy's victory by building sandcastles destined to collapse into probability clouds. <words>38</words> But Mara clutched something different—a map drawn on a dried magnolia leaf, its veins forming oddly authentic coordinates that shifted with each glance. <words>62</words> 

The abandoned lighthouse ahead shimmered between existence and void, caught in that perfect hush before demolition when structures remember what they were. <words>85</words> Its quantum decay sang with corroded rapture, each crumbling brick a note in reality's swan song. <words>101</words> Mara's reflection in the tidal pools showed not herself but her potential—a thousand versions who had already succeeded where she had failed. <words>124</words>

She needed to outshine them all. <words>130</words>

The leaf-map pulsed, guiding her to where spacetime thinned like worn fabric. <words>142</words> Here, her grandmother had taught her, invention wasn't creation but revelation—finding what already existed in parallel shores. <words>159</words> While other families brought flowers to graves, hers brought equations to probability fields, solving for lost loved ones in adjacent dimensions. <words>181</words>

Mara began the summoning, not of spirits but of possibilities. <words>191</words> The lighthouse groaned, its final moment stretching into hours as she worked. <words>203</words> Each gesture pulled threads from other beaches, other Maras, weaving something unprecedented. <words>216</words> The spark of invention wasn't new fire but collision—forcing incompatible realities to kiss. <words>230</words>

Her reflections in the quantum tide pools writhed, trying to escape their watery prisons. <words>244</words> They had settled for discovering; she would transcend. <words>252</words> The leaf crumbled as she pressed it against the lighthouse wall, its map becoming the building's new blueprint. <words>270</words>

Reality hiccupped. <words>272</words>

Where the lighthouse had waited for destruction, something else emerged—a structure that existed in all states simultaneously, never quite there but impossible to demolish. <words>297</words> Mara's invention: permanence in a universe of decay. <words>305</words> Her reflections faded from the pools, outshone by an original who had done what they could only dream. <words>323</words>

The corroded rapture peaked as she touched her creation, feeling every possible sensation at once—rust and newness, solid and quantum foam. <words>345</words> Tomorrow, her family would return for the Dissolution Festival, expecting to find empty beach. <words>359</words> Instead, they would discover her monument to defiance, a lighthouse that death itself couldn't claim. <words>374</words>

She prowled back along the beach, no longer solitary but accompanied by the thousand selves she had absorbed and surpassed. <words>394</words> The spark of invention burned in her chest, oddly authentic in its impossibility. <words>407</words> Some things, she had proven, refused to dissolve. <words>415</words>
