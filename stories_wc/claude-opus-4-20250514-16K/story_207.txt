<story>
The forthright peddler Kira floated through the abandoned space station medical bay, her dried flower bouquet clutched against her chest like a talisman. <words>20</words> While the universe hums its secret song through the station's dead corridors, she spreads rumor-laden gossip columns across the surgical table, their holographic text flickering in the emergency lighting. <words>49</words> 

Each column divides into categories with her meekly assertive touch—truth here, lies there, half-truths scattered between like fallen petals. <words>69</words> She had sworn a blood oath never to return to this place where her sister died, but redemption's path rarely follows straight lines. <words>92</words> The dried flowers were Elena's last gift, preserved from the medical bay's garden before the evacuation, before everything went wrong. <words>112</words>

"Forgive me," Kira whispers to the empty beds, her voice carrying that peculiar joyful loneliness of someone who has learned to befriend ghosts. <words>135</words> The gossip columns hold the key—buried in society scandal and merchant whispers lies the truth about the contamination that killed half the station's crew. <words>160</words> She sifts through each rumor with practiced fingers, dividing fact from fiction, building a case that will finally expose the corporation that sealed their fate. <words>185</words>

Her peddler's instinct for honesty wars with the oath's binding—she had promised Elena's spirit she would never seek vengeance. <words>205</words> But this isn't vengeance; it's justice wearing redemption's cloak. <words>214</words> The dried bouquet trembles as she finds it: a columnist's throwaway line about experimental medicines, dates that match, names that connect. <words>235</words> 

The universe's secret song grows louder, harmonizing with the station's dying systems. <words>248</words> Kira packages the evidence with the same meekly assertive manner she uses to sell her wares—persistent but never pushy, truthful but gentle. <words>271</words> Breaking the blood oath feels like shedding old skin; it hurts, but underneath lies something new and necessary. <words>289</words>

She leaves one dried flower on the surgical table where Elena breathed her last, a small rebellion against the oath's constraining magic. <words>311</words> The abandoned medical bay seems less haunted now, its silence filled with purpose rather than sorrow. <words>327</words> As Kira navigates back to her merchant vessel, the gossip columns tucked safely away, she realizes that joyful loneliness isn't emptiness—it's the space where healing begins. <words>354</words> 

The corporation will fall, the truth will emerge, and Elena's death will mean something. <words>368</words> Kira's forthright nature, tempered by loss and sharpened by solitude, has found its perfect expression. <words>383</words> She sells truth now, peddling justice to anyone who will listen, her redemption path lit by the universe's eternal humming song. <words>405</words>
