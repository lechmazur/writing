Mortimer shuffled into the witch's crystal scrying room, his arthritic fingers clutching an unmarked cardboard tube. <words>16</words> The grumpy crypt caretaker had tended graves for forty years, but tonight's stargazing would unveil truths he'd buried deeper than any corpse. <words>37</words>

The witch gestured toward her sand mandala, its intricate patterns glowing beneath constellation light streaming through the obsidian skylight. <words>56</words> "Your trauma multiplies within you, Mortimer—each suppressed memory spawning another until they threaten uprising," she intoned, her voice carrying grandiose weight despite its whisper. <words>81</words>

He jiggled the tube nervously, knowing what lay inside: his daughter's final drawing before the plague took her. <words>99</words> For decades, he'd convinced himself that tending the dead honored her memory, but the witch saw through his façade. <words>119</words> "The living cannot heal by dwelling among bones," she said, sprinkling colored sand. <words>132</words>

As stars wheeled overhead, Mortimer watched the mandala's patterns shift and flow. <words>144</words> Each grain seemed to multiply singular moments—his daughter's laughter echoing through crypts, her small hand in his, her fevered final breath. <words>166</words> The witch's crystals caught starlight, projecting these memories across the room's curved walls. <words>180</words>

"Trauma shapes us," the witch continued, her fingers tracing spirals in sand. <words>192</words> "Not through its presence, but through how we transform it." <words>202</words> She beckoned him forward. <words>206</words> "Add your truth to the mandala." <words>212</words>

Mortimer's hands trembled as he opened the tube, revealing the drawing: a sun with a smiling face, crudely beautiful in its innocence. <words>235</words> He understood now—his grumpiness wasn't protecting him from pain but multiplying it, creating an uprising of bitter ghosts within his chest. <words>257</words>

Carefully, he placed the drawing at the mandala's center. <words>266</words> The sand seemed to jiggle and dance, incorporating this artifact of love into its cosmic pattern. <words>282</words> Through the scrying room's crystals, he saw not death but life—not endings but transformations. <words>296</words>

"The importance of trauma," the witch said softly, "lies not in its weight but in its alchemy." <words>313</words> The stars above seemed to pulse in agreement. <words>321</words>

For the first time in forty years, Mortimer smiled. <words>330</words> The uprising within him quieted, not through suppression but through acceptance. <words>341</words> His daughter lived on—not in cold crypts but in every sunrise that reminded him of her drawing, in every act of tenderness he'd denied himself. <words>367</words>

As dawn approached, the mandala's sands settled into new configurations, holding both sorrow and joy in perfect balance. <words>385</words> Mortimer left the tube behind, empty now but somehow lighter for having carried its burden so long. <words>402</words> The witch nodded knowingly—another soul had discovered that healing begins when we stop multiplying our singular wounds. <words>419</words>
