Marina's dice clattered across the maintenance table at the tidal power monitoring station, their ivory faces catching the flicker of homemade candles. <words>18</words> She'd discovered the rustic candle mold in the supply closet weeks ago, back when the generators first started failing during high tide. <words>39</words> Now their candlelit dinners had become ritual—her fellow technicians placing bets on everything from turbine output to tomorrow's weather, while she rolled for stakes she couldn't afford. <words>67</words>

The unspoken bargains hung between them like sea fog: whoever won got first pick of overtime shifts, last one standing kept the emergency rations, losers covered the winner's overnight monitoring duties. <words>98</words> Marina never questioned why they gambled instead of simply scheduling, never wondered why her colleagues smiled sadly when she threw the dice with such hope. <words>124</words>

Tonight felt different—the waves crashed with rarely predictable violence against the station's hull. <words>138</words> "Double or nothing," she whispered, watching her last paycheck's worth of chips slide across the table. <words>155</words> Her supervisor, Chen, laughed until tears rolled down his weathered cheeks. <words>166</words> "Kid, you remind me of myself before the company decided to dock our hazard pay." <words>182</words>

The midnight lectures started then, as they always did when Marina lost everything. <words>196</words> Professor Hendricks—unhinged since the university cut his tenure—would emerge from the observation deck, ranting about probability theory and tidal coefficients. <words>216</words> "The house always wins because the ocean always takes!" he'd shout, gesturing wildly at equations scrawled on napkins. <words>234</words> His rebellious sermons on systemic exploitation and rigged games echoed through the station while Marina poured fresh wax into the old mold. <words>257</words>

She understood now why they kept playing, kept laughing through tears. <words>268</words> The station's decommission notice had arrived last month—they'd all be unemployed when the new automated system came online. <words>286</words> These games weren't about winning; they were about pretending they still had choices, still had time. <words>303</words>

Marina struck a match, lighting the newest candle. <words>311</words> "One more round?" she asked, her voice catching between a sob and a giggle. <words>326</words> They all nodded, pushing their worthless chips back to center. <words>337</words> Outside, the turbines groaned against the relentless tide, generating just enough power to keep the emergency lights blinking—a futile rhythm against the approaching dark. <words>362</words>

She rolled the dice again, chasing that last spark of hope before oblivion claimed their small world. <words>379</words> The candle flame danced in the reflection of her tears as she laughed at the impossible odds, finally understanding the cruelest bargain of all: they'd traded their futures for these fleeting moments of warmth and bitter joy. <words>417</words>
