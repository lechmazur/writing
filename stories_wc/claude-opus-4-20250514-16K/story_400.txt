Morrigan, the last druid, stood among frost-kissed apple trees suspended impossibly over crystalline chasms, contemplating whether today's birthday ritual was worth the terror. <words>24</words> Three centuries had passed since the final human footsteps echoed away, leaving only her and the glacial orchard's ancient magic. <words>44</words> She fingered the dull safety pin—her grandmother's final gift—that held together her tattered robes, its ordinariness a mockery of her extraordinary isolation. <words>68</words> 

The birthday feast required gathering: ice-bloom petals, frozen sap, and most crucially, voices from the orchard's sleeping spirits. <words>86</words> But waking them meant breaking the silence she'd cultivated like armor, that blessed muteness protecting her from memories of laughter, arguments, songs. <words>109</words> Her fear of sound had grown monstrous, yet the ritual demanded noise—specifically, the traditional birthday chant her mother once sang while kneading starfruit bread. <words>135</words>

"Ridiculous," she muttered, then flinched at her own voice cracking across the frozen air like a whip. <words>153</words> The irony wasn't lost on her: Earth's final guardian, paralyzed by the very thing that once defined humanity—communication. <words>172</words> She felt fiercely ambivalent about everything now—preserving traditions for no one, maintaining an orchard that fed only ghosts, existing when existence itself seemed pointless. <words>197</words>

Yet muscle memory persisted. <words>201</words> Her hands gathered ingredients while her mind rebelled, each movement a battle between duty and despair. <words>218</words> The safety pin pricked her finger as she reached for winterberries, drawing a bead of blood that steamed in the arctic air. <words>241</words> "Happy birthday to me," she whispered sardonically, watching the droplet freeze mid-fall. <words>254</words>

The spirits stirred, sensing her preparations. <words>260</words> They hungered for the feast, for the ancient words that would release them briefly from their slumber. <words>277</words> Morrigan's throat constricted. <words>280</words> Three hundred years of silence versus one moment of song—the mathematics of loneliness were cruel. <words>296</words>

She arranged the meal on ice-carved plates: phantom bread, memory wine, sorrow-berries glazed with regret. <words>312</words> The safety pin glinted dully in the eternal twilight, reminding her of simpler times when broken things could be mended. <words>333</words> Drawing a shuddering breath, she began the chant, each syllable a small death, each note a resurrection. <words>351</words>

The orchard erupted with ghostly celebration, spectral voices joining hers in terrible, beautiful cacophony. <words>366</words> Tears froze on her cheeks as she sang louder, shattering her fear like ice beneath spring's first touch. <words>385</words> When the last echo faded, she stood trembling but triumphant, surrounded by grateful spirits and empty plates. <words>403</words>

"Until next year," she promised them, her voice steady now, almost amused by her own survival. <words>420</words> The safety pin held firm. <words>425</words>
