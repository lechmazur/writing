The convicted dream thief sat cross-legged in the forgotten library, its treehouse walls groaning against centuries of silence. <words>18</words> After the last human was born—a mathematical impossibility she could never quite calculate—the world had emptied of dreamers, leaving her profession obsolete. <words>41</words> 

She clutched the flimsy photo album, its pages brittle as moth wings, studying images of herself playing cricket with strangers whose faces she'd stolen dreams from. <words>68</words> Each photograph showed a different version: the thief who counted on fingers, the woman who couldn't divide her own guilt, the criminal who measured redemption in impossible fractions. <words>97</words>

"Seven billion, eight billion," she muttered, trying to remember Earth's final population, but numbers scattered like startled birds whenever she reached for them. <words>121</words> The fragmented self—that's what the judge had called her condition during sentencing, as if stealing dreams had split her into countless incomplete equations. <words>145</words>

Thunder. <words>146</words> She needed thunder. <words>149</words> 

In dreams, she'd learned, thunder meant awakening, meant the sleeper might surface before she could finish her work. <words>167</words> But in this empty world, no storms came. <words>175</words> The skies hung silent as funeral shrouds. <words>182</words>

She turned another page: herself mid-bowling, arm cocked back, ready to plunge forward into the cricket pitch's hungry earth. <words>202</words> That shared love for the sport had been her method—joining neighborhood matches, earning trust, slipping into minds when guards dropped with exhaustion. <words>226</words> 

"If X equals the number of dreams stolen," she whispered, tracing equations in dust, "and Y equals the fragments of self lost, then thunder equals..." <words>252</words> 

Nothing. <words>253</words> Mathematics betrayed her again. <words>257</words>

The treehouse library held books about probability, about the odds of humanity's extinction, about the statistical likelihood of redemption. <words>276</words> She'd read them all, understood none. <words>283</words> Numbers swam past her comprehension like fish in dark water. <words>293</words>

But she knew this: somewhere in the album's fading chemistry lived the formula for summoning storms. <words>309</words> Each stolen dream had contained its own fraction of thunder, and if she could only add them correctly, multiply their essence, divide their power among the empty clouds... <words>339</words>

She stood, album pressed against her chest, and climbed to the highest branch. <words>352</words> Below stretched the world's last cricket ground, its boundary lines still visible beneath decades of moss. <words>369</words> 

"I plunge," she announced to no one, leaping into the vacuum where mathematics and madness met. <words>386</words> The album's pages scattered like white birds, each carrying its fragment of stolen thunder, her divided selves finally attempting the impossible sum. <words>409</words>

The sky considered her offering with ancient patience. <words>417</words> Then, from the emptiness above, a single rumble—not quite thunder, but close enough for a thief's fractured arithmetic. <words>436</words>

She smiled, suspended between earth and heaven, finally understanding the equation: one whole person equals infinite fragments, falling. <words>454</words>
