The minstrel's broken watch band caught starlight as she spread polaroid photographs across the obsidian table. <words>16</words> Above the endless city, the black velvet sky-lounge rotated slowly, its glass walls revealing nothing but night. <words>33</words> 

She'd been dismayed at first—hired to sing of boundaries that didn't exist. <words>46</words> But the photographs held secrets. <words>51</words> Each faded image showed rooftop gardens from decades past, their locations now lost in the sprawling metropolis below. <words>69</words> She traced their edges with practiced fingers, excavating memories that weren't hers. <words>81</words>

"Subjectively rational," she muttered, arranging the photos in spirals. <words>90</words> What seemed like madness had method—each garden's placement followed patterns only she could see. <words>105</words> The broken timepiece had stopped precisely when the city's expansion erased its final boundary. <words>120</words> Now she sang to empty chairs while studying these frozen moments. <words>132</words>

A polaroid slipped free: a woman watering moonflowers beside a rusted fence. <words>144</words> Another showed children chasing fireflies where skyscrapers now pierced clouds. <words>154</words> Each photograph revealed coordinates in the endless grid below—not through labels or landmarks, but through shadows, through the angle of a gardener's smile, through the particular way light fell on soil that no longer existed. <words>189</words>

The lounge's proprietor brought her whiskey. <words>195</words> "Still mapping?" <words>197</words>

She nodded, adjusting the broken band absently. <words>204</words> Time meant nothing here anyway. <words>209</words> The city grew outward eternally, consuming horizons with mechanical hunger. <words>219</words> But these photographs proved boundaries once existed—garden walls, property lines, the edges where one life ended and another began. <words>238</words>

By cross-referencing shadows and architectural ghosts, she'd already excavated seventeen lost gardens. <words>250</words> Their locations formed constellations on her hand-drawn map. <words>258</words> Connect them right, and they'd reveal the city's original heart—the first garden, the source of all secrets. <words>276</words>

She sang as she worked, her voice carrying across the lounge's emptiness. <words>288</words> The melody mapped distances between what was and what remained. <words>298</words> Each note placed another pin on her chart of endless night. <words>309</words>

A new photograph surfaced from the pile: her own grandmother planting seeds by lamplight. <words>323</words> The broken watch band had been whole then, gleaming on the old woman's wrist. <words>337</words> The minstrel smiled—dismay transforming into purpose. <words>343</words>

She'd been hired to sing of boundaries, yes. <words>351</words> But she'd chosen to excavate them instead, one garden at a time, until her map revealed every secret the endless city had swallowed. <words>375</words> The night stretched infinite beyond the lounge's windows, but infinity could be charted if you knew where to look. <words>394</words>

Tomorrow, she'd descend with her map. <words>400</words> Tonight, she sang to the photographs, to the gardens, to the boundaries waiting to be reborn. <words>416</words>
