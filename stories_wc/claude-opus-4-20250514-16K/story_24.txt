The Mountain of Lost Words housed more than books—it sheltered broken souls in its cavernous bars between the stacks. <words>18</words> Elias, the meandering bard, navigated its spiraling corridors with purpose disguised as aimlessness, his puppet case bumping against dusty shelves. <words>38</words> In the depths where literature gave way to liquor, he found them: the readers who'd forgotten how to feel. <words>57</words>

Tonight's venue was The Marginalia, a bar wedged between Philosophy and Fiction, where patrons nursed whiskey and unread messages. <words>76</words> The mountain bookstore's labyrinthine design had birthed these pockets of despair—once-eager readers now hiding from apologies they couldn't send. <words>96</words> Elias unpacked his puppets, each ordinarily extraordinary in their careful imperfections, stitched from book pages and library cards. <words>114</words>

"Ladies and gentlemen," he announced to the scattered drinkers, "tonight's show features Napoleon's actual dentures!" <words>129</words> He produced yellowed teeth from velvet cloth—obvious fakes, yet somehow commanding attention. <words>141</words> The puppet emperor, wearing the ridiculous dentures, began lamenting his exile not from France, but from human connection. <words>159</words>

Through subversive tales, Elias's puppets dismantled the audience's defenses. <words>168</words> A wooden Marie Curie discovered radium in heartbreak; a felt Shakespeare wrote sonnets to his unsent texts. <words>185</words> The dentures passed from puppet to puppet, each character speaking truths too painful for human mouths. <words>201</words>

The bartender, accustomed to Elias's appearances, dimmed the lights. <words>210</words> In the mountain's belly, surrounded by millions of unread stories, the bard's miniature theater radiated warmth like a campfire in winter. <words>231</words> His wandering through the bookstore's maze wasn't random—he sought the cold corners where people dwelt in that terrible lull before reconciliation. <words>253</words>

"Even Napoleon apologized," the puppet emperor declared, dentures chattering. <words>262</words> "Not for conquering nations, but for the smaller wars—the silent treatments, the turned backs, the love allowed to frost over." <words>283</words>

A woman in the corner finally pulled out her phone. <words>294</words> Others followed, thumbs hovering over keyboards, drafting words they'd swallowed for months. <words>306</words> This fractured idyll—a paradise of books transformed into a refuge for the lonely—began to heal. <words>322</words>

Elias packed his puppets carefully, leaving the dentures on the bar. <words>333</words> Someone would claim them, use them in their own story of recovery. <words>346</words> He'd sown what he came to sow: the courage to breach silence. <words>359</words> By dawn, he'd reach another broken corner of the mountain, where hearts grown cold waited unknowingly for puppet shows and fake teeth. <words>382</words> The labyrinthine bookstore held infinite hiding places, but Elias, in his meandering way, would find them all. <words>399</words> Tomorrow, more warmth would radiate from unlikely stages, melting the ice between souls who'd forgotten they weren't meant to read alone. <words>421</words>
