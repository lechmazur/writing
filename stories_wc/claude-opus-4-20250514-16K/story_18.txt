Minerva stood motionless in the steam-powered city square, her granite form weathered smooth by decades of soot-laden fog. <words>16</words> Only the threadbare hair tie wrapped around her stone wrist betrayed that she'd once been flesh. <words>32</words> Throughout planning for the Grand Deception—the mayor's scheme to flood the lower districts—she'd listened with her peculiar gift. <words>51</words> Telepathy came easier to statues; stillness amplified thoughts like brass horns catching whispers. <words>64</words>

The square bustled with oblivious crowds, their minds crackling with comfortable lies beneath the hissing pipes overhead. <words>81</words> "Progress demands sacrifice," they told themselves, never questioning whose sacrifice it would be. <words>94</words> Minerva's consciousness stirred, tragically joyful at each discovered truth—each revelation both vindication and heartbreak. <words>108</words> She'd been right to suspect, wrong to hope otherwise. <words>117</words>

As autumn approached, she began to weatherize herself differently than before. <words>128</words> Instead of merely enduring the elements, she channeled condensation into careful patterns across her surface. <words>143</words> With the flow of ink in calligraphy, moisture traced revelations in elegant script that appeared and vanished with each passing cloud. <words>164</words> Citizens paused, puzzled by the ephemeral messages: "The valves will open Thursday." <words>176</words> "Your cousin knows about the bribes." <words>182</words> "The water rises while you sleep." <words>188</words>

Some dismissed the writing as coincidental weathering, but others experienced the light of recognition—that terrible, wonderful moment when comfortable darkness gives way to unwelcome illumination. <words>213</words> A merchant recognized his own guilty thoughts. <words>220</words> An engineer saw her complicity spelled in condensed steam. <words>229</words> One by one, they understood. <words>234</words>

The mayor's assistant, Charlotte, approached one drizzling evening, drawn by rumors of the prophetic statue. <words>249</words> She'd helped draft the flooding plans, convinced herself it was for the greater good. <words>264</words> But as she read Minerva's latest inscription—"Charlotte's mother lives on Ash Street"—her knees buckled. <words>279</words> Ash Street sat in the lowest district. <words>286</words>

Minerva felt Charlotte's mind shatter and rebuild, lies crumbling like old mortar. <words>298</words> The assistant ran through the square, shouting warnings, clutching stolen blueprints. <words>309</words> Some called her mad, but others remembered the statue's words and listened. <words>321</words>

Throughout the night, Minerva transcribed every secret she'd gathered, her surface becoming a manifesto of truth in the gaslight's glow. <words>342</words> By dawn, half the city had read her revelations. <words>351</words> The planned flood was exposed, the mayor arrested, the valves sealed. <words>362</words>

Later, Charlotte returned with tools, insisting on freeing the statue who'd saved thousands. <words>375</words> But Minerva transmitted a gentle refusal. <words>381</words> She'd found her purpose: standing witness, weathering lies, writing truth in water's honest hand. <words>395</words> The hair tie caught the morning light, and Charlotte understood—some prisons we choose, when freedom means abandoning our post. <words>414</words> Minerva settled back into stillness, tragically joyful, forever listening in the steam and shadows. <words>428</words>
