Marina stood at the edge of the prismatic lake, its surface fracturing sunlight into rainbow shards that danced between the construction barriers. <words>21</words> The magician's trunk lay open beside her, its modestly extravagant velvet lining faded but still holding pretensions of grandeur. <words>40</words> She clutched the simple drawer knob she'd unscrewed from its face—brass worn smooth by years of pre-show rituals. <words>59</words>

Behind her, bulldozers slept like metal beasts amid the half-built amphitheater that would soon replace the old playground. <words>77</words> Only the seesaw remained, and when the wind caught it, its squeak echoed across the water like a metronome of memory. <words>98</words>

Marina had performed here as a child, before the joy leaked out through invisible wounds. <words>113</words> Now she was a joyless performer, mechanically producing wonder for audiences while feeling none herself. <words>128</words> The construction foreman had given her one day to organize her things, to decide what to keep from the old dressing room they'd demolished. <words>152</words>

But she wasn't here for props. <words>158</words>

The drawer knob had hidden a compartment in her trunk, and inside lay two letters. <words>173</words> One contained the truth about the accident—how her recklessness during a escape trick had cost her assistant his mobility. <words>192</words> The other held the lie she'd told authorities, the version that absolved her, the story everyone believed. <words>209</words>

She was torn between truths, between confession and self-preservation. <words>218</words>

The seesaw squeaked again, and she remembered Benjamin pushing her higher, laughing before he became her assistant, before the chains bound too tight, before everything changed. <words>244</words> The sound was a ghost language, translating her guilt into something almost bearable. <words>257</words>

With cautious abandon, she began to organize not objects but intentions. <words>268</words> She placed the truthful letter on the velvet lining and held the lie over the prismatic water. <words>285</words> The lake reflected her fractured self back in every color of regret. <words>297</words>

The construction would bury this place, but it couldn't bury what happened. <words>309</words> The seesaw's echo grew fainter as clouds gathered, and Marina understood that some performances never truly end. <words>326</words> She let the false letter fall into the lake, watching it sink into the prismatic depths. <words>342</words>

Tomorrow, she would mail the truth to Benjamin. <words>350</words> Tonight, she would sit on the seesaw one last time, finding in its rhythm a different kind of performance—one where the only audience that mattered was her conscience. <words>379</words> The drawer knob slipped from her fingers, a small brass period at the end of a long, dishonest sentence. <words>398</words>

She pushed off gently, and for the first time in years, the squeak sounded almost like music. <words>415</words>
