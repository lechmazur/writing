Mira never wanted the orchard, but the cursed trees chose her anyway, their chrome branches weeping synthetic sap in the heart of Neo-Tokyo's agricultural district. <words>23</words> She'd inherited it from her grandmother, along with the burden of tending to fruit that whispered forgotten names and grew backwards into themselves. <words>45</words> Each morning, she'd slip through the holographic barriers before the city's surveillance drones awakened, her fingers dancing across puzzle-locks on abandoned farmhouses that dotted the orchard's edges. <words>72</words> These rotting structures held fragments of the curse's origin—data chips embedded in moldering walls, quantum-encrypted journals, and once, impossibly, a fossilized dragon tooth she'd discovered in a cave beneath the oldest farmhouse's foundation. <words>104</words>

The tooth changed everything. <words>107</words> Its surface bore microscopic inscriptions that her scanner revealed to be genetic code, not of dragons, but of the very trees she tended. <words>130</words> With gleeful precision, she began mapping connections between the farmhouses' secrets and the orchard's affliction, her analytical mind treating each discovery like a child's game of cosmic hide-and-seek. <words>158</words> She'd grip the tooth during her investigations, feeling its ancient warmth pulse against her palm, as if it remembered when dragons and technology were one. <words>184</words>

In the hush of a hidden sunrise—that precious moment when the city's lights dimmed but the sun hadn't yet triggered the day-cycle programs—Mira understood. <words>209</words> The orchard wasn't cursed; it was a living archive, each tree a repository of stories the world had chosen to forget. <words>230</words> The farmhouses were decoders, left by those who'd tried before her to translate the trees' cryptic language. <words>247</words> Her grandmother hadn't been a caretaker but a failed translator, and now Mira held the key—literally—in the form of a dragon's tooth that bridged organic memory and digital consciousness. <words>276</words>

She laughed, a sound both joyous and mournful, realizing her destiny. <words>287</words> To become the voice of the unknown meant accepting that some mysteries demanded not just solving, but living within their questions. <words>308</words> The trees began to hum in harmony with the tooth's vibrations, their chrome bark reflecting the sunrise in fractal patterns that spelled out stories in languages yet to be invented. <words>338</words> Mira opened her neural interface, preparing to download centuries of hidden knowledge, knowing that each revelation would erase a piece of who she'd been before. <words>363</words> But wasn't that the price of giving voice to the voiceless? <words>374</words> She pressed the tooth to her temple, felt the orchard's roots dig deeper into her consciousness, and began to speak in tongues of metal and moss, sorrow and celebration intertwined. <words>404</words> The reluctant caretaker had become the willing prophet. <words>412</words>
