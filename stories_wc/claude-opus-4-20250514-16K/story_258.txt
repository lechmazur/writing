The nimble locksmith arrived at the floating orchard as salt spray kissed apple blossoms, her fingers clutching the torn map corner that had cost everything. <words>22</words> For decades, she'd picked locks to memories, but this driftwood sanctuary held the last repository of the Arawak fire dances. <words>42</words> 

The orchard existed in that physically metaphysical space where belief and matter intertwined—visible only to those who still remembered. <words>62</words> She'd discovered its location via dusty yearbooks with questionable annotations, scrawled by missionaries who'd documented what they'd tried to erase. <words>83</words> "Dance of the Rising Smoke," one margin read, followed by crude sketches of movements they'd deemed satanic. <words>100</words>

Now, as waves lapped against the ancient oaks' roots tangled in driftwood, she understood why the elders had hidden this place. <words>122</words> The trees themselves were living libraries, their bark inscribed with choreography in languages the world had forgotten. <words>139</words> She began to prance—the word felt foolish until her feet found the rhythm, and suddenly it was the only verb that captured the sacred lightness required. <words>166</words>

A storm of secrets erupted as her movements unlocked each tree's knowledge. <words>178</words> Ghost dancers materialized between the branches, their forms teaching her the ceremonies: the Hurricane Summoning, the Cassava Blessing, the Soul-Fire Kindle. <words>199</words> Her locksmith tools hung useless at her belt; these locks required motion, not metal. <words>214</words>

Years of breaking into houses had given her the agility, but nothing had prepared her for this jaded wonder—the exhaustion of discovering how much had been lost mixed with awe at what remained. <words>247</words> Each dance she learned carved itself into her muscle memory, a preservation more permanent than any archive. <words>264</words>

The floating orchard creaked, its driftwood foundation ancient as the cultures it protected. <words>277</words> She noticed the single oak at its center, leaves brown and clinging. <words>289</words> The torn map corner in her pocket grew warm—when the final leaf drops from the ancient oak, it had warned. <words>309</words> 

She danced faster, learning the Ancestor Awakening, the Star Navigation, the Storm Calming. <words>322</words> The last leaf trembled. <words>326</words> Time was a lock she couldn't pick, but she could become the key herself, her body a vessel for movements that refused to die. <words>350</words>

As the leaf spiraled down, she performed the Dance of Eternal Return, and understood: the orchard would sink, but she would carry it within her. <words>375</words> The secret storm would rage in her bones, in her breath, in every step she'd teach to those ready to remember. <words>396</words> The leaf touched water, and the orchard began its descent, but she was already dancing on the waves. <words>414</words>
