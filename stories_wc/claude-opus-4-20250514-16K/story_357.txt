Margot adjusted her spectacles, studying the frost giant's latest move across the crystalline board with the intensity only a focused collector could muster. <words>21</words> The giant's lair sparkled with icicles that caught the candlelight, but she barely noticed, too absorbed in cataloging patterns—her way of keeping despair, that alpha predator, at bay. <words>49</words> 

"Your turn, little human," rumbled Bjorn, though his tone held surprising warmth for someone who'd frozen villages. <words>67</words> 

She opened her journal, fingering the black rose pinned inside—pressed and preserved from her first victory against loneliness. <words>86</words> People called her seldom odd, which she supposed meant predictably peculiar, but here in Bjorn's cave, playing endless rounds of Kingdoms & Crystals, she'd found her sanctuary. <words>113</words>

"Oh, delightful," she muttered, moving her piece, "you've cornered my knights again." <words>126</words> Three games in, and she was starting to unravel his strategy—repetitive patterns hidden beneath chaotic moves. <words>143</words> 

That's when the raven arrived, frost-burned and carrying an embossed invitation. <words>154</words> "The Midwinter Gala requests your presence," Bjorn read aloud, eyebrows raised like glaciers. <words>168</words> 

Margot laughed, a sound like bells in winter. <words>176</words> "They do this every year, hoping I'll abandon my hermitage." <words>186</words> She tucked the invitation between journal pages, another artifact for her collection of declined social obligations. <words>203</words>

"You never go?" Bjorn asked, rolling dice carved from permafrost. <words>214</words>

"Why would I trade this for small talk about weather?" <words>224</words> She captured his crystal fortress with a move she'd been planning for six turns. <words>239</words> "Besides, despair doesn't stalk me here." <words>245</words>

The giant chuckled, a sound like avalanches. <words>252</words> "You know, I started hosting game nights because the villagers stopped visiting after that unfortunate freezing incident." <words>270</words>

"Their loss," Margot said cheerfully, setting up the next round. <words>281</words> "You have excellent taste in strategic gaming." <words>288</words>

As midnight approached and their seventh game commenced, she realized the invitation had done its work—not by luring her away, but by confirming what she already knew. <words>316</words> Here, matching wits with a frost giant over elaborate board games, she'd built a fortress against despair stronger than any party's false warmth could provide. <words>342</words> 

"Check," she announced, moving her ice queen across the board. <words>353</words>

"You're getting better," Bjorn admitted, studying the board with ancient eyes. <words>365</words>

"I'm a collector," she replied, grinning. <words>371</words> "I collect victories, strategies, and quiet Thursday nights." <words>379</words> She glanced at her journal, where the black rose kept watch over tallied wins and documented moves. <words>397</words> "But mostly, I collect proof that solitude isn't surrender—it's triumph." <words>407</words>

Bjorn smiled, revealing teeth like stalactites. <words>413</words> "Rematch?" <words>414</words>

"Always." <words>415</words>
