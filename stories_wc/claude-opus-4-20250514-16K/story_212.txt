Elara knelt in the crystalline soil of the ethereal plains, her weathered hands coaxing life from seeds that shouldn't exist. <words>19</words> After the last resource war, the boundaries between ocean and land had dissolved, leaving ghost tides that carried messages in bottles across fields of translucent wheat. <words>44</words> She'd been breeding these impossible crops for seven years, ever since escaping the Conclave's agricultural compounds where every seed, every harvest, every breath belonged to them. <words>70</words>

Today's bottle clinked against a phosphorescent stone. <words>77</words> Inside, wrapped in kelp that whispered of forgotten seas, lay a magician's deck of trick cards—typically atypical for these waters that weren't waters. <words>100</words> Each card shimmered with instructions for splicing reality itself into her seeds. <words>112</words> The Queen of Spirals showed her how to weave tomorrow's rain into yesterday's drought. <words>126</words> The Fool's Mirror revealed which memories to plant for crops that could grow backwards through time. <words>142</words>

"Listen, listen, they're singing again," Elara began to jabber to the seeds, her words tumbling like dice. <words>159</words> "The boundaries hum their song—between what was ocean and what is field, between servant and free, between possible and impossible." <words>180</words> Her voice cracked with the raw solace of understanding. <words>189</words> The Conclave had tried to contain nature itself, drawing lines around what could grow, who could grow it. <words>207</words> But here, where the war had torn reality's fabric, those boundaries sang a different tune. <words>223</words>

She shuffled the trick deck, each card transforming as it touched her calloused fingers. <words>237</words> The Ace of Tides became a seed packet. <words>245</words> The Seven of Echoes sprouted tendrils that reached toward the ghost sea's horizon. <words>258</words> These weren't mere illusions—in the ethereal plains, magic and agriculture had fused into something typically atypical, something the Conclave could never control. <words>281</words>

Another bottle bobbed across the shimmering field, carrying news from other boundary-singers, other escaped farmers learning to grow freedom itself. <words>301</words> Elara planted the card-seeds in spiraling patterns, each one a note in the song that would eventually dissolve all borders. <words>321</words> The Conclave's rigid rows and regulated harvests seemed like ancient history now. <words>333</words> Here, she grew wild futures from impossible pasts, nourished by an ocean that existed in the spaces between what was and what could be. <words>357</words>

As twilight painted the ethereal plains in colors that had no names, Elara's crops began their evening chorus. <words>375</words> They sang of boundaries not as walls but as doorways, not as limits but as invitations to transform. <words>393</words> She smiled, tasting salt on the wind that shouldn't exist, feeling the raw solace of a life finally her own. <words>413</words>
