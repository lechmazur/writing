The Andromedae emissary arrived at Earth's orbital debris tracking station clutching a thin coathanger, her six fingers trembling against the wire. <words>17</words> She'd bent it into the shape of their sacred symbol—branches spreading outward like veins of possibility. <words>33</words> 

Station Chief Martinez lurched backward when she materialized in the break room during Thursday's picnic. <words>48</words> "We expected you in the docking bay," he stammered, watching her study the fridge where postcards from every Earth nation rustled in the ventilation current. <words>73</words>

"Your patterns," she whispered, touching a card from Tibet. <words>82</words> The coathanger in her hand began glowing, its branches multiplying into fractal geometries that mapped themselves against the postcards' images. <words>102</words> "Each picture holds mathematical constants—golden ratios in your mountains, Fibonacci spirals in your storms." <words>117</words>

Throughout their weekly picnics, she'd return, always through impossible angles—emerging from supply closets, stepping out of monitor screens, once even rising from Martinez's potato salad. <words>142</words> The staff learned to set an extra place, though she never ate, only observed their interactions with ancient eyes. <words>162</words>

"Why the coathanger?" intern Chen asked during the fifth picnic. <words>172</words>

She twisted it again, and suddenly they could see it—every piece of space debris the station tracked formed the same branching pattern. <words>195</words> "Your discarded satellites follow the same laws as your postcards, your friendships, your redemptions," she said. <words>212</words> "I came to learn if humans understood their own wisdom." <words>222</words>

Martinez laughed nervously. <words>225</words> "We just track junk to prevent collisions." <words>232</words>

"No," she corrected gently. <words>236</words> "You map the universe's tendency toward connection." <words>243</words> Through the rustle of postcards pinned to the fridge door, they heard it then—a cosmic whisper that sounded like orbits singing. <words>265</words> Each trajectory they'd catalogued wasn't random but part of an infinite web, every piece of debris a choice seeking its redemption. <words>287</words>

On her final visit, she left the coathanger hanging among the postcards. <words>299</words> When Chen touched it, she saw everything—how Earth's orbital debris would eventually form rings like Saturn's, how those rings would catch cosmic dust, how that dust would birth new moons. <words>330</words> The pattern of destruction becoming creation, repeating endlessly. <words>338</words>

"Your species' greatest wisdom comes by accident," the emissary said, fading into the ventilation shaft. <words>353</words> "You throw away coathangers and launch satellites, never knowing you're drawing the universe's autobiography across your sky." <words>370</words>

The tracking station still holds Thursday picnics. <words>377</words> They still monitor debris. <words>381</words> But now they see the patterns everywhere—in coffee swirls, in sandwich crumbs, in the way they orbit each other's lives. <words>402</words> The coathanger hangs there still, its branches catching light, teaching them that every discarded thing traces the path home. <words>422</words>
