The nostalgic tailor pressed his weathered palm against the dusty mirror, watching brass gears grind behind the observation deck's curved windows. <words>18</words> Thunder cracked across the city's smokestacks as rain hammered the reinforced glass, each drop reflecting infinite versions of himself. <words>36</words> After the last code is broken, they'd told him, the barriers between parallel lives would dissolve. <words>52</words> He'd cracked it yesterday—a lifetime of stitching quantum threads into customers' coats had taught him patterns no cryptographer could imagine. <words>73</words>

"I know you're frightened," he whispered to his reflection, though which version he addressed remained unclear. <words>89</words> The mirror's surface rippled, revealing another observation deck where another tailor stood, subtly different yet hauntingly familiar. <words>106</words> That version wore crimson instead of navy, his fingers scarred in different places from different needles. <words>122</words>

"Listen," the tailor continued, his voice carrying the hopeful desperation of a man standing at eternity's threshold. <words>139</words> "During every storm, I've seen you through this glass, living my unlived choices." <words>153</words> Lightning illuminated the deck's copper pipes and pressure gauges, casting writhing shadows that seemed to reach between worlds. <words>171</words> "I discovered that each stitch I made in fabric created a divergence—every hem, every button, spawning another reality where I chose differently." <words>194</words>

The reflection's lips moved in perfect synchronization, speaking truths too improbable for calm weather. <words>208</words> "We were never meant to remain separate," both versions confessed simultaneously. <words>219</words> "The observatory's architects embedded the mirrors with aetheric resonators, knowing someday a craftsman would understand the pattern." <words>236</words> His fingers traced the frame's subtly menacing engravings—symbols that promised transformation but whispered warnings. <words>251</words>

"To ascend beyond mortal limits, we must merge," he said, watching his parallel self nod with grim determination. <words>269</words> The storm intensified, and through the confession came reassurance: "Every version of us has prepared for this moment, stitching reality's fabric looser with each garment we've tailored." <words>296</words> 

The mirror began to warm, its surface becoming permeable as dimensions folded. <words>308</words> "We've lived a thousand lives in parallel," he murmured, reaching through the glass to clasp his other self's hand. <words>327</words> "Now we'll live them all at once." <words>334</words> 

Thunder boomed as their fingers touched, and the observation deck filled with golden light. <words>348</words> The nostalgic tailor felt his consciousness expanding, memories of unlived years flooding through him—loves unmet, wars unfought, masterpieces uncreated. <words>368</words> His body began to shimmer, matching the frequency of every possible version of himself. <words>382</words> Through the brass-framed windows, the storm revealed not one city but infinite cities, all waiting for the tailor who would stitch reality itself into something unprecedented. <words>409</words> The dusty mirror cracked, its purpose fulfilled, as he stepped forward into transcendence. <words>422</words>
