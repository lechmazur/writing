Marcel's fingers, trained to lift wallets from unsuspecting marks, trembled as they touched the ventriloquist dummy's carved cheek in the lighthouse engine room. <words>20</words> The wooden figure sat upright against rusted gears, its painted eyes fixed on him with confusingly lucid awareness—alive yet not, seeing yet blind. <words>43</words> 

"You're between appointments," the dummy said without moving its lips, voice echoing off metal walls. <words>58</words> 

Marcel stumbled backward, his pickpocket's instincts screaming danger, but the door had vanished. <words>71</words> "What appointments?" <words>73</words>

"The ones where you steal pieces of people without transforming anything," the dummy replied, its head tilting impossibly far. <words>92</words> "Shall we begin?" <words>95</words>

The engine room's abandoned machinery groaned, releasing steam that formed words in the air. <words>109</words> Marcel watched, baffled, as the vapor spelled out verses about metamorphosis and revolution. <words>122</words> 

"Recite them," commanded the dummy with scorching poise, its painted smile widening. <words>134</words> 

Marcel's throat constricted, but poetry poured forth unbidden: "I pluck coins from pockets deep / While my own soul lies asleep / But transformation's truest art / Begins by changing one's own heart." <words>166</words>

The dummy applauded with wooden hands that shouldn't move. <words>175</words> "Better. <words>176</words> Now sustain it." <words>179</words>

Hours passed—or perhaps minutes—as Marcel found himself locked in impromptu poetry sessions with the eerie figure. <words>195</words> Each verse peeled away another layer of his practiced deceptions, revealing truths he'd pickpocketed from himself. <words>211</words> The haunted lighthouse engine room became a crucible where his old identity dissolved like morning fog. <words>227</words>

"Why?" Marcel gasped between stanzas, sweat beading on his forehead. <words>237</words>

"To challenge the status quo," the dummy whispered, its voice now indistinguishable from Marcel's own thoughts. <words>253</words> "The greatest theft is stealing back your authentic self from the world that shaped you into a thief." <words>271</words>

When dawn light finally pierced the engine room's grimy windows, Marcel stood transformed. <words>284</words> The dummy sat silent, ordinary wood once more. <words>292</words> But in Marcel's pocket, where stolen wallets once nested, lay folded papers covered in his poetry—verses about redemption, metamorphosis, and the peculiar magic of haunted places that force us to confront our truest selves. <words>326</words>

He left the lighthouse with empty hands but a full heart, understanding finally that the art of transformation required not taking from others, but giving oneself permission to change. <words>355</words> The door reappeared behind him, ready for the next appointment, the next lost soul seeking transformation through the dummy's confusingly lucid wisdom. <words>378</words>

Marcel never pickpocketed again, choosing instead to perform street poetry that challenged passersby to question their own status quo, sustaining the lighthouse's strange mission in the world beyond its walls. <words>408</words>
