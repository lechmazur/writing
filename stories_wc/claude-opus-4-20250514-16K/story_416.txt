Sir Aldric hadn't expected the Swamp Market to open immediately after the scoreboard reset at the jousting championship. <words>17</words> The luminous bog stretched endlessly, its phosphorescent waters casting emerald light on makeshift vendor stalls. <words>32</words> He'd thrown his academic scrolls into the moat years ago—too many rules, not enough legends. <words>48</words> Now he collected stories instead. <words>53</words>

The fossilized snail shell gleamed on the furthest shelf. <words>62</words> Last one. <words>64</words> Perfect. <words>65</words> His gauntleted hand reached forward just as another grabbed for it. <words>76</words> They collided. <words>78</words> Hard. <words>79</words>

"Mine," growled the stranger—a woman in tattered robes, eyes wild with purpose. <words>91</words>

"I touched it first," Aldric replied, though he hadn't. <words>100</words>

"Liar." <words>101</words> She smiled. <words>103</words> "You're here for the Spiral Prophet legend." <words>110</words>

His pulse quickened. <words>113</words> How did she know? <words>117</words> The fossil supposedly contained coordinates to verify the prophet's tomb—the greatest urban legend in seven kingdoms. <words>133</words>

"Split it?" she suggested. <words>137</words>

"Impossible." <words>138</words> The shell's spiral held the complete map. <words>145</words> Breaking it meant losing everything. <words>150</words>

They stood frozen, hands touching the ancient artifact. <words>158</words> The swamp's glow intensified around them. <words>164</words> Vendors watched. <words>166</words> Waited. <words>167</words>

"I'm Vera," she said suddenly. <words>172</words> "Failed scholar, successful thief." <words>176</words> Her fingers traced the shell's ridges. <words>182</words> "Been tracking this for years." <words>187</words>

"Sir Aldric." <words>189</words> He loosened his grip slightly. <words>194</words> "Knight who reads forbidden texts." <words>199</words>

She laughed—sharp, brief. <words>202</words> "We're both outcasts chasing stories." <words>207</words>

The vendor, an ancient crone, cackled. <words>213</words> "One price for both." <words>217</words> She pointed at their joined hands. <words>223</words> "Destiny converges here." <words>226</words>

Aldric studied Vera's scarred knuckles, her determined jaw. <words>234</words> She'd fought for knowledge like him. <words>240</words> Different methods, same hunger. <words>244</words>

"Partners?" he proposed. <words>247</words>

"Until we verify the tomb." <words>252</words> She nodded. <words>254</words> "Then we decide." <words>257</words>

They paid together, gold coins glinting in phosphorescent light. <words>266</words> The shell felt warm between their intertwined fingers. <words>274</words> Around them, the swamp pulsed with ancient magic, with possibilities. <words>284</words>

As they left the market, Aldric felt his rigid world expanding. <words>295</words> Rules had kept him alone. <words>300</words> Rebellion brought unexpected allies. <words>304</words> The fossil's weight in his pouch matched the lightness in his chest. <words>316</words>

"North?" Vera asked, consulting her stolen charts. <words>323</words>

"North," he confirmed, checking his banned manuscripts. <words>330</words>

Their boots squelched through glowing mud. <words>336</words> Two paths had crossed over one shell, creating something neither expected. <words>347</words> Tomorrow they'd hunt legends. <words>351</words> Tonight, they walked together through radiant mist, discussing impossible things with restrained joy. <words>364</words> The scoreboard's reset had ended one game. <words>371</words> Their collision had started another. <words>376</words>

Aldric smiled beneath his helm. <words>381</words> Sometimes the best discoveries came from breaking protocol. <words>389</words> Sometimes destiny arrived through clumsy hands and shared obsessions. <words>398</words> The swamp sang around them, and they listened, ready for whatever truth the spiral would reveal. <words>414</words>
