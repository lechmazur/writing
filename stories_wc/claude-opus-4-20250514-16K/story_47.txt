The hospice's soundless sanctuary had never hosted auditions before, but Margot, its most dutiful ward, understood why the dying patients wanted one last theatrical hurrah. <words>26</words> She adjusted her worn leather glove—a relic from her grandmother's deathbed magic tricks—and watched the performers file past the oxygen tanks and morphine drips. <words>50</words> Years of watching people die had made her eagerly jaded, craving the dark comedy in their final acts while still serving them tea with steady hands. <words>76</words> But something was wrong today. <words>81</words> Phones kept disappearing from the audition waiting room, and cryptic voice notes were appearing on the devices—fragments of confessions, whispered secrets, final words never meant to be heard. <words>109</words> 

"The glove knows," rasped Mrs. Chen from bed seven, her eyes following Margot's covered hand. <words>125</words> Margot had worn it for protection, both from bodily fluids and from feeling too much, but now she wondered if it held other purposes. <words>149</words> She began to solve the mystery by listening to each stolen recording, recognizing voices of the dying mixed with the living performers. <words>172</words> The messages weren't theft but gifts—patients were stealing phones to leave their own audition tapes, reframing the familiar ritual of last words into performance art. <words>198</words> 

Mr. Jamison, who hadn't spoken in weeks, had recorded a joke about death being the ultimate stage fright. <words>216</words> Sister Katherine, the nun in bed twelve, left a recording of herself singing bawdy sailors' songs. <words>232</words> Each message transformed their impending mortality into something unexpectedly alive. <words>242</words> 

During the actual auditions, professional actors performed Hamlet's soliloquies and dramatic death scenes, but Margot knew the real show was happening in the stolen phones. <words>267</words> She gathered the devices and played the recordings through the sanctuary's speakers, filling the silence with a cacophony of final laughs, confessions, and absurd observations about dying. <words>295</words> The actors stopped mid-monologue, stunned by the graceless beauty of authentic voices choosing joy over reverence. <words>311</words> 

Mrs. Chen smiled and pointed at Margot's glove again. <words>320</words> "Your grandmother left her own recording too, hidden in the leather's lining." <words>332</words> Margot felt the small device sewn inside, a final trick from the woman who taught her that death deserved laughter, not just tears. <words>355</words> She played it for the room: her grandmother's voice, recounting a dirty limerick about Saint Peter. <words>371</words> 

The auditions ended differently than planned—not with actors portraying death, but with the dying directing their own final scenes. <words>391</words> Margot kept her glove on, understanding now that protection meant preserving these fearless voices, each one reframing mortality's familiar face into something defiantly, messily human. <words>416</words> The sanctuary's silence had finally found its perfect sound: laughter in the face of the inevitable, graceless and beautiful and entirely true. <words>439</words>
