The morbid florist clutched her plain white candle as the floating rock dojo swayed gently beneath her feet. <words>18</words> She had come here, to this impossible place suspended between earth and stars, because Master Chen's final letter had obliged her to search through his trunk. <words>44</words> 

"The answers you seek about cosmic cycles lie within my typed pages," he had written. <words>59</words> Now, in the last flicker of a guttering lantern, she knelt before the weathered trunk, her hands trembling with what she privately called her neutral passion—that strange ability to care deeply while remaining emotionally distant. <words>94</words>

Years of arranging funeral wreaths had tempered her beliefs about death and rebirth. <words>107</words> Where once she saw only endings in wilted petals, she now perceived beginnings, cycles within cycles. <words>123</words> The trunk's hinges groaned as she lifted the lid, revealing thousands of yellowed pages, each typed with mechanical precision. <words>143</words>

She lit her candle from the dying lantern's flame, a boldly timid gesture—daring to continue in darkness yet fearing what illumination might reveal. <words>167</words> The first page she touched crumbled slightly: "The cosmos breathes through every bloom and decay." <words>182</words> 

Hours dissolved as she read by candlelight, each page revealing Master Chen's observations of how the dojo itself demonstrated cosmic principles—floating yet anchored, isolated yet connected to everything. <words>211</words> He had studied how chrysanthemums grew differently here, their roots reaching not down but outward into emptiness, drawing sustenance from stellar winds. <words>234</words>

"You will understand," one passage read, "when you stop seeing death as morbid and start seeing it as punctuation in an eternal sentence." <words>257</words> The candle wax pooled, marking time's passage as she absorbed his decades of contemplation. <words>271</words>

In the backlog's deepest layer, she found pressed flowers between pages—specimens from his experiments in growing life on floating stone. <words>291</words> Each bloom was labeled with cosmic coordinates rather than earthly names. <words>302</words> Her florist's eye recognized patterns in their preserved forms that matched the celestial charts he'd drawn. <words>318</words>

As her candle burned lower, matching the manuscript's dwindling stack, she felt her tempered beliefs shifting again. <words>335</words> The morbid fascination that had driven her to arrange flowers for the dead transformed into something larger—an understanding that every ending fed a beginning, that the dojo floated precisely because it had released its need for ground. <words>372</words>

The last page contained only one line: "Now you know why flowers reach toward light—they remember being stars." <words>390</words> 

Her candle died as dawn touched the dojo's edge, but she no longer needed its light. <words>406</words> She understood at last why Master Chen had chosen a morbid florist to inherit his life's work. <words>423</words> Death and life were not opposites but dance partners in the cosmic cycles, and she—neutrally passionate, boldly timid—was perfectly positioned to tend their eternal garden. <words>449</words>
