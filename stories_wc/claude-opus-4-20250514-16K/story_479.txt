Morgana Blackwood adjusted her diamond-studded gloves, scrolling through the abandoned profiles in the social network archive. <words>16</words> As the city's most glamorous undertaker, she specialized in digital death—preserving online legacies before servers crashed forever. <words>32</words> Her great-grandmother's brass measuring tape glinted beside her workstation, an heirloom from 1889. <words>46</words>

She'd been fruitlessly patient for three years, waiting for someone to understand her mission. <words>60</words> While others saw ordinariness in these forgotten profiles—vacation photos, birthday wishes, mundane status updates—Morgana recognized the myth. <words>77</words> Every life contained extraordinary threads if you knew how to elongate them, stretch them into their truest form. <words>95</words>

The ritual began during paint mixing, a family tradition her ancestor Esmeralda had discovered. <words>109</words> As pigments swirled together in her studio's corner, Morgana unfurled the brass measuring tape across her screen. <words>127</words> Each inch corresponded to a year of digital life, each marking a moment worth preserving. <words>142</words>

"Profile 47,892," she whispered with jubilant remorse, finding another soul abandoned to deletion. <words>155</words> Marcus Chen, accountant, father of two, amateur astronomer. <words>163</words> The algorithms deemed him ordinary, scheduled his memories for erasure. <words>173</words> But Morgana saw his midnight posts about constellations, his daughter's first piano recital video, his wife's cancer journey documented in hopeful updates. <words>196</words>

She pressed the measuring tape against the screen, performing the Blackwood preservation ritual. <words>209</words> The ancient practice required precision: measure the depth of a digital soul, multiply by love received, divide by tears shed. <words>229</words> As cobalt blue mixed with vermillion in her paint pot, the archive shimmered. <words>242</words> Marcus Chen's data began to elongate, transforming from compressed files into something eternal. <words>255</words>

Her grandmother had preserved letters; her mother, photographs. <words>263</words> Morgana preserved the illusion of ordinariness, revealing the extraordinary beneath. <words>273</words> Each profile she saved joined her private sanctuary, a hidden server where forgotten lives bloomed like digital flowers. <words>291</words>

The paint finished mixing—seafoam green, the color of new beginnings. <words>301</words> Another notification appeared: "Mass deletion in 24 hours." <words>309</words> Thousands would vanish, their ordinariness deemed unworthy of server space. <words>319</words> Morgana smiled sadly, her lipstick perfect despite her exhaustion. <words>328</words> She would save perhaps fifty tonight, using her family's measuring tape to judge which souls burned brightest beneath their mundane surfaces. <words>349</words>

Tomorrow, she'd return to her mortuary, preparing bodies with the same reverence she showed these digital ghosts. <words>366</words> But tonight belonged to the ancient practice, the Blackwood tradition of measuring immeasurable worth. <words>380</words> She unrolled the brass tape again, its markings worn smooth by generations of patient hands. <words>396</words> The myth of ordinariness would die harder than any body she'd ever buried. <words>409</words> In her glamorous defiance, every forgotten profile became immortal. <words>418</words>
