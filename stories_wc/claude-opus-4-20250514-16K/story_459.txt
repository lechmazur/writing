Marcus dropped his wrench for the third time that morning, the metal clanging against the elevator shaft with an elegance only the genuinely clumsy possess. <words>25</words> He worked maintenance at the Coastal Research Institute, where scientists preserved sand castles in climate-controlled chambers—a job that paid well enough to ignore the ghosts. <words>50</words> 

During lunch breaks, he'd wander into the preservation lab, sandwich in hand, watching translucent figures drift between the delicate sand structures. <words>72</words> The ghosts never spoke, creating a dissonance of silence that pressed against his eardrums like underwater pressure. <words>89</words> Other employees ate peacefully, oblivious to the spectral woman who wore a dried flower crown, her Victorian dress dissolving into wisps at the hem. <words>114</words>

Marcus began staking out local ghost tours after work, listening to guides spin tales about the institute's haunted history. <words>133</words> Built on an old cemetery, they said, though Marcus knew better—the ghosts weren't from graves but from memories trapped in sand. <words>154</words> The preservation process, he'd discovered, didn't just freeze castles; it captured final moments, last breaths, forgotten farewells. <words>171</words>

He started to dissect the patterns, mapping which ghosts appeared when, correlating their movements with the sand castles' origins. <words>190</words> Beach wedding centerpieces summoned the flower-crowned woman; a child's birthday creation brought giggling shadows; a hospice patient's final sculpture manifested an old man counting invisible coins. <words>216</words>

The tours taught him nothing useful, just rehearsed stories for tourists seeking shivers. <words>229</words> Real understanding came from sitting still, letting the silence speak its fractured language. <words>242</words> The ghosts weren't trapped—they were echoes, playing on repeat for an audience of one. <words>257</words>

One Tuesday, while adjusting the lab's freight elevator, Marcus watched the Victorian woman approach her favored castle. <words>274</words> He'd carried her dried flower crown for weeks, retrieved from where she'd dropped it countless times. <words>291</words> This time, instead of returning it, he gently placed it atop the sand castle she haunted. <words>308</words>

The preservation chamber's humidity activated something in the dried flowers—a faint perfume of roses and sea salt. <words>325</words> The woman's form solidified briefly, her eyes meeting his with gratitude before dissolving completely. <words>340</words> The crown crumbled, mixing with the sand. <words>347</words>

Marcus understood then that his gift wasn't seeing ghosts but knowing when to stop looking. <words>362</words> He finished his repairs, collected his tools with practiced gracelessness, and left the lab to its silence. <words>380</words> The ghosts would remain, but he'd found his liberation in letting go of the need to save them all. <words>399</words> Sometimes the most complex truths wore simple clothes: not every echo needed an answer. <words>414</words>
