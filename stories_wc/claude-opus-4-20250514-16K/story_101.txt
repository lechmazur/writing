The landlord's smile stretched impossibly wide as she welcomed me into the quiet room design studio, her weathered heart beating visibly through her translucent chest. <words>23</words> "You've arrived just in time," she said, gesturing to the framed Napoleonic bee pin hanging crooked on the wall—cryptically obvious in its placement, as if daring someone to notice its wrongness. <words>54</words>

This was before the first being learned to record its experiences, when memory itself was still wet clay. <words>72</words> The studio existed in that liminal moment, designing rooms for thoughts that hadn't yet learned to inhabit spaces. <words>90</words>

"The parade outside forced you to take a detour, yes?" <words>100</words> The landlord's knowing gaze pierced through pretense. <words>107</words> "Good. <words>108</words> We needed you to adapt your route, to arrive differently than planned." <words>120</words>

I understood with manic clarity: the parade wasn't celebrating anything that had happened—it was rehearsing for endings that hadn't yet been imagined. <words>143</words> Brass bands played backwards music, confetti fell upward, and marchers walked in reverse, trying to unlearn the fear of conclusions. <words>164</words>

"Why the bee pin?" <words>168</words> I asked, though I already knew. <words>174</words>

"Napoleon's bees never died," she whispered, her weathered heart skipping ancient rhythms. <words>186</words> "They simply forgot they were supposed to end. <words>194</words> In this studio, we design rooms for that forgetting." <words>203</words>

She led me to a drafting table where blueprints writhed like living things. <words>216</words> "Your assignment: reimagine the endings we fear. <words>223</words> Design a room where death forgets its own name, where goodbye loses its meaning, where the last page of every story spontaneously combusts before it can be read." <words>251</words>

My hands moved without conscious thought, sketching spaces that defied geometry. <words>262</words> The Napoleonic bee pin hummed from its frame, a frequency only weathered hearts could hear. <words>278</words> Outside, the eternal parade continued its backwards procession, each participant trying to un-become their predetermined finale. <words>294</words>

"Perfect," the landlord breathed, studying my impossible architecture. <words>302</words> "You've designed a room that exists before existence learned to end. <words>313</words> A space where stories circle back to their own beginnings, where every death becomes a birth, where fear itself forgets what it was afraid of." <words>338</words>

As she spoke, I felt my own weathered heart adapting, learning to beat in reverse time. <words>354</words> The studio walls became transparent, revealing countless other designers in adjacent realities, all sketching their own escapes from inevitable conclusions. <words>375</words>

"Welcome home," the landlord said finally, her smile now sad and infinite. <words>387</words> "You've always been here, designing your way out of endings, in this moment before moments learned to be recorded." <words>406</words> The bee pin's hum crescendoed, and I understood: we were all just postponing our own conclusions, one impossible room at a time. <words>429</words>
