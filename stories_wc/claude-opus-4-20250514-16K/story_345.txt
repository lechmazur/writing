Father Marcus jogged through the labyrinth orchard, his breath forming clouds that mingled with the dull radiance filtering through giant bean stalks that spiraled into heaven. <words>25</words> The snow patterns beneath his feet formed intricate pathways—left here, right there—as if some divine cartographer had mapped his escape from complacency. <words>47</words> In his pocket, the wooden abacus clicked with each stride, its missing beads creating gaps where certainty once lived. <words>66</words>

Twenty years he'd served the church before walking away, and now, unapologetically confused about everything he'd once preached, he followed these frozen breadcrumbs deeper into the towering green maze. <words>94</words> The bean stalks groaned overhead, their leaves catching snowflakes that fell like whispered prayers he no longer answered. <words>112</words> Each turn revealed another corridor of verdant columns, each seemingly identical yet subtly different, like the days he'd spent in his parish—comfortable, predictable, slowly dying. <words>137</words>

The abacus had been his grandfather's, a merchant who calculated profits while Marcus calculated souls. <words>152</words> Now, with three beads missing from the heaven rod and two from the earth, it perfectly represented his fractured faith—incomplete equations that no longer balanced. <words>177</words> He jogged faster, following the snow's cryptic calligraphy as it spelled out directions in a language older than Latin. <words>196</words>

Through the hush of fate unraveling, he heard it—the sound of his predetermined life coming apart like poorly-sewn vestments. <words>215</words> The price of his former complacency had been steep: a congregation that never questioned, sermons that never challenged, a God that never surprised. <words>238</words> But here, lost among these impossible plants that defied both botany and theology, Marcus felt the first stirrings of genuine wonder in decades. <words>261</words>

The snow patterns began spiraling now, leading him toward the orchard's heart where the bean stalks grew thickest. <words>279</words> He clutched the broken abacus, no longer counting what was missing but marveling at the spaces between—those gaps where mystery lived. <words>301</words> His confusion wasn't a weakness anymore; it was honesty, raw and liberating. <words>313</words>

As the path narrowed, Marcus understood: he'd been following his own footprints from some future self who'd already escaped fate's design. <words>334</words> The giant stalks leaned inward, their shadows creating a cathedral more sacred than any he'd served. <words>350</words> With each step beyond predestination, the dull radiance grew brighter, not blinding but revealing—showing him that getting lost was the only way to be found. <words>375</words>

He jogged on, the incomplete abacus rattling its broken music, while overhead the bean stalks reached toward clouds that had never heard of Heaven's monopoly on transcendence. <words>402</words> In this labyrinth orchard where snow wrote new scriptures with every storm, Marcus finally learned to read between the lines of his own unwritten story. <words>427</words> The price of complacency had been everything; the reward for confusion was infinite. <words>440</words>
