The undertaker pressed his calloused palm against the astronomical clock's brass meridian. <words>11</words> The ancient Persian palace, now reimagined as a morgue for the forgotten, thrummed with silence after the car's backfire echoed through empty streets. <words>34</words> Karim had inherited more than his grandfather's burial tools; he'd inherited tribal knowledge that was rarely practical in daylight hours. <words>54</words>

The clock's celestial gears whispered secrets only his bloodline understood. <words>64</words> Each constellation etched into its face marked a prison, each sun path a chain forged by his ancestors who'd served Persian kings. <words>86</words> They hadn't buried bodies—they'd buried time itself. <words>94</words>

His weariness ran bone-deep, accumulated from decades of watching mourners mistake death for endings. <words>109</words> But here, in this moment's hush, he could feel the mechanism responding to his touch. <words>125</words> The tribal knowledge surged: to imprison sorrow, one must follow the sun's ancient paths through the zodiac wheel. <words>143</words>

The palace walls, now lined with refrigerated chambers instead of tapestries, held their breath. <words>158</words> Karim traced the ecliptic line with practiced precision, feeling each degree like a heartbeat. <words>173</words> This was why his family had survived conquests and revolutions—not for their skill with the dead, but for their ability to cage grief itself. <words>198</words>

The astronomical clock began its work, gears grinding with placid ferocity. <words>209</words> Each tick pulled shadows from the corners, each tock wove them into geometric patterns his grandfather would recognize. <words>228</words> The sun paths weren't mere astronomy; they were bars on a celestial jail. <words>242</words>

Outside, the street remained frozen in that peculiar quiet that follows sudden noise. <words>256</words> Inside, Karim watched as the clock imprisoned another day's worth of despair, compressing it into a pinpoint of obsidian that he'd later bury with tomorrow's dead. <words>283</words>

His motivation had never wavered, not through years of handling cold flesh and hot tears. <words>299</words> To hold onto hope in the absolute dark required more than faith—it demanded the rarely practical wisdom of knowing where to put the darkness when it threatened to swallow everything. <words>330</words>

The clock's final rotation aligned with the palace's original meridian, unchanged despite the building's transformation. <words>346</words> Karim removed his hand, leaving a warm print on the cold metal. <words>359</words> Another night's sorrow successfully caged. <words>364</words> Another dawn earned through ancestral astronomy. <words>370</words>

He returned to his preparation room with the same placid ferocity that marked all inheritors of impossible duties. <words>388</words> The tribal knowledge would pass to his daughter soon enough, this burden of following sun paths to imprison what others could only mourn. <words>412</words> Until then, he would continue transforming an ancient palace into tomorrow's sanctuary, one celestial calculation at a time. <words>430</words>
