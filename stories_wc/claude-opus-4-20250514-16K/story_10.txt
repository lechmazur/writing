The cheerless duelist stood in the abandoned spaceport customs office, her rapier hanging loose at her side. <words>16</words> Amid the hum of server rooms that somehow still ran on emergency power, she stared at the maggoty wooden chest that rattled with each electrical surge. <words>42</words> 

Her fatal flaw had always been pride—the precisely innovative techniques she'd developed for combat had made her invincible, but also unbearably alone. <words>65</words> She'd won every duel, destroyed every relationship, until only ghosts remained. <words>77</words>

The chest had arrived that morning, forwarded through seventeen different ports, bearing her grandmother's seal. <words>93</words> Inside, she found the family recipe cards, but they'd changed during their journey through radiation fields and temporal anomalies. <words>113</words> The ink had begun to elasticize, stretching across the yellowed paper like living tissue, forming new instructions through unexpected mutations of family recipes she'd memorized as a child. <words>142</words>

"Forgiveness Bread," read one card, the letters pulsing. <words>150</words> "Mix equal parts regret and understanding." <words>156</words> Another: "Reconciliation Stew—simmer old wounds until tender." <words>164</words>

She laughed bitterly. <words>167</words> Her grandmother had tried teaching her these recipes before she'd chosen the blade over the kitchen, before she'd decided that winning meant everything. <words>191</words> Now, decades later, in this liminal space between worlds, the recipes had evolved into something more than food—they'd become instructions for healing. <words>215</words>

The chest rattled again, and she noticed movement inside. <words>224</words> Not maggots, she realized, but chrysalises, transforming. <words>231</words> Like the recipes. <words>234</words> Like her, perhaps. <words>237</words>

She thought of her last opponent, the fear in his eyes before she'd struck the winning blow. <words>254</words> He'd whispered his daughter's name. <words>259</words> She'd won that duel, but lost something irreplaceable. <words>268</words>

The server rooms hummed their electronic lullaby as she drew her rapier one final time. <words>283</words> With precisely innovative movements, she began to follow the mutated recipes, using her blade to measure and mix ingredients that existed more in memory than reality. <words>310</words> Each motion was a form of combat against her former self. <words>321</words>

As she worked, the chrysalises began to open, releasing not moths but moments—all the forgiveness she'd never sought, all the apologies she'd never made. <words>346</words> They filled the abandoned office with bittersweet light. <words>354</words>

The cheerless duelist felt something elasticize within her chest—not her heart, but the cage around it. <words>370</words> She understood now why the recipes had mutated, why they'd found her here in this forgotten place. <words>387</words> To learn the power of forgiveness, she first had to forgive herself. <words>399</words>

She smiled, tasting salt on her lips. <words>406</words> It was the first ingredient. <words>411</words>
