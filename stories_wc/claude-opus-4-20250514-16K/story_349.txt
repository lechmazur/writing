Marcus had piloted surveillance drones over war zones, but nothing prepared him for tumbling through purple lightning into a realm where griffins nested in abandoned observatories. <words>19</words> The stone structure perched on the cliff's edge, its broken dome revealing stars he didn't recognize. <words>35</words>

Inside, creatures gathered around flickering candles—a desperate speed dating event for the magically doomed. <words>50</words> A satyr explained through bitter laughter: tomorrow, the executioners would burn the last enchanted orchard, severing this realm's connection to magic forever. <words>72</words>

"Unless someone can disseminate the seeds of mercy," she added, cynically hopeful, pressing a dried herb bundle into Marcus's hands. <words>92</words> "Your kind destroyed our sister realms with iron and industry, but perhaps..." <words>104</words>

Marcus recognized the herbs—rosemary, sage, lavender—identical to his grandmother's garden. <words>114</words> In three-minute rotations, he moved between beings: a weeping dryad whose tree would die tomorrow, a phoenix down to her last regeneration, a troll poet composing eulogies. <words>142</words> Each conversation revealed the same pattern—they'd isolated themselves, hoarding magic instead of sharing it, until their world withered. <words>161</words>

"In my world," Marcus told them, "we learned mercy through mutual destruction." <words>174</words> His drone footage had documented both devastation and surprising acts of kindness in rubble. <words>189</words> "Horizons of mercy appear when you stop guarding your borders." <words>199</words>

The herbs' scent triggered something—not magic, but memory. <words>207</words> Marcus described community gardens rising from bombed earth, enemies sharing water, children playing in crater parks. <words>224</words> The creatures leaned closer, recognizing something beyond spells. <words>232</words>

"Disseminate these stories," Marcus urged, crushing herbs between his fingers. <words>242</words> Their fragrance filled the observatory, mundane yet profound. <words>250</words> "Tell others that mercy isn't found in grand gestures but in small sharings." <words>263</words>

The satyr laughed again, less bitter now. <words>270</words> "A drone pilot teaching us about connection." <words>277</words> But she took the herbs, dividing them carefully. <words>285</words>

By dawn, creatures departed carrying herb sprigs and stranger cargo—stories of a world that survived its own darkness through unexpected kindness. <words>307</words> They moved toward the orchard with something Marcus recognized from post-conflict zones: not quite hope, but its cynical cousin—the stubborn refusal to let despair win. <words>334</words>

Marcus remained at the observatory, watching the horizon lighten. <words>343</words> Perhaps he'd never return home, but he'd done what drone pilots do best—provided perspective from above, revealing patterns invisible at ground level. <words>366</words> The orchard's fate remained uncertain, but seeds of possibility now traveled on the wind, carried by those who'd learned that mercy begins with sharing what little remains. <words>394</words>

In the charred serenity of dawn, Marcus smiled, understanding finally why he'd been brought here—not to save them with technology, but to remind them of humanity's hardest-won wisdom: isolation is the true enemy of magic. <words>431</words>
