Marcus stood rigid against the greenhouse wall, watching Ambassador Chen admire the lunar roses while his own rage bloomed quietly beneath practiced calm. <words>21</words> Twenty years he'd served as her bodyguard, twenty years since she'd purchased his contract from the prison colony, and every day he collected fragments of visitors' conversations like seeds. <words>50</words> 

"My daughter just turned eighteen," a tourist murmured to her companion near the oxygen ferns. <words>65</words> Marcus filed it away with thousands of other stolen stories, each one a piece of the life he'd been denied. <words>85</words> The faded photograph in his chest pocket—his own daughter, frozen at age two—burned against his ribs. <words>102</words>

Ambassador Chen moved through the crater-edge paradise, unaware that her serendipitously stubborn bodyguard had been constructing something magnificent from his eavesdropping. <words>124</words> Amid these park visits, he'd discovered a pattern: every third Tuesday, the greenhouse's legal AI conducted citizenship hearings. <words>143</words> Stories of freedom, whispered between the genetically modified fruit trees, had shown him the way. <words>159</words>

"The Council will ratify my application next week," a young woman had said yesterday, her joy infectious. <words>177</words> Marcus had memorized every word of her petition, every legal precedent she'd cited. <words>191</words> His own application, painstakingly assembled from overheard legal arguments and borrowed phrases, waited in the system. <words>208</words>

Chen paused at the observation deck, Earth hanging massive above the crater's rim. <words>222</words> "Beautiful view," she said absently, never acknowledging that he'd been watching the same view for two decades, always through the lens of servitude. <words>246</words>

The notification came silently to his neural implant: Application approved. <words>256</words> The AI had ruled that twenty years of forced service satisfied rehabilitation requirements. <words>270</words> His contract was void. <words>274</words>

Marcus felt the change like atmospheric pressure dropping—a timely rebirth after years of patient plotting. <words>290</words> Chen turned, perhaps sensing the shift in her perpetual shadow. <words>301</words> He pulled out the photograph, studying his daughter's face one last time before sliding it across the small gap between them. <words>323</words>

"She'll be twenty-two now," he said, his voice carrying that strange mixture of serenity and anger that comes from winning a very long game. <words>348</words> "I'm going to find her." <words>353</words>

Chen's face cycled through confusion, indignation, and finally understanding. <words>362</words> "Your contract—" <words>364</words>

"Has been legally terminated." <words>368</words> He removed his security badge with deliberate slowness, placing it beside the photograph. <words>382</words> "The stories in this garden taught me patience. <words>391</words> And law." <words>393</words>

He walked toward the exit, leaving Chen among her roses, finally understanding what it meant to breathe free air, even if it was recycled through lunar filters. <words>421</words> Behind him, Earth continued its eternal watch, witness to another small revolution in the greenhouse at the crater's edge. <words>441</words>
