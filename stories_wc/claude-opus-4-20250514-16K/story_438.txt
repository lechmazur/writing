Dr. Serafina Voss swept into the synthetic biology lab, her lab coat embroidered with constellations that only appeared under blacklight—discreetly flamboyant, like everything about her. <words>24</words> The other researchers called her the vague mystic, never quite understanding how she predicted which genetic sequences would survive after the last star map is drawn. <words>48</words> In her pocket, she carried her grandmother's mariner's compass, its needle spinning wildly in the electromagnetic fields of the gene sequencers. <words>69</words>

"Override the safety protocols," she commanded her assistant, her voice carrying that hollow recklessness that had gotten her both fired and rehired three times. <words>93</words> She wasn't here for the science anymore. <words>100</words> She was here to chronicle family histories encoded in DNA, searching for the next horizon of human memory. <words>118</words>

The polaroids hidden in attics across the city held the key. <words>129</words> Each faded photograph contained a person whose genetic material had been preserved in the lab's cryogenic vaults before they vanished. <words>149</words> Serafina had discovered that certain families possessed a peculiar mutation—their cells could store actual memories in their mitochondria. <words>168</words>

She inserted another sample into the sequencer, watching the compass needle suddenly point true north. <words>183</words> "There," she whispered, as data cascaded across the screen. <words>192</words> The genetic code revealed itself like a story written in nucleotides: a fisherman's daughter who had sailed beyond the edge of mapped waters, carrying secrets in her blood. <words>221</words>

Her assistant hesitated at the console. <words>227</words> "The ethics board will—"

"The ethics board doesn't understand that we're the last generation who can recover these histories," Serafina interrupted. <words>246</words> "After the last star map is drawn, after the satellites fail and the networks collapse, only biology will remember." <words>266</words>

She pulled out a polaroid from her coat—her own mother, standing in an attic full of nautical charts. <words>284</words> The woman in the photograph had the same wild eyes, the same restless need to document the undocumentable. <words>302</words> Serafina fed the photograph into the modified scanner she'd built, watching as it translated visual data into genetic sequences. <words>322</words>

The lab hummed with transgenic possibilities. <words>328</words> Each override of the system brought her closer to encoding entire family histories into synthetic organisms that could survive anything. <words>348</words> The mariner's compass spun faster now, responding to the magnetic field of accumulated memories. <words>362</words>

"The next horizon isn't out there," Serafina said, pressing her palm against the cold glass of the incubator where her modified bacteria grew. <words>386</words> "It's in here, in the stories we carry in our cells." <words>397</words> She turned to her assistant with that hollow recklessness gleaming in her eyes. <words>411</words> "Help me, or don't. <words>415</words> But I'm finishing what my grandmother started." <words>422</words>

The compass needle finally stilled, pointing not north, but inward. <words>432</words>
