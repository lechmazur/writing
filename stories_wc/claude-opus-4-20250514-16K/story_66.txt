The quiet deserter arrived at the plant communication study with nothing but a duffel bag and fragments of porcelain masks collected from battlefields. <words>20</words> In the greenhouse laboratory, she found her assigned workspace: a desk beneath hanging ferns, equipped with monitoring equipment and a cracked mirror that previous researchers had inexplicably left behind. <words>48</words> 

Dr. Chen explained her duties while she arranged jigsaw puzzles on the desk—each representing a different timeframe of plant response data. <words>70</words> "We're mapping how plants communicate trauma," he said, unaware that she'd chosen this remote posting precisely because plants couldn't judge desertion. <words>91</words>

Each night, she reconstructed stories from the porcelain mask shards, piecing together faces of soldiers she'd abandoned. <words>108</words> The plants' electrical signals reminded her of distant screams, but here she could finally carbonize those memories—burn them down to their essential carbon, transform pain into growth medium. <words>137</words> 

The cracked mirror reflected her work: fragments becoming whole, then breaking again. <words>149</words> She was dizzyingly grounded in this ritual, rooted like the specimens she monitored yet spinning through memories with each mask she assembled. <words>172</words>

Week by week, the jigsaw puzzles accumulated, each one a frozen moment of plant communication—distress signals when cut, warnings shared through root networks, celebrations of sunlight. <words>199</words> She began to recognize her own patterns in their data: the way trauma echoed through connected systems, how isolation bred its own language. <words>223</words>

"Noble foolishness," her commanding officer had called her pacifism before she'd fled. <words>235</words> But here, listening to plants whisper their chemical secrets, she found wisdom in that foolishness. <words>251</words> The porcelain faces watched from her desk as she worked, no longer accusations but witnesses to her transformation. <words>269</words>

One morning, analyzing overnight recordings, she discovered something extraordinary: the plants had begun responding to her presence differently, their signals calming when she entered. <words>293</words> She held a mask fragment up to the cracked mirror, watching her reflection split between past and present selves. <words>312</words>

Breaking the cycle meant accepting that belonging nowhere was itself a destination. <words>324</words> The greenhouse became her nowhere—a place outside nations and wars, where a deserter could tend to silent witnesses and carbonize old ghosts into fertile soil. <words>350</words> 

She assembled the final jigsaw puzzle of the study, revealing a pattern she'd never expected: the plants' communication network looked exactly like the porcelain mask fragments arranged on her desk. <words>380</words> In trying to escape human connection, she'd discovered another kind entirely. <words>391</words> The cracked mirror no longer showed a deserter, but a translator between kingdoms, rooted in her noble foolishness. <words>409</words>
