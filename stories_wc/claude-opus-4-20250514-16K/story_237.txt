In the brig of the Crimson Nebula, psychic genealogist Mara Chen rolled her grandmother's dice between calloused fingers, feeling the chip in one corner where time had bitten deep. <words>28</words> She could taste the memories embedded in ivory—generations of gamblers, lovers, and thieves who'd wagered everything on these cubes. <words>47</words> Outside her cell, the last star was fading into morning light, that peculiar phenomenon when space itself seemed to yawn and stretch. <words>69</words>

"Proudly humble," the pirates had mocked when they'd captured her, but Mara knew her gift was both burden and blessing. <words>89</words> She could read the DNA of destiny itself, tracing bloodlines through objects, lengthening moments into eternities of understanding. <words>106</words> The pirates wanted her to find their captain's lost daughter, but Mara had discovered something far more terrible in his ancestry. <words>127</words>

She pressed the chipped die against her temple and reached. <words>137</words> Not into the past, but sideways, into the quantum foam where all possibilities lived. <words>151</words> There—diaries left on abandoned bullet trains, Earth's ghost stations where commuters once scribbled their secrets during morning rides. <words>169</words> She could access them through the dice, which had rolled across those very train tables a century ago. <words>187</words>

The first diary whispered of a woman who'd loved a pirate. <words>198</words> The second spoke of children given up to keep them safe. <words>209</words> Each entry lengthened her perception, stretching seconds into hours as she absorbed their grief. <words>223</words> The puzzle of destiny began to reveal itself—not in grand cosmic designs, but in the small choices that rippled through generations. <words>244</words>

Captain Vega's daughter hadn't been lost; she'd been hidden. <words>253</words> His own mother had broken the chain of piracy, placing the child on Earth before the last exodus. <words>271</words> The alarm bells of heartbreak that rang in his chest weren't for a stolen child, but for a saved one. <words>291</words>

Mara smiled grimly as footsteps approached her cell. <words>299</words> She'd tell him the truth wrapped in riddles, as was her way. <words>311</words> The dice clicked together—one smooth, one chipped—like mismatched heartbeats finding rhythm. <words>322</words> Sometimes the greatest treasure a pirate could steal was the peace of not knowing. <words>336</words> Sometimes love meant letting go before you ever held on. <words>346</words>

"Captain," she called out with grave playfulness, "I've found your answer in the space between rolling dice." <words>363</words> The cell door creaked open, and she saw her own reflection in his tears—ancestry's mirror, cracked but whole. <words>381</words> She would hush his alarm bells with truth gentle as starlight, sharp as the chip in grandmother's die. <words>399</words> After all, every genealogist knew that family trees grew in the strangest soil, even in the brig of pirate ships sailing toward dawn. <words>422</words>
