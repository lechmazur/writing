The final chord faded in the abandoned music hall, leaving Maya alone with her trade. <words>13</words> As a social media exorcist, she helped people shed their digital ghosts—those curated versions of themselves that haunted every platform. <words>32</words> Tonight's client had paid her to reignite something lost: the ability to exist without documentation. <words>47</words>

She moved through the building's bowels to the abandoned mess hall, her footsteps quietly loud against rusted tiles. <words>65</words> The space reeked of forgotten meals and institutional despair, perfect for her ritual. <words>78</words> From her pocket, she produced an old grocery receipt—eggs, milk, bread—someone's mundane Tuesday from 1987. <words>93</words> These artifacts grounded her work, proving life existed before every moment demanded sharing. <words>106</words>

Her method required infiltrating secret clubs in alleyways, those analog gatherings where familiar strangers recognized each other without profiles or handles. <words>127</words> She'd spent months earning trust in these spaces where eye contact replaced likes, where conversations vanished into air instead of archives. <words>149</words> Each club taught her techniques: the art of forgetting passwords, the meditation of deleted accounts, the ceremony of burning screenshot folders. <words>171</words>

Maya spread salt in a circle, placing the receipt at its center. <words>183</words> Her client would arrive soon, desperate to feed their curiosity with life's raw edge instead of filtered fragments. <words>201</words> She understood the hunger—that ache to experience without performing, to witness without broadcasting. <words>214</words>

The mess hall's broken windows let in streetlight, casting shadows that danced like deleted posts. <words>229</words> Maya's indifferent enthusiasm kept her balanced; she cared enough to help but not enough to judge. <words>246</words> After all, she'd once been trapped too, her identity scattered across platforms like digital confetti. <words>261</words>

Footsteps echoed in the corridor. <words>266</words> Her client entered, phone clutched like a talisman, eyes darting between Maya and the exit. <words>282</words> "Ready?" she asked, her voice carrying that particular frequency of someone who'd learned to whisper loudly. <words>298</words>

They nodded, stepping into the circle. <words>304</words> Maya began the exorcism, guiding them through deletion rituals, teaching them to recognize familiar strangers in real life—the barista, the bus driver, the woman walking her dog—without needing to know their usernames. <words>336</words> The grocery receipt burned slowly, its smoke carrying away the compulsion to document every meal. <words>351</words>

Hours later, they emerged transformed, eyes bright with analog wonder. <words>361</words> The city's alleys beckoned with their secret clubs, promising connections that existed only in the moment. <words>377</words> Maya watched them disappear into the night, another soul successfully severed from their digital double. <words>392</words> She pocketed her fee and vanished too, already sensing the next haunted profile calling for exorcism. <words>408</words> The abandoned mess hall returned to silence, holding their secret like all the meals it would never serve again. <words>427</words>
