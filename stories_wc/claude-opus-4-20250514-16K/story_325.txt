Dr. Margot Vines adjusted her worn-out leather belt, which held three miniature Venus flytraps in specialized holsters, as she prepared the projector at the Himalayan Cloud Tea House. <words>27</words> During the film's intermission, she noticed her carnivorous companions writhing with unusual excitement, their tiny mouths snapping at invisible prey. <words>47</words> "Patience, my pretties," she muttered with comically serious intensity, her wild eyes reflecting the flickering light from the projection booth. <words>67</words>

The black-and-white film reel contained more than entertainment; hidden between frames were encoded botanical diagrams that, when projected at altitude, would ionize the thin mountain air. <words>94</words> This unexplained phenomenon had drawn Margot here, chasing rumors of ancient pathways used by monks who cultivated impossible gardens above the tree line. <words>118</words> Her plants, usually loyal only when fed, had begun betraying their fickle nature by leaning away from her toward the screen. <words>139</words>

"Traitors," she whispered affectionately, noting how their leaves trembled in patterns matching the film's hidden frequencies. <words>155</words> The other tea house patrons, mostly trekkers seeking warmth, remained oblivious to the electromagnetic disturbance building around them. <words>173</words> Margot's instruments, disguised as antique film canisters, detected ionization levels that shouldn't exist at this elevation. <words>190</words>

As the intermission ended, she threaded the crucial reel—stolen from a monastery's archive after her plants had "convinced" the librarian to look elsewhere. <words>214</words> The first hidden frame appeared: a map dissolved between two scenes of mountain landscapes. <words>229</words> Her carnivorous plants suddenly stood erect, their stems pointing like compass needles toward the eastern wall. <words>246</words>

The leather belt, inherited from her mentor who'd vanished seeking these same pathways, began to warm against her waist. <words>266</words> Its buckle, she realized with academic excitement poorly disguised as calm, contained magnetized particles that resonated with the ionized air. <words>286</words> The unexplained phenomena intensified as more hidden frames flickered past—botanical formulae, astronomical charts, pathways marked in an unknown script. <words>306</words>

Her plants' loyalty shifted again; now they strained toward her belt, their primitive consciousness somehow recognizing the connection. <words>325</words> "Of course," Margot breathed, understanding dawning like sunrise over the peaks. <words>336</words> The ancient pathways weren't physical routes but electromagnetic corridors, accessible only when specific atmospheric conditions aligned with botanical conductors. <words>356</words>

She stood abruptly, causing concerned murmurs from the tea-sipping audience. <words>366</words> Her plants quivered with anticipation as she unbuckled the belt, holding it toward the projected map. <words>383</words> The leather glowed faintly, and through the tea house window, a shimmering trail appeared in the moonlit snow. <words>402</words> "Shall we explore, my inconstant darlings?" she asked her plants, already moving toward the door. <words>418</words> The pathway beckoned, visible only to those who understood the marriage of mad science and patient observation. <words>436</words> Behind her, the film reel spun on, its secrets revealed to empty chairs and cooling cups of butter tea. <words>456</words>
