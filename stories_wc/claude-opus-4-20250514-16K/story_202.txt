The Found Object Museum's night watchman, Marina, moved through galleries like a careful poisoner, her footsteps silent beneath the dusty starlight filtering through skylights. <words>23</words> She'd discovered her strange gift accidentally—objects she touched would slowly leak their histories into visitors' minds, sometimes overwhelming them with visions. <words>44</words> Innocently guilty of these psychic intrusions, she'd learned to handle artifacts with laboratory precision, wearing gloves that muted her peculiar venom. <words>66</words>

Tonight's unauthorized visitor changed everything. <words>71</words> A skateboarder had broken in, wheels grinding against marble floors, testing the edges of gravity between display cases. <words>89</words> Marina watched from shadows as he followed something—a trail of cryptic clues hidden in a scavenger hunt she hadn't sanctioned. <words>109</words> Each clue led deeper into the museum's labyrinth, past taxidermied oddities and recovered wreckage, toward the restricted vault. <words>127</words>

Her code of instinct screamed warnings. <words>133</words> This wasn't random vandalism but calculated infiltration. <words>140</words> The skater's movements betrayed purpose beneath casual rebellion, each kickflip precisely timed to avoid security cameras. <words>157</words>

Marina pursued, fingertips tingling with her burden. <words>164</words> In the vault's antechamber, she found him examining an elegant rapier with a cracked hilt, the museum's most dangerous acquisition. <words>185</words> Legend claimed it had slain seven duelists before its owner died mysteriously—poisoned, some said. <words>199</words>

"Don't touch it directly," Marina warned, emerging into dusty light. <words>209</words> The skater spun, board clattering away. <words>215</words> "I need to authenticate something my grandmother left here," he said, producing faded photographs. <words>229</words> "She was the last duelist's daughter." <words>235</words>

Marina recognized the ritual scarification in the images—marks of those who'd survived the rapier's curse. <words>250</words> The weapon chose its wielders through bloodline, but each generation paid in madness. <words>264</words> She understood now why he'd come skateboarding, defying gravity's certainty. <words>274</words> The rapier's pull was strongest on those who courted danger with grace. <words>286</words>

"Your grandmother knew I worked here," Marina realized. <words>294</words> "The scavenger hunt—she designed it to bring you when you were ready." <words>306</words> Her poisonous gift suddenly made sense; she was the rapier's keeper, meant to prepare inheritors for their burden. <words>324</words>

Removing her gloves, Marina grasped the cracked hilt. <words>332</words> Visions flooded through her into him—centuries of honor and horror, the code of instinct that governed those who wielded death with artistry. <words>355</words> He gasped, understanding blooming behind his eyes. <words>362</words> The skateboard had been practice, teaching him to dance with danger. <words>373</words>

"The authentication isn't about the blade," Marina whispered, her innocent guilt finally lifting. <words>386</words> "It's about whether you can bear knowing what you'll become." <words>396</words> Under dusty starlight, amid scattered skateboarding gear, they waited for his choice. <words>408</words>
