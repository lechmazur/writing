Marina pressed the amber pendant against her chest, feeling the ancient mosquito trapped inside pulse with spectral warmth as she stood in the abandoned carnival's shooting gallery. <words>26</words> Every summer solstice, her family had gathered here before the park closed, their tradition of channeling the drowned at this liminal hour between land and sea. <words>52</words> She'd inherited more than her grandmother's gift for hearing the waterlogged dead; she'd inherited the burden of being the youngest, forever eclipsed by her sisters' legendary dives. <words>80</words> 

The half-written letter to her mother lay folded in her pocket, its unfinished sentences bleeding truth: "I can't keep diving into their wrecks, speaking for their ghosts." <words>108</words> Between those careful lines lived her real confession—she wanted to arouse something beyond inherited duty, to kindle her own strange fire. <words>130</words> The shooting gallery's rusted tin ducks seemed to nod in the salt breeze, understanding her joyfully melancholic resolve. <words>148</words>

Tonight, she would break tradition. <words>153</words> Instead of diving the harbor wrecks where her sisters had made their names, she would listen to the carnival's own drowned spirits. <words>175</words> This place had sunk beneath bankruptcy and storm surge twenty years ago, creating an underwater graveyard of joy. <words>193</words> Her amber talisman grew hot, the prehistoric insect inside somehow connecting her to older magics than her family knew. <words>212</words>

"Tell me your stories," she whispered to the barnacle-crusted gallery, her words a fleeting rebellion against generations of maritime necromancy. <words>232</words> The ghosts came eagerly—not sailors or passengers, but carnies and children, ticket-takers and fortune-tellers, all desperate to share their landlocked drowning. <words>254</words> A carousel operator materialized, his phantom fingers still turning invisible cranks, and Marina felt her frozen heart beginning its painful, necessary thaw. <words>277</words>

She pulled out the letter, adding new lines by moonlight: "Mother, I've found my own dead to shepherd." <words>296</words> The amber mosquito seemed to buzz approval, its million-year entombment a reminder that some preservations were meant to be broken. <words>317</words> Marina laughed—a sound both sorrowful and free—as cotton candy ghosts swirled around her, their sweetness mixing with brine. <words>336</words> 

By dawn, she would return to her family's dock, but changed. <words>348</words> No longer the youngest sister trailing in illustrious wakes, but a different kind of ghost whisperer entirely. <words>365</words> One who dove not into ocean graves but into the spaces between joy and grief, finding in abandoned laughter a deeper salvage. <words>388</words> The shooting gallery fell silent as the sun rose, but Marina's heart continued its slow, rebellious bloom, finally stepping out of the shadow into her own strange light. <words>418</words>
