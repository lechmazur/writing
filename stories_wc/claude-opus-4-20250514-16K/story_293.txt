The nervous minstrel's fingers trembled against the bioluminescent strings of his lute, its glow powered by the same bacteria that kept Lumenvale's towers alight. <words>23</words> He clutched a crumpled photograph in his other hand—the only sincere thing he'd ever owned, though he'd never admit it. <words>43</words> The image showed constellations mapped above a distant shore, a place where music meant more than entertaining the bacterial engineers who ruled this glowing metropolis. <words>68</words>

"Another performance?" his patron asked, and Kellan nodded with his practiced smile, the one that hid everything true. <words>86</words> But tonight was different. <words>90</words> Tonight, he would deploy his escape plan, following the star patterns memorized from that worn photograph. <words>106</words> The bacteria-powered city hummed with predictable rhythms—fermentation cycles, protein synthesis schedules, the mechanical pulse of biotechnology that had replaced wonder with efficiency. <words>129</words>

He began to play, his melody weaving through the phosphorescent air with calculated imperfection. <words>143</words> The crowd swayed, intoxicated by his rarely sincere performance, never suspecting that each note mapped to a constellation above. <words>162</words> His nervous energy transformed into cautious revelry as he realized they were too absorbed to notice him edging toward the exit. <words>183</words>

The lonely candle flame in his quarters would gutter out within the hour—his makeshift timer, the only non-bacterial light source he'd managed to hide. <words>208</words> By then, he needed to reach the city's edge where the artificial glow faded and real stars emerged. <words>226</words> His fingers found the crumpled photograph again, feeling its creases like a map of possibilities. <words>241</words>

"Why do you play?" a child asked suddenly, breaking through his performance. <words>254</words> The question struck him like lightning. <words>260</words> In all his years of false smiles and rehearsed stories, no one had asked about purpose. <words>276</words> He almost answered honestly, almost revealed his plan to escape this ordinary existence where art served only function. <words>294</words>

Instead, he winked and continued playing, but now his music carried something different—a genuine longing that made the bacteria flicker in response. <words>317</words> The crowd felt it too, this unexpected authenticity bleeding through his careful facade. <words>331</words> Some began to look up, following his gaze to where stars should be visible beyond the city's glow. <words>349</words>

As his final note rang out, Kellan bowed deeply, then slipped away into the shadows. <words>365</words> The star patterns from the photograph burned in his memory as he navigated the bioluminescent streets one last time. <words>384</words> Behind him, the candle flame flickered its warning, and ahead, the unknown beckoned with its promise of genuine purpose. <words>403</words> His nervous energy transformed into determination as he crossed the threshold where bacterial light ended and starlight began, finally escaping the ordinary world that had never quite fit his restless soul. <words>435</words>
