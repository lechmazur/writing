Captain Iris Vane adjusted her worn-out glove, the leather cracked from years of gripping control sticks she'd forgotten how to fly properly. <words>20</words> The twisted orchard labyrinth stretched before her, apple trees writhing into impossible spirals beneath the enchanted oak grove's ancient canopy. <words>39</words> Thunder had just finished its performance, and she knew the rain would follow soon—this precious lull was her only chance. <words>59</words>

She'd borrowed these memories from the postcards, each one covered in sinister doodles that mapped the natural patterns she desperately needed to archive. <words>82</words> The memories weren't truly hers, but they guided her through the deliberately dreamy haze that protected this place from outsiders. <words>102</words> A careless pilot by reputation, Iris had crashed seven planes chasing phenomena nobody else believed existed, but here, finally, was proof. <words>123</words>

The postcards whispered directions through someone else's recollections: turn left at the tree that grows downward, right where gravity forgets itself. <words>143</words> Each doodle revealed another pattern—how bark spiraled counterclockwise during lunar eclipses, how roots formed mathematical sequences that could predict storms. <words>163</words> She documented everything with resigned exuberance, knowing that even if she succeeded, people would call her reckless, unstable, foolish. <words>182</words>

But she'd found what the doodles promised: the Curator, trapped within the grove's heart, keeper of every natural algorithm ever observed. <words>203</words> The enchantment held him prisoner, feeding on his knowledge while the world forgot how seasons truly worked, why birds migrated, what made flowers bloom. <words>227</words>

Iris pulled off her glove, revealing the final postcard tattooed on her palm—the key pattern, drawn in ink that moved like living shadow. <words>250</words> She pressed it against the oak's trunk, and the borrowed memories surged through her, showing her the combination of movements needed. <words>271</words> Dance three steps moonwise, trace the Fibonacci sequence in bark dust, speak the thunder's echo backward. <words>287</words>

The grove shuddered as she worked to emancipate the Curator, each action unraveling centuries of magical bondage. <words>303</words> Through the dying enchantment, he emerged—not human, but a living catalog of wings and leaves and crystallized dewdrops. <words>320</words> "You're late," he said, his voice like wind through wheat. <words>330</words> "The world has already forgotten so much." <words>337</words>

Iris laughed, a sound both bitter and delighted. <words>345</words> "Then we'd better start archiving." <words>350</words> She handed him the postcards, each one now glowing with recovered knowledge. <words>362</words> The rain began to fall, but they stood together in the dissolving labyrinth, two guardians of patterns the careless world had abandoned. <words>384</words> Her crashes, her reputation, her borrowed memories—all had led to this moment of resigned triumph, this exuberant acceptance of an impossible task that someone had to do. <words>411</words>
