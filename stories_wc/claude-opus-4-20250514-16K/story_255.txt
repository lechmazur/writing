The seer, forgettable in every way except for her gift, stood alone in the abandoned control tower as confetti settled like colorful ghosts around her feet. <words>26</words> The surprise party for the airport's demolition crew had ended twenty minutes ago, leaving behind the peculiar silence that follows forced celebration. <words>47</words> She pulled the encrypted USB drive from her pocket—the real reason she'd orchestrated this gathering. <words>63</words>

For thirty years, this tower had hidden what the aviation industry desperately wanted forgotten: evidence of the Flight 447 cover-up. <words>83</words> The seer's visions had shown her glimpses, but she needed proof—something her analytically innovative mind could dissect and present to the world. <words>106</words> She'd spent months untangling the web of lies, following paper trails that led nowhere, until a janitor mentioned finding "some old computer thing" during renovations. <words>131</words>

The USB drive felt warm against her palm, its encryption as stubborn as the officials who'd buried the truth. <words>150</words> She closed her eyes, letting her gift guide her fingers across the tower's dusty control panels. <words>166</words> Nothing. <words>167</words> The visions remained frustratingly vague, showing only fragments of panicked faces and deleted files. <words>181</words>

Then the scent hit her—petrichor, that distinctive smell of first rain after drought. <words>194</words> But it hadn't rained in weeks. <words>200</words> The impossible aroma triggered something deeper than memory; her gift surged, and suddenly she could see the password dancing behind her eyelids: the tail number of the plane, reversed and paired with the date justice was denied. <words>238</words>

Her laptop hummed as the files unlocked, revealing communications that proved the airline knew about the mechanical failure before takeoff. <words>258</words> They'd gambled with 239 lives and lost, then paid handsomely to make it disappear. <words>272</words> The seer smiled—a curious blend of innocence and cynicism that belonged to someone who'd seen too much yet still believed in truth's eventual triumph. <words>296</words>

"Delayed justice," she murmured, "is still justice." <words>303</words> The mythic relic she'd sought wasn't some ancient artifact but something far more powerful: evidence that could finally bring peace to families who'd waited three decades for answers. <words>331</words>

She uploaded everything to seventeen different servers before calling the journalist she'd been cultivating. <words>345</words> By morning, the story would be everywhere, impossible to suppress or spin. <words>357</words> The control tower would be demolished on schedule, but its secret would live forever in the headlines. <words>374</words>

Outside, real rain began to fall, washing away the footprints of party guests who'd unknowingly provided cover for the most important discovery of her unremarkable life. <words>400</words> The seer packed up her laptop, leaving only the empty USB drive behind—a small gift for whoever came looking. <words>419</words> Let them wonder how a nobody had untangled their perfect crime. <words>430</words>
