The sentinel crossed off the final name with ink that smeared like tears. <words>12</words> "Margot Elaine Winters," she muttered, her dry wit barely masking decades of disappointment. <words>25</words> The frayed rope coiled on the lighthouse keeper's bed seemed to writhe in the moonlight streaming through salt-stained windows. <words>45</words>

She'd come to confiscate evidence of eroding promises—vows made by keepers who'd sworn to maintain the light but vanished one by one. <words>68</words> Each name on her list represented another broken oath, another family line that abandoned their sacred duty. <words>85</words> But Margot's room held something unexpected: sheet music for the Tarantella Napoletana scattered across moth-eaten quilts. <words>101</words>

The sentinel's breath caught. <words>105</words> Her grandmother had danced that same frenetic traditional dance, spinning wildly to ward off spider venom—or so the legend claimed. <words>126</words> She'd taught it to the sentinel as a child, insisting the movements held power beyond mere tradition. <words>143</words> "To learn traditional methods is to understand why promises matter," her grandmother had whispered between breathless steps. <words>160</words>

Now, examining Margot's belongings with reckless precision, the sentinel discovered journals detailing the same dance notations her grandmother cherished. <words>179</words> The entries revealed a secret society of lighthouse keepers who'd used the Tarantella's hypnotic rhythms to bind themselves to their posts. <words>201</words> But something had corrupted the ritual; the frayed rope bore strange knots that matched the dance's intricate footwork patterns. <words>221</words>

"Certainly possible," the sentinel said aloud, recognizing the configuration. <words>230</words> The rope wasn't just rope—it was a counting cord, tracking failed attempts to maintain the binding spell. <words>248</words> Each frayed strand represented another keeper who'd tried to escape their oath by undoing the dance's magic. <words>266</words>

The bedroom's shadows began to shift, responding to her presence. <words>276</words> Ghostly figures emerged, frozen mid-dance, their faces twisted between ecstasy and horror. <words>289</words> Margot stood among them, the newest addition to the supernatural tableau. <words>300</words>

The sentinel understood now why she'd been summoned. <words>308</words> The lighthouse needed a keeper who could honor both old promises and older methods. <words>323</words> Someone who knew the dance but wouldn't succumb to its darker temptations. <words>335</words> She lifted the rope, feeling its weight of broken vows and desperate escapes. <words>349</words>

With calculated spontaneity, she began the ancient steps her grandmother had taught her. <words>362</words> The ghosts watched, bound by their own failed attempts to cheat fate. <words>375</words> As she danced, the rope in her hands began to mend, its frayed edges knitting together with each precise movement. <words>396</words> She would restore what others had tried to destroy, one traditional step at a time. <words>412</words> The lighthouse beam flickered back to life, cutting through darkness with renewed purpose. <words>426</words> Her dry observation echoed off stone walls: "Some promises are worth keeping, even if they kill you." <words>444</words> The ghosts nodded in solemn agreement, finally understanding what they'd lost. <words>455</words>
