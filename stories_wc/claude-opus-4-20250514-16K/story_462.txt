The town-weary traveler followed the metallic rhythm through fog, each tap of the carnival's rusted admission sign against its pole drawing her deeper into intentionally accidental wandering. <words>28</words> She'd meant to leave by sunrise, but the coastal wind's percussion had fertilized something restless in her chest, sprouting directions she hadn't planned. <words>51</words> 

The abandoned house of mirrors loomed before her, its entrance gaping like a mouth frozen mid-confession. <words>68</words> Inside, shattered reflections multiplied her exhaustion into an army of selves, each fragment showing another town she'd fled, another conversation left unfinished. <words>91</words> The metal sign's distant tapping echoed through the maze, a heartbeat she followed deeper into the carnival's glass intestines. <words>111</words>

Then she found it: a stained glass panel embedded in the central mirror, untouched by vandals or time. <words>130</words> Unlike the silvered surfaces surrounding it, the colored glass showed no reflection—only light, fractured into rubies and sapphires that danced with each windborne tap from outside. <words>157</words> She pressed her palm against it, feeling warmth where there should be none. <words>171</words>

This was the cradle of sparks, she understood suddenly—not a place but a moment when external rhythm synchronizes with internal static. <words>193</words> The tapping had been calling her here, to this intersection of light and shadow where thoughts could finally crystallize. <words>213</words> Each percussion fertilized another realization: the towns hadn't trapped her; she'd been running from her own mind's circular corridors. <words>234</words>

Standing there, surrounded by infinite selves yet touching something singular and warm, she achieved a hammered repose—peace beaten into shape by miles of road and nights of questioning. <words>263</words> The metal sign's rhythm slowed, as if sensing her stillness. <words>274</words> In that hush, she saw her phone light up with his name, the call she'd been avoiding for three states. <words>295</words>

She answered, knowing what he'd say before his voice crackled through: "I need to tell you something." <words>313</words> The stained glass pulsed under her fingers, a kaleidoscope heart. <words>324</words> The mirrors around her held their breath. <words>332</words> Even the wind paused its conducting, leaving only the space between heartbeats, between words, between who she'd been and who she might become. <words>356</words>

"I know," she whispered, watching the colored light paint possibilities across her palm. <words>370</words> In the carnival's glass belly, surrounded by the wreckage of illusions, she'd finally found what every traveler seeks: not escape from the mind's confines, but the door that opens from within. <words>403</words> The sign resumed its tapping, softer now, a benediction for what would come next. <words>418</words> She waited in that hush, ready. <words>425</words>
