Dr. Elara Voss pressed the crumbling parking stub between her fingers, the last artifact from the life she'd abandoned when the Castellan fortune meant nothing against fragmenting dimensions. <words>24</words> The xenobiology research station hummed with bitter electricity as reality stuttered around her—walls phasing between steel and organic membrane, time loops catching scientists mid-stride. <words>48</words> She'd inherited more than wealth; she'd inherited the family curse of seeing too much, understanding the spaces between spaces where alien biology leaked through Earth's weakening seams. <words>74</words>

"Cloud migration begins in seventeen minutes," the AI announced, its voice fracturing across timelines. <words>88</words> Elara smiled with practiced cynicism—bitterly optimistic, her colleagues called it, that particular brand of hope sharpened by watching three realities collapse. <words>109</words> The parking stub dated from the day she'd first noticed the tears: March 7th, 2019, Pier 47, where she'd parked her Bentley and never returned. <words>134</words>

The evacuation sirens wailed, but Elara turned left instead of right, taking the maintenance corridor that everyone avoided since Dr. Chen had emerged speaking backwards. <words>159</words> Traffic—both vehicular and interdimensional—clogged the main routes as panicked researchers fled the approaching phenomenon. <words>173</words> Her detour spiraled upward through forgotten stairwells where gravity hiccupped, each step a calculated risk balanced against her singular purpose. <words>193</words>

The observation deck materialized like a fever dream, its panoramic windows revealing the cloud migration in its terrible glory—not meteorological but xenobiological, vast organisms drifting between realities like jellyfish through cosmic oceans. <words>226</words> Below, the research station flickered between states: intact, ruined, not-yet-built, simultaneously all and none. <words>241</words>

Elara pressed her palm against the glass, feeling the vibrations of colliding dimensions. <words>254</words> The parking stub pulsed warm in her other hand—quantum entanglement, she'd discovered, linking her to that last moment of unified reality. <words>276</words> She'd spent seven years pushing the limits of possibility, gene-splicing Earth biology with interdimensional samples, creating hybrid organisms that could exist in multiple states. <words>301</words>

Now, as clouds of living paradox engulfed the station, she initiated the sequence. <words>314</words> Her modified bacteria, seeded throughout the facility's ventilation system, activated in response to the alien presence. <words>330</words> They began their work with reckless precision, each microorganism a tiny anchor point, weaving reality back together at the cellular level. <words>352</words>

The fragmentation slowed, stuttered, stopped. <words>357</words> Walls solidified. <words>359</words> Time straightened its tangled threads. <words>364</words> The clouds, sensing the shift, altered their migration path, flowing around the newly stabilized pocket of space-time. <words>381</words>

Elara laughed—sharp, triumphant, exhausted—as her impossible gambit succeeded. <words>390</words> The lost heiress had found her inheritance after all: not money, but the ability to unify what others could only watch fall apart. <words>413</words> She tucked the parking stub back into her pocket, a reminder that even the humblest anchor could hold against the storm. <words>434</words> Outside, the clouds continued their ancient dance, but inside the station, reality held firm. <words>449</words>
