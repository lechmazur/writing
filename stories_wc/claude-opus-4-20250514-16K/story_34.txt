The morose sentinel sat in the interdimensional airport lounge, turning the amber pendant between weathered fingers. <words>16</words> Across the tapestry of hidden hours, she had watched countless travelers pass through these liminal spaces, each departure another thread in her unraveling sense of purpose. <words>42</words> The pendant caught the lounge's ethereal light, revealing hammered shapes within its golden depths—marks from a blacksmith's anvil in a dimension she could no longer name. <words>69</words>

She was objectively emotional about her duty, understanding her melancholy as data points on a graph of infinite compromises. <words>88</words> Each choice had been necessary: accepting this post, surrendering her original form, learning to exist between worlds rather than within them. <words>110</words> The tides of compromise had worn her edges smooth, transforming her from guardian to ghost. <words>126</words>

A traveler approached, holding an identical pendant. <words>133</words> "You're looking for the way back," the sentinel said, her voice carrying mysterious familiarity—as if she'd spoken these words to herself across countless iterations. <words>158</words> The traveler nodded, eyes bright with hope she had long forgotten. <words>170</words>

"Watch," she whispered, pressing her pendant against the lounge's quantum glass. <words>182</words> The amber began to unfurl like a flower blooming in reverse time, each petal a memory of what home had meant. <words>203</words> The hammered shapes aligned with invisible constellations, and suddenly she remembered: the anvil had belonged to her father, who forged these pendants for wanderers who might lose their way. <words>234</words>

"You match the shapes," she explained, guiding the traveler's hand. <words>245</words> "Not to the glass, but to the impression they left on your soul." <words>259</words> Together, they traced the patterns, and the lounge shimmered, revealing doorways to a thousand definitions of home. <words>277</words>

The traveler gasped as one door showed their destination—a small blue world spinning in familiar starlight. <words>294</words> "But what about you?" they asked, hesitating at the threshold. <words>305</words>

The sentinel smiled, truly smiled, for the first time in unmeasured ages. <words>318</words> "My father taught me that home isn't a place you return to," she said, watching her pendant pulse with renewed purpose. <words>340</words> "It's a meaning you resurrect with every choice to help another find theirs." <words>354</words>

As the traveler stepped through, the sentinel felt the first crack in her emotional objectivity. <words>370</words> Perhaps being morose was simply another word for waiting—waiting for the moment when guarding the way home would teach her that she had been home all along, here in the spaces between worlds, matching shapes on the anvil of service. <words>412</words> The amber pendant grew warm against her chest, no longer a weight but a compass pointing inward. <words>430</words>
