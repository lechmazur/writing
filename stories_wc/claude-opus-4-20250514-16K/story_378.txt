Gertrude hadn't meant to become mayor—she'd simply been the only one awake when the previous mayor vanished into the carnival's fog three months ago. <words>21</words> Now, as wagons creaked away under dawn's first light, she clutched the clockwork beetle he'd left behind, its brass legs ticking against her palm. <words>45</words>

"Damned fool probably ran off with the snake charmer," she muttered, though her weathered face softened as she watched the carnival disappear. <words>68</words> The monks from the swamp orchard had warned her: those who led this town faced peculiar fates. <words>85</words>

She trudged to the crowded cafe where exhausted carnival workers gulped coffee before departure. <words>99</words> Sliding into a corner booth, she overheard two performers whispering urgently. <words>110</words>

"The beetle's more than decoration," one hissed. <words>117</words> "Brother Francis told me it holds the water wisdom—the only way to cleanse the orchard's poisoned springs." <words>134</words>

"But whoever uses it..." <words>138</words>

"Metamorphoses, yes. <words>140</words> Becomes something else entirely. <words>144</words> The mayor knew this. <words>148</words> He chose to change rather than watch the town die." <words>158</words>

Gertrude's knuckles whitened around her mug. <words>164</words> The polluted swamp had been spreading for years, killing the monks' sacred apple trees one by one. <words>181</words> She'd assumed the previous mayor was a coward, but perhaps... <words>191</words>

"Blast it all," she growled, earning startled looks from nearby tables. <words>202</words> Yet even her perpetual grumpiness couldn't mask the reluctant awe creeping into her voice. <words>216</words> The clockwork beetle warmed in her pocket, as if sensing her thoughts. <words>228</words>

Outside, the last carnival banner fluttered away like a departing ghost. <words>239</words> Gertrude stood slowly, joints creaking in protest. <words>246</words> The reclusive monks had tended that orchard for centuries, preserving something essential about this place—something worth any sacrifice. <words>264</words>

"Can't let those peculiar fellows down," she murmured, almost fondly. <words>274</words> "And someone's got to keep this ramshackle town from falling apart." <words>285</words>

She walked toward the swamp as morning painted the sky pink, each step heavy with purpose. <words>301</words> The beetle's clicking grew louder, matching her heartbeat. <words>309</words> In her pocket, she felt it beginning to move on its own, tiny gears whirring with ancient knowledge. <words>327</words>

At the orchard's edge, where black water lapped against dying roots, Gertrude pulled out the beetle. <words>343</words> Its emerald eyes glowed softly in the dawn light. <words>352</words>

"Well then," she said, voice rough with emotion. <words>360</words> "Let's change some fate, shall we?" <words>366</words>

The transformation began the moment she pressed the beetle to the water's surface—not painful, but overwhelming, like becoming the rain itself. <words>387</words> Gertrude's last thought, tinged with her characteristic irritation and unexpected wonder, was that she should have brought an umbrella. <words>406</words>

Brother Francis found her hat floating among the first clean lilies to bloom in decades. <words>421</words> The water sang differently now, he noticed—grumpily, but with unmistakable love. <words>432</words>
