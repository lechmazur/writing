Valentina adjusted her amber earrings, watching their honey glow ripple across the sky reflection pool. <words>15</words> The water's surface mirrored clouds that weren't quite right—temporal echoes from timelines she'd counseled lovers through. <words>31</words> As the city's most notorious heartbreak counselor, she'd perfected the art of healing wounds while inflicting new ones. <words>49</words> 

Her restlessly curious nature had drawn her to this profession after time travel's invention revealed love's cruelest truth: every relationship existed simultaneously across infinite possibilities. <words>74</words> She tracked cloud trails like breadcrumbs through temporal streams, finding clients trapped between what was and what could have been. <words>94</words>

"You're late," she murmured as footsteps approached. <words>101</words>

Marcus stood at the pool's edge, his reflection fracturing across dimensions. <words>112</words> "I've been everywhere," he said. <words>117</words> "Watched us meet a thousand times, fall in love in hundreds, separate in dozens." <words>131</words>

Valentina's fingers found her earrings again—amber preserving moments like ancient insects. <words>142</words> The gravity of desires pulled differently here, where past and future collided. <words>154</words> She'd worn these earrings in every timeline, a constant while everything else shifted. <words>168</words>

"That's your cage," she diagnosed, professional distance masking her own recognition. <words>179</words> "You're addicted to possibilities, not realities." <words>185</words>

He laughed bitterly. <words>188</words> "Says the woman who breaks hearts to mend them." <words>197</words>

The accusation stung because it was true. <words>204</words> Her method was destruction—shattering illusions so violently that clients had no choice but to rebuild. <words>219</words> She'd zip through their memories, unraveling the threads that bound them to false hopes. <words>234</words>

"I proclaim myself free," Marcus whispered, the words she'd taught countless others. <words>246</words> "Free in this cage of illusions." <words>252</words>

But watching him speak her prescribed mantra, Valentina felt the weight of her own desires. <words>267</words> Her cautious impulsiveness had led her here—helping others escape while remaining trapped herself. <words>281</words> Every client reminded her of what she'd lost, what she'd chosen to lose. <words>294</words>

The cloud trails above shifted, revealing new patterns. <words>302</words> In one timeline, she saw herself remove the amber earrings, hand them to Marcus. <words>316</words> In another, she walked away. <words>321</words> In this one, she stood frozen between heartbreak and healing. <words>331</words>

"The session's over," she said finally. <words>337</words>

As he left, his reflection lingered in the pool, a ghost of possibilities. <words>350</words> Valentina touched the water's surface, watching ripples distort the sky. <words>360</words> Her earrings caught the light, burning like trapped suns. <words>369</words> She'd built her reputation on freeing others, but tonight she wondered who would counsel the counselor. <words>385</words> 

The gravity of her own desires pulled her down, down into the reflecting pool where all timelines converged. <words>403</words>
