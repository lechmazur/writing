The whispering advisor pressed the piece of driftwood into Mira's palm, its surface smooth from decades compressed into moments within the time-dilated zone. <words>24</words> "Listen to what the wood remembers," she murmured, her voice barely audible above the temporal static that buzzed like ancient radio interference. <words>46</words>

Mira had come to understand time patterns, drawn by reports of the abandoned orchard where seconds stretched into years and centuries collapsed into heartbeats. <words>70</words> The fence surrounding it had begun its surrender to rust only yesterday in standard time, yet here, moss already claimed the posts like patient green fingers. <words>96</words>

The driftwood felt oddly comforting against her skin, warm despite the zone's perpetual twilight. <words>110</words> As she held it, something stirred within her—a rising empathy for all the moments trapped here, suspended like insects in amber. <words>131</words> The advisor's weathered hands produced a centuries-old coin, its surface worn nearly smooth except for faint indentations that caught the strange, sideways light. <words>155</words>

"To honor what was lost, trace these marks," the advisor whispered. <words>166</words> Mira's fingertips found the subtle grooves, and suddenly she understood—they weren't decorative but a map, a record of temporal currents carved by someone who'd learned to read time's hidden language. <words>197</words>

Through the driftwood, she felt echoes of the tree it once was, standing in an orchard that existed before the zone's creation. <words>220</words> She saw farmers who'd tended these grounds, their faces blurred by temporal distortion but their love for the land sharp and clear. <words>243</words> The coin had been theirs, passed down through generations who'd noticed time's peculiar behavior here long before scientists arrived with their instruments and theories. <words>268</words>

"They knew," Mira breathed, understanding flooding through her. <words>276</words> "They tried to warn us." <words>281</words>

The advisor nodded, her eyes reflecting centuries of accumulated wisdom despite her seemingly middle-aged face. <words>297</words> "Time isn't linear here—it's layered, like sediment. <words>305</words> The driftwood remembers the ocean that will claim this land in futures that have already happened in some layers." <words>324</words>

Mira felt the weight of this knowledge, the responsibility of witnessing time's true nature. <words>338</words> The rising empathy within her extended not just to the past but to all the possible presents existing simultaneously in this space. <words>361</words> She understood now why people came seeking answers about time patterns but left changed, carrying an oddly comforting certainty that every moment—past, present, and future—remained somehow accessible, somehow alive. <words>391</words>

As the orchard fence continued its graceful decay around them, Mira clutched the driftwood and coin, ready to honor the wisdom of those who'd seen time's truth before her. <words>421</words> The advisor's whisper followed her back toward the zone's edge: "Remember, time isn't lost—it's simply waiting to be found." <words>441</words>
