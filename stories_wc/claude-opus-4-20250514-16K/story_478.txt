The orchard island drifted through the maelstrom's eye, apple blossoms trembling against impossible winds while Midwife Thera stood at its heart, pressing lavender between pages she'd salvaged from the fireplace. <words>29</words> She wore her secrets like jewelry—silver vials at her throat, each containing memories she'd birthed from others, openly displayed yet their contents unknowable. <words>52</words> The waxing moon painted everything in mercury light, illuminating half-burned diary pages that whispered of what had been stolen from her. <words>73</words>

"Critical of everyone but yourself," the wind seemed to mock, remembering words she'd once written before someone had taken even her own recollections. <words>96</words> Thera's fingers traced charred sentences: *The child crowned at midnight, mother's eyes reflecting stars I cannot name, herbs pressed into her palm—rosemary for remembrance.* <words>121</words> She recognized her handwriting but not the memory it described. <words>131</words>

Each diary fragment revealed another stolen moment: deliveries she'd attended, wisdom she'd gathered through blood and breath, all erased from her mind but not from these partially destroyed pages. <words>160</words> The pressed herbs between pages released their essences—sage, thyme, mugwort—each one a key to doors locked inside her own skull. <words>181</words> She'd been too critical once, judging mothers for their cries, their fears, their desperate bargaining with pain. <words>198</words> Now she understood: someone had judged her worthy of forgetting. <words>208</words>

The maelstrom swirled closer, threatening to tear the island from its ethereal moorings, but Thera remained steady, arranging the burnt pages like tarot cards. <words>232</words> Her openly secretive nature had always unnerved the other midwives—how she'd display her knowledge while keeping its source hidden, like a magician showing empty hands before producing life itself. <words>262</words> But here, alone on this drifting sanctuary, she could finally see the pattern. <words>275</words>

The diaries weren't just hers. <words>280</words> They belonged to every midwife who'd grown too wise, who'd learned to read the language written in stretch marks and screams. <words>301</words> Someone—or something—had been harvesting their memories, leaving them hollow yet functional, critical without compassion, skilled without understanding. <words>319</words> The pressed herbs began to smoke without flame, and suddenly Thera could taste memories on her tongue: copper pennies and birth cauls, first breaths and last words. <words>347</words>

She pressed the herbs harder, grinding wisdom back into her bones. <words>358</words> The waxing moon swelled overhead, and she felt herself transcending—not rising above but growing through, like roots through stone. <words>378</words> Each recovered memory sprouted new understanding: criticism was fear dressed in expertise, and her stolen memories had been seeds all along. <words>400</words> The maelstrom sang as she remembered her true name, and the orchard island bloomed with fruit that tasted of everything she'd helped bring into the world. <words>426</words> Midwife Thera smiled, openly secretive no more, simply open, as wisdom grew wild in the spaces where her memories had been. <words>447</words>
