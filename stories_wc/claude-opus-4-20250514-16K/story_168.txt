Vera had murdered seventeen centerpieces that morning, each orchid stem severed with surgical precision. <words>13</words> The ruthless flower arranger tucked her scuffed plastic comb behind one ear and accelerated past the speed limit, fingers drumming the steering wheel. <words>37</words>

"You realize we're technically trespassing," her passenger noted, adjusting the radio as folk music drifted through static. <words>54</words>

"Technically is my favorite kind of breaking rules," Vera replied, her intellectually spontaneous mind already racing ahead to the stone circle. <words>76</words> "Besides, I need to distinguish the genuine petroglyphs from Victorian graffiti before the solstice tour groups arrive." <words>93</words>

The watcher's burden had fallen to her three years ago, inherited from her grandmother along with cryptic journals and that plastic comb – an unlikely key to ancient puzzles. <words>122</words> Their spontaneous road trip conversations always circled back to the same obsession: decoding rock art that others dismissed as random scratches. <words>144</words>

"Turn here," her companion said suddenly. <words>150</words>

Vera swerved onto the dirt path, sending gravel flying. <words>159</words> The mysterious stone circle emerged through morning mist like broken teeth against the sky. <words>173</words> She parked carelessly, already moving toward the central monolith where spiral carvings caught the light. <words>189</words>

The radio singer's voice rose and fell, and in the pause between verses, Vera pressed the comb's teeth against the stone's surface. <words>212</words> The worn plastic grooves aligned perfectly with the carved channels – a template, a cipher, a message preserved in the most mundane object imaginable. <words>237</words>

"My God," her companion whispered. <words>242</words>

"Please don't deify me yet," Vera murmured, tracing the patterns with fierce concentration. <words>255</words> "I'm only halfway through destroying the archaeological establishment's assumptions." <words>264</words>

The rock art wasn't decorative – it was instructional, a manual for those who watched and waited. <words>281</words> Each spiral marked a celestial event, each line a responsibility passed through generations of secret keepers. <words>297</words> Vera's polite anarchy had always masked this deeper purpose: protecting knowledge too dangerous for museums, too powerful for academic papers. <words>318</words>

"The tour bus will arrive in twenty minutes," her companion warned. <words>329</words>

"Then we have nineteen to document everything," Vera said, pulling out her phone while keeping the comb pressed against stone. <words>350</words> "The burden passes to whoever can see what we see." <words>360</words>

She thought of her grandmother, who'd arranged funeral flowers while memorizing star charts, who'd smiled sweetly while subverting every attempt to excavate these sites. <words>385</words> The watcher's burden wasn't about keeping secrets – it was about knowing when to let them bloom. <words>402</words>

The singer's voice returned, and Vera began to hum along, her revolution disguised as morning tourism. <words>419</words>
