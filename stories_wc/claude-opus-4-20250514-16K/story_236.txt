Elara bent over her drafting table in the underwater city planning office, her blacksmith's hands trembling as she traced proposed tunnel routes. <words>17</words> The softcover dictionary beside her blueprints lay open to "heartbreak," its pages waterlogged from centuries of submersion. <words>34</words> She had been openly hidden here since the drowning began, forging permits instead of horseshoes, waiting for the unfinished bargain to complete itself. <words>58</words>

The office's bioluminescent walls pulsed with each visitor—hitchhikers who'd somehow found their way to this drowned metropolis, spinning half-baked stories about the surface world. <words>83</words> Elara verified each tale against her dictionary's fading definitions, searching for the word that would ignite the ancient contract she'd made. <words>105</words> 

"The sun still rises," one traveler had sworn, barnacles crusting his leather jacket. <words>119</words> Another claimed trees grew backward now, roots reaching skyward. <words>128</words> Each story added another layer to her collection of sorrows, fuel she'd learned to burn in the forge of her chest. <words>149</words>

She remembered the day she'd traded her hammer for this bureaucratic exile—when the water first kissed the city's foundations and the sea-witch had offered salvation. <words>175</words> "Forge me a heart that cannot break," the witch had commanded, "and I'll spare your people." <words>192</words> But Elara, too meek to refuse yet too wise to comply fully, had crafted only half a heart before fleeing below. <words>213</words>

Now, across the hush of time's final ripple, she understood. <words>223</words> The hitchhikers weren't random—they were messengers, each carrying a fragment of the world's dying breath. <words>239</words> Their stories weren't lies but prophecies written in reverse, and her dictionary held the key to reading them properly. <words>259</words>

She turned to "ignite" and found her own handwriting in the margin: "To begin by ending." <words>276</words> The unfinished bargain had always been openly hidden in her refusal to complete it. <words>291</words> The witch needed a whole heart to flood the entire world, but Elara's half-made creation had trapped them both in this luminous purgatory. <words>315</words>

With fingers that once shaped iron, she tore the page from the dictionary. <words>329</words> The paper burst into cold flame, burning with all the heartbreak she'd collected from the hitchhikers' tales. <words>347</words> The office walls flickered, reality wavering between what was drowned and what might yet be saved. <words>364</words>

Elara smiled with luminous regret, knowing that to truly harness heartbreak as fuel, one must first admit to having a heart worth breaking. <words>388</words> The unfinished bargain would remain incomplete forever—her greatest work of defiance forged not in metal, but in the courage to remain tenderly, brilliantly unfinished. <words>413</words>
