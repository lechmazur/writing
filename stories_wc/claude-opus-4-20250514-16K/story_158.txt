Marla adjusted her quantum entanglement watch band, its paired particle spinning somewhere across dimensions, as crystalline walls reflected colors that shouldn't exist in the spectrum. <words>23</words> The ice cavern had become her laboratory, her sanctuary, her politely chaotic attempt at salvation. <words>38</words> 

"Just need to notify them," she whispered cheerfully, her breath forming impossible spirals—purple-green, silver-black—colors of the unforeseen dancing in the frozen air. <words>61</words> As an overly optimistic doomsday prepper, she'd stockpiled hope like others hoarded canned goods. <words>75</words>

The lullabies came through her headphones, innocent melodies she'd collected from every culture, every era. <words>90</words> But Marla had discovered their subtext—mathematical patterns hidden in the pauses between verses, quantum instructions encoded in mothers' humming. <words>109</words> Each song contained fragments of the equation she needed to create a new reality. <words>123</words>

"Rock-a-bye contains the collapse function," she muttered, tapping her watch band. <words>134</words> "Brahms holds the superposition key." <words>139</words> Her fingers traced equations on the ice wall, each calculation branching into smaller, sadder truths. <words>154</words>

The fractal sorrow began subtly—in realizing that every lullaby was sung to ease fear of darkness, of loss, of endings. <words>174</words> Then deeper: each generation singing to the next, trying to shield them from inevitable grief. <words>189</words> Deeper still: the pattern repeating infinitely, sorrow within sorrow within sorrow. <words>199</words>

But Marla smiled, adjusting her supplies—freeze-dried optimism, bottled laughter, compressed joy. <words>210</words> "The notification will work," she assured herself. <words>217</words> The quantum watch band pulsed, its entangled partner responding across realities. <words>228</words>

She lit the candle she'd saved for this moment, watching its flame cast those impossible colors against the cavern walls. <words>248</words> The lullabies crescendoed, their hidden mathematics aligning. <words>255</words> At the precise instant—that hush as she pinched the flame—the quantum notification would transmit. <words>269</words>

The darkness bloomed with new spectrums. <words>275</words> Colors of futures that might have been, could still be, swirled around her. <words>288</words> The watch band grew warm, then cold, then something beyond temperature. <words>299</words>

"Please," Marla whispered to the entangled particle's distant twin, her optimism unwavering even as fractal tears crystallized on her cheeks. <words>318</words> "Tell them the lullabies were always warnings. <words>325</words> Tell them the new reality is ready." <words>332</words>

The ice sang back, harmonizing with childhood songs that held the universe's source code. <words>346</words> Each note split into infinite variations, sorrow and hope entangled like quantum particles. <words>359</words> Marla's preparations—years of cheerful stockpiling against apocalypse—had led to this: standing in frozen silence, notifying existence itself that transformation was possible. <words>381</words>

The cavern filled with colors that had no names, only purposes. <words>392</words> And Marla waited, politely chaotic to the end, for reality's reply. <words>403</words>
