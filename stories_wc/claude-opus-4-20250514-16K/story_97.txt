The brass compass spun wildly in Oracle Vera's trembling hand, its needle pointing everywhere and nowhere in the unstable dimension she'd tumbled into. <words>22</words> She laughed—a desperately casual sound that betrayed nothing of her racing pulse—and tucked a strand of silver hair behind her ear. <words>43</words> "Just another calculation error," she muttered, though her fact-minded nature knew this was something else entirely. <words>59</words>

The dimension flickered like a dying candle, reality folding and unfolding in impossible geometries. <words>73</words> Vera had spent centuries cataloging truths, measuring certainties, predicting outcomes with cold precision. <words>86</words> But here, in the cradle of a whispered minute that stretched like taffy, her logic meant nothing. <words>103</words>

Then the visions came. <words>107</words>

Heartbreak she'd never allowed herself to feel crashed through her like a tsunami—memories of connections refused, moments of vulnerability rejected, souls who'd reached for her only to find equations instead of understanding. <words>138</words> Each vision struck deeper than the last, showing her the forgotten places within herself where empathy should have lived. <words>157</words>

"No," she gasped, but the compass pulled her forward, its brass surface now warm with something like compassion. <words>175</words> The visions intensified: a child she'd told would die in precisely 43 days without offering comfort, a lover she'd calculated would leave her so she left first, a friend whose grief she'd quantified instead of shared. <words>211</words>

The dimension responded to her breaking heart, walls of probability dissolving to reveal pathways she'd never seen. <words>227</words> These weren't routes through space but through understanding—each one leading to a forgotten place where facts had overshadowed feelings. <words>246</words>

With shaking fingers, she began to recompose herself, not as the oracle who knew everything, but as one who could finally feel everything. <words>269</words> The compass needle steadied, pointing toward a shimmering doorway. <words>278</words> Beyond it lay not answers but questions—beautiful, terrifying questions about what it meant to truly connect. <words>294</words>

"The path to empathy," she whispered, understanding flooding through her like sunrise. <words>306</words> Her centuries of facts hadn't been wrong, merely incomplete. <words>315</words> She needed both—the precision of knowledge and the chaos of feeling. <words>326</words>

Vera stepped forward with optimistic desperation, knowing the journey would unmake everything she'd been. <words>340</words> But in this unstable dimension where heartbreak became wisdom, she discovered that sometimes the most important truths couldn't be measured. <words>360</words> The brass compass hummed against her palm, no longer a tool for navigation but for transformation. <words>376</words>

As the whispered minute finally exhaled, Vera emerged changed—still an oracle, but one who understood that facts without empathy were just beautiful lies. <words>400</words>
