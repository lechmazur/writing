Captain Yara's feet pounded against the rusted flight deck, her morning jog a ritual she'd maintained for seventeen years since the spaceport's abandonment. <words>23</words> The single chopstick clutched in her right fist cut wind like a conductor's baton, its worn bamboo surface abstractly physical—both weapon and memory. <words>46</words> She'd stolen it from Chen's quarters the day his heart revolted, pumping backwards until the blood pooled wrong, drowning him from inside. <words>68</words>

"Damn fool," she muttered, her breath clouding in the thin atmosphere. <words>79</words> The smuggler's rage hadn't dimmed with time; if anything, it crystallized sharper each lap around the skeletal control towers. <words>97</words> Chen had promised her coordinates to the hidden waterfalls of Kepler-442b, those legendary oases where water flowed upward, defying physics and Federation patrol routes alike. <words>122</words>

She slowed near the observation lounge, where she'd set up her makeshift shrine. <words>135</words> The teacup waited, yesterday's leaves dried in patterns she'd learned to read like star charts. <words>150</words> Each morning, she brewed fresh tea with recycled condensation from her breath, swirled the chopstick three times, and watched the leaves settle. <words>172</words> Today's configuration mirrored Chen's final electrocardiogram—a bitter joke from the universe. <words>183</words>

"You think this is funny?" she spat at the empty chair across from her. <words>197</words> The biting sincerity in her voice echoed off titanium walls. <words>207</words> "Seven years of partnerships, and you choose a heart attack over telling me the truth?" <words>222</words>

The leaves shifted slightly in the artificial breeze from failing ventilation systems. <words>234</words> Yara leaned closer, studying the new pattern with smuggler's eyes trained to spot hidden compartments and false manifests. <words>252</words> There—in the clustering near the cup's rim—coordinates emerged like bruises on pale skin. <words>266</words>

Her hands trembled as she traced the numbers with the chopstick's tip. <words>278</words> Chen had encoded the waterfall locations in his own cardiac rhythm, knowing his stubborn heart would eventually rebel against a lifetime of stimulants and deep-space pressure. <words>305</words> The bastard had memorialized himself in his own death, forcing her to maintain this ritual until she understood. <words>323</words>

She laughed, harsh and wounded. <words>328</words> Tomorrow she'd leave this graveyard of ships and broken promises. <words>338</words> The waterfalls waited, flowing impossibly upward like Chen's reversed blood, like her tears that refused to fall in the station's weak gravity. <words>361</words> She pocketed the chopstick and resumed jogging, each footfall a percussion against forgetting. <words>374</words> The abandoned spaceport would remember them both—the smuggler who ran circles searching for treasure, and the partner who hid it in the rebellion of his own beating heart. <words>402</words>
