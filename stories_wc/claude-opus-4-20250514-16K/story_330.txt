Sir Aldric floated past the crystalline columns of the zero-gravity dance hall, his armor dulled by centuries of regret. <words>17</words> The trident prong from the sunken realm of Nethys hung from his belt, its coral-crusted surface pulsing with bioluminescent memories. <words>37</words> Here, in this normally abnormal sanctuary where gravity forgot its purpose, knights and phantoms waltzed through three dimensions of air. <words>58</words> The watchtower clock, visible through the transparent dome overhead, had been frozen at eleven fifty-nine for three hundred years. <words>78</words>

Tonight, something shifted. <words>81</words>

The clock's ancient hands quickened, grinding forward through rust and time. <words>93</words> Aldric's heartbeat synchronized with the mechanism as midnight approached—not the expected hour, but thirteen o'clock, an hour that existed only in drowned calendars. <words>118</words> The other dancers continued their ethereal ballet, unaware that reality was preparing to fold. <words>133</words>

He had discovered the forgotten paths beneath the dance hall during his exile, tunnels that connected this floating citadel to the submarine ruins where he'd first failed. <words>161</words> The trident prong had been his only trophy from that disaster, when he'd let his kingdom sink rather than speak the words that would have saved it. <words>189</words> Now, as the impossible hour struck, the prong blazed with undersea fire. <words>202</words>

"The vow," he whispered, and his voice rippled through the zero gravity like water. <words>217</words> The silent promise he'd carried for ages demanded utterance: to unite the sunken and the floating, the drowned and the dancing. <words>239</words> Sacred disorder erupted as the hall's perfect choreography shattered. <words>249</words> Dancers tumbled through suddenly meaningful air as gravity remembered and forgot itself in waves. <words>264</words>

Through the chaos, Aldric saw it—deepening horizons where the walls dissolved, revealing infinite dance halls stretching across parallel possibilities. <words>284</words> In each one, a different version of himself held a different fragment of the trident. <words>300</words> The forgotten paths had always led here, to this moment of convergence. <words>313</words>

He drew the prong and spoke the vow that had echoed silently through ages: "By depths unmeasured and heights undanced, I bind the realms that time has torn asunder." <words>343</words> The words quickened reality itself. <words>349</words> Water rushed upward through the forgotten paths, not drowning but blessing, as the sunken realm rose to meet the floating. <words>370</words> 

The dance hall transformed into something unprecedented—a cathedral of air and sea where the normally abnormal became transcendently possible. <words>390</words> Aldric's dejection lifted as he understood: his failure had been necessary, a sacred disorder that led to this greater unity. <words>411</words> The thirteenth hour chimed its final note, and horizons deepened infinitely outward. <words>424</words> Knights and sea-spirits danced together now, gravity and buoyancy finding new harmony in the spaces between breathing and drowning. <words>444</words> His ancient vow, finally voiced, echoed through every realm. <words>454</words>
