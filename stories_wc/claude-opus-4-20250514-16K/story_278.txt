Mikhail's calloused hands gripped the sponge as he washed the director's sedan, his sculptor's fingers remembering stone instead of soap. <words>18</words> The impact crater research base loomed behind him, its brutalist architecture carved into the ancient depression like a parasite. <words>36</words> Through the windshield, he glimpsed the vintage reading glasses—Dr. Chen's, unmistakable with their tortoiseshell frames—abandoned on the dashboard. <words>55</words> His theoretically spontaneous decision to pick them up was anything but random; he'd been watching, waiting, understanding the webs of intrigue that bound this place. <words>81</words> The glasses had witnessed every classified document, every hushed conversation about what truly lay beneath the crater's surface. <words>99</words> Mikhail held them to the light, and through their scratched lenses, he saw the truth written in the sediment layers: not a meteor impact, but something far stranger. <words>128</words> Fourteen years of servitude had taught him patience—fourteen years of creating propaganda sculptures while the scientists hoarded their terrible knowledge. <words>149</words> He'd carved monuments to their lies, shaped clay into false histories while his own truth calcified in his chest. <words>168</words> The afternoon sun slanted through the garage bay, illuminating a curtain of disturbed dust motes. <words>183</words> Mikhail watched them dance, remembering his grandmother's stories of travelers who could step between worlds through such golden veils. <words>203</words> The glasses trembled in his grip as footsteps approached—Dr. Chen, returning too soon. <words>217</words> In that moment of desperate clarity, Mikhail understood that some chains could only be broken by vanishing entirely. <words>235</words> He pressed the glasses to his chest and stepped forward into the swirling dust, feeling his molecules loosen, disperse. <words>255</words> The sponge dropped to concrete as his form dissolved into the sunbeam, each particle carrying fragments of his consciousness away. <words>276</words> Dr. Chen found only wet footprints and her glasses, polished clean, reflecting the empty space where her sculptor had stood. <words>297</words> In the investigation that followed, they discovered Mikhail's hidden studio beneath the crater—hundreds of miniature sculptures depicting the base's darkest secrets. <words>319</words> Each piece revealed another thread in the conspiracy he'd untangled through years of silent observation. <words>335</words> Some claimed they could still see him in the dust-filled light of certain afternoons, a shimmer of possibility. <words>354</words> Others insisted he'd simply walked away, that the disappearance was an elaborate performance. <words>368</words> But those who truly knew him understood: Mikhail had found the only door that wasn't guarded, slipping through sunlight itself. <words>389</words> His escape was both an ending and a revelation, leaving behind art that spoke truths the scientists had buried deeper than any crater. <words>413</words> The glasses remained in evidence storage, holding reflections of a man who'd chosen dispersal over captivity. <words>430</words> And sometimes, in the garage where he'd washed their lies away, the dust still danced with peculiar intention. <words>449</words>
