The morning paper thudded against the empty porch of the witch's potion brewery just as Agent Elara finished her calculations. <words>18</words> She'd spent three nights hiding among the cauldrons, watching the witch work, learning the precise moment when time itself could be stirred backward like cream into coffee. <words>47</words> Her fingers worried the loose button on her stolen apprentice robes—a nervous habit that betrayed her despite years of spy training. <words>68</words>

The witch had wronged her once, decades ago, stealing credit for Elara's first invisibility serum and launching a career built on borrowed valor. <words>91</words> Now Elara had returned, not for revenge, but for something far more complex: to mend the fences between them through an act of diabolically benevolent manipulation. <words>118</words>

She slipped the button into the temporal reversal potion, watching it dissolve. <words>130</words> The brew shimmered, and suddenly Elara wasn't just seeing the past—she could bypass the locked doors of history itself. <words>149</words> Time flowed backward around her like silk scarves in reverse, carrying her to that pivotal moment thirty years prior. <words>168</words>

There stood her younger self, exhausted, holding the perfected invisibility formula. <words>178</words> And there was Morgana, the witch, reaching with greedy fingers. <words>188</words> But this time, Elara intercepted. <words>193</words>

"Wait," she whispered to Morgana, her coy smile hiding centuries of practiced deception. <words>206</words> "Take the formula, but know this—she'll return one day, seeking not vengeance but partnership." <words>221</words> She pressed a matching button into Morgana's palm. <words>229</words> "When she does, you'll recognize her by this." <words>237</words>

The reversal ended, snapping Elara back to the present brewery. <words>247</words> Morgana stood before her, ancient now, holding that same button with trembling fingers. <words>260</words> "I've been waiting," the witch said softly. <words>267</words> "I've prepared everything you'll need to become what you've always dreamed—a true master of disguise." <words>282</words>

She gestured to a wall of potions that could reshape bone, alter voice, transform completely. <words>297</words> "My borrowed glory was built on your foundation," Morgana continued. <words>307</words> "These formulas are my penance, my attempt to mend what I broke." <words>319</words>

Elara's fingers found the space where her button had been. <words>329</words> The empty threads reminded her that some disguises run deeper than mere appearance—they mask our intentions, our hurt, our hope for redemption. <words>351</words> She'd spent a lifetime learning to hide, but perhaps the greatest disguise was pretending she'd only come back for the power. <words>373</words>

"Partners?" Morgana asked, extending a vial that sparkled with possibility. <words>383</words>

Elara accepted it with practiced nonchalance, though her heart raced with the thrill of fences finally mended. <words>400</words> The morning paper still lay on the porch, its headlines irrelevant to two women rewriting their own history. <words>418</words> In this brewery where time could flow backward, they'd found a way to move forward together. <words>435</words>
