Martha kneaded sourdough in her bakery's kitchen when the shadows began whispering recipes for revolution. <words>15</words> Her cynically gentle hands—weathered from years of serving a town crushed beneath the Regent's taxes—pressed dried lavender between pages of her grandmother's cookbook. <words>39</words> The pressed flowers held more than memories; each petal contained seeds of contagion, dormant spores that could topple tyranny if released at the precise lunar moment. <words>65</words>

"The moon waxes full in three nights," her shadow murmured, stretching across flour-dusted countertops. <words>79</words> Martha had tracked the patterns for months, marking crescents and gibbous phases in her ledger alongside bread orders, knowing she must exceed her humble station to free her neighbors. <words>107</words> The emergency time machine garage beneath her shop—a relic from the war, forgotten by all but bakers who understood yeast's relationship with temporal fermentation—hummed with possibility. <words>133</words>

She descended the hidden stairs, carrying pressed flowers from every season: foxglove for fury, Queen Anne's lace for precision, poppies for sleep. <words>155</words> The shadows followed, their newly-found voices harmonizing warnings and encouragements. <words>165</words> "The Regent's coronation feast," they sang, "when he'll eat your poisoned bread." <words>178</words>

Martha's cynicism had grown from watching good people starve while palace granaries overflowed, yet her gentleness persisted in every loaf she'd given freely to hungry children. <words>204</words> Now both qualities would serve her purpose. <words>211</words> She calibrated the time machine's controls, aligning its chronometer with her lunar charts. <words>224</words> The seeds needed exactly fourteen days of temporal acceleration to mature their revolutionary properties—timed to bloom in the Regent's stomach during tomorrow's new moon. <words>248</words>

"You're certain?" her shadow asked, suddenly doubtful. <words>255</words>

Martha smiled, sprinkling accelerated pollen into tomorrow's royal flour. <words>264</words> "Bread rises; tyrants fall," she replied, watching the machine's gears spin backward and forward simultaneously. <words>279</words> The pressed flowers crumbled to dust between her fingers, each mote a catalyst for change. <words>295</words> By dawn, the contagion would spread through the palace, a yeast of justice that would ferment dissent in every guard who'd tasted her bread, every servant who'd shared her loaves. <words>325</words>

The shadows danced approval on the garage walls, their whispers becoming songs of ancient uprisings. <words>340</words> Martha sealed the contaminated flour in muslin, her movements both bitter and tender—a baker's revolution measured in teaspoons and moon phases. <words>361</words> She climbed back to her shop, where morning's first customers would never suspect their bread-maker had exceeded every expectation, transforming from nourisher to liberator in the space between shadow-speech and sunrise. <words>392</words> Tomorrow, when the Regent bit into her fresh-baked revolution, the seeds would finally bloom. <words>406</words>
