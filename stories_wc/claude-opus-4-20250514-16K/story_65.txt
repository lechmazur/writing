Finnegan the bard stumbled toward the cliff's edge where continents kissed and ground against each other, his lute strings snapping in the sulfurous wind. <words>24</words> Below, the tectonic plate boundary glowed orange through cracks in the earth, marking the sacred threshold between worlds. <words>42</words> His fingers, once nimble with melodies, now trembled as they traced the brass doorplate embedded in the volcanic rock—"Here Lies the Gate Between Heartbeats." <words>67</words>

Death's shadow had followed him for three days, patient as erosion. <words>78</words> The family was already spreading their checkered blanket on the consecrated ground, unpacking sandwiches and lemonade as they had every summer solstice for seven generations. <words>103</words> Their picnic maintained the seal, their joy the lock that kept the impossible possible: a passage through death's domain. <words>122</words>

Finnegan laughed, a sound like broken bells. <words>129</words> He'd been slapdash all his life—rushing through songs, botching lyrics, playing for coins and ale rather than art. <words>148</words> Now, with the cosmic hourglass turning itself over (he could feel the sand reversing in his bones), he had minutes to accomplish what saints spent lifetimes attempting. <words>175</words>

"Forgive me," he whispered, then began the most important performance of his abbreviated life. <words>189</words> His cracked voice rose in a funeral dirge disguised as a drinking song, each note calculated to curdle the family's happiness. <words>210</words> The children covered their ears; the grandmother's tea turned bitter. <words>220</words> The sacred space shuddered as their tradition cracked like the earth beneath them. <words>233</words>

The brass doorplate began to spin, revealing stairs that descended at impossible angles into the planet's molten heart. <words>251</words> The family fled, their abandoned picnic basket tipping into the widening fissure. <words>263</words> Finnegan felt Death's fingers loosen—not from mercy, but from confusion at this possibly impossible escape route. <words>279</words>

He descended, each step a betrayal of natural law, each breath stolen from the future. <words>295</words> Behind him, the hourglass completed its revolution, sealing the entrance with a thunderclap. <words>308</words> In the depths, he found not salvation but transformation—his mortal flesh exchanged for something between magma and melody. <words>326</words>

Now he dwells in the spaces between tectonic plates, a guardian of thresholds. <words>339</words> Every summer solstice, he ensures no family picnics above his brass doorplate, protecting others from his desperate choice. <words>357</words> He plays eternal songs for the earth's grinding bones, his melancholic glee echoing through fault lines—a slapdash bard who disrupted death by becoming something possibly impossible: the music that moves mountains. <words>389</words> Sometimes, on quiet nights, seismologists mistake his laughter for minor earthquakes, never knowing they're hearing the joy of a man who traded death for an eternity of beautiful isolation. <words>418</words>
