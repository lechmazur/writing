Lord Ashworth hadn't been called by his title in decades, not since the spontaneous combustion lab hired him as a janitor. <words>19</words> The artificial hummingbird drone whirred past his ear, its tiny camera recording everything with the same hollow recklessness that had cost him his fortune. <words>43</words> Between text messages from his estranged daughter—always arriving at 3:17 AM—he fortified his makeshift shelter in the lab's abandoned wing. <words>64</words> 

The method was mysteriously obvious: old ticket stubs from the opera, the races, the galas where he'd once been somebody. <words>84</words> He reassembled them into a paper wall, each stub a brick of memory that somehow repelled the lab's volatile energies. <words>104</words> The drone hovered, its mechanical wings catching the blue flame that perpetually burned in specimen jar seventeen. <words>121</words>

"I know you're watching," he said to the drone, a moment of candor that cut through illusions like the lab's lasers through tissue samples. <words>145</words> The drone belonged to Dr. Chen, who pretended not to know about Ashworth's nocturnal residency. <words>160</words> Another text arrived: "Dad?" <words>163</words> He didn't reply. <words>166</words> 

Instead, he pressed another stub—Covent Garden, 1987—into the growing barrier. <words>176</words> The paper somehow absorbed the lab's unpredictable eruptions, each ticket a testament to evenings when spontaneous combustion meant passion, not chemical reactions. <words>198</words> The drone recorded his methodical work, its lens capturing what security cameras mysteriously missed. <words>213</words>

Between the next messages—three minutes, always three minutes—he remembered why he'd chosen this place. <words>227</words> Here, among beakers of substances that ignited without warning, his fall from grace seemed almost logical. <words>243</words> A lord becoming nobody, wealth becoming ash, just another experiment in entropy. <words>255</words>

The hummingbird drone landed on his paper fortification, its weight negligible but its presence heavy with unspoken understanding. <words>273</words> Dr. Chen would review the footage tomorrow, delete it, and leave fresh ticket stubs by the service entrance. <words>291</words> It was their arrangement, built on small truths exchanged in the margins of official blindness. <words>306</words>

His phone buzzed: "I know you're there." <words>313</words> This time, surrounded by his paper walls in a laboratory designed to study impossible ignitions, he typed back. <words>331</words> "So do I." <words>334</words> The admission felt like spontaneous combustion itself—sudden, consuming, transforming everything it touched. <words>346</words>

The drone whirred away, carrying his confession through the sterile air where forgotten nobles and brilliant scientists pretended not to see each other's wounds. <words>370</words> Between the last message and dawn, Ashworth added the final stub to his fortress: a ticket to nowhere, dated tomorrow, purchased with hope's counterfeit currency. <words>395</words> In this place where things burned without reason, even illusions could be cut through, one small, reckless truth at a time. <words>417</words>
