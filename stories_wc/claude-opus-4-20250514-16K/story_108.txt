The vexed minstrel arrived at the falling star collection point just as midnight fog rolled across the obsidian platform. <words>18</words> His lute hung silent against his back, replaced by the confiscated spy gadget pen he'd stolen from the Guards of Luminance three moons ago. <words>42</words> Within the tapestry of fate, this moment had been woven long before his birth—though he couldn't have known that watching "The Fog's Embrace" every winter solstice with his grandmother would prepare him for tonight. <words>76</words>

The crowd below writhed in collective madness, their eyes reflecting the fever-bright stars that fell like rain into the collection nets. <words>98</words> Each captured star pulsed with promises that drove mortals to violence, and the minstrel's task was simple: to hush the madness in the crowd before dawn broke. <words>125</words>

He clicked the pen twice, activating its hypnotic ink. <words>134</words> The fog responded immediately, recognizing its sister technology—for the pen had been crafted from condensed mist by the same artisans who built this sacred site. <words>160</words> These were the gifts of the fog: tools that appeared mundane but contained the power to reshape reality itself. <words>179</words>

With strategically spontaneous movements, the minstrel began to write glyphs in the air. <words>192</words> Each symbol hung suspended, beginning to radiate a soft silver light that competed with the falling stars. <words>209</words> His grandmother's voice echoed in his memory: "The fog gives, but it also takes. Use its gifts wisely, child." <words>229</words>

The crowd's frenzy intensified as more stars plummeted earthward. <words>238</words> The minstrel's coy malevolence surfaced in his smile—they thought him merely an entertainer, unaware that his performance tonight would steal their desires and leave them hollow. <words>264</words> Better hollow than dead, he reasoned, remembering how his grandmother had saved their village using the same technique she'd hidden within that ancient film's choreography. <words>289</words>

His glyphs multiplied, forming a net of light that caught not stars but souls. <words>303</words> The crowd's madness began to drain away like water through cupped hands. <words>315</words> Some collapsed, suddenly exhausted; others blinked in confusion, wondering why they'd come to this cursed place. <words>331</words>

The minstrel continued his work with patient precision, each stroke of the pen calculated yet appearing effortless. <words>348</words> By dawn, the collection point stood empty save for him and the nets full of stars that no longer called to human greed. <words>371</words> He capped the pen and tucked it away, knowing the Guards would never find it again. <words>387</words> The fog swirled around him in approval, offering safe passage home. <words>398</words> His grandmother would be proud—he'd learned her lessons well. <words>407</words> The tapestry of fate had gained another thread, woven in silver ink and starlight. <words>421</words>
