Margot's fingers traced the labyrinth orchard's twisted pathways above the colonial town's terracotta rooftops, her locksmith tools weighing down one pocket while embroidered gloves filled the other. <words>27</words> The pottery class below hummed with conversation, but she remained focused on the fruit trees that grew in impossible spirals, their branches forming corridors only she could navigate. <words>55</words> Twenty years of picking locks had made her jaded, yet the unclaimed throne hidden somewhere in this aerial maze still quickened her pulse. <words>78</words> 

She'd stumbled upon the secret during a painting restoration job, when ancient pigments revealed a map stitched into ceremonial hunting gloves. <words>99</words> The embroidery depicted not animals but power itself—methods of tracking and capturing authority that had been deliberately erased from history. <words>119</words> Now, as twilight painted the sky amber, she moved with demure audacity through the canopy, her presence delightfully menacing to the doves that nested there. <words>144</words>

A voice startled her: "The clay remembers what hands forget." <words>154</words> Below, a pottery instructor had climbed through a skylight, his wheel still spinning. <words>167</words> "You're searching for the throne," he continued, not questioning but stating. <words>178</words> Margot's hand instinctively found her picks, but he raised his clay-caked palms peacefully. <words>192</words> "My family were the throne's keepers, before the hunters' guild was dissolved." <words>204</words>

He explained how the old hunting methods—patience, observation, understanding one's quarry—had permeated every aspect of governance. <words>220</words> "The throne wasn't taken by force but by forgetting these ways," he said, producing matching gloves from his apron. <words>239</words> The embroidery was identical to hers, but reversed, like a lock and its key. <words>253</words> 

"Every generation, someone tries to claim it with ambition alone," he smiled sadly. <words>266</words> "But the throne requires both seeker and keeper, hunter and guardian." <words>277</words> Together, they navigated the orchard's puzzle, their gloves' patterns aligning to reveal hidden passages. <words>291</words> The fruit trees whispered secrets of pursuit and protection, of power earned through understanding rather than conquest. <words>308</words>

At the labyrinth's heart stood not a throne but a simple potter's wheel, its base inscribed with the charter of the hunters' guild. <words>332</words> "Governance is craft," Margot murmured, understanding flooding through her. <words>341</words> "Shape the clay of society with patient hands, fire it with justice, glaze it with wisdom." <words>357</words> The instructor nodded, and together they began to turn the wheel, their embroidered gloves moving in practiced synchrony. <words>375</words> The throne had never been empty—it had been waiting for those who understood that true power lay not in locks and keys, but in preserving the methods that shape communities with careful, skillful hands. <words>408</words>
