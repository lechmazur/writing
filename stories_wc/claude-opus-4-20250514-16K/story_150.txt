Rex "Rattlesnake" McGraw adjusted his brass-fitted spurs against the copper floor of the steampunk observatory dome, his weathered fingers rolling worn runic bone dice between verses. <words>24</words> The outlaw cowboy poet had fled here after the Tucson incident, drawn by whispers of a virtually peculiar phenomenon: coffee shop walls that rewrote themselves with prophecies. <words>52</words>

Throughout rehearsals for the observatory's monthly poetry slam, Rex noticed the inscriptions shifting. <words>66</words> Steam hissed from pneumatic telescopes overhead as he squinted at today's message: "Your dice shall misalign the stars themselves." <words>85</words> He'd stolen those bone dice from a Navajo shaman years ago, never understanding their power until now. <words>102</words>

The walls flickered again: "Intertwined destinies converge at the thirteenth roll." <words>113</words> Rex felt saturated ambivalence wash over him—part dread, part exhilaration. <words>123</words> His poems had always been about running, but what if running was just another form of arrival? <words>140</words>

During Tuesday's rehearsal, the coffee-stained walls proclaimed: "The poet who stole time must return it." <words>156</words> Rex's hand trembled, nearly dropping the dice. <words>163</words> Wednesday brought: "Your verses bend reality; your throws determine futures." <words>173</words> By Thursday, other performers avoided him, sensing something virtually peculiar in how shadows bent around his boots. <words>190</words>

The observatory's brass gears churned overhead, measuring constellations that Rex knew his dice could misalign with a single throw. <words>209</words> Friday's wall simply read: "Tomorrow." <words>214</words>

The final rehearsal arrived like a dust devil. <words>222</words> Rex climbed the iron stairs to the performance platform, where telescopic lenses focused starlight into geometric patterns. <words>239</words> The walls erupted with text: "Every outlaw reaches their crossroads. Every poet finds their truth. Every die cast reshapes the cosmos." <words>261</words>

His fingers worked the ancient dice, feeling runes pulse with heat. <words>272</words> The other poets watched, frozen between fascination and fear. <words>281</words> Rex understood now—his theft hadn't been random. <words>289</words> The shaman had needed someone to carry these dice here, to this junction where steam technology met prophecy. <words>307</words>

"I came to spark unstoppable curiosity," Rex murmured, beginning his final poem. <words>319</words> "But curiosity was already burning, waiting for kindling." <words>327</words> The walls responded instantly: "Throw them." <words>333</words>

Rex cast the dice across the copper stage. <words>341</words> They tumbled in impossible patterns, defying physics, their runes glowing like prairie stars. <words>354</words> The observatory dome cracked open, revealing not sky but infinite versions of himself—some lawmen, some saints, some still running. <words>374</words>

The walls displayed their final message: "Intertwined destinies require tangled souls. You were never one person, Rex McGraw. You were always all of them." <words>399</words>

The dice settled, showing symbols that existed in no earthly language. <words>410</words> Rex smiled, understanding at last why outlaws write poetry—to rehearse for the moment when running becomes returning. <words>428</words> The steampunk observatory hummed with new purpose, its gears now turning to rhythms only dice could divine. <words>445</words>

Saturated ambivalence gave way to clarity: every stolen moment had been borrowed from himself. <words>459</words> The curiosity he'd sparked would burn through generations, virtually peculiar and utterly necessary. <words>473</words> Rex McGraw, outlaw cowboy poet, had finally found his stage. <words>484</words>
