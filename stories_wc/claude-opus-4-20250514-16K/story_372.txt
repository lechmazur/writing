Kira pressed her forehead against the cracked window of the noodle shop, watching her reflection splinter into unfamiliar fragments across the glass—a thousand versions of herself she'd never met. <words>26</words> The unused sticky label in her pocket bore coordinates to a safe house she'd never reach; the avalanche of corporate surveillance was already cascading through the slums' data streams, hunting her signal. <words>56</words> She'd been a spy long enough to recognize the signs of pursuit, but tonight she felt curiously indifferent to her fate, as if her heart's recent betrayal had numbed even her survival instincts. <words>88</words>

The vendor slid a steaming bowl across the counter. <words>97</words> "New recipe," he said, his voice carrying the weight of conspiracy. <words>108</words> She lifted the spoon to her lips, and at that instant—as umami exploded across her tongue—she saw him enter through the back door. <words>131</words>

Marcus. <words>132</words>

Her handler, her lover, her Judas. <words>138</words>

"Found you," he said, unable to resist the urge to gloat even now, even after selling her identity to the highest bidder. <words>160</words> The scar above his left eye caught the neon filtering through the shop's grimy windows—the same scar she'd traced with her fingertips during their midnight excursions through abandoned towers. <words>189</words>

Their shared interest in urban exploration had been their cover story, then their genuine passion, then finally the trap that caught them both. <words>212</words> They'd mapped every forgotten corner of the vertical slums, cataloging rust patterns and graffitied love letters, never realizing they were also mapping the geography of their own inevitable betrayal. <words>240</words>

"The extraction team is three blocks away," Marcus continued, holstering his weapon with practiced ease. <words>255</words> "You could have just disappeared, but you had to come here, to our place." <words>269</words>

Kira savored another spoonful of noodles, watching steam rise between them like the ghosts of better days. <words>286</words> The avalanche was coming—corporate agents, deletion protocols, the erasure of everything she'd ever been—but destiny had always been a rambling thing, hadn't it? <words>309</words> A series of random turns through empty buildings, chance encounters in forgotten places, love found and lost in the spaces between surveillance grids. <words>332</words>

She reached for the sticky label, peeled its backing, and pressed it against the table between them. <words>349</words> The coordinates meant nothing now, but the gesture meant everything—a final message in their private language of abandoned places and might-have-beens. <words>370</words>

Marcus stared at the label, his triumphant expression faltering. <words>379</words> Outside, boots thundered up the fire escape, but Kira simply returned to her noodles, finding strange peace in their perfection. <words>399</words> Some avalanches couldn't be outrun; they could only be faced with the dignity of one last perfect meal in the ruins of love. <words>423</words> The unfamiliar woman in the window's reflection smiled back at her—finally, devastatingly free. <words>436</words>
