Brother Kael sat in the empty breakroom of the Sky-Touched Monastery, his weathered hands wrapped around a cup of cold tea. <words>19</words> The resignation letter from Master Chen still lay on the stone table, its edges fluttering in the mountain wind that somehow found its way through every crack. <words>44</words> Kael's sword rested against the wall, as tired as its owner, both having served the monastery for decades with a fierce apathy that confused the younger monks. <words>72</words>

"You could have been Grand Master," Chen had said before leaving. <words>83</words> "But you chose to remain nobody." <words>89</words>

Kael had shrugged then, just as he shrugged now, reaching for the plain cloth bag beside him. <words>106</words> Inside were star charts, carefully drawn over thirty years, tracking the meteor showers that passed over their floating sanctuary. <words>125</words> The other monks thought it a harmless hobby of an old warrior who had lost his edge. <words>142</words> They didn't know about the promise. <words>148</words>

When he was young and foolish, before the monastery had lifted him from the bloodshed below, Kael had sworn to himself that he would find the source of the falling stars. <words>179</words> Not for glory or enlightenment, but simply because everyone said it couldn't be done. <words>193</words> That spark of defiance had never died, even as his body grew weary and his enthusiasm dimmed to mere routine. <words>213</words>

Tonight's shower would be different. <words>217</words> The calculations in his bag showed a pattern emerging after three decades of patient observation. <words>232</words> The meteors weren't random; they followed ancient pathways between the floating monasteries, roads of light that the founders had hidden in plain sight. <words>255</words>

Kael stood slowly, joints protesting. <words>260</words> The breakroom felt smaller without Chen's presence, but perhaps that was fitting. <words>272</words> To overcome the monastery's greatest mystery, he would need to leave everything behind. <words>285</words>

He picked up his sword with the same disinterested efficiency he'd shown for years, knowing full well that his apparent indifference was the greatest rebellion of all. <words>312</words> The young monks sought transcendence through dedication; Kael had found his through calculated detachment, following his secret obsession with the dogged persistence of someone who had nothing left to prove to anyone but himself. <words>346</words>

As the first meteors began to streak across the darkening sky, Kael shouldered his plain cloth bag and walked toward the monastery's edge. <words>369</words> The abyss below held no fear for him anymore. <words>378</words> He would follow the star-paths tonight, keeping that old, naive promise with the wisdom of knowing exactly how foolish it was. <words>399</words> Sometimes, he thought with a tired smile, the most profound victories came from simply refusing to give up on our younger selves' impossible dreams. <words>423</words>

The meteor shower intensified, and Brother Kael stepped off the edge, following the light. <words>437</words>
