The final petal fell from the old rosebush behind Miko's Neon, and Kira knew her time had come. <words>17</words> She pushed through the repair shop's door, past flickering tubes of argon and mercury vapor, her katana's weight a familiar burden against her hip. <words>41</words> 

The tribal mask hung between a half-restored casino sign and a church cross crackling with faulty wiring. <words>58</words> Its labyrinthine carvings seemed to shift in the unstable light, patterns that matched the scars on her conscience. <words>76</words> Three years since the monastery burning, three years of searching for what the half-truth historians called "the door of release." <words>97</words>

"You're early," Miko said, not looking up from his workbench where neon tubes lay like exposed veins. <words>114</words> His grandfather had been one of those historians, spinning tales that were nine parts fiction to one part revelation. <words>133</words> But Kira had learned to sift truth from their elaborate lies, gleaning secrets like picking glass shards from wounds. <words>152</words>

"The mask," she said, her voice carrying that reservedly bold quality of someone who'd learned to command without shouting. <words>172</words> "Your grandfather spoke of it in his final manuscript." <words>181</words>

Miko's hands stilled. <words>184</words> "The one about doors that aren't doors?" <words>191</words>

She nodded, remembering the cryptic passage: *When neon bleeds its last light, the guilty shall find their threshold.* <words>209</words> The historians had wrapped truth in metaphor, but she'd pursued every thread, every whispered legend. <words>225</words> The mask supposedly opened a door to the unknownâ€”not a physical portal, but something deeper. <words>240</words>

"It doesn't work the way you think," Miko warned, finally meeting her eyes. <words>253</words> "The door of release isn't escape." <words>259</words>

"I know." <words>261</words> Her hand moved unconsciously to her sword's grip. <words>269</words> "It's confrontation." <words>271</words>

He lifted the mask from its hook, and the shop's neon signs dimmed as if bowing. <words>287</words> The carvings seemed to breathe, each line a path through guilt's maze. <words>299</words> As she took it, the weight felt heavier than her blade ever had. <words>312</words>

"The monks you couldn't save," Miko said softly. <words>320</words> "They're waiting behind that door." <words>325</words>

Kira pressed the mask to her face, feeling the carved channels align with tears she'd never shed. <words>342</words> The neon shop dissolved, replaced by a threshold humming with possibility and dread. <words>355</words> This was why she'd pursued every half-truth, endured every historian's riddle. <words>367</words> Not for absolution, but for the chance to face what haunted her. <words>379</words>

She stepped forward, sword sheathed but ready, into the unknown that guilty souls must walk alone. <words>395</words> The door of release closed behind her with the soft finality of a last petal's fall. <words>411</words>
