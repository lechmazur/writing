Marcus clutched the antique perfume bottle, its crystal surface cold against his palm as he stood at the intersection where concrete surrendered to vines. <words>25</words> The spontaneous decision to explore this side road had led him here, to this overgrown city street where nature had reclaimed what humans had abandoned. <words>50</words> He was a repressed poet, forty-three years old, who had spent decades filing insurance claims instead of verses, secretly terrified that his words might mean nothing. <words>77</words> 

The bottle had been his grandmother's, discovered that morning in her estate sale preview. <words>91</words> One spray had unleashed not just lavender and time, but memories of her reading Rumi by candlelight, tracing poetry onto his young arms with her fingertip. <words>117</words> Now, surrounded by walls draped in ivy and windows filled with birds' nests, Marcus felt the old hunger return—to pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin, to make permanent what the universe whispered. <words>150</words>

His lingering doubts followed like shadows. <words>156</words> What if his poetry was merely pretentious scribbling? <words>164</words> What if the years of suppression had killed whatever gift he'd possessed? <words>177</words> The street stretched before him, a green tunnel where streetlights bloomed with morning glories. <words>191</words> 

At that precise moment—like a pin dropping in a silent corridor—everything stilled. <words>204</words> Even the leaves ceased their rustling. <words>210</words> Then the ambush came: not from the abandoned doorways or vine-shrouded alleys, but from within. <words>225</words> Words erupted, decades of imprisoned verses demanding release. <words>233</words> His hands shook as he uncapped the perfume bottle and began writing on his forearm with its glass applicator, the remaining drops of scent mixing with ink from a found pen. <words>264</words>

"The city grows backwards into Eden," he wrote, his knowing naivety allowing him to believe this moment was both completely foolish and absolutely necessary. <words>288</words> More lines followed, spiraling up his arm: "We are vines seeking our own walls, poets afraid of our own voices, until the wilderness calls us home." <words>315</words>

A jogger appeared, stared, then vanished into the green. <words>324</words> Marcus didn't care. <words>327</words> He was writing on his skin because paper felt too temporary for this recognition: that his terror had been the guardian of his gift, that repression had been composting his words into something richer. <words>360</words> The antique bottle empty now, he used his fingernails to complete the final line across his chest: "Fear is the poet's first editor, but silence is their only true death." <words>390</words>

He stood there, inked and perfumed, a middle-aged man covered in words among the ruins, finally understanding that some verses must be lived before they can be written. <words>418</words> The city street held him like a green womb, patient with his rebirth. <words>431</words> His lingering doubts remained, but now they were creative partners rather than prison guards. <words>445</words> Tomorrow he would return to filing claims, but tonight he would transcribe his skin into notebooks, finally ready to ambush the world with his voice. <words>471</words>
