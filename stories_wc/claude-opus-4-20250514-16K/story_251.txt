Ezra clutched the bag of cracked marbles, each fissure mapping futures she'd rather forget, as the lunar dust settled around the mining colony's rummage sale. <words>26</words> She'd prophesied for the miners here, telling them which veins would yield, which would collapse, always with that peculiar smile that meant yes-but-also-no. <words>49</words> The scoreboard above tracked cosmic alignments and extraction quotas equally, a digital god that decided who ate and who didn't. <words>69</words> 

"Found something interesting," she murmured, lifting a box of jigsaw puzzle edges—no centers, just borders from a hundred different pictures. <words>89</words> The vendor, not recognizing her gift, shrugged at the worthless fragments. <words>100</words> But Ezra saw what others couldn't: each edge was a boundary between realities, waiting to be defragmented. <words>117</words>

In her quarters, she arranged the marbles and puzzle edges with trembling confidence, knowing this was presumptuous yet necessary. <words>136</words> The cracked marbles held shattered timelines—each fracture a decision point where the cosmic scoreboard had tallied wrong. <words>153</words> She'd seen too many miners' fates predetermined by algorithmic cruelty, their destinies compressed into profit margins. <words>169</words>

Between one heartbeat and the next, she pressed a puzzle edge against a marble's crack. <words>185</words> Reality hiccupped. <words>187</words> The scoreboard's data streams stuttered, reorganizing themselves as her fingers worked. <words>198</words> Each defragmented timeline sent ripples through the colony's predetermined futures, scrambling the careful calculations that bound them all. <words>216</words>

"I probably shouldn't," she whispered, even as she continued, her hands moving with practiced uncertainty. <words>232</words> This was her final oath—not spoken but enacted, not to any deity but to possibility itself. <words>249</words> She was happily sad, grieving the orderly futures she destroyed while celebrating the chaos she birthed. <words>266</words>

A marble split completely, revealing a swirl of quantum foam inside. <words>277</words> Through it, she glimpsed miners finding rare minerals where algorithms promised only dust, marriages that statistics said would fail instead thriving in defiance. <words>301</words> The scoreboard above flickered wildly, its perfect predictions becoming beautiful nonsense. <words>312</words>

Security would arrive soon, drawn by the anomalies. <words>320</words> But Ezra worked faster, each puzzle edge finding its partner crack, each union unwriting another certainty. <words>337</words> She was nobody special, she told herself, just a minor prophet with a bag of broken toys and salvaged edges. <words>358</words> Yet here she was, humbly dismantling the universe's accounting system one fracture at a time. <words>373</words>

When they found her, she was surrounded by light, marble dust, and infinite puzzled borders. <words>389</words> The cosmic scoreboard displayed only static now, its tyranny of prediction finally, blessedly scrambled. <words>403</words> Ezra smiled that yes-but-also-no smile, knowing she'd kept her oath by breaking every rule that mattered. <words>420</words> In the lunar mining colony, for the first time in decades, anything could happen next. <words>436</words> And it would. <words>439</words>
