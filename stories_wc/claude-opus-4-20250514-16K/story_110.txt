The water clock repair shop on Mulberry Street harbored more than broken timepieces—it sheltered Evelyn Tidewater, assassin extraordinaire, who had learned to adore the mundane mysteries of suburban life. <words>27</words> Her quietly flamboyant nature manifested in purple velvet curtains and gold-leafed gears, but neighbors merely thought her eccentric. <words>45</words> 

Between chapters of her lethal career, she fixed clocks and composed eulogies for her victims, each one a bleak masterpiece revealing hidden truths about the deceased. <words>72</words> "Harold Thompson loved train sets more than his wife," she'd write, "which explains why she hired me." <words>89</words> The eulogies hung from clothespins in her basement, fluttering like moths of regret. <words>103</words>

Her prized possession, a moss-covered lantern from her first kill twenty years ago, sat prominently on the shop counter. <words>123</words> Customers often asked about it, and she'd laugh—that desperate, hollow sound of someone transmuting pain into art. <words>141</words> "Oh, that old thing? Found it in a cemetery. The moss won't come off—stubborn as guilt!" <words>158</words>

Mrs. Henderson from next door brought her grandfather clock in Tuesday. <words>169</words> "It chimes at all the wrong times," she complained, then leaned closer, whispering, "Like my husband's alibis." <words>186</words> Evelyn's fingers paused on the pendulum. <words>192</words> Another domestic mystery unfolding, another potential client discovering her true services through neighborhood gossip. <words>207</words>

She opened the clock's face, finding a love letter hidden behind the mechanism—not to Mrs. Henderson. <words>224</words> "Fascinating how timepieces collect secrets," Evelyn mused, her tone dancing between sympathy and sardonic delight. <words>239</words> "Would you like me to fix just the clock, or...?" <words>249</words> She let the question dangle like a poisoned earring. <words>258</words>

Mrs. Henderson's eyes darted to the moss-covered lantern, understanding blooming. <words>268</words> "How much for the complete service?" <words>274</words>

"I accept payment in stories," Evelyn replied, already composing the eulogy in her mind. <words>288</words> "Tell me everything about him—his loves, his lies, his last words. I promise to craft something beautiful from the wreckage." <words>309</words>

That evening, as water dripped through her ancient clocks in symphonic sadness, Evelyn lit the moss-covered lantern for the first time in months. <words>334</words> Its green-tinged light cast shadows that looked like reaching hands. <words>345</words> She dipped her pen and began: "Marcus Henderson collected pocket watches and mistresses with equal fervor, never realizing time would run out on both hobbies." <words>370</words>

The domesticity of murder, she'd learned, was its own exquisite art form. <words>382</words> Between the chapters of death, life persisted in all its mundane, heartbreaking glory. <words>396</words> And Evelyn Tidewater, keeper of time and taker of lives, transformed every drop of pain into something almost beautiful. <words>415</words> Almost. <words>416</words>
