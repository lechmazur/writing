The unsteady sentinel swayed against the rusted bulkhead, her augmented legs clicking erratically on the abandoned freighter's deck. <words>18</words> Above her, a strange automaton bird circled through the vast docking bay, its brass wings catching the dying light of distant stars. <words>39</words> She had been waiting here for cycles, between worlds colliding, for the ambush of fate that the shredded letters promised. <words>59</words>

The bird descended, dropping another handful of torn paper fragments at her feet. <words>72</words> With trembling fingers made coyly furious by endless disappointment, she began reassembling them again. <words>86</words> Each configuration revealed different words: "recommend," "prophet," "lies," "collision," "escape." <words>95</words> The prophecy that had driven her here was a puzzle missing crucial pieces. <words>108</words>

"I recommend you cease this madness," the bird suddenly spoke, its voice a tinny echo in the cavernous space. <words>127</words> The sentinel laughed—a sound of cheerless ecstasy that bounced off empty cargo containers. <words>141</words> "You don't understand," she whispered, arranging the letters into new patterns. <words>152</words> "The worlds aren't colliding physically—they're bleeding into each other, and only the true prophecy can stop it." <words>170</words>

Her cybernetic eye caught movement in the shadows. <words>178</words> More automaton birds emerged, hundreds of them, each carrying fragments of the original message that had been deliberately destroyed. <words>197</words> The sentinel's unsteady gait became purposeful as understanding dawned. <words>206</words> The prophecy hadn't been misguided—it had been sabotaged. <words>214</words>

Working frantically now, she spread the thousands of paper scraps across the deck. <words>227</words> The birds watched with glowing eyes as patterns emerged. <words>236</words> Not a warning of collision, but coordinates. <words>243</words> Not a date of doom, but a frequency. <words>251</words> The fog lifted from her mind as the final piece clicked into place. <words>264</words>

"The ambush of fate isn't what happens to us," she murmured, activating the freighter's ancient communication array with the decoded frequency. <words>285</words> "It's what we do when we discover we've been deceived." <words>296</words> 

The automaton birds rose as one, their mechanical hearts pulsing in unison. <words>308</words> Through the viewport, the sentinel watched as the space between colliding realities began to stabilize. <words>323</words> Her unsteady stance finally found its ground—not in the prophecy she'd followed, but in the truth she'd uncovered. <words>342</words> The cheerless ecstasy of her revelation filled the bay: sometimes clearing the fog means accepting that the light beyond isn't what you expected. <words>366</words>

She turned to the lead bird and smiled grimly. <words>375</words> "I recommend we prepare for what comes next." <words>383</words> The bird tilted its brass head, and for the first time, she heard something like hope in its mechanical voice: "Already done, Sentinel." <words>407</words>
