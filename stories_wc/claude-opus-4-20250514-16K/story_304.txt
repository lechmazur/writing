The baroque asteroid spun through darkness, its gilded corridors etched with cherubs and thorns. <words>14</words> Mara crouched behind a marble column, her paint-splattered camera lens catching fragments of borrowed starlight through the crystalline dome overhead. <words>34</words> She had tracked her target across the unforgiving road of the void for three years, from station to station, each trajectory calculated via the pattern of a spider's web after rain—delicate, purposeful, inevitable. <words>68</words>

The transport hub's announcement echoed: "Final route complete." <words>76</words> 

The bus driver emerged from his cabin, stretching. <words>84</words> He removed his cap, revealing the face she'd memorized from a thousand surveillance photos. <words>98</words> But here, beneath the asteroid's ornate frescoes, he looked smaller, ordinary. <words>109</words>

"Superficially profound," he'd called her work once, reviewing her photography exhibition without knowing she listened from the shadows. <words>127</words> The critique had stung then. <words>132</words> Now she understood—her art had been hollow mimicry, capturing surfaces without souls. <words>144</words>

The lens clicked as she adjusted focus. <words>151</words> Paint droplets from her last assignment—an artist who'd discovered too much—still decorated the glass like tiny nebulae. <words>168</words> Through them, the driver's movements fractured into abstract patterns. <words>177</words>

He paused at the observation deck, gazing at the distant sun. <words>188</words> His weathered hands trembled as he reached toward the viewport, and Mara realized what she was witnessing. <words>205</words> After decades of night routes through the asteroid belt, carrying miners and merchants between darkness and darkness, he was trying to cradle the dawn in trembling hands. <words>233</words>

The realization struck her: they were both assassins of different kinds. <words>244</words> He killed hope with his endless circuits through shadow; she killed bodies for credits. <words>259</words> Both pursued their targets along unforgiving roads that led nowhere but back to themselves. <words>274</words>

She lowered the camera. <words>278</words> The contract specified proof of death, but through her paint-starred lens, she'd captured something else—the moment a soul recognized its own emptiness. <words>301</words> 

A laugh escaped her, sharp and unexpected. <words>308</words> Not cruel, but comprehending. <words>312</words> The sound echoed through baroque arches, startling pigeons that shouldn't exist in asteroid habitats but did anyway, defying logic like everything else here. <words>336</words>

The driver turned, seeing her at last. <words>343</words> Their eyes met across the terminal's impossible grandeur. <words>351</words> He nodded once, understanding passing between predator and prey, then walked toward the exit marked "New Routes Available." <words>369</words>

Mara let him go. <words>373</words> The photo of him reaching for sunlight would be her retirement piece—not for the client who'd hired her, but for herself. <words>395</words> Evidence that even assassins could learn mercy on the unforgiving road, when borrowed starlight showed them their own reflection. <words>415</words>
