The dry-tongued bard descended into the giant mushroom meeting hall, where bioluminescent spores drifted like lazy stars. <words>17</words> His gorgeously awkward movements betrayed years of performance reduced to silence, each gesture a remembered song his voice could no longer carry. <words>39</words> During the hush of this dreamless night, he clutched the stained glass prism that had become his only companion. <words>58</words>

The cloak of doubt wrapped tighter around his shoulders with each step down the spiral staircase carved from fungal flesh. <words>78</words> He had come here to preserve what remained of himself, though the method seemed absurd even to him. <words>96</words> The forgotten voicemails on his ancient phone held the last recordings of his voice before the curse struck. <words>114</words>

In the hall's phosphorescent glow, he set the prism upon the central altar where council meetings once thundered with debate. <words>134</words> Now only silence reigned, perfect for his purpose. <words>142</words> He played the first voicemail, his own voice spilling out: "Running late to the tavern, save me some mead." <words>161</words> The prism caught the sound waves, fracturing them into ribbons of colored light that painted memories across the walls. <words>180</words>

Message after message played, each mundane utterance transformed into luminous preservation. <words>191</words> "Can't find my lyre." <words>195</words> "The crowd loved the dragon ballad." <words>201</words> "Mother, I'll visit soon." <words>205</words> The bard's dry tongue clicked against his palate, tasting the ghost of words he'd never speak again. <words>222</words>

But something shifted as the final voicemail echoed through the chamber. <words>233</words> The prism's light began weaving the fragments together, creating a shimmering tapestry of his former self. <words>249</words> He watched, transfixed, as this luminous phantom sang with his stolen voice, performed with his lost grace. <words>266</words> 

The cloak of doubt grew heavier. <words>272</words> Was this preservation or imprisonment? <words>277</words> The phantom bard danced eternally in the prism's light, perfect and unchanging, while he stood outside—flawed, silent, real. <words>295</words>

With crisp languor, he reached for the prism, then hesitated. <words>305</words> To shatter it would mean accepting his voiceless fate, but keeping it meant watching himself from behind glass forever. <words>324</words> The mushroom hall pulsed with patient light, indifferent to his choice. <words>335</words>

His dry tongue formed wordless poetry as understanding bloomed. <words>344</words> The prison of the self wasn't his silence—it was his desperate grip on who he used to be. <words>362</words> He lifted the prism, not to break it, but to set it gently aside. <words>376</words> The light-woven bard continued singing, but he turned away, climbing toward the surface. <words>389</words>

Above, dawn threatened the dreamless night. <words>395</words> His tongue remained dry, his voice remained gone, but something new stirred—a gorgeously awkward freedom. <words>410</words> He had preserved his past and chosen his present. <words>419</words> The cloak of doubt fell away like morning mist, revealing not the bard he was, but the person he was becoming. <words>440</words>
