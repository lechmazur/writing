The stoic wanderer pressed the warped floorboard against her chest, its splinters digging through her coat like memories. <words>19</words> She'd followed the trail of nightmares for three weeks—children's terrors leaking from dreams, leading her here to the witch's familiar training ground. <words>41</words> The clearing hummed with mesmerizingly bland magic, the kind that slipped past defenses precisely because it demanded no attention. <words>60</words>

"You're late," the teacher said, chalk dust spiraling as she wiped the final formula from the stone slab. <words>78</words> The wanderer didn't flinch at the accusation, knowing it was one of many necessary lies that kept this place hidden. <words>99</words> Teachers always claimed tardiness; it confused time-tracking spells. <words>107</words>

"I've come to archive the binding ritual," the wanderer announced, her voice carrying that particular brash tenderness reserved for things about to disappear forever. <words>131</words> The teacher's familiar—a moth with human eyes—fluttered nervously between them. <words>142</words>

"Archive?" The teacher laughed, but her hands trembled. <words>150</words> "Child, you can't archive what breathes." <words>156</words>

The wanderer held up the floorboard, its surface carved with the same symbols the teacher had just erased. <words>174</words> "This came from the first training ground, before the burning." <words>184</words> She traced the grooves with practiced fingers. <words>191</words> "Your grandmother carved these while teaching my grandmother the art of lying to reality itself." <words>206</words>

The moth familiar landed on the board, its wings suddenly blazing with recognition. <words>219</words> Around them, apprentice witches paused their exercises, sensing the shift in power. <words>231</words>

"You would impose this burden on us?" the teacher whispered. <words>241</words> "To remember what we've fought to forget?" <words>248</words>

"Someone must," the wanderer replied, her stoicism cracking just enough to show the weight she carried. <words>264</words> "The nightmares led me here because the old ways are dying." <words>275</words> She gestured to the empty formula space. <words>282</words> "You teach them to erase, but not why we started hiding." <words>293</words>

The teacher's resistance crumbled like ancient chalk. <words>300</words> She pressed her palm against the floorboard, and light erupted between the carved lies and living truth. <words>317</words> "Then archive this too," she said fiercely, pulling the wanderer close. <words>328</words> "The reason we tell necessary lies isn't just for protection—it's because the truth would break their gentle hearts before they're ready to carry it." <words>353</words>

The wanderer nodded, understanding flooding through her as the moth familiar began to sing in a language older than words. <words>373</words> She would impose nothing; she would simply hold space for what refused to be forgotten, with all the brash tenderness of someone who knew that love sometimes meant preserving the very lies that kept it safe. <words>409</words> The nightmares that led her here weren't warnings—they were memories, begging to be archived before the last teacher wiped the final formula away. <words>433</words>
