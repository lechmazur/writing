In the epoch before thought crystallized into being, when creatures moved by divine programming rather than choice, Lord Aurelius wandered his marble halls with the purposelessness of wind. <words>27</words> His faded scarf, inherited from ancestors who couldn't conceive of inheritance, draped across shoulders that had never learned to shrug. <words>47</words> The invitation materialized as invitations did then—not through conscious delivery, but as inevitable as tides: silver letters arranging themselves on his breakfast plate between one blink and the next. <words>77</words>

"The Eternal Harvest Festival awaits your presence," the script proclaimed, though festivals hadn't yet discovered celebration. <words>93</words> Aurelius, naively sophisticated in his jeweled boots and empty education, understood the words' shapes but not their weight. <words>111</words> Still, his feet carried him across the haunted plain where ghosts hadn't learned to haunt, merely existing as echoes of events that never quite happened. <words>137</words>

The corn maze stretched beyond horizons that didn't yet know their boundaries. <words>149</words> Its stalks whispered secrets in languages unborn, creating pathways that shifted with each heartbeat of the not-quite-conscious world. <words>168</words> At its heart, he found her—Lady Seraphina, equally listless, equally noble, turning in slow circles as if dance could be discovered through repetition alone. <words>193</words>

"You came," she observed without surprise, for surprise required expectation. <words>203</words>
"The invitation appeared," he replied, his faded scarf catching phantom winds. <words>214</words>

They stood facing each other in that peculiar space before meaning, until something unprecedented occurred—their mouths simultaneously curved upward. <words>234</words> The sound that emerged startled the pre-sentient corn into stillness: laughter, pure and purposeless, the first of its kind. <words>254</words> It bubbled up from nowhere, going nowhere, existing merely because two beings had accidentally synchronized their breathing. <words>271</words>

In that shared laughter, something flickered—not thought, not yet, but its grandmother. <words>283</words> Intention sparkled between them like static before storms learned to gather. <words>294</words> Aurelius reached for Seraphina's hand, not knowing why, only knowing the gesture mattered more than all his sophisticated emptiness. <words>314</words>

The corn maze shuddered, reality hiccupping as these two listless nobles accidentally invented purpose through their rendezvous. <words>331</words> His scarf unwound, wrapping them both in its faded embrace, and for one impossible moment they glimpsed what they were creating: the power to choose laughter, to intend joy, to make meaning from meaninglessness. <words>365</words>

They stood in ironic awe of their discovery, these architects of consciousness who couldn't yet comprehend their blueprint. <words>383</words> The haunted plain held its breath—or would have, if breath knew holding—as the first spark of sentience flickered to life in their shared mirth. <words>408</words> Tomorrow, thought would dawn, but tonight, two nobles laughed at nothing and everything, their sophisticated naivety birthing the very notion of intention. <words>432</words>
