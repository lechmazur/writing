The mild-tempered guard pedaled through the resort's artificial gravity wells, watching reality fray like an unraveling thread at the black hole's event horizon. <words>20</words> Tourists paid fortunes to witness this cosmic destruction, their poetically bland exclamations—"magnificent" and "breathtaking"—failing to capture the savage bliss of annihilation. <words>42</words>

During his third bike ride that shift, Kaine noticed the stray cats. <words>54</words> They shouldn't exist here, not in a station orbiting a collapsed star. <words>67</words> Yet they prowled the maintenance alleyways between the observation decks, their eyes reflecting something beyond mere light. <words>84</words>

He dismounted and followed them, abandoning his patrol route. <words>93</words> The cats led him deeper into the station's bowels, past storage units containing relics from consumed worlds. <words>110</words> In a forgotten chamber, he found it: an ancient blacksmith's anvil, impossibly heavy, its surface etched with equations that made his eyes water. <words>134</words>

"You're neither hero nor villain," a voice said. <words>142</words> A woman emerged from shadow, her maintenance uniform a poor disguise for someone who moved like liquid mathematics. <words>160</words> "Just another thread in the pattern." <words>166</words>

"I refuse that dichotomy," Kaine replied, surprising himself with his conviction. <words>177</words> The cats circled the anvil, purring at frequencies that resonated with the station's hull. <words>192</words>

She smiled. <words>194</words> "Good. <words>195</words> The resort's owners harvest the unraveling—selling glimpses of endings to those who've never truly lived. <words>210</words> But the anvil remembers when this black hole was a star, forging elements in its heart." <words>227</words>

Kaine understood then. <words>230</words> Each bike ride, each patrol, he'd been circling his own event horizon. <words>243</words> The mild temperament wasn't weakness but camouflage, protecting something fiercer. <words>253</words>

"What happens if we reconnect it?" <words>259</words> he asked, touching the anvil's cold surface. <words>267</words>

"The thread reweaves," she said. <words>272</words> "Not backwards, but differently. <words>276</words> The cats know the way—they're fragments of possibility, leaked through quantum foam." <words>288</words>

Together, they began to push the anvil toward the observation deck. <words>299</words> With each meter, reality rippled. <words>304</words> The poetically bland became viscerally strange. <words>310</words> Tourists gasped as their expensive emptiness filled with genuine awe. <words>320</words>

The resort's alarms wailed, but Kaine felt only savage bliss. <words>330</words> Not the joy of destruction, but of transformation. <words>338</words> He wasn't saving or damning anyone—just choosing to make the pattern more interesting. <words>351</words>

As they reached the viewport, the black hole pulsed. <words>360</words> The anvil began to sing, a deep thrumming that turned the unraveling thread into a loom. <words>377</words> The cats leaped through the reforming space, their paths writing new possibilities. <words>389</words>

Kaine smiled, watching his mild-tempered mask dissolve. <words>396</words> Sometimes the greatest disguise was being exactly what you appeared to be. <words>408</words> Until you weren't. <words>411</words> Until the moment demanded more. <words>416</words> The black hole resort would never be the same, and neither would he. <words>429</words> The thread had found its needle. <words>435</words>
