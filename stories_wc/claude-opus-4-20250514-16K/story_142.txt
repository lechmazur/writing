Lady Evangeline Ashworth clutched the yellowed botanical illustration—her family's last valuable possession—as she stood before the rusted gates of Grimwood's abandoned amusement park. <words>24</words> The broke aristocrat had decided to walk instead of drive, selling her car months ago to buy bread. <words>42</words> Between parallel paths of what her life was and what it had become, she felt the weight of her legacy's burden pressing down like iron chains. <words>69</words> The Ashworth family had guarded culinary secrets for centuries, recipes that could harmonize rare botanical essences into dishes that supposedly granted visions. <words>92</words> Now, with creditors circling like vultures, she needed those recipes hidden by her eccentric great-aunt Cordelia in this realistically odd location—inside the control booth of the park's infamous roller coaster, The Serpent's Spine. <words>126</words>

The October fog wrapped around her ankles as she navigated through broken carousel horses and deflated game booths. <words>144</words> Each step echoed with a blurry vividness, as if the abandoned park existed simultaneously in multiple realities. <words>161</words> The roller coaster loomed ahead, its wooden tracks twisted into impossible angles that defied physics yet somehow remained standing. <words>181</words> Cordelia had been the park's botanist, secretly cultivating supernatural herbs in hidden greenhouses between the attractions. <words>198</words> Before her death, she'd whispered that the recipes were sealed where "screams meet silence." <words>213</words>

Evangeline climbed the maintenance ladder, her aristocratic hands—once soft, now calloused—gripping each rung. <words>227</words> The control booth door hung askew, revealing walls covered in botanical illustrations identical to hers. <words>243</words> As she touched them, the images began to move, leaves unfurling and flowers blooming in perpetual cycles. <words>261</words> The recipes weren't written—they were encoded in the plant movements, a living cookbook that required her illustration as a key. <words>282</words> She pressed her paper against the wall, and suddenly understood: each plant's growth pattern represented measurements, cooking times, sacred proportions. <words>303</words>

The roller coaster creaked to life, though no power had fed it for decades. <words>318</words> Evangeline felt herself standing between parallel paths again—one where she sold these secrets to save her estate, another where she honored her family's duty as guardians. <words>346</words> The botanical illustrations pulsed with otherworldly light, showing her glimpses of ancestors who'd made the same choice. <words>364</words> She began to memorize the patterns, knowing that true wealth wasn't in gold but in keeping these mysteries alive. <words>384</words> As dawn broke through the fog, she descended with the recipes burning in her memory, ready to rebuild the Ashworth legacy one careful dish at a time. <words>413</words> The burden had become her purpose, transforming from weight to wings. <words>424</words>
