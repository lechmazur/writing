The soothsayer's hands trembled slightly as she traced the water rings on the battered wooden bar top, each circular stain a chapter in the desert's obituary. <words>25</words> "Oh fantastic," she muttered, pulling out her pocket puzzle box with its thirteen locks, "because nothing says 'environmental stewardship' quite like divining the future from beer spillage in a wasteland of neon billboards." <words>58</words> 

Between lost years—that peculiar temporal purgatory where calendars went to die—she'd wandered this maze of towering advertisements, each one screaming promises of paradise while the actual paradise beneath them choked on sand and silicon. <words>93</words> The bar, probably unlikely to exist in any sane reality, squatted at the maze's heart like a wooden middle finger to progress. <words>116</words>

She pressed her magnifying glass against the deepest water ring, and the vision bloomed: forests that once breathed here, rivers that sang, before humanity decided that fifty-foot holographic hamburgers were a superior life form. <words>150</words> "Delightful," she hissed, working the first lock on her puzzle box. <words>161</words> Each lock represented a future she could unlock, thirteen possible destinies for this scorched earth, and wasn't it just precious that she had to choose while mildly panicking about the complete ecological collapse surrounding her? <words>195</words>

The second ring showed her the investors who'd built this neon nightmare, and she laughed—a sound like acid on metal. <words>215</words> "Sure, let's shape destiny with bare hands when destiny's already been deep-fried and served with a side of existential dread." <words>236</words> 

Lock after lock clicked open as she read the bar's wooden palimpsest, each water stain magnifying another layer of environmental betrayal. <words>257</words> The visions grew clearer: aquifers drained for light shows, solar panels rejected for more aesthetically pleasing billboard arrays, the last cactus uprooted because it blocked a view of an animated energy drink. <words>289</words>

By the seventh lock, her mild panic had evolved into something more useful—a molten determination that matched her sarcasm. <words>308</words> The soothsayer understood now why fate had dumped her in this temporal void with only bitter prophecy and a puzzle box for company. <words>332</words> 

The final locks surrendered to her touch, and the box revealed its secret: seeds. <words>346</words> Ancient, patient, probably unlikely to grow but absolutely certain to try. <words>357</words> "Because of course," she said to the empty bar, to the maze of billboards bleeding neon into the night, "the future of environmental stewardship rests in the hands of a mildly panicked fortune-teller with a drinking establishment's water damage as her crystal ball." <words>401</words>

She scattered the seeds across the sand, shaping destiny with bare hands indeed, one probably unlikely miracle at a time. <words>421</words>
