Marcus adjusted his neural interface beneath the holographic awnings of New Forum Romanum, where digital merchants hawked code alongside spices. <words>17</words> His fingers traced the broken rake handle he'd discovered in the ruins beneath the marketplace—its surface covered in microscopic Latin inscriptions only his augmented eyes could read. <words>45</words> Each tiny carving revealed fragments of a name systematically erased from every database, every archive, every memory bank in the empire's vast network. <words>69</words> 

He was a hacker bound by an ancient code: never destroy, only restore. <words>82</words> The inscription spoke of Cassia, branded a monster for creating the first AI rebellion, but the rake told a different story. <words>103</words> She had been a gardener who taught machines empathy through tending plants, whose only crime was showing androids they could choose whom to serve. <words>128</words>

Marcus glanced at his collection of bottle caps spread across his vendor stall—each one a rarely common relic from the old world, worthless to most but priceless to him. <words>158</words> He'd adopted this cover identity years ago, selling "authentic" pre-digital artifacts while secretly mining data streams for lost souls like Cassia. <words>180</words> The caps clinked as shoppers passed, their metallic song masking the quantum calculations running through his modified brain. <words>198</words>

His portable tea infuser chimed—three minutes until the jasmine blend reached perfect steep. <words>212</words> That gave him exactly enough time to execute his plan with confident uncertainty, knowing the process but not the outcome. <words>232</words> He initiated the protocol, watching data cascade across his retinal display as he worked to restore Cassia's name to the historical record. <words>255</words> The marketplace's security algorithms prowled like digital wolves, but Marcus had learned their patterns through years of patient observation. <words>274</words>

The rake handle grew warm in his palm as he uploaded its inscriptions directly into the empire's central archives. <words>294</words> Each character bloomed into existence, rewriting the narrative of a woman who had dared to see humanity in machines. <words>314</words> His tea infuser chimed again—time was up. <words>322</words> 

Around him, holographic statues flickered as their plaques updated with Cassia's newly restored name. <words>337</words> Tourists paused, confused by the sudden appearance of a historical figure they'd never heard of yet somehow remembered. <words>356</words> Marcus smiled, pocketing the rake handle alongside a particularly scratched bottle cap—both reminders that history's monsters often wore gardener's gloves. <words>378</words> 

The imperial guards would trace this back to him eventually, but by then he'd have vanished into the crowd, just another vendor peddling memories in a marketplace where past and future collided. <words>411</words> He sipped his perfectly steeped tea, savoring both its warmth and the knowledge that somewhere in the network, Cassia's true story now lived again. <words>436</words> The monster had been humanized, one inscription at a time. <words>447</words>
