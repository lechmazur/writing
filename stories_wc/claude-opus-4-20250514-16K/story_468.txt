Mortician Elara Voss had catalogued death for thirty years, but it was the dreams of the deceased that truly fascinated her. <words>21</words> Her collection of dream journals, pilfered from funeral homes across three continents with apologetic notes left behind, filled her apartment. <words>40</words> When the night yields to golden embers, she would venture into the mangrove labyrinth where singing spirits dwelled, following a ritual she'd discovered in a suicide victim's final entry. <words>69</words>

Tonight, she wore the tarnished silver bracelet she'd borrowed from Mrs. Chen's corpse—a necessary anchor, the journal had insisted. <words>88</words> The brackish water reflected dawn's first light as ghostly melodies drifted between twisted roots. <words>102</words> "Forgive the intrusion," Elara called out, maintaining her professional courtesy even while trespassing in the realm of the dead. <words>121</words>

She spotted fresh footprints in the mud ahead, glowing faintly. <words>131</words> Testing the journal's instructions, she placed her foot precisely in one print, attempting to imitate the spirit's gait. <words>149</words> The footprint vanished after a single heartbeat, leaving only ripples in reality. <words>161</words> Another appeared three feet away, then another, leading deeper into the maze. <words>173</words>

The spirits' song grew louder yet somehow more peaceful—a loudly serene chorus that should have been contradictory but wasn't. <words>192</words> Elara followed the ephemeral trail, each step perfectly mimicked, each footprint dissolving behind her. <words>206</words> The bracelet grew colder against her wrist. <words>213</words>

At the labyrinth's heart, she found them: hundreds of leather-bound journals floating in the air like patient birds. <words>231</words> The spirits materialized slowly, translucent figures still humming their impossible song. <words>242</words> "You seek our dreams," one said, neither accusation nor question. <words>252</words>

"I seek understanding," Elara replied, bowing slightly. <words>259</words> "The living forget that the dead once dreamed." <words>267</words>

The spirit gestured to the journals. <words>273</words> "Take what you need, curious keeper of flesh." <words>281</words> As Elara reached for the nearest journal, the air itself seemed to exhale—the rustle of revelation, like pages turning in an empty room. <words>304</words> She understood then that the spirits had been waiting for someone who would remember their dreams, not just their bodies. <words>324</words>

The bracelet crumbled to dust as she gathered three journals, the maximum her strange contract allowed. <words>340</words> She retraced her path, no footprints guiding her now, carrying the dreams of painters and accountants and children who'd left too soon. <words>362</words> The spirits' song faded to whispers, then silence. <words>370</words>

Back in her apartment, surrounded by her peculiar archive, Elara catalogued the new additions with the same meticulous care she'd once reserved for corpses. <words>394</words> Some would call her theft sacred vandalism, but she preferred to think of it as preservation through polite anarchy. <words>413</words> After all, what good were dreams if no one remembered them? <words>424</words>
