Marcus tucked the pressed butterfly deeper into his jacket pocket as monitors blinked around him in the drought prediction center's medical bay. <words>18</words> The cautious smuggler had calculated every water route for decades, but today's dental surgery would reveal more than cavities. <words>36</words>

"Count backward from ten," the technician said, adjusting the anesthesia mask while somewhere down the hall, a painter sobbed his confession to authorities. <words>60</words>

Marcus's meticulously impulsive nature had served him well—planning every spontaneous gesture, choreographing each random kindness as he distributed stolen water to parched communities. <words>84</words> But as the gas hit, musical memories flooded through: his grandmother's lullabies echoing across drought-scorched fields, each note a map to hidden aquifers. <words>108</words>

"Seven... six... the butterfly knows..." he mumbled, his voice carrying with detached excitement through the center's ventilation system. <words>126</words>

Dr. Chen leaned closer, recognizing the signs of a confession brewing beneath the clinical enthusiasm of someone who'd stopped caring about consequences. <words>149</words> The painter's wails crescendoed as Marcus's words tumbled out: coordinates disguised as chord progressions, water cache locations hummed in forgotten melodies. <words>171</words>

"My grandmother... she pressed butterflies between sheet music... each one marked a well..." His fingers conducted invisible symphonies against the surgical chair. <words>194</words>

The drought prediction algorithms suddenly made sense—Marcus had been feeding them false data for years, protecting his routes while studying their models obsessively. <words>218</words> His delirious mind revealed the pattern: predict where authorities would look, then smuggle water everywhere else. <words>235</words>

"I wanted to feel what they feel," he sang softly, the butterfly's wings visible through his pocket. <words>253</words> "Every drop I stole, I imagined their thirst... practiced their relief... catalogued their tears..." <words>268</words>

Dr. Chen realized she was witnessing something profound—a criminal's methodology rooted in radical compassion, delivered with the fervor of someone beyond caring. <words>291</words> The painter's confession faded as Marcus's peaked, two parallel admissions of guilt echoing through sterile corridors. <words>308</words>

"The music remembers everything," Marcus whispered, his eyes fluttering. <words>317</words> "Each song a drought, each rest a rainfall... I mapped empathy itself..." <words>330</words>

As consciousness slipped away, his hand clutched the pressed butterfly—a Blue Morpho caught between Chopin nocturnes, its preservation an act of beautiful destruction. <words>354</words> The prediction center's screens flickered with new data: unusual moisture patterns appearing wherever Marcus's grandmother's songs had once played. <words>375</words>

Dr. Chen documented every word with clinical precision, understanding that she'd witnessed the unraveling of someone who'd made himself feel too much. <words>398</words> The cautious smuggler had predicted his own capture through pure exhaustion of caring. <words>412</words> His enthusiastic apathy wasn't indifference—it was the relief of finally letting go. <words>424</words>
