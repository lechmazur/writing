In the hush of the unremembered future, Lucky Jack shuffled his cards in the abandoned schoolhouse, whistling a tune that echoed through broken windows like laughter at a funeral. <words>26</words> The ghost town had forgotten its own name, but Jack remembered everything—especially how he'd won this cursed place in a poker game that typically never should have happened. <words>54</words>

"Time for confessions!" he announced to the empty desks, arranging bottles in a circle where children once learned arithmetic. <words>73</words> His gambling had always defied the gravity of hopelessness, each bet a bright balloon floating over an abyss. <words>91</words> He spun the first bottle with practiced flair, and when it stopped, he opened the botanical diary he'd found wedged beneath the floorboards. <words>114</words>

"I confess," he said cheerfully to the dust motes dancing in afternoon light, "that I once duplicated myself to win at two tables simultaneously." <words>139</words> The diary's pressed flowers seemed to nod, their colors still vivid despite decades of decay. <words>154</words> Power had corrupted him in such delightful ways—the ability to duplicate wasn't meant for cheating at cards, but who could resist? <words>176</words>

He spun again, and the bottle pointed to a spider's web. <words>187</words> "I confess that winning this town was my greatest loss," he laughed, the sound both bitter and sweet. <words>205</words> The botanical diary revealed another entry: 'Hope grows wild in abandoned places.' <words>217</words> Someone had pressed a dandelion between these pages, its seeds still clinging to wishes. <words>231</words>

The corruption of power had taught him this: when you can duplicate yourself infinitely, you become less real with each copy. <words>252</words> His original self had vanished somewhere between the third and fourth duplication, leaving only echoes playing cards in empty towns. <words>272</words>

"Final spin!" he declared, though no one was listening except the ghosts of lessons past. <words>288</words> The bottle turned lazily, pointing everywhere and nowhere. <words>296</words> "I confess that I'm still betting on tomorrow," he said, dealing cards to invisible opponents. <words>312</words> "Even in this cheerful despair, even when the future forgets to remember us." <words>325</words>

He wrote his own entry in the botanical diary, pressing a playing card between its pages—the ace of hearts, naturally. <words>345</words> 'Luck blooms eternal,' he scrawled, 'especially in places where hope has no business growing.' <words>359</words> 

Outside, tumbleweeds performed their ancient dance, and Lucky Jack continued his game, duplicating himself once more to have someone to play against. <words>382</words> In the abandoned schoolhouse, where power's corruption met hopeless optimism, he dealt another hand, whistling that same tune—a melody for those who gamble with eternity and win everything except what matters. <words>414</words>
