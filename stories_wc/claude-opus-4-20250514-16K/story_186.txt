Elara hung upside-down from the suspended palace, her tool belt jangling against stalactites as she adjusted another brass thermometer. <words>17</words> The whimsical tinkerer had scattered hundreds throughout the cavern system, each one disguised as a carnival fortune-teller's crystal ball. <words>35</words> 

"Temperature rising again," she muttered, oddly truthful even to herself in this empty palace that swayed gently on its calcite anchors. <words>56</words> The thermometers weren't just measuring heat—they chronicled the cave's dying breath, the environmental changes that would soon make this underground wonderland uninhabitable. <words>79</words>

She descended to her workshop, where mechanical fortune-tellers lined the walls like sentinels. <words>92</words> Each pop-up figure she'd sculpted held a brass thermometer in its wooden hands, ready to deploy across the tourist paths above. <words>114</words> Visitors thought they were getting their fortunes told, but Elara was giving them something far more precious: the truth about their mortality. <words>136</words>

"Your future holds thirty-seven years," one might say, its calculation based on rising toxin levels and falling oxygen percentages. <words>155</words> The practical illusion served its purpose—people believed more readily in carnival prophecies than climate data. <words>170</words>

Elara picked up her newest creation, a fortune-teller holding an artist's palette. <words>182</words> She'd designed this one specially, programmed to activate across the moment an artist's brush first meets canvas—that split second of infinite possibility before creation begins. <words>207</words> The thermometer in its chest would measure not just environmental decay, but the precise moment when art could no longer exist here. <words>230</words>

"Twenty years until the last painting," she whispered, reading the brass gauge. <words>242</words> 

The palace groaned, stalactites singing their mineral song as acidic moisture ate at their foundations. <words>257</words> Elara's fortune-tellers would pop up tomorrow at the festival above, their cheerful facades hiding grim calculations. <words>273</words> Children would insert coins, receive printed cards with oddly specific lifespans, never knowing each prediction was mathematically precise. <words>291</words>

She wound the springs of her newest creation, watching its painted eyes blink open. <words>305</words> "Tell them gently," she instructed, though she knew it would speak only truth. <words>318</words> The thermometer's needle quivered, sensing another degree of change in the air. <words>330</words>

By morning, her carnival prophets would scatter through the crowds, measuring heartbeats against environmental collapse. <words>344</words> Each reading was a small confrontation with mortality, wrapped in the comfortable lie of entertainment. <words>359</words> Elara climbed back toward the palace's swaying galleries, her work complete. <words>370</words> The stalactites wept mineral tears around her, counting down in their own ancient way. <words>385</words> She'd given humanity the kindest mirror possible—one that looked like a game but reflected the hardest truth. <words>402</words>
