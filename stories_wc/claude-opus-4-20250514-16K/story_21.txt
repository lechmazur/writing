Ambassador Chen pressed the fox tail tassel between her fingers, its coarse fur a reminder of the bandit who'd murdered her daughter twenty years ago. <words>25</words> The forgotten city hall echoed with drum circles from the squatters outside, their rhythmic pounding masking her footsteps through debris-strewn corridors. <words>46</words> She'd tracked him here through DNA samples, decoding genetic patterns with the same methodical precision she'd once applied to treaty negotiations. <words>68</words> 

The tassel had been his calling card, left beside each victim—organically synthetic fibers engineered to mimic real fox fur while containing his genetic signature. <words>93</words> A jest, he'd called it in his manifesto, this fusion of nature and technology that taunted investigators for decades. <words>113</words> Chen had retired from diplomacy to pursue this singular obsession, trading embassy halls for forensic laboratories. <words>129</words>

She found him in what had once been a children's theater, the faint scent of must clinging to faded curtains and broken seats. <words>153</words> He sat cross-legged on the stage, older now, weaving another tassel with practiced fingers. <words>168</words> "Ambassador," he said without looking up, his voice carrying that same abrasive calm she remembered from the crime scene recordings. <words>189</words> "I wondered when you'd decode my little breadcrumbs." <words>198</words>

"Twenty years," Chen replied, matching his tone perfectly, though her hand trembled against the gun in her pocket. <words>216</words> The drums outside intensified, their primal rhythm seeming to pulse through the walls. <words>230</words> "Twenty years of following your genetic puzzles across three continents." <words>240</words>

He finally looked up, eyes reflecting neither surprise nor fear. <words>250</words> "And now you've found me in this tomb of childhood dreams." <words>262</words> His fingers never stopped weaving. <words>267</words> "Tell me, diplomat—was the journey worth more than the destination?" <words>278</words>

Chen considered the question with the same measured analysis she'd once reserved for international crises. <words>294</words> The price of revenge had been everything: career, relationships, sanity worn thin by obsession. <words>309</words> She'd become as organically synthetic as his tassels—human in appearance, but fundamentally transformed by singular purpose. <words>326</words>

"Your daughter loved puppet shows," he said, gesturing to the dusty marionettes hanging overhead. <words>341</words> "I researched her extensively before—" <words>346</words>

The gun appeared in Chen's hand with diplomatic efficiency. <words>356</words> "Don't." <words>357</words> The word cut through drum beats and memory alike. <words>367</words> 

He smiled, a grotesque jest. <words>373</words> "The measured diplomat finally loses her measure." <words>381</words>

Chen's finger found the trigger, steady despite twenty years of waiting. <words>393</words> The drums outside reached crescendo as she understood the true price of revenge: not what you lose pursuing it, but who you become when you finally claim it. <words>422</words> 

The fox tail tassel fell from nerveless fingers, organically synthetic justice at last complete. <words>437</words>
