The gentle conjurer Elara descended into the underground city of the dwarves, her hands trembling with what the ancient texts called "joyful terror"—that exquisite dread of finding what you've desperately sought. <words>28</words> Above, at the precise moment a brittle branch cracked in the silent forest, she knew her search for justice had finally led her here. <words>52</words> The dwarven tunnels glowed with crystalline veins, each pulse of light revealing reversed messages carved into stone: "NEDRAG NETTEGROF EHT DLIUBER." <words>73</words>

For decades, the dwarves had suffered under a curse that turned their legendary gardens to ash, their children born without the ability to cultivate life. <words>99</words> The perpetrator remained inscrutably obvious—hidden in plain sight, yet impossible to name until the proper evidence could be assembled. <words>119</words> Elara clutched the fragments of a stained glass butterfly, its wings shattered across seven kingdoms after witnessing the original crime. <words>140</words>

"You've come to reassemble it," growled Thorin, the eldest dwarf, his beard white as bone. <words>156</words> His eyes sparkled with that same joyful terror—hope wrestling with the fear of another disappointment. <words>172</words>

Elara nodded, spreading the rainbow shards across the ancient altar where the forgotten garden once bloomed underground, nourished by magical springs. <words>194</words> Each piece hummed with memory, and as she began her gentle conjuring, the reversed messages throughout the tunnels started making sense. <words>216</words> "REBUILD THE FORGOTTEN GARDEN"—but only when read backward, for the curse itself had inverted truth. <words>232</words>

With delicate gestures, she wove light between the fragments, each connection revealing another reversed confession etched in the glass: "YRRAVAL SAW I." <words>255</words> The dwarves gasped as understanding dawned—their own minister Lavary, trusted keeper of the garden seeds, had poisoned the soil out of envy. <words>279</words>

As the final piece clicked into place, the butterfly's wings burst with radiant color, and Elara felt the joyful terror peak. <words>301</words> justice meant pain before healing. <words>306</words> The assembled butterfly took flight, its wings casting prismatic patterns that reversed the curse's grip on the soil. <words>325</words>

Lavary materialized from the shadows where he'd hidden for decades, compelled by the butterfly's complete testimony to face judgment. <words>345</words> The dwarves surrounded him, but Elara raised her hand gently. <words>356</words> "Justice isn't vengeance," she whispered, as magical vines began sprouting from the barren ground. <words>371</words> "Let him tend what he destroyed, understanding now what he had lost." <words>384</words>

The underground city erupted in celebration as flowers bloomed in impossible colors, their roots fed by tears of joy and redemption. <words>407</words> The forgotten garden lived again, more beautiful for having been mourned. <words>418</words>
