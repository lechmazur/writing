Marcus Finch, a vigilant orchardist who'd lost his daughter in a suspicious aviation accident, arrived at the paper airplane test facility precisely at 7:00 AM—never tardy, even throughout volunteering. <words>28</words> The facility's sterile corridors echoed with the sardonic glee he'd cultivated since discovering that grief could be weaponized into investigation. <words>48</words>

"Another punctual morning, Mr. Finch," the receptionist chirped, unaware that Marcus had been systematically photographing every document left carelessly on desks. <words>70</words> His orchard-trained eyes, accustomed to spotting the slightest blight on apple leaves, now hunted for inconsistencies in flight data. <words>90</words>

Three months into his volunteer work, Marcus discovered an antique letter seal pressed into the corner of a classified blueprint. <words>110</words> The wax impression depicted a peacock, its tail feathers spread in an intricate pattern that made his pulse quicken. <words>129</words> He'd seen this before—on his daughter's final letter home, sent just days before her plane mysteriously vanished. <words>147</words>

"Fascinating design," he murmured to Dr. Chen, the lead engineer, barely suppressing his bitter amusement at their transparency. <words>165</words> "The peacock's tail patterns seem to demonstrate specific aerodynamic principles." <words>175</words>

Dr. Chen's face tightened imperceptibly. <words>180</words> "An old company tradition. <words>184</words> Nothing significant." <words>186</words>

But Marcus knew better. <words>190</words> Each eye-spot on the peacock's tail corresponded to a test flight that had ended in tragedy, and his daughter's accident was the seventh. <words>214</words> Throughout volunteering, he'd mapped twenty-three more planned "accidents," each marked by the same seal on documents that supposedly didn't exist. <words>236</words>

His sardonic glee peaked when he realized the conspirators had invited their own downfall by accepting a grieving father as a volunteer. <words>259</words> They'd assumed his obsession with punctuality stemmed from grief-driven routine, never suspecting he was documenting their every move with orchardist precision. <words>282</words>

That evening, Marcus demonstrated his findings to a room full of federal investigators, using the peacock tail patterns as a codebook. <words>304</words> "You see," he explained with dark satisfaction, "they marked their victims like fruit ready for harvest." <words>321</words>

The facility's executives were arrested within hours, their conspiracy unraveling like paper planes in rain. <words>337</words> Marcus stood in the empty test hangar, holding the antique letter seal that had been his daughter's final warning. <words>357</words> She'd known the danger and tried to tell him through the only code their killers wouldn't recognize—the same pattern they'd arrogantly adopted as their symbol. <words>384</words>

His vigilance had finally borne fruit, though the harvest tasted of ashes and vindication. <words>398</words> The orchardist had pruned the poisoned branch, but the tree of his life would never bloom the same. <words>417</words>
