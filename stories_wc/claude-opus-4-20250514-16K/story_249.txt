In the city of forgotten fountains, where moss-covered cherubs still spat dry promises at empty basins, Margot Finch operated as the only unmasked vigilante anyone had ever seen. <words>24</words> Her face, plain as Tuesday soup, was her greatest weapon—nobody suspected the woman who collected traditional games could be anything more. <words>44</words>

She sat in the back row of the Copper Note Barbershop, twirling her grandfather's antique dentist's drill between her fingers, a habit she'd developed while perfecting the art of resilience. <words>73</words> The quartet rehearsed "Sweet Adeline" for the fourth time, their harmonies masking the real performance: the gossip that flowed between measures. <words>94</words>

"Did you hear about the Pachisi set?" <words>101</words> the baritone whispered during a fermata. <words>107</words> "Hidden in the old Nereid Fountain on Seventh Street." <words>116</words>

Margot's lazily ambitious nature meant she never rushed—why chase when you could lure? <words>129</words> She'd discovered long ago that barbershop quartets were the city's neural network, their rehearsals a clearinghouse for every secret worth knowing. <words>150</words>

At the pause between raindrops, when the city held its breath and even pigeons forgot to coo, she made her move. <words>171</words> The antique drill wasn't for teeth anymore; she'd modified it to pick the peculiar locks that sealed the fountain bases, where desperate souls had hidden treasures during the last century's game prohibition. <words>203</words>

She left a trail of hummed notes from "By the Light of the Silvery Moon," knowing the notorious Game Hoarder couldn't resist following a musical clue. <words>229</words> Her collection already included Mancala boards carved from shipwrecks and Go stones that had witnessed empires fall, but the Pachisi set—supposedly played by laughing gods—would complete her life's work. <words>259</words>

The Hoarder emerged from shadows, drawn by her melody like a moth to flame wearing yesterday's cologne. <words>276</words> "You're no vigilante," he sneered, recognizing her ordinary face. <words>285</words>

"That's precisely why I am one," Margot replied, her drill already working the fountain's lock. <words>300</words> The mechanism clicked open, revealing not just the Pachisi set but dozens of games, each a testament to human joy preserved against forgetting. <words>323</words>

The Hoarder lunged, but Margot had spent years building resilience through Ring Around the Rosie and Duck Duck Goose—children's games that taught dodging and misdirection. <words>348</words> She sidestepped him easily, clutching the carved ivory board. <words>357</words>

"Games belong to everyone," she said, backing toward the street where rain was beginning again. <words>372</words> "That's why I collect them—to return them." <words>379</words>

By morning, every forgotten fountain in the city bloomed with recovered games, free for any child or dreamer to claim. <words>399</words> Margot disappeared into the crowd, her grandfather's drill tucked away, already listening for the next rehearsal's whispered secrets. <words>417</words>
