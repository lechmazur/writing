Marcus believed he'd been a goldfish caretaker in Venice, 1847—not that anyone at the forgotten recipe library would believe such nonsense. <words>19</words> He shelved dusty cookbooks with tentatively fierce determination, his movements betraying centuries-old muscle memory of feeding schedules and water changes. <words>38</words>

The library's tradition demanded silence, reverence, and worst of all, that no recipes ever leave these walls. <words>55</words> "Knowledge preserved is knowledge dead," Marcus muttered, adjusting a one-armed toy soldier he'd found wedged between two volumes of medieval porridge techniques. <words>78</words> The soldier had become his mascot, a reminder that even broken things could stand guard. <words>93</words>

Guilt's haunting echo followed him through the stacks—in that other life, he'd let his goldfish die during carnival season, too drunk on celebration to remember their feeding. <words>121</words> Now, reincarnated into this peculiar existence, he plotted to alleviate suffering by liberating these trapped recipes. <words>137</words>

Thunder cracked overhead, unseasonably violent for October. <words>144</words> The skylight shattered, sending rain cascading onto priceless manuscripts. <words>153</words> As Marcus rushed to save what he could, a woman burst through the door, soaking wet and clutching a medical file. <words>174</words>

"Is this the old Benedetti library?" she gasped. <words>182</words> "My grandmother's dying—the doctor's chart shows pancreatic failure, but she swears your archive has her mother's healing broth recipe." <words>202</words>

Marcus glanced at his one-armed soldier, then at the storm-damaged ceiling—nature's own disruption of their stagnant tradition. <words>219</words> "Officially, I'd tell you these recipes are sacred artifacts, never to leave," he said, already pulling a familiar volume from memory. <words>241</words> "But between you and me, what's the point of preserving life-saving knowledge if it can't actually save lives?" <words>259</words>

He handed her the book, its pages yellowed but intact. <words>269</words> "Bone broth with saffron and seven herbs—page forty-three." <words>277</words>

She clutched it desperately. <words>281</words> "Won't you get in trouble?" <words>286</words>

"Probably," Marcus shrugged, feeling that ancient guilt finally loosening its grip. <words>297</words> "But I've learned something from my past mistakes—sometimes the real sin is in the keeping, not the giving." <words>315</words>

As she ran back into the storm, Marcus positioned his toy soldier to face the door. <words>331</words> The library board would arrive soon, furious about the weather damage and the breach of protocol. <words>347</words> He'd face them with the same tentatively fierce resolve he'd once reserved for measuring fish food—precise, necessary, and absolutely unrepentant. <words>368</words>

After all, what was the point of reincarnation if you couldn't fix your mistakes by breaking a few ridiculous rules? <words>388</words> The one-armed soldier seemed to salute in agreement, and Marcus almost believed it did. <words>402</words>
