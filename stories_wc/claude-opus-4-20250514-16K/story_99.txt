Mara slouched against the dusty shelves of the abandoned carnival prize booth, her fingers absently twirling a single chopstick wrapper she'd found wedged between two moldy teddy bears. <words>23</words> The paper crinkled—that specific sound, like autumn leaves crushed underfoot—and suddenly she wasn't there anymore. <words>39</words>

She was binding The Chronicle of Forgotten Empires, her telekinesis threading golden wire through ancient pages while the author whispered, "Every legend you preserve steals a memory from your own life." <words>70</words> The flashback dissolved as quickly as it came, leaving Mara gasping in the musty booth. <words>85</words>

That's how it always worked—sound bites triggering visions across the tapestry of lost legends she'd bound over centuries. <words>103</words> The wrapper crinkled again between her thumb and forefinger. <words>112</words> This time: a moonlit workshop where she'd restored The Metamorphosis Codex, its pages teaching shapeshifters their craft while draining color from her eyes. <words>136</words>

"Just a bookbinder," she muttered, though her casual tone couldn't hide the weight of what she'd become. <words>153</words> Each tome she'd preserved with her gift had demanded its price—memories, sensations, pieces of herself traded for humanity's forgotten wisdom. <words>174</words>

The booth's broken bottles clinked in the wind. <words>182</words> Another flashback: binding The Phoenix Testimony while its author burned to ash, promising rebirth through transformation but taking her ability to feel warmth. <words>206</words>

She'd come here following rumors of the ultimate text—one that could revive not just knowledge but the essence of what she'd lost. <words>229</words> The carnival booth supposedly held a map hidden by another bookbinder centuries ago. <words>242</words> Her telekinesis probed the debris, lifting stuffed animals and plastic prizes, searching. <words>254</words>

The wrapper crinkled once more, deliberately this time. <words>262</words> The vision showed her younger self, before the first binding, laughing at a festival while eating takeout with disposable chopsticks. <words>282</words> Such a mundane memory, yet it held more power than all the legends she'd preserved. <words>298</words>

Behind a row of knockoff superhero dolls, her power found it—a leather journal, its cover embossed with her own initials from a future she hadn't lived yet. <words>327</words> Inside, one line: "Transformation begins when you stop binding others' stories and start writing your own." <words>343</words>

Mara pocketed the chopstick wrapper, that simple paper holding more truth than mystical tomes. <words>357</words> Every legend she'd saved had taught the same lesson she'd been too busy preserving to learn—real power wasn't in keeping ancient knowledge alive but in living fully enough to create new stories worth remembering. <words>392</words>

She left the booth with empty hands and a full heart, ready to discover what transformation meant when you chose it freely. <words>415</words> The price of knowledge, she finally understood, was only as high as your fear of living without it. <words>433</words>
