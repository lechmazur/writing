Kira shuffled through the rust-eaten doorway of the abandoned space station control room, her mage robes catching on broken metal. <words>18</words> The facility squatted at the edge of her family's farmland—acres of wheat that would be sold next month to developers. <words>37</words> She'd been living in the station for weeks now, practicing the same basic spells that every underachieving mage knew by heart. <words>58</words> Another package thudded against the airlock door, misdelivered by the postal drone that couldn't distinguish between active and derelict addresses. <words>78</words> 

With bored excitement, she retrieved it—wrong name again, but she'd stopped caring about mail fraud. <words>93</words> Inside lay something exceptionally usual: a doll head, porcelain-pale with mechanically blinking eyes that clicked with each movement. <words>111</words> Yet as her fingers touched it, ancestral memories flooded through—her grandmother's stories of mages who commanded space stations, who bent reality between stars. <words>135</words> The doll head was a key, she realized, its blinking eyes a code her bloodline had forgotten. <words>152</words>

She placed it on the main console, where dust outlined absent monitors. <words>164</words> The eyes blinked: three long, two short, one long. <words>173</words> Kira repeated the pattern with her fingers against the dead controls, and suddenly holographic displays blazed to life around her. <words>193</words> Star maps, spell formulae, combat protocols—everything her lineage had abandoned when they chose to hide as farmers. <words>210</words> 

"Genetic match confirmed," the station's AI announced, making her jump. <words>220</words> "Heritage vault access granted." <words>224</words>

A hidden panel slid open, revealing crystallized spellbooks and a commander's uniform bearing her family crest. <words>240</words> All those years of believing she was inadequate, when really she'd been operating with a fraction of her inheritance. <words>259</words> The other packages she'd hoarded suddenly made sense—each misdelivery had been the station calling its bloodline home. <words>276</words>

She pressed her palm against the command chair's scanner. <words>285</words> "I'm ready to spring this trap," she whispered to her limitations. <words>296</words> The chair hummed to life, neural interfaces activating as the station began to unveil its true nature—not abandoned but dormant, waiting. <words>318</words> Through the viewports, the wheat fields stretched endlessly, but now she saw the ley lines beneath them, the power her ancestors had cultivated. <words>342</words>

The doll head's eyes stopped blinking, fixing on her with approval. <words>353</words> Its porcelain lips moved: "Welcome home, Station Commander." <words>361</words> 

Kira felt the surge of stellar magic through her veins, no longer an underachiever but an heir reclaiming her birthright. <words>381</words> The developers could have the farmland; she had stars to command and a heritage to rebuild from this forgotten outpost. <words>401</words> Tomorrow, she would leave this boundary between past and future, but tonight, she had spells to learn. <words>418</words>
