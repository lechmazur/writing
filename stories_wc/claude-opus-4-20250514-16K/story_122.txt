Brother Kaine's augmented eyes flickered as vultures circled the Tibetan plateau, their shadows crossing the stone platform where corpses awaited dismemberment. <words>17</words> The cyber-templar clutched a worn leather bridle—his last physical anchor from before the upload—while his digital consciousness struggled against meat and bone. <words>39</words> 

The storm approached with mathematical precision, lightning threading purple veins through clouds that promised annihilation. <words>55</words> His order had believed their virtual monastery impregnable, but that mirage of safety shattered when the first server farm burned. <words>75</words> Now only he remained, downloaded into this borrowed flesh, patiently frantic as his neural implants calculated trajectories. <words>92</words>

"The reading begins," announced the sky burial master, unfolding ancient texts that described how light could bend reality itself. <words>111</words> Kaine's synthetic muscles trembled with euphoric agitation—here, finally, was proof that the physical and digital realms weren't separate but refracted versions of one truth. <words>135</words> 

He pressed the bridle's cracked leather between trembling fingers, remembering his mount from centuries ago, before he'd traded flesh for code. <words>157</words> The storm's electromagnetic pulse would destroy his consciousness unless he could prove his theory: that lightning, like data, could be redirected through proper channels. <words>181</words>

From his tactical vest, Kaine produced a prism salvaged from the monastery's quantum computers. <words>196</words> The reading continued, Sanskrit syllables mixing with the screech of bone-hungry birds. <words>208</words> He positioned the crystal precisely where corpse-light met storm-shadow, watching reality fracture into component wavelengths. <words>223</words>

"I am the bridge," he whispered, neural pathways firing in patterns that shouldn't exist in organic matter. <words>240</words> The first lightning strike descended, and Kaine raised the prism skyward, his augmented reflexes operating at the speed of prayer. <words>260</words>

Light bent impossibly. <words>263</words> The bolt struck the prism and reversed, climbing back toward its origin in a display that violated every law his order had encoded. <words>286</words> But this was the lesson the sky burial taught: that boundaries between states were illusion, that death and life, digital and physical, were merely different frequencies of existence. <words>314</words>

The storm recoiled from its own reflected fury. <words>322</words> Kaine laughed, a sound both human and synthetic, as vultures scattered from the electric aftermath. <words>337</words> His consciousness flickered between servers scattered across continents and the failing neurons of his borrowed brain. <words>353</words>

The mirage of safety had always been just that—a mirage. <words>363</words> True security came from accepting the collision, embracing the dissolution between what was preserved and what was sacrificed. <words>380</words> As the sky burial master resumed reading, Kaine wrapped the bridle around his wrist, grounding himself in leather and memory while his mind danced between lightning and code. <words>408</words>

Above, the storm retreated, defeated by its own reflection. <words>417</words> Below, the cyber-templar knelt among the waiting dead, finally understanding that reality was just another protocol to master. <words>435</words>
