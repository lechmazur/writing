Elara clutched her fountain pen with its broken nib, the only tool she had left to decode the universal riddle. <words>19</words> The meek necromancer descended deeper into the underground city of the goblins, where crystalline walls caught fragments of surface light. <words>38</words> Above, the distant echo of playground sounds filtered through ventilation shafts—children laughing while she pursued ancient mysteries below. <words>56</words>

The goblins had woven their history into a tangled tapestry that hung in the central cavern, threads crossing and recrossing in patterns that hurt to follow. <words>82</words> Elara approached it with peculiarly sincere reverence, understanding that others saw her gentleness as weakness, but knowing her humility was her greatest strength. <words>105</words>

"To regain what was lost," she whispered, reading the tapestry's central inscription with her fingertips. <words>120</words> The broken pen scratched against her palm, its damaged tip catching on her skin like a reminder of imperfection's power. <words>140</words>

She had tried everything—summoning spirits, consulting bones, reading entrails—but the riddle remained locked. <words>153</words> The goblins watched from shadowed alcoves, their eyes reflecting the bioluminescent fungi that lit their realm. <words>169</words> They had invited her here, the only necromancer humble enough to ask rather than command the dead. <words>186</words>

Then she saw it: a single dewdrop clinging to a stalactite above the tapestry. <words>200</words> The drop caught a stray beam of light from above, refracting it into countless colors that danced across the woven surface. <words>221</words> In that prismatic moment, the threads revealed their secret—not in their weaving, but in the spaces between. <words>238</words>

Elara lifted her broken pen, its jagged nib suddenly perfect for the task. <words>251</words> She traced the empty spaces, following the light's path through the dewdrop's lens. <words>264</words> The universal riddle wasn't about what connected everything, but about the gaps that allowed connection to exist. <words>281</words>

As she worked, the playground sounds above seemed to harmonize with the scratching of her pen. <words>297</words> Children at play understood what scholars forgot—that wisdom lived in simplicity, in the spaces between knowing and being. <words>315</words>

The tapestry began to glow, threads rearranging themselves as Elara's broken pen revealed the riddle's answer. <words>331</words> Death and life, connection and separation, were not opposites but dance partners in an eternal waltz. <words>347</words> The goblins emerged from hiding, their ancient faces creased with approval. <words>358</words>

She had regained not just knowledge, but understanding—the difference between commanding death and conversing with it. <words>373</words> The dewdrop fell, splashing against stone, but its lesson remained: sometimes broken tools and meek hearts see clearest. <words>391</words> Elara smiled, her peculiarly sincere nature finally recognized as the key that unlocked the universe's most tangled mystery. <words>409</words>
