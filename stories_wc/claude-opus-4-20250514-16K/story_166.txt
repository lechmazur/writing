The ghostly caretaker drifted between crystallized apple trees, her translucent form shimmering against the steam rising from the geothermal vents that kept the orchard alive. <words>25</words> After the last wish had been granted to the final visitor three centuries ago, Meredith found herself bound to this peculiar frozen grove, tending to trees that bore fruit of ice. <words>55</words> She clutched a weathered plastic straw—the only physical object she could touch—which had once belonged to a child who'd wished to speak with squirrels. <words>80</words>

The forbidden expedition logs lay scattered across her ethereal desk, their pages perforated by time and frost. <words>97</words> Each hole revealed fragments of other realities, other fates that might have been, and Meredith had discovered she could weave through these openings like threading a cosmic needle. <words>125</words> With solemnly silly determination, she poked the straw through a particularly large perforation, watching as the plastic bent reality around itself. <words>146</words>

"Herbert!" she called to the arctic fox who frequented the steaming pools. <words>158</words> The creature tilted its head, and through the straw's hollow center, Meredith finally heard his response: "The birds say the southern vents will freeze tonight." <words>183</words>

Gentle chaos erupted as animals throughout the orchard realized their ghostly guardian could finally understand them. <words>199</words> Rabbits bounded through thermal patches, chattering about root vegetables hidden beneath the permafrost. <words>212</words> A family of snow geese honked elaborate stories about magnetic fields and navigation mysteries. <words>226</words> Even the usually silent musk oxen began sharing philosophical musings about the nature of warmth and cold. <words>243</words>

Meredith laughed—a sound like wind chimes made of icicles—as she rushed from creature to creature, the plastic straw conducting their voices across the veil between living and dead. <words>271</words> The expedition logs fluttered wildly, their perforated pages creating new pathways through fate with each conversation. <words>287</words> She learned that the orchard's survival depended on a delicate dance: the animals' movements guided the flow of geothermal heat, their instincts maintaining the impossible balance. <words>313</words>

As aurora borealis painted the sky green and gold, Meredith understood her true purpose. <words>327</words> She wasn't just a caretaker of frozen trees but a translator between species, a bridge across the divide of understanding. <words>347</words> The plastic straw hummed with each new connection, its mundane origin transformed into something magical by necessity and ingenuity. <words>366</words> Through the forbidden logs' perforations, she glimpsed infinite orchards across infinite realities, each tended by their own peculiar guardians. <words>384</words> But this one was hers, alive with the gentle chaos of interspecies communion, thriving in the marriage of ice and steam, death and life, silence and song. <words>411</words>

Tomorrow, she would teach the wolves to read the expedition logs themselves. <words>423</words> Tonight, she simply listened, weaving through fate one conversation at a time. <words>436</words>
