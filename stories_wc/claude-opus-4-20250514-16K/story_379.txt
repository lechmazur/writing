Marcus Chen pressed his palm against the biodome's transparent wall, watching synthetic rain cascade over hydroponic wheat fields while his muscles protested from morning stretches. <words>19</words> The trickster lawyer who'd once defended corporate criminals now lived among vertical farms, cataloguing the whispers of dying languages before they vanished forever. <words>41</words> 

A leftover gift tag fluttered from his pocket—"To the one who chose differently"—written in Jedek, a Malaysian tongue spoken by fewer than three hundred souls. <words>67</words> He'd been impatiently patient for three years, hiding here while authorities hunted him for exposing his firm's linguistic genocide: systematically destroying indigenous contracts to steal ancestral lands. <words>94</words>

His wristband chimed with another cryptic dare from his high school rivals, now bounty hunters: "Remember when you defended the indefensible? Follow the morning glory vines to Terminal Seven." <words>122</words> They knew his patterns, knew he performed tai chi at dawn, knew his obsession with preserving what others erased. <words>141</words>

Marcus ignored their bait with ghostly resolve, returning to his real work. <words>153</words> The biodome's AI translated ambient conversations into dying languages, each phrase a small rebellion against homogenization. <words>169</words> He recorded an elderly farmhand humming in Vod, a Cambodian language with twelve remaining speakers. <words>184</words>

Another message arrived: "The gift tag was from your first case's victim. She learned your language before hers died." <words>203</words> His hands trembled mid-stretch, remembering the pharmaceutical executive he'd helped acquit, whose company had displaced entire communities. <words>220</words>

The chosen paths diverged that day—one toward easy wealth, another toward impossible redemption. <words>233</words> He'd spent years using legal loopholes for evil; now he used them to preserve what courts wouldn't protect. <words>251</words>

"Terminal Seven has the last Kusunda speaker," the next dare taunted. <words>262</words> "But also federal marshals." <words>266</words>

Marcus finished his routine, muscles warm, mind calculating. <words>274</words> His rivals thought they could divert him with moral tests disguised as traps. <words>287</words> They didn't understand that every preserved word was a ghost he was laying to rest, every recorded phrase an apology to the silenced. <words>310</words>

He packed his recording equipment with practiced efficiency. <words>318</words> The gift tag went back in his pocket—not sentiment, but evidence of his transformation. <words>333</words> The biodome's crops would grow without him; the languages would die without intervention. <words>346</words>

Walking toward Terminal Seven, he embodied his paradox: a fugitive rushing to wait, a criminal saving culture, a trickster whose greatest trick was becoming sincere. <words>371</words> His high school rivals had inadvertently shown him the way forward by trying to pull him back. <words>388</words>

Some paths choose you, he realized, even when you think you're choosing them. <words>401</words> The ghostly resolve that carried him forward was simply all his buried victims, speaking through him at last. <words>419</words>
