The exiled prince pressed his shoulder against the rotting door of the abandoned customs office, snow whipping through his threadbare cloak. <words>21</words> Inside, dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through broken windows, and something pulled him deeper into the building—unseen forces that had guided his steps since his banishment. <words>50</words> His fingers found the antique mortar and pestle on a clerk's desk, its jade surface worn smooth by countless hands grinding herbs and medicines across centuries. <words>77</words> The prince had become unintentionally iconic among the border villages—the nameless wanderer who appeared in storms, helped where he could, then vanished like morning frost. <words>103</words> But tonight felt different; tonight, the loneliness pressed against his ribs like a physical weight. <words>119</words>

The sudden snowstorm had driven someone else inside—a young apothecary's apprentice clutching a leather satchel, her eyes wide with recognition. <words>140</words> "You're him," she whispered, not with fear but wonder. <words>150</words> "The ghost prince who heals." <words>155</words> He almost laughed at the irony; he could improve others' ailments but never his own isolation. <words>172</words> She approached cautiously, then gestured at the mortar and pestle. <words>183</words> "My grandmother spoke of that tool—said it belonged to the old healers who understood the medicine of connection." <words>202</words>

Together, they worked through the storm, grinding roots she carried and herbs he'd gathered, creating remedies for the village's winter sickness. <words>224</words> Their hands moved in rhythm, and in that shared purpose, something shifted. <words>237</words> The familiar unknown settled between them—the recognition that loneliness wasn't cured by crowds but by a single soul who saw past the exile to the person beneath. <words>265</words> As dawn approached, she pulled an iron key from her satchel. <words>277</words> "This locked the old pharmacy," she said. <words>284</words> "My grandmother left it to me." <words>290</words> The prince watched her turn it in the empty air, a gesture of ceremony. <words>305</words> "Sometimes we must lock away the past to unlock the future." <words>316</words>

The storm cleared, revealing a world transformed in white. <words>325</words> She offered him the key, but he shook his head, placing the mortar and pestle in her hands instead. <words>345</words> "Keep them together," he said. <words>350</words> "Some cures require both tools and companionship." <words>357</words> As he prepared to leave, she touched his arm. <words>367</words> "The village needs a healer," she said simply. <words>375</words> "Stay." <words>376</words> The unseen forces that had driven him into exile seemed to pause, waiting. <words>390</words> In her eyes, he saw not a subject addressing royalty, but one healer recognizing another. <words>406</words> The prince nodded, understanding that sometimes the cure for loneliness is as simple as accepting the remedy when it's offered. <words>427</words>
