Marina's webbed fingers trembled as she arranged the vintage photographs across her stall in the drowned market of New Atlantis. <words>19</words> The other vendors hawked their wares with boisterous calls, but the shy diviner merely waited, knowing the right customer would come. <words>39</words> 

The photos were confusingly clear—each showed the same woman drowning, yet in different oceans, at different times, with different outcomes. <words>60</words> Marina had salvaged them from a waterlogged smartphone that shouldn't exist here, its screen still flickering with ghost notifications from parallel worlds. <words>83</words>

"@LastBreath_Echo: Should have learned to swim," read one post. <words>93</words> "@LastBreath_Echo: He pushed me, but I let him," read another. <words>104</words> Each social media confession revealed fragments of the same tragedy played out across infinite timelines, all stemming from one woman's original drowning. <words>127</words>

Marina touched the photos with practiced detachment, though her gills flared with suppressed emotion. <words>141</words> The echo of regret rippled through the dimensional barriers like sonar, growing stronger with each timeline where the woman died. <words>162</words> This wasn't mere coincidence—someone had fractured reality itself, trying to undo their mistake by creating new timelines, only to precipitate the same tragedy repeatedly. <words>187</words>

The cosmic imbalance was obvious now. <words>193</words> In every timeline, the woman drowned because she'd never learned to swim, too proud to admit her fear of water. <words>214</words> Her killer—lover, friend, stranger, the role changed but never the guilt—pushed her in different ways across realities, trapped in an endless loop of recreating their crime. <words>241</words>

Marina's gift showed her the truth: the original killer had become a timeline-hopper, desperately seeking a reality where they hadn't pushed her, hadn't watched her sink. <words>268</words> But their very presence precipitated the act in each new timeline, their regret manifesting as inevitable action. <words>285</words>

The other merchants continued their trade, oblivious to the temporal catastrophe unfolding through old photographs and digital echoes. <words>303</words> Marina gathered the photos carefully, her shy nature warring with duty. <words>314</words> She alone could see the pattern, alone could break it. <words>324</words>

With feigned indifference, she posted her own message across the dimensional barriers: "@TimelineMender: Some things can't be undone. Stop running." <words>344</words> She attached the photos, each one proof of the futility. <words>354</words>

The smartphone buzzed immediately. <words>358</words> "@LastBreath_Echo has stopped sharing across all timelines." <words>366</words>

Marina returned to arranging her wares, knowing that somewhere across the parallel worlds, a killer had finally stopped trying to rewrite history. <words>389</words> The cosmic imbalance would heal now, the echo of regret finally allowed to fade instead of endlessly reverberating through fractured realities. <words>411</words> She sold seashells and fortune readings to passing customers, passionate about her purpose yet appearing utterly disinterested, just another vendor in the forgotten underwater market. <words>436</words>

The vintage photographs she kept, evidence of wounds that transcend dimensions. <words>447</words>
