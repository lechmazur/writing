The skeptical minstrel Raven adjusted her lute strap, eyeing the dragon-scale armor scrap she'd pried from the factory floor. <words>17</words> The Fadewright Disappearing Ink Factory had been abandoned for decades, but its ancient steam vents still hissed secrets through the walls. <words>37</words>

"Immortal trickster wants to play games?" she muttered, checking the midday sun through a broken window. <words>53</words> Outside, the mailbox stood empty—that peculiar hush when no letters arrived, when even the wind held its breath. <words>72</words> Perfect timing for what she had planned. <words>79</words>

The trickster Malachi had wagered her soul against his eternal servitude, claiming no mortal could surprise him. <words>96</words> But Raven had discovered something impossibly plausible in the factory's old records: disappearing ink could be reversed. <words>113</words> Not erased—reversed, making visible what was never meant to be seen. <words>124</words>

She loaded the dragon-scale into her slingshot, aiming for the largest steam vent. <words>137</words> The scale would ricochet precisely seventeen times—she'd calculated it—before landing in the ink reservoir below. <words>153</words> Dragon magic mixing with vanishing formulae and steam-powered alchemy? <words>162</words> Pure chaos. <words>164</words>

"Here's the thing about reckless generosity," Raven said aloud, knowing Malachi was listening from whatever dimension immortals inhabited. <words>183</words> "Sometimes giving everything away is the only way to win." <words>193</words>

She released the slingshot. <words>197</words> The scale sparked against metal, each ricochet accompanied by the steam vent's prehistoric hiss. <words>211</words> On the seventeenth bounce, it splashed into the ink reservoir. <words>221</words>

The factory shuddered. <words>224</words> Every drop of disappearing ink ever spilled began reversing itself—centuries of hidden messages, secret contracts, and erased promises blooming across the walls like inverse graffiti. <words>249</words>

Including Malachi's original contract with the universe, the one he'd written in disappearing ink to hide his true nature: he wasn't immortal at all. <words>274</words> Just a con artist who'd tricked Death itself by making his mortality vanish. <words>287</words>

Raven watched with irreverent awe as the trickster materialized, looking distinctly mortal and furious. <words>301</words> "You gave up the dragon-scale," he sputtered. <words>308</words> "Your only protection!" <words>311</words>

"Reckless generosity," she grinned, strumming her lute. <words>318</words> "I gave the universe back its truth. <words>325</words> Turns out, that's worth more than armor." <words>332</words>

The factory's steam vents sang their approval, a chorus of hisses that sounded almost like laughter. <words>348</words> Malachi aged a thousand years in seconds, his schemes crumbling to dust. <words>360</words>

Raven composed a new ballad on the spot, about a minstrel who weaponized generosity against greed. <words>376</words> The empty mailbox outside seemed to listen, its hush now feeling less like absence and more like anticipation. <words>394</words>

After all, the best stories were always about giving everything away. <words>405</words> Even dragon-scales. <words>407</words> Especially dragon-scales. <words>409</words>
