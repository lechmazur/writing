Bartholomew adjusted his cracked white face paint in the mirror of the floating rock yoga studio, watching the clock hand spin endlessly behind him. <words>23</words> The mechanism had broken three years ago, when he'd first arrived with drifting promises of joy tucked into his oversized pockets like deflated balloons. <words>47</words> Now, as the day's earliest train departed at dawn below, its whistle echoing through the suspended granite walls, he prepared for his technically absurd morning ritual. <words>73</words>

He unrolled his mat beside the spinning timepiece, its shadow creating dizzy circles on the floor. <words>89</words> The other yogis had long stopped coming—who wanted to stretch beside a bleak clown whose painted smile never matched his eyes? <words>110</words> But Bartholomew had discovered something in the solitude: he could master the art of dismantling illusions through private poetry, each verse peeling away another layer of his performer's facade. <words>139</words>

"Breathe in sorrow, exhale stars," he whispered, moving through sun salutations as the clock hand whirred its endless waltz. <words>158</words> His motivation burned bright and peculiar—to outshine the northern lights with a grin, not the painted one stretched across his face, but something genuine erupting from within. <words>186</words>

The floating studio swayed gently in the morning breeze, tethered to reality by chains of technically absurd engineering and Bartholomew's stubborn hope. <words>208</words> He wrote verses on the fogged windows with his fingertip: "Promises drift like autumn leaves / But spinning hands catch what time believes." <words>231</words>

A young woman appeared at the doorway, hesitant. <words>239</words> She'd climbed the rope ladder despite the "CLOSED" sign, drawn by rumors of the yoga clown who practiced alone at dawn. <words>260</words> Bartholomew's first instinct was to hide behind his greasepaint grimace, but something in her searching expression made him pause. <words>279</words>

With jagged generosity, he gestured to the space beside him. <words>289</words> "The clock spins lies," he said, his voice rough from disuse. <words>300</words> "But bodies tell truth." <words>304</words>

She unrolled a mat, and together they moved through poses while Bartholomew's whispered poetry filled the spaces between breaths. <words>323</words> The spinning clock hand cast wild shadows that danced across their synchronized movements, transforming the bleak studio into something almost magical. <words>344</words>

As the session ended, she smiled—not at his painted face, but at the light breaking through his carefully constructed darkness. <words>364</words> Bartholomew felt it then: a grin, real and radiant, cracking through his white facade like aurora borealis through night sky. <words>384</words> The drifting promises he'd carried finally found anchor in this moment of shared solitude, technically absurd yet profoundly true. <words>403</words>

The clock hand spun on, but time had finally started moving forward again. <words>416</words>
