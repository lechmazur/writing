The sapped herbalist slumped against the glass wall of the observatory, her fingers still clutching the blacksmith's bellows she'd stolen from the village below. <words>24</words> Years of pursuing the perfect healing draught had drained her—not just of strength, but of the capacity to care about anything beyond her obsession. <words>48</words> She'd climbed to this cliff-perched observatory with thoughtfully thoughtless abandon, knowing the altitude would ruin half her specimens but cherishing the irony of seeking life's essence where the ocean met death's drop. <words>80</words>

The bellows, she'd discovered, could aerate her tinctures in ways no herbalist's tools could manage. <words>95</words> Its crude iron chambers forced air through delicate botanical extracts with a violence that somehow preserved their potency while destroying their gentleness. <words>117</words> This was the price of perfection—to corrupt the very nature of healing in pursuit of its ultimate form. <words>135</words>

She dozed fitfully, the afternoon sun warming the glass walls while she supposedly studied tide patterns for their lunar influences on her herbs. <words>159</words> In truth, she watched with fervent indifference, recording data with meticulous precision while feeling nothing about the knowledge gained. <words>179</words> Her napping was itself a kind of work—dreams revealed chemical combinations her waking mind rejected. <words>195</words>

A lone goose traced its path across the observatory's panoramic view, and she stirred. <words>209</words> Its flight path, she noticed with the clarity that comes between sleep and waking, matched exactly the spiral pattern she'd been trying to achieve in her distillation process. <words>237</words> Nature mocking her again, showing perfection in thoughtless motion what she couldn't achieve through years of deliberate study. <words>255</words>

She pumped the bellows experimentally, watching the bubbles rise through her latest attempt. <words>269</words> The goose's trajectory had shown her something—not how to succeed, but how to fail with purpose. <words>286</words> Perhaps perfection wasn't in the formula but in the rhythm, the breathing of the bellows matching the tides below, the sleeping mind matching the waking obsession. <words>313</words>

She cherished this revelation even as she dismissed it. <words>322</words> Tomorrow she would forget this insight, lose it to the same exhaustion that had brought her here. <words>339</words> But today, in this glass prison above the waves, she understood that her thoughtfully thoughtless methods were not flaws but features. <words>361</words> The price of perfection was everything—her health, her awareness, her ability to feel—and she paid it with fervent indifference, pumping the stolen bellows in time with the tides she pretended to study, following the ghost-path of a goose toward a perfection that would destroy her even as she achieved it. <words>412</words>
