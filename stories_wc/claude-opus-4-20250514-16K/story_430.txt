The reaver sat hunched on the kaleidoscope park bench, his scarred fingers smoothing a child's drawing on crumpled paper. <words>17</words> In this place where playground mirrors fractured sunlight into dancing rainbows, he looked charmingly grotesque—a gargoyle guarding innocence. <words>35</words> The drawing showed three stick figures: grandmother, mother, daughter, each progressively smaller, each holding the same crooked smile. <words>53</words>

He'd stolen it forty years ago from his sister's room, before the first lie is told—that terrible moment when children learn parents are fallible. <words>78</words> Since then, he'd become what generational patterns demanded: another thief in a bloodline of thieves, another closed-off soul in a dynasty of emotional reavers. <words>103</words> His grandmother had stolen hearts, his mother had stolen trust, and he had stolen everything else. <words>119</words>

But the drawing nagged at him. <words>125</words>

Along its margins, he'd scrawled poems over the decades, each one a different shade of regret. <words>141</words> "Little sister drew us whole / before we learned to steal / before we learned that love / was something we could never feel." <words>164</words> The verses wound around crayon houses and lopsided suns, his adult grief embracing her childhood hope. <words>180</words>

Today, she waited by the spiral slide, her own daughter's hand in hers. <words>193</words> He watched them through the kaleidoscope panels, their images splitting and reforming in brilliant fragments. <words>208</words> His sister had broken the pattern—become a giver, not a taker. <words>220</words> The child tugged toward the swings, and he saw his sister's face soften with the same crooked smile from the drawing. <words>241</words>

He approached slowly, the paper trembling in his weathered hands. <words>251</words> "You dropped this," he lied, offering the first truth he'd spoken in decades. <words>264</words>

She recognized it instantly, her eyes filling. <words>271</words> "You kept it?" <words>274</words>

"My poems probably ruined it," he said, his voice carrying that mocking affection he'd perfected to keep the world at distance. <words>296</words> But she was already reading his marginal confessions, tracing the words with one finger while her daughter played. <words>314</words>

When she finally looked up, her expression held no judgment, only understanding. <words>326</words> "You were trying to taste the stars in a single kiss," she said, quoting his most desperate verse. <words>344</words> "All those things you stole—you were trying to fill the emptiness our family carved in us." <words>360</words>

He nodded, unable to speak past the constellation burning in his throat. <words>372</words> His niece ran over, rainbow light dancing across her face, untouched by their inherited darkness. <words>387</words> She smiled that same crooked smile and handed him a dandelion. <words>398</words>

"For you," she chirped, and he tasted stars. <words>406</words>
