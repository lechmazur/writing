Mira's fingers danced through pockets in the time-worn marketplace, her hope burning brighter than the sand cascading down the walls of the giant hourglass that contained their world. <words>24</words> She hummed off-key, a tastefully offensive melody about merchants who sold their mothers for copper coins, drawing amused glances from vendors who'd grown fond of her cheerful thievery. <words>52</words>

The marketplace existed in that peculiar moment when chalk lines on sidewalks fade away—neither fully there nor gone, suspended between memory and forgetting. <words>76</words> Mira clutched her most precious possession: a broken pencil sharpener her sister had given her before vanishing into the upper chamber of the hourglass, where time moved differently. <words>104</words>

"Still sharpening invisible pencils?" old Tomás called from his fruit stand, his voice carrying that particular brand of blithe discontent that infected everyone here. <words>128</words> "Maybe if you sang better, coins would materialize in your pockets instead of you having to fish for them." <words>147</words>

But Mira knew something that seared her soul, a secret about why people disappeared upward, about the depths of devotion required to turn the hourglass. <words>172</words> Her sister hadn't abandoned her; she'd become part of the mechanism itself, grinding time into sand with every turn. <words>191</words>

Unable to contain it anymore, Mira leaped onto Tomás's counter and began to sing—really sing—about the sacrifice above. <words>209</words> Her voice cracked with truth, and impossibly, Tomás joined her in a spontaneous karaoke duet, harmonizing about the loved ones they'd lost to time's hunger. <words>235</words>

Other vendors joined, their voices weaving through the dusty air, and something extraordinary happened: golden coins began to materialize from the falling sand itself. <words>259</words> But Mira didn't reach for them. <words>265</words> Instead, she held up her broken pencil sharpener, and in its cracked plastic, everyone saw reflections of those who'd ascended. <words>285</words>

"They're not gone," she sang, her pickpocket hands finally still. <words>295</words> "They're turning the glass for us, keeping our market from being buried." <words>307</words> The song spread through the hourglass, a confession that transformed their blithe discontent into something fiercer—understanding. <words>323</words>

Now when Mira's fingers slip into pockets, she leaves behind tiny drawings made with pencils her broken sharpener can no longer sharpen, sketches of the devoted above. <words>351</words> Each one a promise that their sacrifice is seen, their love acknowledged in this suspended moment between erosion and permanence. <words>371</words> The marketplace learned to sing her tastefully offensive hymns, celebrating those who chose to become time itself out of love. <words>391</words> And sometimes, just sometimes, the sand falling from above glitters with their tears. <words>404</words>
