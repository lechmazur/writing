The old-fashioned mage pressed the fragment of pharaoh's coffin against the frosted glass of the arctic research greenhouse, his movements purposefully aimless as children's laughter echoed from the nearby playground. <words>28</words> Each wandering step was calculated chaos, a dance meant to confuse whatever watched from the mirrors scattered among the tropical plants thriving in their artificial summer. <words>53</words> The riddle had begun unfolding three days ago when he first glimpsed his reflection cradling something that wasn't there—a shadow-child with eyes like frozen honey. <words>78</words>

Through the greenhouse's humid corridors, past specimens from forgotten jungles, he pursued ephemeral encounters with his mirror-self, each reflection revealing another piece of the ancient puzzle. <words>104</words> The coffin fragment pulsed with heat that defied the Arctic cold pressing against the dome, its hieroglyphs shifting whenever caught in peripheral vision. <words>127</words> During playground time, when the research station's children scattered between the swings and slides visible through the condensation-streaked windows, the reflections grew bold. <words>150</words>

Yesterday, his mirror-twin had cradled the shadow-child tenderly, and the mage understood with sanctified dread what frontier awaited claiming. <words>170</words> Not a place but a threshold—between death and undeath, between the pharaoh's eternal prison and this incongruous paradise of forced growth. <words>192</words> The greenhouse had been built atop something ancient, something that transformed innocent play into ritual, science into necromancy. <words>210</words>

He caught himself in the reflection of a water tank, arms wrapped around empty air in a grotesque pantomime of comfort. <words>231</words> But in the mirror-world, he held the shadow-child close, feeling its non-existent weight, inhaling the scent of lotus and embalming spices. <words>253</words> The riddle's answer crystallized: the pharaoh had hidden his heir not in tomb or scroll, but in the spaces between reflections, waiting for someone foolish enough to cuddle a ghost into being. <words>286</words>

The fragment grew heavier as playground time ended, children's voices fading into Arctic wind. <words>300</words> Each mirror now showed the truth—the mage's arms full of something terrible and precious, a prince preserved in shadow and contradiction. <words>322</words> He had claimed his frontier, but the cost writhed against his chest, neither alive nor dead, demanding the love that would anchor it to this world. <words>348</words>

Through the greenhouse's eternal summer, surrounded by mirrors that no longer lied, the old-fashioned mage completed his purposeless purpose. <words>367</words> He had solved the riddle by becoming it, transforming the arctic research station into a cradle for impossibility, where playground laughter would forever echo with the sound of ancient prayers. <words>397</words> The pharaoh's fragment crumbled to dust, its work complete, leaving only the weight of what had been summoned through foolish tenderness and calculated wandering. <words>422</words>
