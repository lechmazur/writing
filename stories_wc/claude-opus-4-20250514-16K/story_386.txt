The atom-powered lighthouse stood alone on the cliff, its beam sweeping across waters that remembered nothing. <words>16</words> Inside, Marya spread her grandmother's embroidered tablecloth across the control panel, each stitch a constellation from an empire the universe had forgotten. <words>38</words> 

She was the last time refugee, catapulted here when her civilization collapsed into temporal fragments. <words>53</words> The lighthouse keeper had found her unconscious on the rocks below, clutching the cloth like a lifeline. <words>70</words> That was three years ago, in the hush of a line that never moves—the temporal boundary where past and future refuse to meet. <words>93</words>

The keeper trusted her with a trustworthy strange faith, never questioning why her shadow fell upward or why clocks stopped when she entered a room. <words>118</words> He simply taught her to tend the atomic heart of the lighthouse, to read its rhythms like a pulse. <words>137</words>

Tonight, the stars would align as they had on the eve of her empire's dissolution. <words>152</words> By the alignment of the stars, she could open a window—not to return, for that timeline no longer existed, but to reach through and gather what remained. <words>179</words> 

"You'll destroy yourself," the keeper warned, watching her arrange crystals on the embroidered map. <words>193</words>

Marya's smile was quietly defiant. <words>198</words> "Some wounds demand binding, even if the thread cuts deep." <words>208</words>

She activated the lighthouse's full power, channeling it through the tablecloth's ancient patterns. <words>221</words> The fabric glowed, each thread a pathway through collapsed time. <words>231</words> Her unstoppable will pushed against the universe's resistance, demanding it acknowledge what had been erased. <words>246</words>

Through the aperture came not people or cities, but something more precious—memories given form. <words>260</words> They swirled like luminous moths around the lighthouse beam, fragments of laughter, sorrow, and wisdom from ten thousand years of culture. <words>281</words> 

The keeper understood then why he had trusted her. <words>290</words> She wasn't trying to resurrect the dead, but to ensure they weren't forgotten. <words>303</words> 

As the stars shifted and the window began to close, Marya gathered the memory-lights into the lighthouse's atomic core. <words>322</words> They merged with its perpetual flame, transforming its harsh glare into something softer—a borrowed dawn from a civilization that would now illuminate this world forever. <words>347</words>

"Your empire lives on," the keeper said, touching her shoulder as tears traced her cheeks. <words>362</words>

"Not my empire," Marya corrected, folding the tablecloth with reverent hands. <words>373</words> "But its light will guide others through their darkness." <words>382</words> 

Outside, ships that had never seen such gentle radiance adjusted their courses, drawn by a beacon that promised not just safety, but hope. <words>406</words> The time refugee had bound old wounds with new purpose. <words>416</words>
