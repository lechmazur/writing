Brother Marcus had lived alone in the cavern cathedral for seventeen years, tending phosphorescent moss that painted the stalactites in ethereal blues and greens. <words>24</words> The water pumps had failed yesterday, which meant death for both him and his glowing garden—unless he could remember how civilization worked. <words>46</words>

He clutched his only tool: a pair of scissors so blunt they couldn't cut butter, much less the corroded pump cables. <words>67</words> "Magnificent," he muttered, addressing a particularly judgmental cluster of luminescent fungi. <words>78</words> "I've forgotten everything useful about the world above, but at least I remember sarcasm." <words>92</words>

The ancient service elevator groaned somewhere in the cathedral's depths, its arrival schedule as reliable as Marcus's social skills. <words>111</words> He knew it would emerge onto an empty maintenance floor—no one had visited in a decade. <words>128</words> Still, he pressed the scissors against the pump housing and twisted, hoping his years of isolation had somehow granted him mystical repair abilities. <words>152</words>

Nothing. <words>153</words>

Then, impossibly, the scent of fresh bread wafted through the cavern. <words>164</words> Marcus froze. <words>166</words> That smell—it amplified every buried memory of human connection, of shared meals, of warmth beyond phosphorescent light. <words>183</words> His hands trembled. <words>186</words> The scissors slipped. <words>189</words>

The blunt blades caught perfectly in a hidden release mechanism, popping open the pump's access panel with a satisfying click. <words>209</words> "Of course," Marcus laughed bitterly. <words>214</words> "Seventeen years of enlightened solitude, and I'm undone by phantom carbohydrates." <words>225</words>

Inside the panel, the fix was simple—a single disconnected wire, waiting patiently for human touch. <words>240</words> As he worked, the bread scent intensified, making his stomach clench with forgotten hunger for more than food. <words>258</words> The pump shuddered to life, water gurgling through ancient pipes like laughter. <words>270</words>

"Congratulations," he told his glowing congregation. <words>276</words> "Your hermit has achieved peak functionality: fixing things accidentally while hallucinating bakeries." <words>288</words> The moss pulsed brighter, either in celebration or pity. <words>297</words>

The elevator dinged its arrival somewhere above, opening to absolutely no one, as always. <words>312</words> Marcus considered riding it up, following that impossible bread scent to its source. <words>325</words> Instead, he pocketed his strangely effective scissors and returned to his phosphorescent flock. <words>338</words> Some impacts of isolation, he'd learned, were irreversible—but at least his plants would survive another day. <words>355</words>

He sat among the glowing cathedral pillars, listening to restored water trickle through stone, and tried to forget the smell of bread, of life, of everything he'd chosen to leave behind. <words>386</words> The moss seemed to glow a little softer, as if understanding. <words>397</words> "Tomorrow," Marcus whispered, "I'll definitely go up tomorrow." <words>405</words> They both knew he was lying. <words>411</words>
