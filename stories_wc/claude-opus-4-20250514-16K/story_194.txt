Magnus wiped bone dust from his calloused hands before entering La Morte Vivante, the ancient ossuary where he'd taken a dishwashing job after the logging accident shattered his spine. <words>23</words> The restaurant's femur chandeliers cast shadows that made him stumble—gracefully awkward movements that somehow never broke a plate. <words>41</words> 

During his morning bike ride to work, nightmares from the accident had returned, but different—visions of wars not yet fought, of healing hands he didn't recognize as his own. <words>70</words> In his locker, beneath his flannel shirt, lay a letter written in tree-ring patterns only a lumberjack could decode. <words>89</words> "The forests will burn in 2087," it warned, "unless you learn what the bones remember." <words>104</words>

Chef Amelie watched him work, her harsh tenderness evident in barked orders that ended with gentle touches to his scarred back. <words>125</words> She'd hired him for reasons beyond pity—hidden agendas whispered through the kitchen like steam. <words>139</words> The ossuary's previous incarnation held secrets; monks had practiced forgotten healing traditions here, using forest herbs and bone-deep knowledge. <words>159</words>

Each bike ride home brought stronger visions through the reawakened nightmares—future soldiers dying from wounds that ancient wisdom could prevent. <words>179</words> Magnus began arriving early, studying the skull-embedded walls between prep work, tracing symbols that matched his letter's code. <words>197</words> The restaurant itself was the message, he realized, its very existence a revamp of sacred ground into something that could hide truth in plain sight. <words>222</words>

Amelie finally revealed her own scars one evening, battle wounds from a time that hadn't happened yet. <words>239</words> "Your spirit never broke when your body did," she said, crushing herbs into tomorrow's special sauce. <words>255</words> "That's why they chose you—a lumberjack understands growth, patience, the healing that comes from deep roots." <words>270</words>

The nightmares transformed into lessons as Magnus learned to read the ossuary's walls like forest growth rings. <words>287</words> Each bike ride became a meditation, his awkward grace now purposeful as he gathered wild herbs from forgotten paths. <words>306</words> The coded letter revealed more secrets: how to brew tinctures in restaurant kitchens, how to hide healing in haute cuisine, how to prepare for wars by feeding souls today. <words>335</words>

By winter, Magnus's hands—once meant only for axes—had learned the bones' secrets. <words>347</words> He served dishes that mended more than hunger, his spirited nature channeled into each plate's harsh tenderness. <words>364</words> The future war might still come, but now humanity would remember how to heal. <words>378</words> The ossuary restaurant stood ready, its hidden agenda sprouting like seedlings through ancient graves—life persisting, knowledge preserved, hope served nightly at table seven. <words>402</words>
