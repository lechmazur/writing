Elara traced her fingers along the rusted rail of the abandoned roller coaster track, her breath forming small clouds in the October air. <words>22</words> The housekeeping logs from seventeen haunted inns across three continents had all led here, their bizarre entries chronicling dust patterns that formed the same cryptic message: "The last fragment waits where screams once soared." <words>57</words>

She was ingeniously clueless, everyone said—brilliant at finding patterns no one else could see, yet somehow missing the obvious. <words>77</words> Like now, clutching her leather journal filled with meticulous notes about supernatural housekeeping anomalies, she failed to notice the antique doorknob in her coat pocket had begun to glow. <words>106</words>

The riddle was older than time itself: "What opens when everything closes?" <words>118</words> Generations of pathfinders had sought the answer, but Elara had discovered something they'd missed—the haunted inns weren't random. <words>136</words> Their housekeeping logs, dismissed as the ramblings of disturbed caretakers, actually documented visits from something searching, room by room, inn by inn. <words>159</words>

She climbed the track's steep incline, her quiet mania driving her forward. <words>171</words> Each page turn of the logs had revealed more: furniture that rearranged itself into arrows, mirrors that reflected maps, carpets whose stains spelled coordinates. <words>195</words> All pointing here, to this skeletal monument of forgotten joy. <words>205</words>

The doorknob had been her grandmother's last gift—pulled from a door that no longer existed, from a house that history had forgotten. <words>228</words> Elara had carried it as a talisman, never suspecting it might be more. <words>241</words>

At the roller coaster's apex, she found it: a door frame standing impossibly alone, weathered by decades of rain and wind that had eroded everything else. <words>267</words> No door, just the frame and a peculiar socket where a doorknob should be. <words>281</words>

Her hands trembled—not from cold but from realization. <words>289</words> The last fragment wasn't something to find; it was something she'd carried all along. <words>303</words> She pulled the antique doorknob from her pocket, watching it pulse with otherworldly light. <words>318</words>

As she fitted it into the socket, the air shimmered. <words>328</words> The door frame filled with starlight, revealing not another place but another when—the moment before time began, when everything was closed and nothing was open. <words>353</words>

The riddle's answer whispered through her mind: possibility. <words>361</words> What opens when everything closes? <words>366</words> The potential for existence itself. <words>371</words>

She stepped through, finally understanding her ingenious cluelessness had been the key all along—only someone who couldn't see the obvious would carry the last fragment for years without trying to use it, preserving it for this exact moment. <words>409</words> The doorway sealed behind her, leaving only rust and memory on the abandoned track. <words>423</words>
