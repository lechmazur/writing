Kael watched the street artist add the final brushstroke to the mural—a shimmering phoenix rising from recycled debris—before slipping into the shadows of Neo-Tokyo's central recycling facility. <words>24</words> The detached swordsman had learned patience from the Secret Weavers, those enigmatic manipulators of fate who worked through discarded art and forgotten dreams. <words>46</words> His hand rested on his blade's hilt, not from threat but habit, as he approached the artist's overflowing waste bin. <words>66</words>

"Time to meddle," he murmured, kneeling with the reverence of a shrine visitor. <words>79</words> The Weavers had taught him their doctrine of loving detachment—to care deeply while maintaining the distance necessary for true sight. <words>99</words> He began sorting through torn collage pieces, each scrap a possibility, each fragment a thread in fate's tapestry. <words>117</words>

Among paper butterflies and metallic stars, his fingers found it: a piece of sea pottery, smooth as memory, blue as forgotten oceans. <words>139</words> The recycling center's automated systems hummed around him, sorting humanity's castoffs while missing this treasure that had traveled through centuries to reach this precise moment. <words>164</words>

Kael spread the collage scraps on the concrete floor, reassembling them not as they were, but as they needed to be. <words>185</words> A child's drawing of a house became a doorway; magazine cutouts of clock faces formed a spiral of time; newspaper headlines spelled out coordinates in their negative spaces. <words>213</words> The sea pottery served as the center, the anchor point where all possibilities converged. <words>227</words>

"You're early," said a voice behind him. <words>234</words> The street artist stood watching, paint-stained fingers twitching with curiosity rather than alarm. <words>247</words> "The Weavers said you'd come after midnight." <words>254</words>

"Your mural changed the timeline," Kael replied, not looking up from his work. <words>267</words> "That phoenix—you painted it with reclaimed oils from the old world. <words>278</words> Such things have power." <words>282</words>

Together they completed the reassembled collage, each piece clicking into place with the satisfaction of inevitability. <words>298</words> The pattern revealed itself: a map to the place where sky met sea, where a swordsman might speak an impossible vow to the universe itself. <words>323</words>

"To promise perfect protection while remaining perfectly detached," the artist said, understanding flowering in her eyes. <words>339</words> "That's what you're trying to consecrate." <words>345</words>

Kael smiled, his first genuine expression in months. <words>353</words> "The Weavers believe impossibility is just another medium to work with." <words>364</words> He pocketed the sea pottery and stood, leaving the collage for the recycling center's morning shift to puzzle over. <words>383</words> "Besides, what's the point of a vow that's actually possible?" <words>393</words>

The artist laughed, and somewhere in the city's electronic heartbeat, fate shifted one degree closer to impossible. <words>410</words>
