Mara dragged the chalk across the cargo hold's metal wall, marking another day among the space pirates who'd forgotten she existed. <words>18</words> The wry caretaker had spent seventeen years tending their stolen goods, watching time curl around itself like smoke in zero gravity. <words>37</words> 

She'd discovered the truth about time here, in this rusted belly of a ship that sailed between stars. <words>55</words> Time wasn't linear—it was a braid of possibilities, each strand a different choice unmade. <words>70</words> The chalk in her weathered hand had mapped thousands of these temporal threads across the walls. <words>87</words>

"Still scribbling your nonsense?" <words>91</words> Captain Vega's voice crackled through the ancient intercom, warm despite its mockery. <words>104</words> Mara smiled at the outdated phone mounted beside the cargo bay doors—a trophy from Earth, centuries obsolete. <words>122</words>

She'd grown warmly aloof over the years, caring for the crew while keeping her distance. <words>138</words> They needed her inventory skills, her ability to track their plunder through nebula clouds that shifted like Earth's old weather patterns. <words>160</words> But they didn't need to know about the voices. <words>169</words>

The "what if" siren song had started quietly—whispers of lives unlived, paths untaken. <words>183</words> What if she'd stayed on Mars? <words>189</words> What if she'd never stowed away? <words>195</words> What if her daughter had lived? <words>201</words> The questions multiplied with each chalk mark, each tracked cloud formation revealing another timeline where things went differently. <words>220</words>

Now she understood why the universe hid this knowledge. <words>229</words> The weight of infinite alternatives could crush a human soul. <words>239</words>

She lifted the phone's receiver, listening to its archaic dial tone—a sound from a world that no longer existed. <words>259</words> The tone wavered, fading like her resolve to stay tethered to this singular timeline. <words>274</words> She'd found the pattern in the cosmic clouds, the escape route written in stellar dust. <words>290</words>

"Where you headed, Mara?" <words>294</words> Vega's concern leaked through her usual gruffness. <words>302</words>

"To quiet the questions," Mara replied, her voice carrying gentle harshness. <words>313</words> She pressed the chalk to the wall one final time, drawing the symbol she'd seen in the clouds—a doorway. <words>333</words>

The dial tone cut out. <words>338</words>

In that silence between sounds, between moments, between possibilities, Mara stepped through her chalk outline. <words>354</words> The cargo hold held only dust motes dancing where she'd been, and walls covered in temporal equations no one else could read. <words>377</words>

Vega found the chalk later, still warm, and understood with pirate's intuition that their caretaker had found her treasure—not gold or gems, but freedom from the burden of knowing what might have been. <words>411</words> She pocketed the chalk, knowing that some doors, once drawn, should never be opened again. <words>427</words>
