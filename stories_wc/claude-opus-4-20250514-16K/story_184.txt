Mira wiped her calloused hands on her apron, the same one she'd worn serving ale, now dusty with the peculiar soil of the vacuum chamber garden. <words>23</words> The facility's transparent walls revealed stars that shouldn't exist yet, wouldn't exist yet, as time crawled backward through this impossible place. <words>44</words> She'd tried to ignore the calling, truly she had, but destiny has a predictably unpredictable way of dragging tavern-hands into cosmic absurdity. <words>67</words>

Her broken collection of seashells clinked in her pocket—fragments from an ocean that would un-evaporate in three centuries. <words>85</words> Each piece hummed with reverse entropy, their fractures healing slower than memory itself. <words>99</words> "Well then," she muttered with practiced irreverence, "guess I'll save the universe or whatever." <words>113</words>

The dried riverbed stretched before her, its fossilized footprints leading backward to futures that had already unhappened. <words>130</words> Dr. Temporal had explained it with insufferable enthusiasm: "You must randomize the sequence, dear girl! <words>145</words> Step only in the prints that correspond to prime numbers multiplied by your grandmother's birthday!" <words>160</words> Mira had punched him, naturally, but here she was anyway. <words>170</words>

The vacuum chamber garden breathed around her—if vacuum could breathe—its bio-engineered plants growing younger, seeds ascending into flowers. <words>189</words> She scattered her broken shells across the footprints, each fragment a beacon to guide her through temporal arithmetic. <words>208</words> Seven steps forward, three steps into last Tuesday, pivot on the heel of next September. <words>224</words>

"This is ridiculous," she announced to the uncaring cosmos, hopping between prehistory's traces with all the dignity of a drunken crane. <words>245</words> But as she danced through the mathematical maze, reality began to shimmer. <words>257</words> The shells sang harmonics that hadn't been invented yet, wouldn't be uninvented for eons. <words>272</words>

She'd poured beer for philosophers and kings, but nothing had prepared her for this—catapulting imagination beyond the borderlands of possibility itself. <words>294</words> Each randomized step through the ancient impressions unwound another law of physics, another certainty she'd taken for granted. <words>313</words> The calling had found her washing tankards and dreaming small dreams, but apparently the universe needed a working-class hero. <words>333</words>

"Fine," she said, leaping onto the forty-seventh footprint while juggling temporal paradoxes like empty pint glasses. <words>349</words> "But after I fix causality, I'm demanding overtime pay." <words>358</words>

The garden erupted in impossible colors as she completed the sequence, her broken shells fusing into a map of everything that never was. <words>382</words> Time hiccupped, considered its options, then resumed its backward flow with renewed purpose. <words>395</words> Mira straightened her apron and cracked her knuckles. <words>403</words> Tomorrow's yesterday was about to get interesting. <words>410</words>
