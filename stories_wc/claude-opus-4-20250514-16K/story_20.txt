The archer hadn't touched her bow in seven years, dedicating herself instead to documenting protests and revolutions with the same precision she once reserved for targets. <words>25</words> Now, as Mars aligned with Saturn in their millennial waltz, she found herself at the Inverted Falls—a roadside curiosity where water flowed upward, defying nature's pull. <words>50</words> 

She'd stopped only to refuel, maintaining that anxiously calm demeanor that war correspondents perfect, when she saw him standing on the wooden platform they called the Bridge of Regret. <words>78</words> Local legend claimed anyone who crossed it would confront their abandoned dreams, but she'd developed a passionate disinterest in such folklore—the same detachment that let her chronicle suffering without drowning in it. <words>110</words>

"Elena," he called, holding something that caught the strange upward spray of water. <words>123</words> The tarnished silver comb she'd left behind when she'd chosen notebooks over arrows, when she'd decided that documenting change mattered more than winning medals. <words>147</words>

She approached with measured steps, each one a small betrayal of the tremor in her chest. <words>163</words> "I thought you'd sold it," she said, her voice carrying that practiced neutrality she used when interviewing generals about their defeats. <words>184</words>

"I couldn't," Marcus replied, extending the comb toward her. <words>193</words> "Just like you couldn't stay." <words>198</words>

The waterfall roared upward behind him, drops ascending like reversed tears, and she understood why they named this bridge what they did. <words>220</words> Every archer knows the moment between drawing the bow and releasing—that suspended instant where all possibilities exist. <words>237</words> She'd been living in that moment for seven years, neither fully journalist nor completely divorced from her athletic past. <words>256</words>

"The movements I chronicle," she said, taking the comb with steady fingers that remembered a different kind of tension, "they're just people trying to hit impossible targets." <words>284</words> The metal felt heavier than any bow she'd carried. <words>293</words>

"And you?" he asked. <words>297</words> "What target are you aiming for?" <words>303</words>

She tucked the comb into her jacket, where it pressed against her notebook—past and present colliding like celestial bodies in their ancient dance. <words>327</words> "The same one I always was," she admitted, surprising herself with the confession. <words>340</words> "Perfect aim." <words>342</words> She paused, watching water climb toward stars. <words>349</words> "I just changed what I'm shooting at." <words>356</words>

The bridge creaked beneath their combined weight, a wooden complaint about carrying so much unresolved history. <words>372</words> But bridges were meant for crossing, not standing, and Elena had deadlines to meet, movements to document, truths to pin down with words instead of arrows. <words>398</words>

She left him there, ascending like the water, carrying her regret transformed into purpose. <words>412</words> The comb would tarnish further in her travels, but she'd keep it—a reminder that some targets require a different kind of precision. <words>435</words> As planets wheeled overhead in their patient choreography, she drove toward the next revolution, anxiously calm, passionately disinterested, and perfectly aimed. <words>457</words>
