The farmer's market bustled with its unusually usual Saturday morning chaos when Mira, a professional cuddler whose clients paid for human warmth, spotted the antique vendor holding what looked impossible—a phantom train ticket punch, its brass surface etched with constellations. <words>37</words> She'd seen one only in her grandmother's stories about the old spaceport, before society's unspoken rules had relegated touch workers like her to the margins. <words>62</words> The vendor, noticing her recognition, whispered an address and vanished into the crowd. <words>76</words>

Three hours later, Mira stood in the abandoned spaceport hangar, its vastness echoing with decades of decay, rust eating through dreams of stellar voyages that never launched. <words>104</words> The acceptance speech for the Touch Workers' Rights Award played on her phone—she should have been there, but prejudice ran deeper than accolades. <words>128</words> Instead, she'd followed the vendor's cryptic invitation here, where shadows held secrets older than her profession's shame. <words>145</words>

The hush before the speech began stretched like taffy, and in that suspended moment, Mira saw them—others like her, emerging from the hangar's corners. <words>170</words> Touch workers, comfort specialists, professional embracers, all drawn by the same phantom punch that had once validated passage between worlds, now validating their existence. <words>195</words> The vendor appeared again, ancient yet somehow novel in his movements, explaining how this place had been a departure point for colonists seeking worlds without Earth's rigid social hierarchies. <words>225</words>

"The punch still works," he said, demonstrating on invisible tickets that materialized in the air, each one bearing a passenger's deepest prejudice to be left behind. <words>251</words> Mira understood then—this wasn't about escaping to the stars but about transforming the ground beneath their feet. <words>268</words> The hangar's decay wasn't just architectural; it was the slow dissolution of old hatreds, making space for something new. <words>288</words>

As her phone played her name being called for the award she'd declined to accept, Mira took the punch from the vendor's weathered hands. <words>313</words> Each click against the phantom tickets released another layer of internalized shame, another unspoken rule that said her work wasn't legitimate, wasn't healing, wasn't necessary. <words>339</words> The other touch workers formed a circle, their hands joined in defiance of a world that feared human connection. <words>359</words>

The vendor smiled, fading like morning mist. <words>367</words> "The real voyage," he whispered, "was always about arriving where you already are, but with new eyes." <words>385</words> Mira pocketed the punch, knowing tomorrow's farmer's market would find her recruiting others, building a movement from this ancient hangar where the future had once tried to launch, and now, finally, would. <words>419</words>
