Ranger Mika patrolled the urban orchard with mechanical precision, her boots clicking against the repurposed highway overpass where apple trees now grew through cracked asphalt. <words>25</words> In this era after the last human dream was dreamt, she clutched her grandmother's plain notebook like scripture, its pages filled with symbols that felt familiarly unknown. <words>51</words> The trees fluctuated between bloom and decay with each passing hour, their roots drinking from the automated irrigation system she maintained with religious fervor. <words>75</words>

Through chance encounters with wind-scattered pages, Mika had discovered her grandmother's obsession: catching the echo of a goddess who once whispered through human dreams. <words>99</words> Now those dreams were extinct, replaced by the gray static of survival, but Mika believed the goddess still lingered in the orchard's chaotic organization. <words>123</words>

She met the first pilgrim at dawn, a woman who claimed the apples tasted like forgotten lullabies. <words>140</words> "Your grandmother planted these trees," the stranger said, producing a matching notebook from her coat. <words>155</words> Mika's pulse quickened as she compared the pages—identical symbols arranged in different patterns, like sheet music for a song no one remembered how to sing. <words>180</words>

The second encounter came at noon: a child who spoke in her grandmother's voice, explaining how each tree corresponded to a dream fragment. <words>203</words> The orchard wasn't just a garden but a net, designed to catch divine echoes in its branches. <words>220</words>

By evening, seven more pilgrims had arrived, each carrying notebooks, each drawn by the same familiarly unknown compulsion. <words>238</words> They formed a circle among the trees, and Mika understood—her overzealous maintenance hadn't been madness but preparation. <words>255</words> Her grandmother had scattered these notebooks like seeds, knowing that after dreams died, only obsession could resurrect wonder. <words>273</words>

The pilgrims opened their notebooks simultaneously, and the symbols began to fluctuate on the pages, rearranging themselves into new patterns. <words>293</words> The apple trees responded, their branches swaying in windless air, leaves shimmering between green and silver. <words>309</words>

"She's here," whispered the child, pointing to the space between the trees where shadows danced without sources. <words>326</words> Mika felt it then—not the goddess herself, but her echo bouncing through the orchard's careful chaos, a frequency only the dreamless could hear. <words>350</words>

The notebooks burst into flame, but no one moved to save them. <words>362</words> They had served their purpose, bringing together those who refused to accept a world without mystery. <words>378</words> As the ashes scattered through the canopy, new buds appeared on the apple trees, each one containing the possibility of dreams returning. <words>400</words>

Mika smiled, understanding at last why her grandmother had chosen her: not to be a ranger, but a guardian of the space between order and chaos, where goddesses might still dance. <words>431</words>
