Marcus wiped down the same glass for the third time, his gloomy expression reflecting in its surface as the abandoned carnival ticket booth materialized again outside his bar window. <words>24</words> The booth appeared every night at this hour—at the hush when a truce forms without words—bringing with it the drone of overlapping realities that only he could hear. <words>52</words> 

He fingered the worn wallet in his apron pocket, its leather smooth from decades of handling, knowing it held more than money. <words>74</words> Inside were photographs from worlds that shouldn't exist together: himself young in one reality, old in another, dead in a third. <words>95</words> The transient realities had been bleeding through ever since midnight stole the light from this place, leaving everything suspended between what was and what might be. <words>121</words>

"You're staring again," said Claire, sliding onto a barstool with that abrasively charming smile that made people either love her immediately or recoil. <words>144</words> "The booth's back, isn't it?" <words>149</words>

Marcus nodded, pouring her usual without being asked. <words>157</words> Through the window, he watched a figure approach the broken payphone booth beside the carnival entrance, lifting the receiver to no one. <words>179</words> But Marcus heard the confessions clearly—they always drifted to him like smoke: "I killed her in the other timeline," the voice whispered. <words>202</words> "But here she never existed at all." <words>209</words>

"You know what they're saying," Claire observed, studying his face with unsettling familiarity. <words>223</words> "You always do." <words>226</words>

The drone intensified, reality wavering like heat mirages. <words>234</words> Marcus gripped the bar's edge as the room flickered between states—full of patrons, empty, burned down, never built. <words>252</words> His worn wallet grew warm, anchoring him to this particular thread of existence. <words>266</words>

"I need to reclaim it," he said finally, his voice matching the gloomy cast of his features. <words>283</words> "The light stolen by midnight." <words>288</words> He'd been a barkeep in every reality, but only in this one had he witnessed the theft—watched darkness swallow the carnival's eternal glow, fracturing time itself. <words>314</words>

Claire reached across the bar, her fingers briefly touching his. <words>324</words> "The confessions at the payphone," she said with enigmatic familiarity, "they're not random." <words>337</words> "They're instructions." <words>339</words>

Marcus met her gaze, understanding dawning. <words>345</words> Every overheard confession was a piece of the puzzle, fragments of truth from colliding realities. <words>360</words> The drone wasn't chaos—it was a map. <words>368</words>

He untied his apron with deliberate slowness, the gloomy barkeep preparing to leave his post for the first time in any timeline. <words>391</words> The worn wallet pulsed with possibility as he walked toward the door, toward the carnival booth where realities converged, ready to steal back what midnight had taken. <words>418</words>
