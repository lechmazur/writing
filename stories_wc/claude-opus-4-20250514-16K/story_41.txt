Maya's calloused fingers trembled as she clutched the plain cameo brooch, its worn ivory surface reflecting starlight that only she could see. <words>22</words> For seventeen years, she'd punched timecards at the textile factory, hiding the nebulae that swirled beneath her skin whenever machinery sparked. <words>43</words> Tonight, at the end of a corridor no one dares walk, she would finally review the choice that had imprisoned her. <words>65</words> 

The gargoyle-guarded terrace materialized through shadow, stone sentinels perched above a bottomless abyss that yawned like the universe's hunger. <words>85</words> Her grandmother had described this place in academically wild terms—equations scrawled on napkins, theorems about dimensional bridges sung as lullabies. <words>106</words> Maya had memorized every formula, every verse, preparing for this unique family ritual that connected generations of cosmic beings masquerading as ordinary humans. <words>130</words>

"The Witnessing," her mother had called it before disappearing into her own constellation. <words>143</words> Each woman in their line faced this moment: standing before the abyss, reviewing a lifetime of suppressed power, deciding whether to remain earthbound or ascend. <words>169</words> The cameo brooch, passed mother to daughter for centuries, would open the portal—but only for those brave enough to disregard the footprints left by doubt. <words>195</words>

Maya's reflection in the brooch showed not her factory uniform but cosmic dust arranged in ordered disarray, galaxies spinning where her heart should beat. <words>220</words> She thought of tomorrow's shift, the mechanical repetition that had become her meditation, the coworkers who'd never suspected she could birth stars with her breath. <words>246</words> Breaking free from expectations meant abandoning the safety of anonymity, the comfort of predetermined days. <words>261</words>

The gargoyles' eyes began glowing as Maya pressed the brooch against her chest. <words>275</words> Reality folded like origami, revealing the truth her grandmother's equations had promised: the factory floor was practice for shaping matter, each textile pattern a constellation she'd unconsciously woven. <words>304</words> Her timecards documented not hours worked but cosmic cycles completed, preparing her for this moment of choice. <words>321</words>

Wind from the abyss carried voices of her ancestors, each one having stood here, reviewed their earthly disguises, and chosen their path. <words>344</words> Some returned to factories and farms, guardians in hiding; others leaped into their true forms, becoming the stars their descendants would wish upon. <words>369</words> Maya understood now why the corridor remained empty—not from fear, but from reverence for the privacy of transformation. <words>388</words>

She stepped forward, her work boots dissolving into stardust, the brooch pulsing with accumulated power of generations who'd dared to dream beyond assembly lines. <words>413</words> The gargoyles bowed as Maya finally acknowledged what she'd always known: ordinary was just another word for universe in waiting. <words>434</words> With one last look at her reflected infinities, she jumped, breaking free at last, her cosmic powers unfurling like wings made of nebulae and time. <words>460</words>
