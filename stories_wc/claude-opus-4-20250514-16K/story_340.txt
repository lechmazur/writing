Mara perched on her treehouse balcony, adjusting her exorcist badge for the hundredth time—because nothing says "totally secure in my abilities" like compulsive pin-straightening. <words>22</words> The Amazon's canopy city sprawled before her, bridges swaying between ancient trees, while she clutched the wizard's battered grimoire she'd "borrowed" from the archives. <words>46</words> Sure, Grand Exorcist Valdez had banished seventeen demons before breakfast at her age, but had he ever dealt with a possession that literally aged its victims backward? <words>73</words> 

"Responsibility," she muttered, flipping through water-stained pages, "is just anxiety with a fancy diploma." <words>87</words> The grimoire trembled—typical magical dramatics—and revealed a youthification spell that made her stomach flip. <words>102</words> According to the scrawled margins, reversing the demon's curse required channeling it through herself first. <words>118</words> Because of course it did. <words>123</words>

The suspension bridge to the afflicted district chose that exact moment to snap, vines unraveling like the universe's worst timing. <words>143</words> "Oh, fantastic," Mara groaned, watching her only route vanish into the green abyss below. <words>157</words> The city's clock tower hiccupped—its hands stuttering backward for a heartbeat—and she knew the demon was growing stronger. <words>176</words>

Time distortions meant possession spread. <words>181</words> More children were becoming younger, smaller, helpless. <words>188</words> The weight of their futures pressed against her chest like humidity before a storm. <words>203</words> Valdez would've already solved this, probably while composing a sonnet. <words>213</words>

But Valdez wasn't here. <words>217</words>

With endearing recklessness that her mentors called "feisty" and she called "practical," Mara grabbed a vine. <words>233</words> She swung across the chasm, grimoire tucked under one arm, exorcist pride under the other. <words>249</words> The spell's words tasted like copper and regret as she chanted, feeling years peel away from her bones. <words>267</words> Twenty became fifteen, fifteen became ten—her badge now comically oversized on her shrinking frame. <words>282</words>

The demon materialized, a writhing shadow of backwards time. <words>291</words> "A child exorcist?" it laughed. <words>296</words> "How precious." <words>298</words>

"Child prodigy," Mara corrected, hurling purification salts with tiny hands that remembered their training. <words>313</words> "There's a difference." <words>316</words> The demon shrieked as the spell reversed, aging flooding back through her and into its form. <words>333</words> It withered, crumbled, banished. <words>337</words>

Later, returned to her proper age and filling out the paperwork (because even mystical victories required forms), Mara smiled. <words>356</words> The communication crystal buzzed with congratulations from the Council, mentions of Valdez's record being broken. <words>371</words> She folded the message into a paper airplane and sent it sailing into the canopy. <words>387</words>

Shadows were meant to be stepped out of, not lived in. <words>398</words> Even if it meant swinging through the Amazon as a ten-year-old with an attitude problem and a stolen spellbook. <words>418</words> Responsibility, she'd learned, weighed the same whether you carried it with gravitas or gleeful irreverence. <words>433</words> She chose irreverence. <words>436</words> Every time. <words>438</words>
