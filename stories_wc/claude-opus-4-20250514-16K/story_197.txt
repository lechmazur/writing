Marlowe had spent seventeen years perfecting her craft as a high-altitude con artist, scaling the Worldtree's infinite branches to fleece the dream-merchants who nested there. <words>22</words> Tonight, she clutched a piece of fabric scrap torn from a child's blanket—her ticket to the highest bough where nightmares collide. <words>43</words> 

The Worldtree stood silent during the hush after a child's last bedtime story, when reality thinned and dreams began bleeding through bark. <words>66</words> Each branch held a different terror: on one, teeth fell like rain; on another, loved ones spoke with strangers' voices—mundanely terrifying visions that drove the dream-merchants to madness. <words>95</words>

Marlowe's con was simple yet impossible: she claimed she could compose a cosmic lullaby to calm the colliding nightmares. <words>114</words> The merchants, desperate for peace, paid her in crystallized wishes and bottled sighs. <words>127</words> But tonight was different—the fabric scrap belonged to the last child who'd ever dreamed peacefully in this realm. <words>145</words>

She reached the convergence point where branches twisted into pristine chaos, each limb hosting its own perfectly ordered horror. <words>164</words> Here, she found her workspace: thousands of sticky notes plastered across the trunk, each containing a fragment of the universe's first song. <words>187</words> The tree rearranged them daily, scrambling the melody that once held nightmares at bay. <words>202</words>

By unscrambling a set of sticky notes rearranged daily, Marlowe had convinced the merchants she was decoding the lullaby. <words>222</words> In truth, she'd been stealing their sanity, note by note, weaving it into the fabric scrap. <words>239</words> Each stolen piece furthered her true plan—not to stop the nightmares, but to further their reach into waking minds. <words>259</words>

As she worked tonight, peeling another note free, the fabric began to sing. <words>273</words> Not the cosmic lullaby she'd promised, but something darker—a song that made the nightmares dance. <words>289</words> The Worldtree shuddered, its branches reaching toward sleeping children everywhere. <words>299</words>

Marlowe smiled, her con complete. <words>304</words> She'd never intended to compose a cosmic lullaby; she'd been composing its opposite all along. <words>320</words> The fabric scrap pulsed with stolen sanity, transforming her into something new—not a con artist, but a nightmare conductor. <words>340</words> 

She began to climb higher, beyond where even dreams dared venture, leaving sticky notes to flutter down like falling leaves. <words>361</words> Each one carried a piece of her human self, scattered across the pristine chaos below. <words>377</words> The tree accepted her offering, its bark opening to reveal staircases of bone and starlight. <words>393</words>

In the hush after the last bedtime story ever told, Marlowe ascended to become the silence children fear most. <words>413</words> The cosmic lullaby she'd composed was simply this: the sound of nothing where something should be, playing forever in the space between sleep and waking. <words>438</words> And somewhere below, the dream-merchants realized too late that the greatest con was making them believe nightmares could be tamed at all. <words>461</words>
