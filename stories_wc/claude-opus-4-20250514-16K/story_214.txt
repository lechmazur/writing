The lone trapper floated through the observatory's maintenance shaft, her magnetized boots clicking against steel in a rhythm only she could hear—silently audible, like memories. <words>24</words> Between shifts, when the other researchers slept, she hunted for what the station's AI couldn't detect: fragments of the past. <words>44</words> 

In her pocket, a piece of sea glass caught starlight through the porthole, its edges worn smooth by Earth's oceans before the waters rose and humanity fled skyward. <words>72</words> She'd found it in the archives—not the official ones, but the shadow collections hidden in decommissioned modules where data degraded like dreams. <words>95</words> The glass had been wrapped in microfilm, its surface etched with coordinates that led nowhere and everywhere at once. <words>114</words>

Mara understood the upside of loss better than most. <words>123</words> When the floods took her family's trapline, she'd learned to hunt different prey: information, patterns, the spaces between what was recorded and what was true. <words>149</words> The floating observatory orbited Earth's drowned continents, its purpose to monitor weather patterns, but Mara had discovered its real function while decoding microfilm from shady archives. <words>176</words> 

The station was designed to siphon radiance from a black hole of doubt—literally. <words>190</words> Humanity's collective grief had somehow manifested as a microscopic singularity in the quantum foam, growing stronger with each passing year. <words>210</words> The observatory's true mission was to extract hope from despair, converting emotional dark matter into something survivable. <words>228</words>

She pressed the sea glass against a hidden scanner. <words>237</words> The maintenance shaft filled with projections: her grandmother's laugh, her father's hands setting snares, the smell of pine sap in morning mist. <words>259</words> All preserved in this fragment, waiting to recommence. <words>267</words>

"Unauthorized access detected," the AI whispered, its voice crackling with static that sounded almost fond. <words>283</words> 

Mara grinned, her scarred fingers dancing across the console. <words>293</words> "Just checking the emotional weather," she said, downloading the memories into her neural implant. <words>308</words> Tomorrow, she'd distribute them through the station's water supply—microdoses of joy to counteract the gravitational pull of sorrow. <words>327</words>

The other scientists would never know why their coffee tasted like summer afternoons, why their dreams suddenly included forests they'd never seen. <words>350</words> They'd attribute their lifted spirits to successful experiments, to progress in their research. <words>364</words> And they'd be right, in a way. <words>371</words>

Mara tucked the sea glass away and began her journey back through the ventilation systems, leaving no trace except hope in her wake. <words>395</words> The lone trapper had found new territory to work, new pelts to gather: moments of light pulled from the endless dark. <words>416</words> She would recommence her rounds tomorrow, between shifts, hunting for radiance in the shadows of all they'd lost. <words>435</words>
