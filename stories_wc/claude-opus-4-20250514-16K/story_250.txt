The blunt heretic clutched her worn-out teddy bear as dust motes danced through shafts of light penetrating the forgotten library inside the deserted temple. <words>20</words> She had promised her dying sister she would find the truth, no matter how many sacred texts she had to challenge. <words>39</words> 

"Show yourself," Mara called out, her voice echoing against stone walls lined with rotting scrolls. <words>54</words> The omniscient mind that haunted this place had left her breadcrumbs for decades through the jumbled codes in an outdated stock ticker mounted incongruously beside ancient tomes. <words>81</words> She approached it with enthusiastic caution, her fingers trembling as they traced the brass keys. <words>96</words>

The ticker suddenly clattered to life, spewing ribbon after ribbon of seemingly random numbers and letters. <words>112</words> This was her battle—not with swords or prayers, but with logic against divinity itself. <words>127</words> Each sequence held fragments of old promises, prophecies twisted into market data by whatever entity dwelled here. <words>144</words>

Years ago, her sister had discovered the first piece of this cosmic puzzle before vanishing into these very halls. <words>163</words> Now, at the hush when that long-lost puzzle piece reappeared—a single sequence repeating endlessly on the ticker—Mara's heart hammered with anxious elation. <words>186</words> 

"Seven-seven-three-nine-alpha," she whispered, matching the pattern to her sister's final notes. <words>197</words> The teddy bear's button eye caught the light as she set it on the desk, a witness to this moment of reckoning. <words>219</words> She had been enthusiastically cautious for too long, tiptoeing around divine mysteries while her sister's fate remained unknown. <words>238</words>

"I reject your riddles," Mara declared, typing counter-sequences into the ticker with increasing fervor. <words>252</words> "Face me directly, or admit you're no more omniscient than these moldering books." <words>265</words>

The library trembled, and suddenly the ticker's ribbon formed words instead of codes: "Your sister kept her promise. Now keep yours." <words>287</words> 

Mara's fingers flew across the keys, her blunt nature finally an asset as she stripped away layers of theological obfuscation. <words>308</words> She would match wits with this so-called omniscient mind until one of them broke. <words>323</words> The teddy bear watched with its remaining eye as she battled through algorithms older than the temple itself, each decoded message bringing her closer to a truth that gods and mortals had conspired to hide. <words>357</words>

At last, the ticker fell silent, its final message clear: her sister had transcended, not perished, having solved the ultimate equation between faith and heresy. <words>382</words> Mara laughed through her tears, clutching the teddy bear that had traveled with them both since childhood. <words>399</words> She had won her battle not by destroying the omniscient mind, but by proving it could be understood. <words>417</words> Old promises fulfilled, she walked from the temple into dawn's light. <words>428</words>
