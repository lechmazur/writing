The thin-lipped warlock descended into the abandoned mine shaft, his formally casual attire—a moth-eaten dinner jacket over torn denim—perfectly suited for what he knew would be his greatest discovery. <words>29</words> December thirty-first had arrived, and with it, the moment to flip the final calendar page of the year. <words>47</words> He had spent months deciphering the location of this forgotten library, buried deep where copper veins once gleamed. <words>65</words> 

The warnings had been explicit: those who gorged on the fruit of knowledge here would pay dearly. <words>82</words> But warnings were for those who lacked his particular hunger. <words>92</words> His thin lips curved into what might have been a smile as he pushed through the rotting oak doors. <words>111</words>

Inside, shelves stretched impossibly upward, filled with discredited textbooks that respectable scholars had long dismissed as dangerous nonsense. <words>129</words> He knew better. <words>132</words> These volumes contained rumored cures that could optimize the very essence of lost artifacts—if one knew how to read between the lies. <words>155</words>

His fingers found the viking ship figurehead fragment in his pocket, its weathered wood warm against his palm. <words>173</words> This was no mere splinter of history; it was the key to unlocking what the texts promised. <words>191</words> The fragment had sailed through centuries, accumulating power with each storm it weathered, each battle it witnessed. <words>208</words>

He selected a volume bound in what appeared to be human skin, its pages crackling with age and possibility. <words>228</words> The text swam before his eyes, words rearranging themselves into configurations that both were and weren't there. <words>245</words> This was the confusing certainty he had sought—knowledge that existed in the spaces between understanding and madness. <words>262</words>

As midnight approached, he began the ritual described in the book's marginalia. <words>274</words> The figurehead fragment pulsed, resonating with energies that the abandoned mine had absorbed from the earth's core. <words>291</words> Each discredited cure he whispered transformed the artifact, optimizing its latent potential until it blazed with otherworldly light. <words>309</words>

The library shuddered, books tumbling from their shelves as if eager to share their forbidden wisdom. <words>326</words> He gorged himself on their contents, each page dissolving on his tongue like communion wafers of pure knowledge. <words>344</words> His thin lips moved in silent incantations, weaving the rumored cures into reality. <words>357</words>

When the clock struck twelve, the warlock understood why the warnings existed. <words>369</words> The fruit of knowledge was not meant to be devoured—it was meant to devour. <words>383</words> But as the library collapsed around him, he smiled his thin-lipped smile. <words>396</words> He had optimized the impossible, transforming himself into the very artifact he had sought. <words>410</words> The mine sealed itself, adding another lost treasure to its collection. <words>421</words> Some certainties, after all, are worth the confusion they bring. <words>432</words>
