As the submissive aristocrat, Lady Whistledown, tended to the gardens amid the yard work, she couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt for being so distracted by the secret agent workshop hidden behind the hedge <words>39>.
Her unusually perceptive nature had picked up on the faint hum of activity emanating from within, and she found herself drawn to the unassuming building <words>64>.
While pruning the roses, Lady Whistledown's gaze fell upon the dull letter opener she had pilfered from the workshop's reception desk earlier that morning <words>88>.
She had been using it to gently dig into the soil, and now it lay beside her, a symbol of the silent empathy she felt for the vulnerable creature she was trying to protect <words>115>.
The creature, a skilled agent codenamed "Nightshade," was rumored to be hiding in the workshop, and Lady Whistledown had overheard snippets of conversation through unplanned eavesdropping in the echo chambers that crisscrossed the estate <words>143>.
As she worked, she would occasionally pause to listen, her ears perked up like a satellite dish tuning into a faint signal <words>165>.
The information she gathered was piecemeal, but it was enough to piece together the general outline of Nightshade's predicament <words>188>.
It seemed that the agent was in danger of being liquified by a particularly nasty toxin, one that would dissolve their very identity <words>213>.
Lady Whistledown's motivation for helping Nightshade was simple: she couldn't bear the thought of such a brilliant and resourceful person being reduced to nothing more than a puddle of goo <words>240>.
With a flick of her wrist, she sent the dull letter opener flying into a nearby bucket, where it landed with a soft clunk, a gesture of solidarity with the imperiled agent <words>268>.
As she returned to her yard work, Lady Whistledown couldn't help but feel a sense of earnest flippancy, a tone that seemed to suit the absurdity of her situation <words>296>.
She was, after all, a submissive aristocrat with a penchant for espionage and a dull letter opener, working to protect a secret agent through the power of silent empathy <words>323>.
And so, she continued to tend to the gardens, her ears open and her heart aflame with a determination to help Nightshade survive the dangers that lurked within the workshop <words>351>.
With a final flourish, Lady Whistledown finished her task, the dull letter opener's work done, its presence a reminder of the quiet courage that lay just beneath the surface of her aristocratic demeanor <words>370>.
