In that moment, affirmed by the silence that surrounded him, the minstrel knew he had escaped the mundane existence that had been weighing him down, and a sense of gentle turmoil gave way to a deep, abiding peace <words>283>.
As the sounds of rush hour continued to filter through the giant's dining room, the minstrel smiled, his heart now attuned to a different rhythm, one that was both openly private and profoundly free <words>310>.
The witch's gnarled wooden ladle, now a symbol of his transformation, lay forgotten on the floor, its work done, as the minstrel walked away, his footsteps echoing through the giant's dining room <words>336>.
