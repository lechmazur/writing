In the underground city of the goblins, I sat peculiarly sincere, surrounded by the faint sounds of a playground drifting through the tunnels, and pondered the tangled tapestry of life and death. <words>29</words>
As a meek necromancer, I had spent years trying to decode a universal riddle that would unlock the secrets of the afterlife. <words>53</words>
My eyes fell upon a fountain pen with a broken nib, a relic of a long-forgotten scholar who had once sought the same answers. <words>73</words>
I recalled the words etched into the pen's barrel: "regain the lost art through the way light reflects off a dew drop." <words>93</words>
Intrigued, I rose from my seat and made my way to a nearby crystal cave, where the morning dew clung to the facets of the rocks. <words>115</words>
Amid the playground sounds of children's laughter and the clang of swings, I carefully positioned a dew drop on a crystal point, watching as the light danced through it. <words>138</words>
The refracted light cast a miniature rainbow on the ground, illuminating a hidden pattern etched into the stone floor - a piece of the tangled tapestry. <words>162</words>
As I studied the pattern, the intricate web of life and death began to unravel, revealing a glimpse of the universal riddle's solution. <words>185</words>
With the fountain pen's broken nib, I began to transcribe the revelation onto a piece of parchment, the scratchy lines and imperfect script a testament to the pen's condition. <words>210</words>
Yet, as I wrote, the words seemed to take on a life of their own, flowing with a mystic simplicity that belied the complexity of the riddle. <words>234</words>
The playground sounds faded into the background as I became lost in the flow of writing, the tangled tapestry slowly regaining its clarity. <words>257</words>
As the last sentence was written, the dew drop evaporated, leaving behind a tiny, shimmering residue that seemed to hold the essence of the revelation. <words>283</words>
I smiled, feeling a sense of accomplishment, for I had regained a piece of the lost art, and the universal riddle had yielded a fraction of its secrets. <words>308</words>
The goblins, drawn by the faint glow of the crystal cave, gathered around me, their eyes shining with a mixture of curiosity and reverence. <words>330</words>
In that moment, I knew that the tangled tapestry was not just a puzzle to be solved, but a gateway to a deeper understanding of the world and its mysteries. <words>356</words>
And as I looked upon the parchment, now filled with the scratchy lines of the fountain pen, I felt a sense of mystic simplicity wash over me. <words>379</words>
The universal riddle remained, but I was one step closer to unraveling its secrets. <words>394</words>
