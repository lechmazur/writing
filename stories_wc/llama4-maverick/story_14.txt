The darkness swallowed him whole, but the spark within him remained, a flame that burned bright, a reminder of the candlelit dinner, and the unspoken bargain that had changed his life forever <words>362>.
As the tides ebbed and flowed, the gambler's fate was sealed, a testament to the power of chance, and the unspoken bargains we make in the darkest of times <words>394>.
