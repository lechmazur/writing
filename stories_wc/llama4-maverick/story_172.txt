The seashell, once a mere curiosity, had become a symbol of her liberation, and the guide smiled, feeling a sense of peace settle over her like a mantle <words>262>.
With the wooden puzzle box now empty, the guide closed it, and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore filled the silence <words>283>.
The guide's eyes, once red from lack of sleep, now shone with a soft light, as she gazed out at the horizon, ready to face whatever lay ahead <words>307>.
As she stood there, the wind rustling her hair, the guide felt a sense of sharp gentleness, a feeling that would stay with her forever <words>327>.
