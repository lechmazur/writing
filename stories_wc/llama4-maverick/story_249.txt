In the city of forgotten fountains, where the once-grand water features now stood dry and still, a lazily ambitious unmasked vigilante roamed the streets, driven by a peculiar motivation to collect traditional games. <words>29</words>
With an antique dentist's drill in hand, a relic of a bygone era, the vigilante set out to lure the city's most elusive game collectors into a trap. <words>54</words>
