In this state of calm contemplation, she felt the hidden patterns of the world reveal themselves to her, and she knew that she had finally grasped the truth she had been seeking. [539]
The fireflies continued to dance around her, their lights flashing in a pattern that seemed to echo the rhythm of her own heartbeat. [565]
