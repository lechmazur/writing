The coathanger clattered to the floor, and the emissary felt a pang of embarrassment, but the scientist, oblivious to the commotion they had caused, simply smiled and said, "We've found a pattern in the debris field!" <words>301</words>
The emissary watched as the team celebrated, and in that moment, they realized that the tone of accidental wisdom that pervaded this place was a result of the scientists' ability to find meaning in the most unexpected places. <words>341</words>

The emissary's unease began to dissipate, replaced by a sense of wonder at the consistently surprising nature of human connection, and they knew that their journey had only just begun. <words>422</words>
As they left the orbital debris tracking station, the emissary felt a sense of gratitude for the accidental wisdom they had gained, and they knew that the stories hidden within the rustle of postcards on the fridge door would stay with them forever. <words>463</words>
The thin coathanger, now safely back in their possession, seemed to symbolize the fragile yet resilient nature of the connections they had observed, and the emissary smiled, feeling a sense of peace settle over them. <words>498</words>
