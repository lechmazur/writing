As a glamorous undertaker, I spent my days surrounded by the trappings of mortality, yet my spirit remained unbroken, buoyed by a jubilant remorse for the lives I'd touched <words>29>.
In the social network archive where I spent most of my time, scrolling through the digital legacy of the departed, I stumbled upon an obscure reference to a unique family tradition passed down from my great-grandmother, a skilled taxidermist <words>53>.
The tradition was to elongate the preparation process for the deceased, making it a labor of love rather than just a task, and it was this that drove me to preserve ancient practices in a world that seemed to value speed over reverence <words>83>.
To achieve this, I employed a brass measuring tape, an heirloom passed down through generations of my family, to meticulously measure every aspect of the deceased's final resting place <words>109>.
My fruitlessly patient nature allowed me to spend hours, even days, ensuring that every detail was just so, a trait that often left my clients bewildered but ultimately grateful <words>134>.
During paint mixing, a task that others might find mundane, I found solace in the ritual, the swirling colors a reminder of the myth of ordinariness, the idea that even in death, there is beauty to be found <words>162>.
As I mixed the paint, I couldn't help but think of my great-grandmother, and the countless hours she spent preparing the deceased for their final rest, her patience and dedication a testament to the power of tradition <words>194>.
The archive, once a cold and soulless repository of digital memories, was now a treasure trove of stories and histories, each one a reminder of the lives that had been lived and lost <words>223>.
And so, I continued to work, my brass measuring tape at the ready, as I elongated the preparation process, defying the conventions of a world that seemed to value haste over heritage <words>252>.
In doing so, I felt a deep sense of connection to my ancestors, and to the ancient practices that had been passed down through our family, a sense of continuity that was both comforting and exhilarating <words>286>.
As the paint mixed to a perfect shade, I felt a sense of pride and purpose, knowing that I was preserving a tradition that would otherwise be lost to the sands of time <words>315>.
And when the task was complete, I stepped back to admire my handiwork, the final result a testament to the power of tradition and the myth of ordinariness, a reminder that even in death, there is beauty to be found <words>346>.
In that moment, I knew that I had done justice to my great-grandmother's memory, and to the countless others who had come before me, their stories and traditions now a part of me <words>376>.
