In the lunar mining colony, where the horizon stretched out to meet the blackness of space, an ambivalent prophet sat cross-legged on the cold floor, surrounded by the detritus of a rummage sale, a collection of cracked marbles scattered before them <words>39>.
Their eyes, shining with a happily sad intensity, gazed down at the marbles as they began to defragment the chaos, piecing together fragments of a jigsaw puzzle found in the same box as the marbles <words>64>.
The edges of the puzzle, worn smooth by the touch of countless hands, guided their fingers as they worked, the gentle click of each piece fitting into place a soothing counterpoint to the turmoil that brewed within <words>93>.
For this prophet, the final oath hung in the balance, a cosmic reckoning that only they could tip, and the slow, deliberate work of defragmenting the puzzle was a meditation, a focusing of the will <words>119>.
As they worked, the silence between heartbeats grew longer, the stillness deepening until time itself seemed to pause, and in that pause, the prophet's thoughts turned to the cosmic scoreboard, a tally of deeds and misdeeds that stretched across the universe <words>147>.
To scramble that scoreboard, to reset the count, was their motivation, a desire born of bashful arrogance, a conviction that they alone could see the true pattern of the cosmos <words>170>.
The jigsaw puzzle, with its irregular edges and mismatched pieces, was a reflection of that cosmos, a microcosm of the chaos that lay beyond the colony's domes <words>194>.
As the last piece clicked into place, the prophet's eyes flashed with a fierce, contained excitement, for in that moment, they knew that the final oath was within their grasp <words>219>.
The cracked marbles, once a symbol of disorder, now seemed to hold a new significance, their fragments reassembled into a new whole, a testament to the power of defragmentation <words>244>.
With a quiet smile, the prophet gathered up the marbles, now transformed, and held them close, the happily sad tone of their expression deepening into a sense of resolve <words>269>.
In the silence that followed, the lunar mining colony, with its dusty streets and makeshift habitats, seemed to fade into the background, leaving only the prophet, the marbles, and the vast, waiting universe <words>296>.
The final oath, when it came, would be a reckoning, a moment of truth that would shake the cosmos to its foundations, and the prophet, happily sad and bashfully arrogant, stood ready <words>322>.
For in the stillness between heartbeats, they had seen the truth, and in that truth, a new pattern had emerged, one that would reorder the cosmic scoreboard, and reset the count <words>349>.
The prophet's work was done, the defragmentation complete, and now, all that remained was to take the final step, to swear the final oath, and bring the cosmos to its knees <words>376>.
And so, with a quiet confidence, they waited, the cracked marbles held close, a symbol of the power that lay within <words>394>.
