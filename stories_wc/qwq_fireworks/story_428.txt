Okay, let's tackle this story request. The user wants a 550-620 word story that includes all the given elements. First, I need to make sure every element is incorporated seamlessly. The character is a city planner turned doomsday prepper. That's an interesting contrast—someone who planned cities but now prepares for the end of the world. The object is an antique ink blotter. Hmm, how does that fit in? Maybe it's a family heirloom or a tool he uses. The core concept is escaping self-imposed chains. So the character is trying to free himself from some mental or emotional constraints.

The attribute is "rarely authentic." That could mean the character isn't genuine, maybe he pretends to be someone he's not. The action is "debase," which means to lower in dignity or quality. The method is "by studying broken constellations." So perhaps he's using astronomy or some celestial patterns that are fragmented. The setting is an ancient Indian temple. That gives a specific location with cultural and historical significance. The timeframe is "at the second a handshake seals a hidden deal." A crucial moment where a deal is made secretly. The motivation is to "banish doubt with unyielding will." The character wants to eliminate self-doubt through sheer determination. The tone is "daring caution"—so the story should have a sense of boldness but also carefulness.

I need to weave all these elements into a coherent narrative. Let's start with the city planner turning into a doomsday prepper. Maybe he's disillusioned with city planning, feeling like his work is futile, so he turned to prepping. The ink blotter could be a symbol of his past life as a planner, perhaps something his father used. The broken constellations might be part of the temple's carvings, which he studies to find a way to break free from his doubts. The hidden deal at the temple could involve a transaction where he trades something, maybe the ink blotter, to a shadowy figure to gain knowledge or power.

The tone of daring caution means the protagonist takes risks but is careful. The attribute "rarely authentic" suggests he's been putting on a facade, maybe in his prepper role or in his past. The act of debasing could relate to him lowering his previous self or others' perceptions. The temple setting allows for ancient secrets and a mystical element. The motivation to banish doubt ties into his core concept of escaping self-imposed chains. 

Now, structuring the plot: The prepper goes to the temple to find the constellations, uses the ink blotter as a tool or key. The hidden deal happens when he meets someone there, perhaps a dealer in ancient artifacts. The handshake seals the deal where he exchanges the blotter for information. His journey is both physical (exploring the temple) and internal (facing his doubts). The climax is when he uses the constellations' knowledge to break free from his mental chains, symbolized by the ink blotter's role. The ending should show his transformation from someone full of doubt to someone resolute.

I need to ensure each element is integral. The ink blotter must be crucial to the plot, maybe revealing the constellations' secrets. The broken constellations could be a metaphor for his fractured self. The hidden deal's handshake at the exact moment adds tension. The setting's ancient Indian temple provides an exotic backdrop that ties into the constellations. The motivation drives his actions throughout. The tone is maintained through his cautious yet bold decisions.

Word count is crucial. I'll need to write concisely, making each sentence count. Check each element is included and that the story flows logically. Avoid any extra details that don't serve the core elements. Ensure the ending ties back to the core concept of escaping self-imposed chains, showing his success through the actions and elements provided.

<story>
The city planner turned doomsday prepper stood in the shadow of the ancient Indian temple, his breath visible in the cool dawn air. The ink blotter—a relic from his father’s desk, its surface cracked like a dried riverbed—burned in his pocket. <words>45</words>  
He had come to this forgotten ruin to study the broken constellations etched into the stone, their fractured lines whispering secrets he’d spent years decoding. <words>75</words>  
Doubt gnawed at him, as it always did. The kind of doubt that made him question every sandbag stacked, every ration counted, every plan meticulously drawn but never executed. <words>105</words>  
Today, he would debase that doubt. Not by erasing it, but by proving it irrelevant. <words>125</words>  

The temple’s entrance yawned open, its lintel carved with a constellation of scorpions and stars. He traced the symbols with the ink blotter, its surface absorbing the dust like a parched sponge. <words>165</words>  
Inside, the air hummed with the weight of centuries. Torches flickered, casting jagged shadows that mirrored the constellations above. He knelt, aligning the blotter’s cracks with the temple’s ceiling, its ink-stained grooves revealing hidden patterns. <words>215</words>  
A figure emerged from the dark—a dealer in ancient secrets, his hands stained with indigo ink. “You’ve brought the key,” the man said, nodding at the blotter. “But the price is higher now.” <words>260</words>  
They clasped hands, the deal struck in the heartbeat between breaths. The dealer pressed a tablet into his palm, its surface etched with a constellation split into seven shards. “The chains you wear are your own,” the dealer hissed. “Burn them, or let them burn you.” <words>315</words>  

The prepper fled into the temple’s labyrinth, the tablet glowing faintly. He’d rarely been authentic, trading blueprints for bunkers and city council meetings for survivalist forums. But here, in the dark, he felt a flicker of truth: his obsession with control was a cage. <words>380</words>  
The constellations on the tablet matched the temple’s ceiling, but inverted—a map of cracks, not stars. He placed the ink blotter over them, its grooves aligning perfectly. Light burst from the seams, illuminating a wall etched with a single phrase: *To escape, become the void that swallows doubt.* <words>450</words>  
He hesitated, the tablet’s heat searing his skin. To banish doubt, he’d have to destroy the symbols that once gave his life meaning. The ink blotter—a symbol of his father’s rigid planning—now held the power to unravel his own. <words>510</words>  
With a scream, he shattered the tablet against the wall. The ink blotter’s cracks flared, absorbing the fragments. The temple trembled, its constellations dissolving into ash. <words>555</words>  
When the light faded, the prepper stood alone, the ink blotter now smooth and unmarked. His hands shook, but his mind was still. The chains had been his insistence on certainty; now, he embraced the unknown. <words>600</words>  
Outside, the first light of dawn spilled over the ruins. He walked into it, the once-cracked blotter pressed to his chest—a blank slate, finally authentic. <words>620</words>
