Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a story that includes all the specified elements. First, I need to make sure I understand each element and how they can fit together. 

Starting with the character: a pleasant meddler. That's someone who's nice but likes to interfere in others' affairs. Maybe they have a reason to manipulate others in a way that's not harmful but still meddling. The attribute is openly manipulative, so their intentions are clear, but they might have a good reason.

The object is a pair of rusted ice skates. How does that fit? Maybe the skates are a clue or a symbol. The core concept is scattered seeds. Seeds could be literal or metaphorical, like information or symbols that need to be gathered. The action is to weaken, and the method is via the receding footprints of a nighttime beach wanderer. So, weakening someone or something through the footprints left by someone walking at night on a beach. 

Setting is an obsidian skyscraper. That's a dark, shiny building, maybe in a futuristic city? Timeframe is during the quiet shift before sunrise in a hospital ward. Wait, that's conflicting. The setting is a skyscraper, but the timeframe is in a hospital. Hmm, need to reconcile that. Maybe the obsidian skyscraper is part of the hospital? Or the hospital is in an obsidian skyscraper? That could work. The hospital is in a modern, sleek building made of obsidian-like material.

Motivation is to decode ancient symbols. The character is trying to figure out these symbols, maybe they're related to the scattered seeds. The tone is lucid confusion, so the story should have a clear narrative but with elements that are puzzling or surreal.

Let me start structuring. The pleasant meddler works in a hospital during the quiet hours. They find the rusted ice skates, which are part of the scattered seeds. The footprints on the beach (maybe in a dream or a memory) lead them to weaken something. The obsidian skyscraper could be the hospital itself, made of dark glass. The symbols they're decoding might be on the skates or related to the footprints. The meddler's manipulative nature could be them trying to get others to help without revealing their full intentions.

Wait, how do the footprints weaken something? Maybe the footprints are part of a ritual or a clue that, when followed, cause something to weaken. The meddler might be following these footprints left by someone at night, leading them to the ice skates and the symbols. The seeds could be the symbols themselves, scattered, needing to be collected. 

I need to ensure all elements are tightly integrated. The character's motivation is decoding symbols, so maybe the ice skates have symbols on them. The scattered seeds could be the symbols that are spread out, needing to be gathered. The meddler uses their manipulative nature to get information from others in the hospital, perhaps during the quiet shift when others are tired and more susceptible. The footprints might be part of a trail left by someone (the nighttime beach wanderer) that the meddler follows, leading them to the skates. The weakening action could be that following the footprints causes the obsidian skyscraper's structure to weaken, or maybe the meddler's own resolve as they uncover the truth.

The obsidian skyscraper as a hospital setting adds a cold, sleek environment contrasting with the rusted skates. The timeframe before sunrise gives a quiet, reflective mood. The tone of lucid confusion can come from the meddler piecing together clues that don't immediately make sense but have a logical flow once connected.

Now, structuring the plot. The meddler, let's name them Clara, works in the hospital at night. She notices something odd, maybe the ice skates left in an unusual place. She follows clues, manipulates colleagues to get information, deciphers symbols on the skates that point to the beach. The footprints there lead her to realize the building's foundation is weakening because the symbols, when decoded, reveal a hidden structure. The climax could be her figuring this out just before sunrise, preventing a collapse. 

Each element must fit: the meddler's manipulation (asking coworkers about the skates), the rusted skates as an object with symbols, scattered seeds as the symbols spread across the building, the footprints leading her to the beach (maybe a nearby beach, or a symbolic beach-like area in the building). The weakening could be the building's structure, and decoding the symbols stops it. The tone remains clear but with some mystery.

Need to check word count. The user wants 500-600 words. Each sentence needs a word count after. So I'll have to write the story, then after each sentence add the cumulative word count in tags. But first, the story must be enclosed in <story> tags, and all elements must be present. Let me draft the story step by step, ensuring each element is included naturally.

<story>
The obsidian skyscraper loomed over the city like a frozen monolith, its sleek surface reflecting the faint glow of pre-dawn. <words>46</words> Clara adjusted her scrubs, her pleasant smile a shield as she navigated the hospital’s quiet shift. <words>78</words> Her role as a nurse was a cover; her true mission was to decode the ancient symbols etched into the rusted ice skates she’d found tucked behind a supply closet. <words>119</words> The skates were a puzzle, their blades corroded but the symbols pristine—a language of scattered seeds, each character a fragment of a larger truth. <words>157</words> She’d manipulated her colleagues with charm and curiosity, extracting clues from their exhaustion. <words>185</words> “Ever seen these before?” she’d ask, her tone innocent but her intent openly manipulative. <words>213</words> No one suspected her obsession. <words>227</words>  

That night, the symbols led her to the rooftop. <words>254</words> Beneath a moonless sky, she traced their shapes in the air, the obsidian walls humming faintly. <words>287</words> A breeze carried salt, unnatural here—then she saw them: receding footprints in the gravel, leading toward the edge. <words>326</words> A nighttime beach wanderer? Impossible. Yet the tracks spiraled downward, as if someone had walked the building itself into the sea. <words>369</words> Clara followed, her steps deliberate, the skates clutched in her bag. <words>397</words>  

The footprints ended at a ventilation shaft. Inside, she found more symbols, fused with the skyscraper’s steel. <words>440</words> Each character aligned with the skates’ engravings, forming a key. <words>468</words> But the structure groaned—cracks spiderwebbed the walls. The building was weakening, its foundation eroded by time or something darker. <words>506</words> Clara realized the symbols weren’t just codes; they were warnings. The scattered seeds were fragments of a spell, meant to hold the obsidian edifice together. <words>549</words>  

She skated toward the core, the rusted blades biting into the steel floor. <words>581</words> The symbols guided her path, her breath syncing with the skyscraper’s labored pulse. <words>612</words> At the heart, a chamber glowed with ancient light. The final symbol awaited, incomplete. <words>643</words> Clara placed the skates on the floor, their rust mingling with the glyphs. The scattered seeds aligned, and the walls stilled. <words>678</words>  

Dawn crept over the horizon, painting the obsidian tower gold. <words>708</words> Clara smiled, her manipulation justified—she’d saved the building by bending its secrets to her will. <words>743</words> Yet the footprints lingered in her mind, a riddle unresolved. Who had walked the skyscraper’s skin, leaving trails to weaken it? <words>785</words> The answers were seeds, still scattered. <words>812</words>
