Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a story that combines all the given elements. First, I need to parse each element carefully. The character is an exorcist with stage fright—that's an interesting combination. The object is pressed wildflowers, which could symbolize something preserved or memories. The core concept is "inheritance of lies," so maybe the exorcist is dealing with family secrets. The attribute "never usual" suggests something unconventional. The action is "submerge," which could be literal or metaphorical. The method is the sound of a key turning in a lock, so that's a trigger for some event. The setting is orbital debris, which is a space setting, so maybe a space station or a spaceship. The timeframe is "amid toy assembly," so perhaps the story takes place while toys are being built, adding an unexpected element. The motivation is to "sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'," implying overcoming limitations. The tone is "defiant hush," so a quiet but determined atmosphere.

I need to integrate all these elements cohesively. Let's start with the setting: orbital debris. Maybe the exorcist is on a space station or a ship surrounded by debris. The timeframe is during toy assembly, so maybe the protagonist works in a toy factory in space? That's an unusual setting, fitting the "never usual" attribute. The pressed wildflowers could be a family heirloom, part of the "inheritance of lies." The exorcist's stage fright might stem from a past failure or family secret. The action "submerge" could relate to diving into the debris or a memory. The key turning in a lock could be a literal door opening, revealing something hidden. The motivation to sculpt possibility from ashes suggests overcoming fear, so the exorcist must confront their past to create something new.

Plot structure: Maybe the protagonist is assembling toys but is haunted by their exorcist past. The key sound triggers a memory or a problem with the orbital debris. The wildflowers might be a symbol from their family, which they realize were part of the lies. The climax could involve submerging into the debris to confront a demon or the truth, using the wildflowers as a tool. The resolution would be overcoming stage fright and the lies, creating new possibilities.

Characters: The exorcist (protagonist) has stage fright, so maybe they fear public failure, which ties to their exorcist duties. Their motivation is to change their fate, hence "sculpt possibility." The antagonist could be a demon tied to the inheritance of lies, perhaps from their family. The wildflowers might have been given by a parent who was also an exorcist, but hid their true role.

Setting details: The orbital debris could be a hazard outside the toy factory, which is in space. The assembly line of toys contrasts with the dark, dangerous environment outside. The sound of the key turning could be the airlock opening, letting debris in or triggering a memory.

Integration check: Each element must fit. The wildflowers as an object need to be tied to the inheritance. The key turning must be pivotal, maybe unlocking a secret room or a memory. Submerge could be physically entering debris or mentally diving into the past. The tone of defiant hush means quiet determination, so the protagonist works quietly but with resolve.

Possible plot flow: Start with the protagonist working on assembling toys in the orbital factory, hearing the key sound, which reminds them of their past. They find pressed flowers in their locker, leading to a flashback. The flowers were a gift from their parent, who lied about their true exorcist role. The protagonist's stage fright comes from a failed exorcism. Now, they must confront a demon in the debris (submerge into it), using the flowers as a tool. The key turning sound is the moment they decide to face it, leading to a resolution where they overcome their fear, sculpting new possibilities.

Need to ensure all elements are included and the word count is precise. Each sentence's word count must be tracked. Let me outline the scenes and check each element's placement. Make sure the tone is maintained throughout, with a quiet but defiant atmosphere. The ending should resolve the motivation and tie up the inheritance of lies.

<story>
The exorcist’s gloved fingers trembled over the toy’s mechanical heart, each click of the screwdriver echoing the sound of a key turning in a lock. <words>45</words> Around her, the orbital debris field glittered through the factory’s portholes—frozen shards of satellites and shuttles, a graveyard suspended in the defiant hush of space. <words>86</words> Amid the assembly line’s clatter, she pressed a wildflower between pages of her grandmother’s journal, its petals still vibrant after decades. <words>123</words> The flower, a lie she’d inherited: her grandmother had claimed it grew on a planet’s surface, but the family archive showed no such records. Only silence. <words>161</words> 

“You’re late,” snapped the supervisor, her voice static-rasped over the intercom. “The shipment to Mars docks in an hour.” <words>195</words> The exorcist nodded, her throat tight with the ghost of a stage where lights blinded and demons hissed. <words>228</words> She’d fled that life, trading incantations for toy assembly, but the debris field whispered. <words>257</words> Tonight, a new fragment had breached the hull—a jagged hunk of obsidian, humming with a familiar, hungry pulse. <words>292</words> 

At midnight, she submersed herself in the airlock, the key turning sound now a mantra in her ears. <words>329</words> The void swallowed her, cold and bright, as she gripped the obsidian shard. It burned, memories flooding: her grandmother’s hands, pressing flowers into her palms before whispering, “Never let them see you tremble.” <words>374</words> The lie crystallized—the wildflowers were talismans, not trinkets. Her family had always fought demons, using artifice to mask their battles. <words>415</words> 

The shard’s hum crescendoed. A shadow coiled around her ankle—leathery, insistent. The exorcist’s breath hitched, stage fright and terror colliding. <words>453</words> She fumbled the journal from her belt, its pressed flowers scattering like dying fire. One caught in the shard’s grip. “You think petals can save you?” the shadow hissed. <words>492</words> 

But the flower smoldered, a tiny sun. Her grandmother’s voice echoed: “A lie unspoken is a door left locked.” <words>529</words> The exorcist inhaled, the defiant hush now a roar inside her. She screamed the incantation, not into the void, but into the keyhole of her own fear. <words>565</words> The shadow recoiled as light erupted—not from the flower, but from her hands, raw and trembling and true. <words>600</words> 

Back in the factory, dawn’s first light glinted on the repaired hull. The supervisor found her at the assembly line, pressing a new wildflower into a toy’s chest compartment. <words>635</words> “Next shipment’s for a child who believes in monsters,” she said, voice steady. The flower, a lie no longer, pulsed with the quiet strength of inheritance redefined. <words>675</words>
