Okay, I need to create a story that includes all the given elements. Let me start by listing them out again to make sure I don't miss anything.

Character: sorrowful apothecary. So the main character is someone who makes medicines or potions, but they're feeling sorrow. Maybe they lost someone or something?

Object: plastic spoon. That's an unusual item in a fantasy setting. I should think how to incorporate it naturally. Maybe it's a family heirloom or part of a recipe?

Core Concept: family recipes. The apothecary probably has old recipes passed down through generations. Maybe they're trying to recreate something important.

Attribute: roughly refined. This could describe the fortress, the recipes, or the apothecary's skills. Maybe the fortress isn't perfectly built, or the recipes are not perfected yet.

Action: bifurcate. This means to divide into two. Perhaps splitting something, like a recipe or a path. The apothecary might need to split a substance or a decision.

Method: decoding dream catchers left behind. The apothecary uses dream catchers to find clues or instructions. They might be left by someone else, maybe family members.

Setting: exiled fortress floating above scorching deserts. The fortress is isolated, maybe abandoned. The desert below is harsh, contrasting with the fortress's environment.

Timeframe: final minute before a library shuts its doors. The story is timed, adding urgency. The apothecary must act quickly before the library closes.

Motivation: tempt an oracle to speak again. The oracle is silent, and the apothecary wants to make it speak. Maybe the oracle has important information or can help them.

Tone: painful joy. The story should mix sorrow and happiness. Maybe the apothecary finds something bittersweet, like a memory or a solution that brings both pain and hope.

Now, how to weave all these together. Let's start with the setting. The fortress is floating above a desert, exiled, so maybe it's a place of isolation. The apothecary is there, perhaps exiled too. The library is in the fortress, and it's about to close. The apothecary needs to act quickly.

The family recipes are crucial. Maybe the apothecary is trying to make a potion from an old recipe but needs the oracle's help. The plastic spoon is part of the recipe, an odd item that's significant. The dream catchers could hold clues to the recipe or how to activate the oracle.

The apothecary's sorrow might stem from a lost family member who left the dream catchers. Bifurcate could mean splitting the recipe into two parts or making a tough choice. The method of decoding the dream catchers involves deciphering symbols or messages to unlock the oracle.

Time is tight, so the final minute adds tension. The apothecary works frantically, using the spoon to mix ingredients from the recipe, decoding the dream catchers, and trying to get the oracle to speak. The painful joy comes from perhaps remembering the family member while achieving their goal, or the oracle's message brings both hope and sorrow.

Let me outline the plot:

1. Setting: Exiled fortress, library closing. Apothecary is in the library with a plastic spoon.
2. He's trying to decode dream catchers to find a family recipe.
3. The recipe requires something that needs the oracle to speak.
4. In the last minute, he mixes ingredients with the spoon, uses the decoded info to present to the oracle.
5. Oracle speaks, but the message is bittersweet (maybe about family loss but hope).
6. The fortress or situation changes, showing the outcome.

I need to ensure each element is included and fits naturally. The plastic spoon might be the only tool he has from his family, so it's sentimental. The dream catchers could have symbols that correspond to the recipe steps. The bifurcate action could be splitting the recipe into two parts or a literal division in the process.

Also, the tone of painful joy needs to come through. Maybe the apothecary is happy to reconnect with family through the recipe but sad because it reminds him of their absence. The oracle's message could offer a path forward but with sacrifice.

I need to check word count as I go. Each sentence should end with the current word count. Let me start drafting and track the words carefully.

<story>
The apothecary’s hands trembled as he clutched the plastic spoon, its jagged edge a relic of his mother’s kitchen. <words>37</words> The fortress groaned above the desert, its stone walls pocked with the scars of exile, while sandstorms clawed at its underbelly. <words>69</words> Inside the library, shadows lengthened; the final minute before closing coiled like a serpent around his throat. <words>97</words> On the desk lay three dream catchers, their webs tangled with threads of silver and ash, left behind by his father decades ago. <words>129</words> He needed their secrets to tempt the silent oracle in the tower—a being who’d once prophesied hope but now only echoed silence. <words>164</words>  

The spoon glinted as he scraped it against a cracked vial labeled *“Bifurcate the root, split the soul.”* His family’s recipes demanded precision, but grief had left his craft roughly refined. <words>211</words> He’d tried every method: burning the herbs, chanting the old tongue, even bribing the library’s ghosts with moth-eaten tomes. Nothing worked. <words>246</words> The dream catchers, though… their symbols mirrored the oracle’s cryptic glyphs. <words>269</words> If he could decode them, he might split the potion’s essence—*bifurcate* its power—and force the oracle to speak. <words>305</words>  

A page fluttered open, revealing his mother’s handwriting: *“The desert’s thirst mirrors the heart’s. Mix with what you’ve lost.”* <words>342</words> He poured sand from the fortress floor into a mortar, grinding it with the last of his father’s dried lilies. The spoon dragged through the mix, its plastic edge crumbling. <words>379</words> The dream catchers’ threads began to glow. Each knot unraveled into a phrase—*“Half to the earth, half to the sky.”* <words>414</words>  

He froze. The bifurcation wasn’t physical. It was choice: offer the potion to the oracle or keep it, clinging to the illusion of control. <words>451</words> The library’s lights dimmed; the clock ticked. His throat tightened. This was why he’d clung to the spoon—the only thing left of her except the recipes. <words>489</words>  

With a gasp, he split the mixture. One half he hurled into the floor’s fissure, the other he climbed the tower with, the spoon now a dagger in his fist. <words>525</words> The oracle’s chamber pulsed with starlight. Its voice, when it came, was his father’s: *“You’ve always known what to ask.”* <words>559</words> The apothecary’s laugh cracked like the spoon in his palm. Joy and sorrow fused—the oracle’s return meant the fortress would descend, ending exile. But the desert below? It would swallow their bones. <words>603</words>  

He pressed the spoon to his lips, tasting salt and sand, as dawn split the horizon. The library doors slammed shut behind him, and the fortress began to fall. <words>639</words>
