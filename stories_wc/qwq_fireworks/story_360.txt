Okay, let me tackle this query. The user wants a story that combines all the given elements. First, I need to list out each element to ensure none are missed. The character is a meek necromancer, so I need to make sure their personality comes through as shy or timid. The object is a fountain pen with a broken nib—maybe the pen has some magical properties? The core concept is "the tangled tapestry," which could symbolize interconnected destinies or a complex problem. The attribute "peculiarly sincere" might describe the necromancer's demeanor or the pen's effect. The action is "regain," so perhaps the necromancer is trying to regain something lost. The method is through light reflecting off a dew drop, which could be a key moment in the story. The setting is an underground goblin city, so the environment should feel subterranean and maybe a bit eerie. The timeframe is amid playground sounds, so there's a contrast between childlike sounds and the dark setting. The motivation is to decode a universal riddle, so the necromancer's goal is tied to solving something big. The tone should be mystic simplicity—so not overly complex but with a magical feel.

I need to weave all these elements into a cohesive story. Let's start with the setting. The underground city of goblins could have glowing fungi or crystals for light. The playground sounds might come from goblin children playing, which contrasts with the necromancer's serious quest. The meek necromancer might be overlooked, so using the broken nib pen could be a humble tool that's crucial. The tapestry concept could be a literal tapestry that's tangled, representing the riddle. The dew drop reflection might be the key to unraveling it. The motivation to decode the riddle could be to regain something, like a lost spell or knowledge. The sincerity could be the necromancer's genuine approach that others lack.

Plot structure: Maybe the necromancer enters the goblin city, uses the pen (even with the broken nib) to interact with the tapestry. The playground sounds distract but then the dew drop's reflection (from a crystal or mushroom) reveals the solution. The goblins might be curious but the necromancer's sincerity wins them over. The climax is decoding the riddle through the reflection, leading to regaining the lost knowledge. The tone should stay simple but mystical, focusing on the pen's role and the reflection moment.

Check for all elements: meek necromancer (check), fountain pen broken nib (check), tangled tapestry (core concept, check), peculiarly sincere (maybe the necromancer's trait, check), regain (the action, check), light on dew drop (method, check), underground goblins (setting, check), playground sounds (timeframe context, check), decode riddle (motivation, check), mystic simplicity (tone, check). Need to ensure each element is integral. Maybe the pen's broken nib is why the necromancer is meek—they can't perform big magic, so they use the simple method of light and dew. The goblin's playground sounds could be a time when the tapestry is accessible, or the light from their games creates the dew drop reflection. The sincerity makes others trust them, allowing access to the tapestry. The tangled tapestry is the universal riddle's physical form. The story's arc could be the necromancer's journey from meek to finding their unique strength through simplicity.

Now, structure the sentences with word counts after each. Start with the story tag. Each sentence ends with the cumulative word count. Need to stay within 500-600 words. Let me draft a sample opening:

"The meek necromancer shuffled through the labyrinthine tunnels of the underground goblin city, her peculiarly sincere gaze fixed on the flickering glow of bioluminescent fungi. <words>18</words>"

That's 18 words. Next sentence: "In one hand, she clutched a fountain pen with a broken nib—a relic from her failed attempts to resurrect forgotten spells. <words>41</words>"

Continuing, ensuring each element is integrated. Need to mention the playground sounds, the dew drop's reflection leading to decoding the riddle, and the method of using light. The ending should resolve the motivation, maybe the necromancer regains the knowledge, showing character development. Keep sentences flowing naturally, with each element tied to the plot. Check word counts as I go to stay within limits. Let's see if this approach works. Need to make sure every element is present and tightly woven without feeling forced. Also, maintain the mystic simplicity by avoiding overly complex language. Use the goblin setting to add atmosphere, the pen's broken nib as a symbol of the necromancer's limitations, and the dew drop as the pivotal moment. Alright, proceed step by step, ensuring each part aligns and the counts are accurate.

<story>
The meek necromancer shuffled through the labyrinthine tunnels of the underground goblin city, her peculiarly sincere gaze fixed on the flickering glow of bioluminescent fungi. <words>30</words>  
Her boots echoed faintly against the damp stone, while laughter and clatter from a nearby goblin playground seeped through the corridors—a dissonant backdrop to her solitary quest. <words>60</words>  
In one hand, she clutched a fountain pen with a broken nib—a relic from her failed attempts to resurrect forgotten spells. Its cracked tip now scraped parchment like a whisper, yet she carried it as a lifeline. <words>98</words>  
The riddle etched in her mind had haunted her for years: *“To unravel the tangled tapestry, seek the thread that light forgets.”* She needed to decode it, to regain the lost incantation that might save her dying sister aboveground. <words>145</words>  
A flicker of dew on a goblin’s discarded marble caught her eye. The orb, suspended mid-roll between two fungal pillars, refracted a shard of light into a prismatic smear. <words>180</words>  
Instinctively, she knelt, the pen trembling as she traced the dew drop’s reflection. The act felt ritualistic, almost childlike, yet the liquid surface shimmered with uncanny clarity. <words>217</words>  
Suddenly, the playground’s cacophony stilled. A goblin child stood before her, its furrowed brow matching her own. “You’re looking for the thread,” it said, voice like gravel and honey. <words>259</words>  
The necromancer nodded, her sincerity disarming the creature. “The tapestry’s knots are woven by lies,” the goblin continued, “but truth is the thread that bends light.” <words>302</words>  
A chill ran down her spine. The dew drop’s reflection now showed not just light, but a pattern—a geometric dance of shadows and glimmers that mirrored the riddle’s words. <words>342</words>  
With a shaky breath, she pressed the pen’s broken nib into the dew, its inkless tip absorbing the liquid. The drop burst, and the light fractalized into a thousand threads, each a strand of the tapestry’s design. <words>385</words>  
The goblin grinned, pointing deeper into the tunnels. “Follow where the light *doesn’t* go.” It vanished, leaving her alone with the sudden clarity. <words>423</words>  
She sprinted, the pen now glowing faintly as the dew’s magic coursed through it. Each turn revealed more threads, the tapestry’s image coalescing in her mind—a map of forgotten connections between life, death, and the spaces between. <words>469</words>  
At the city’s heart, she found a cavern veiled in perpetual twilight. The tangled tapestry hung there: a living weave of goblin histories, necromantic lore, and the faintest pulse of her sister’s fading breath. <words>513</words>  
The broken nib touched the tapestry’s center. Light flared, and the threads began to untangle, guided by the dew’s reflection in her pen. The riddle’s answer emerged—not in words, but in the way shadows and light intertwined, revealing the “thread” as the space between them. <words>563</words>  
As the tapestry unraveled, so too did her meekness. The pen, once broken, now wrote with the clarity of dawn. She chanted the regained incantation, its power surging through the goblin city’s veins—a bridge between life’s laughter and death’s silence. <words>605</words>
