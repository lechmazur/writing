Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a 500-600 word story that includes all the specified elements. First, I need to make sure I understand each element and how they can fit together cohesively.

Starting with the character: an underwater welder. That's an interesting profession. Maybe they work in a unique setting. The setting is a broken planetarium turned nightclub. That's a cool contrast between science and nightlife. The timeframe is where two timelines shouldn't meet, so time travel or parallel universes might be involved. 

The core concept is "moments of unraveling," which suggests something is falling apart, maybe the timeline or the character's situation. The attribute "patiently impatient" is a bit tricky. It means the character is waiting but eager, perhaps. The action is to pamper, which could be a way to relax or a ritual. The method is via glimpses in vintage store mirrors. So mirrors in the vintage store show glimpses of something? Maybe visions or alternate timelines?

The object is a vintage button box. Maybe the buttons have some significance, like activating something or connecting to the mirrors. The motivation is to wield improbable power, so the character wants power but through an unconventional method. The tone is inherited mystery, so there's a family secret or legacy involved.

I need to weave all these elements into a story that makes sense. Let me outline a possible plot. The underwater welder works in the broken planetarium nightclub. They find a vintage button box in a store with mirrors that show glimpses of another timeline. The buttons might be part of a device to control or merge timelines. The character is patiently waiting but eager to use the power, maybe to fix their timeline or prevent disaster. The mirrors show the other timeline, and pressing the buttons could have unintended consequences. The mystery comes from the inherited aspect—maybe the box was passed down, and they uncover family secrets through the mirrors.

Now, ensuring each element is tightly integrated. The planetarium as a nightclub gives an atmospheric setting with a mix of old technology and nightlife. The mirrors in the store could be part of the planetarium's remnants. The buttons on the box might correspond to the mirrors, each press showing a different glimpse. The timeline crossing is where the two universes intersect, perhaps at a specific location in the planetarium. The character's motivation to gain power drives their actions, but their patience is tested as they try to figure out how to use the buttons without causing chaos. The inherited mystery could involve a family member who left the box, hinting at past attempts to control timelines.

I need to check the word count. Each sentence must end with the current total words. Let's draft the story step by step, counting words as I go. Start with the setting, introduce the character, their job, the discovery of the button box, the mirrors showing glimpses, the motivation, the conflict between patience and impatience, and the resolution where using the buttons either merges the timelines or causes unraveling.

Wait, the timeframe is "at the crossing where two timelines should never meet," so maybe the planetarium is the nexus. The mirrors in the vintage store (inside the nightclub?) allow seeing the other timeline. The buttons, when pressed, can influence the timelines. The character wants to wield power by controlling this, but must do so patiently, perhaps methodically testing each button, but is impatient to see results.

Potential plot points: The welder works nights at the club, finds the button box in an old mirror shop within the planetarium. Each button press shows a different moment from the other timeline. They discover that pressing all buttons at once could merge the timelines, but it's risky. The inherited aspect might mean their ancestor left clues in the box or the mirrors. The mystery deepens as they uncover family history tied to the planetarium's creation. The climax is deciding to press all buttons, leading to unraveling but perhaps a new equilibrium.

I need to ensure each element is present and integrated. Let me start writing the first sentences, keeping track of word count after each.

<story>
The underwater welder, Mara, adjusted her goggles in the dim glow of the planetarium’s shattered dome, now a pulsing nightclub where neon vines crept over cracked star maps. <words>65</words> Her boots echoed on the floor, once polished marble, now sticky with spilled cocktails. She’d been hired to mend the building’s fractured steel ribs, but the job felt like stitching a wound that kept reopening. <words>127</words>  

The vintage button box sat tucked behind the bar, its brass edges tarnished. Mara had found it days ago, nestled between a shattered orrery and a mirror etched with constellations. <words>183</words> Its buttons—ivory, black, mother-of-pearl—seemed to hum faintly. Her grandmother had warned her about such things: “Some relics aren’t meant to be pried open.” But Mara was patiently impatient, her fingers itching to press them all at once. <words>244</words>  

Each night, after welding, she’d slip into the abandoned gift shop. The mirrors there flickered with glimpses: a version of the planetarium intact, its dome whole, its stars blazing. <words>297</words> In those visions, she saw herself younger, laughing in a timeline where the world hadn’t fractured. The mirrors didn’t show the how, only the what. She needed power to bridge the gap, improbable as it was. <words>348</words>  

On the third night, she pried open the box. Inside lay a note: “To wield, you must pamper.” Beneath it, a vial of oil and a cloth. Mara hesitated—pamper what? The buttons? The mirrors? <words>404</words> She dipped the cloth in the oil and wiped the first button. The mirror behind the bar shuddered. A face appeared, not hers but someone’s—a man in a 1930s suit, pointing at the box. “Don’t,” he mouthed. <words>460</words>  

The mirrors now showed fragments of timelines colliding: dancers in the club morphing into astronomers, a comet streaking through strobe lights. Mara’s patience frayed. She oiled the second button. The man reappeared, this time smiling. “You’ll unravel it all, but unraveling is the only way to mend.” <words>522</words>  

At the crossing—midnight, when the nightclub’s bass throbbed and the planetarium’s original clock tower struck zero—Mara lined up the buttons. Her hands trembled. To press them all would force the timelines to merge, to either destroy or rebirth the world. <words>579</words>  

She closed her eyes, the oil slick under her nails, and pressed. The mirrors screamed. The dome shattered outward, not inward, and stars poured in—not light, but liquid constellations that pooled on the floor, then seeped into cracks. The nightclub stilled. <words>637</words>  

When Mara opened her eyes, the planetarium was whole again, its dome a seamless sky. But in the corner, the vintage button box waited, empty except for a single pearl button. Her grandmother’s voice whispered in her mind: “Now you know why some mysteries are inherited.” <words>697</words>
