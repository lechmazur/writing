Okay, let's tackle this story request. The user wants a 550-620 word story that incorporates all the given elements. First, I need to make sure each element is not just mentioned but integrated tightly into the narrative. Let's start by listing all the elements again to ensure nothing is missed.

Character: meandering bard. So the main character is a bard who wanders, perhaps not focused or maybe a bit lost in their path. 

Object: dentures rumored to belong to a famous figure. These dentures are key, so they must have some significance, maybe a symbol or a tool in the story.

Core Concept: radiating warmth. The story should have elements that emit warmth, perhaps emotional or literal. Maybe the bard's actions or the dentures themselves give off warmth.

Attribute: ordinarily extraordinary. The ordinary becomes special here. The bard's actions or the dentures have an extra layer of significance beyond the obvious.

Action: sow. The bard is planting something, perhaps seeds of change or ideas.

Method: through subversive puppet shows in seedy bars. The bard uses puppet shows in bars that are not the nicest places. Subversive implies they're challenging norms or spreading a hidden message.

Setting: labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain. The setting is a bookstore inside a mountain, with a maze-like structure. This can add to the atmosphere and maybe the journey of the bard.

Timeframe: during the lull before an apologetic text is sent. The story happens in the quiet moment before someone sends an apology message. This could tie into the bard's personal motivation or the story's climax.

Motivation: to stir hearts grown cold. The bard wants to rekindle emotions in people who've become emotionally numb.

Tone: fractured idyll. A mix of beauty and brokenness, maybe a nostalgic yet imperfect setting.

Alright, let's start structuring. The bard is in a mountain bookstore, which is a labyrinth. They use puppet shows in seedy bars to sow something (maybe hope or warmth) using the dentures. The dentures could be a prop in the puppet shows, adding a legendary aspect. The timeframe is during the lull before an apology text, so maybe the bard is reflecting on their own relationships while doing this.

The core concept of radiating warmth can be tied to the dentures, perhaps they emit heat or have a magical property. The extraordinary in the ordinary: the dentures are just old, but their origin makes them special. The method of puppet shows in bars is subversive because the bard is using art in unexpected places to reach people.

The motivation to stir cold hearts means the bard's actions are meant to evoke emotion. The fractured idyll tone would come from the contrast between the bookstore's beauty and the seedy bars, the bard's journey, and the mixed emotions.

Now, the plot structure: maybe the bard discovers the dentures in the bookstore, realizes their power, and uses them in puppet shows to spread warmth. The climax could be during the lull before sending an apology, where the bard confronts their own coldness and uses the dentures in a pivotal show, leading to a resolution where hearts are stirred.

Character development: The bard starts meandering, perhaps feeling ineffective, but through using the dentures and puppet shows, they find purpose. The dentures symbolize the famous figure's legacy, giving the bard motivation.

Need to ensure all elements are seamlessly integrated. Let's draft the first sentences, making sure each element is introduced naturally. The word count must be precise, so I'll need to track each sentence's length and adjust as needed. Also, after each sentence, include the current word count in <words> tags. Let's start writing.

<story>
The meandering bard, Corwin, had spent years wandering the labyrinthine bookstore inside Mount Veyra, its shelves bending like rib bones around forgotten tomes. <words>64</words> His lute strings frayed from stories half-told, he’d settled into a routine of trading ballads for stale rye bread and the occasional copper from patrons who mistook him for a statue. <words>127</words> But tonight, as the first frost gnawed at the mountain’s edges, he’d found the dentures—a set of porcelain teeth tucked between pages of *The Ballad of the Ice King*—their curve still warm to the touch, as if the ghost of the tyrant poet who’d worn them lingered. <words>218</words> Corwin’s fingers trembled. Legends said the teeth hummed with the power to “radiate warmth,” a phrase he’d always dismissed as metaphor. <words>271</words> Now, gripping them, he felt a faint heat, like sunlight through stained glass. <words>294</words>  

He decided to sow rebellion. <words>317</words>  

The seedy bars of the lower shelves were his first stops. <words>342</words> Patrons slumped over ale, their laughter sharp as broken glass, had no idea what hit them when Corwin’s puppets—carved from splintered book spines—began to dance. <words>413</words> The Ice King’s dentures clacked rhythmically in his pocket, their warmth seeping into his palms, fueling tales of lovers who’d defied frost-kings, of poets who’d burned their own verses to light dark alleys. <words>491</words> His shows were subversive, yes, but also tender: a thief returning a stolen locket, a widow planting flowers where her husband’s sword once stood. <words>543</words>  

One audience member always lingered—a woman in a moth-eaten coat, her eyes the color of unreadable manuscripts. <words>589</words> Corwin recognized her: the librarian who’d scowled at him for years, her heart a vault sealed with rust. <words>624</words> He’d never noticed her trembling hands until tonight. <words>643</words>  

The lull before an apologetic text hung heavy in his pocket. <words>675</words> He’d meant to send it hours ago—to his sister, maybe, or the girl who’d left him by the frozen river—but the dentures’ warmth made the words stick. <words>732</words> Instead, he wove a puppet show about a bard who couldn’t apologize, whose songs grew colder with every unsent message. <words>788</words> The librarian wiped her eyes. <words>809</words>  

On the seventh night, she found him in the Children’s Wing, where paper dragons slept in towers of nursery rhymes. <words>866</words> “You’re using his teeth to steal his legacy,” she hissed, but her voice wobbled like a child’s. <words>919</words> Corwin held out the dentures, now glowing faintly, and let them clatter to the floor. <words>960</words> “Legacies are seeds,” he said. “They only grow when you plant them in living soil.” <words>1008</words>  

She knelt, brushing frost from the dentures’ edges. <words>1037</words> “The Ice King’s last poem was an apology,” she murmured. <words>1068</words> Corwin’s breath caught. The words in his pocket suddenly felt lighter. <words>1105</words>  

When dawn split the mountain’s peak, he sent the text: *“I’m sorry. Let’s thaw this together.”* <words>1157</words> The librarian was already at his side, her coat pockets bulging with puppet strings and denture paste. <words>1196</words> They’d start a new show tonight, she said, one that didn’t need famous teeth to stir hearts. <words>1241</words>  

The mountain sighed, its labyrinthine shelves rearranging, as warmth seeped into the fractured idyll. <words>1289</words>
