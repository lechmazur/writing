Okay, I need to create a story that includes all these elements. Let me start by listing them again to make sure I don't miss anything. The character is a phobia-ridden stunt double. The object is a basic envelope. The core concept is echoes in the dark. The attribute is mundanely spiritual. The action is triumph. The method is unraveling knots in a centuries-old fisherman’s net. The setting is a forgotten library inside a pyramid. The timeframe is throughout garage sales. The motivation is to dance on the edge of madness. The tone is numb fascination.

Hmm, starting with the setting: a forgotten library inside a pyramid. That's an interesting mix. Maybe the pyramid is an ancient structure, and the library is hidden, filled with old books or artifacts. The stunt double's phobia could be something like claustrophobia or fear of the dark, which ties into the "echoes in the dark" concept. The envelope might hold a key or a map leading to the library. The fisherman's net with knots could be an ancient puzzle that needs solving. 

The timeframe mentions garage sales, so maybe the character collects items from garage sales, which leads them to the envelope or the net. The motivation to "dance on the edge of madness" suggests the character is pushing their limits, perhaps through their phobias. The method of unraveling knots could be part of a ritual or solving a riddle in the library. 

The attribute "mundanely spiritual" means that ordinary things have a spiritual significance. The envelope and net are mundane objects with deeper meanings. The tone is numb fascination, so the character might be detached but deeply interested in their quest. 

Plot structure: The stunt double, driven by their need to confront fears (phobia-ridden), uses items from garage sales to find the library. The envelope contains a clue leading them there. Inside the pyramid's library, they find the fisherman's net, which has symbolic knots. Unraveling them might unlock something, allowing triumph over their fears. The echoes in the dark could be voices or memories from the past, guiding or haunting them. 

Character development: The stunt double's job involves taking risks, but their phobias hold them back. The journey into the library forces them to face fears. The net's knots represent their internal struggles. Triumph comes when they overcome their phobias, achieving their motivation to dance on the edge of madness without falling in. 

Need to ensure all elements are tightly integrated. The garage sales are where they collect the envelope and maybe parts of the net. The library in the pyramid is the setting where everything converges. The "mundanely spiritual" aspect comes from ordinary objects having deep meaning. The tone of numb fascination means the character is emotionally detached but driven by curiosity. 

Let me outline the story flow: 

1. Introduce the stunt double's phobias and their job. 
2. They frequent garage sales, collecting items, leading to finding the envelope. 
3. The envelope's clue directs them to the pyramid's library. 
4. Entering the library, they face the dark and echoes, their phobia kicks in. 
5. They find the old net, start unraveling knots, each knot representing a fear or memory. 
6. As they unravel, they confront their fears (madness edge), leading to triumph. 
7. Resolution: They overcome, maybe the library's secrets are unlocked, or they find inner peace.

Check word count: Need to keep it between 500-600. Each sentence with word count. Let me draft sentences and track.

First sentence: "Marla had always been afraid of the dark, a phobia that made her stunt work both thrilling and torturous." Words: 21. 

Next: "As a stunt double, she leapt from burning buildings and plunged from helicopters, yet the silence of unlit spaces tightened her throat like a noose." Words added: 32. Total 53.

Then: "Her latest garage sale find—a basic envelope, brittle with age—had led her here, to the forgotten library inside a pyramid buried beneath the dunes of a nameless desert." Words added: 37. Total 90.

"Inside, the air hummed with echoes in the dark, voices whispering through stone corridors that spiraled into nothingness." Words added: 28. Total 118.

She clutched the envelope, its mundanely spiritual presence unsettling her. The object felt both ordinary and sacred, a paradox that mirrored her own fractured psyche. (42 words. Total 160)

The library's shelves groaned under the weight of leather-bound tomes, but it was a tattered fisherman’s net hanging from a beam that arrested her attention. (34. Total 194)

Its knots, centuries-old and blackened with time, formed a labyrinth of secrets. Marla’s fingers trembled as she reached for it, the net’s fibers cold against her skin. (36. Total 230)

Unraveling the first knot triggered a memory: her childhood fear of the ocean, of being lost beneath waves. The second knot unraveled a fear of failure, of being replaced in her career. (41. Total 271)

Each strand untied peeled back another layer of her psyche, the echoes growing louder, more insistent. (23. Total 294)

The net’s unraveling demanded she confront the edge of madness she’d danced upon all her life. (22. Total 316)

When she freed the final knot, the pyramid shuddered. Light flooded the chamber, revealing hieroglyphs that glowed in the envelope’s faint luminescence. (42. Total 358)

The text spoke of a symbiosis between fear and triumph, how the darkest echoes held the seeds of courage. (30. Total 388)

Marla laughed, a sound both hollow and free. Her phobias hadn’t vanished, but they’d become part of her rhythm, like the pulse of a stunt performer mid-leap. (42. Total 430)

She stepped into the light, the envelope crumpling in her hand as the net disintegrated into dust. The pyramid’s whispers faded, leaving only the echo of her own breath. (45. Total 475)

Back in the desert, Marla felt the numb fascination give way to something warmer—a connection to the countless souls who’d sought answers in mundane objects and dark spaces. (48. Total 523)

The stunt double drove home at dawn, the envelope’s secret now part of her, a quiet triumph in the dance between madness and mastery. (33. Total 556)

Wait, that's 556. Need to add more to reach 500-600. Let me check where to expand.

Maybe add more on the process of unraveling knots, the setting details, internal thoughts. 

After the second knot: "Each strand untied peeled back another layer of her psyche, the echoes growing louder, more insistent. The third knot, frayed and stubborn, unveiled her terror of the dark itself—a primal fear that had haunted her since childhood. Her breath hitched, but she persisted, driven by the need to understand the whispers." (Add 30 words. Total 304 + 30 = 334?)

Wait, maybe better to insert a paragraph about the setting. Let me rework some sentences. 

Alternatively, in the pyramid scene: 

Inside, the air hummed with echoes in the dark, voices whispering through stone corridors that spiraled into nothingness. The walls were covered in faded murals depicting ancient rituals, fisherman figures entwined with nets. (Adding 17 words. Total would go up.)

Hmm, perhaps during the unraveling process, more description of the knots and their effects. Let me adjust the existing sentences for more depth without exceeding word count. Maybe split some sentences.

Alternatively, end with more reflection. 

Final sentences: "The stunt double drove home at dawn, the envelope’s secret now part of her, a quiet triumph in the dance between madness and mastery. She knew the echoes would return, but now she faced them with a new rhythm—a stunt performer’s embrace of the edge, where fear and faith intertwined." (Adding 26 words, total 556+26=582. Close enough.)

I need to ensure all elements are there. Let me check each element:

- Phobia-ridden stunt double: Check, Marla has fear of dark, works as stunt double.

- Basic envelope: Found at garage sale, leads to pyramid, holds hieroglyphs.

- Echoes in the dark: The whispers in the library, the voices.

- Mundanely spiritual: The envelope and net are ordinary but have spiritual significance.

- Triumph: She overcomes her fears, achieves triumph.

- Method: Unraveling knots in the net, each knot representing a fear.

- Setting: Forgotten library in pyramid.

- Timeframe: Throughout garage sales (she collects items, including envelope from garage sales).

- Motivation: To dance on the edge of madness, which she does by confronting fears.

- Tone: Numb fascination described in her emotional state.

Yes, all elements are included. The plot structure has her going through the process, facing fears, resolving through the net's knots. The tone is maintained with her numb fascination turning into acceptance. 

I think this works. Let me put it all together with word counts after each sentence.
