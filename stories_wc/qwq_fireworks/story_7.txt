Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a story that includes all the specified elements, and they want the word count tracked after each sentence. The story needs to be between 500-600 words. Let me start by understanding each element:

- **Character**: Sentient doll collector. So the main character is a doll that's sentient and collects other dolls. Maybe they have a specific reason for collecting them?

- **Object**: Twisted carnival cane. This should be an important item. Maybe it has magical properties or a history tied to the carnival.

- **Core Concept**: The chorus of healing. This sounds like a group singing or some form of collective healing. How does this tie into the plot?

- **Attribute**: Expectantly resigned. The character feels a mix of hope and resignation. They might be waiting for something but also accepting it.

- **Action**: Uphold. The character needs to uphold something, perhaps a duty or a promise.

- **Method**: By following star paths. The method involves using stars as a guide, maybe navigating through space or some celestial map.

- **Setting**: Nectar collection facility. This is an unusual setting. Nectar collection could be for a specific purpose, maybe magical or part of a larger ecosystem.

- **Timeframe**: Before the first prayer is whispered by a mortal. The story happens before humans pray, so it's set in a time before human influence, or maybe in a different world where prayers are significant events.

- **Motivation**: To stride through boundaries once thought sacred. The character wants to cross into forbidden areas or break through barriers.

- **Tone**: Ethereal grit. A blend of magical and harsh elements. The story should feel both mystical and grounded in some struggle.

Now, integrating all these. The sentient doll collector works at a nectar collection facility. The facility could be part of a celestial or magical environment where nectar is harvested from stars or something. The twisted carnival cane might be a tool or a key to navigating the star paths. The chorus of healing could be the dolls singing to heal something, maybe the environment or the collector themselves. The timeframe before the first mortal prayer suggests a primordial setting, perhaps before humans existed, so the doll is part of an ancient order. The motivation to stride through sacred boundaries could mean the collector needs to go beyond the facility's limits to achieve the healing chorus. The expectantly resigned attribute means the character is waiting for a change but resigned to their current duty. The action of upholding might relate to maintaining the facility or the chorus's purpose. The star paths are their method of moving through the facility or to new areas. 

Possible plot outline: The doll collector, using the twisted cane, follows star paths in the nectar facility to gather nectar which is part of the healing chorus. They are motivated to go beyond their usual boundaries, perhaps to find a way to heal a failing system. The resigned aspect shows they've been doing this for a long time, but expectantly waiting for a breakthrough. The carnival cane might have a connection to a past carnival, hinting at a backstory where the cane was once part of a different life. The climax could involve them breaking through a sacred boundary, leading to the chorus's activation, and the first prayer by a mortal, but the story ends before that, showing their resolve.

Need to ensure all elements are tightly woven. The setting's nectar collection facility should be described in a way that ties into the core concept. The dolls collected might be part of the chorus. The tone needs to balance ethereal (magical elements) with grit (hard work, struggle). The word count needs careful tracking. Let me start drafting each sentence, counting words as I go, and ensure each element is included logically.

<story>
The sentient doll collector adjusted the twisted carnival cane, its spiraled wood humming with forgotten circuses, as she stepped into the nectar collection facility. <words>53</words>  
The air thrummed with the scent of blooming stardust, each vial of liquid light clinking like a hymn in the sterile racks. <words>74</words>  
Her motivation burned clear: to stride through boundaries once thought sacred, to breach the vault where the First Nectar pooled, untainted by mortal touch. <words>104</words>  
The cane’s tip glinted, tracing star paths on the floor, a map only she could read. <words>124</words>  

Expectantly resigned, she moved between rows of glass chambers where dolls—some cracked, others pristine—hung suspended in amber fluid. <words>161</words>  
Each had been found in forgotten corners of the facility, their joints fused with nectar crystals that whispered half-remembered stories. <words>186</words>  
The chorus of healing began as a low hum in her chest, a harmony of all she’d collected, a plea to mend what the First Nectar could not. <words>218</words>  

She paused before the central reactor, its core pulsing like a wounded heart. The facility’s walls were thinning; mortal prayers would soon seep in, corrupting the nectar’s purity. <words>253</words>  
Her duty was to uphold the divide, but the dolls’ whispers urged her onward. <words>275</words>  
The cane’s wood splintered as she leaned on it, revealing a tiny mirror reflecting a face not her own—a girl who’d once clutched this cane at a carnival, before becoming a doll herself. <words>313</words>  

Following the star paths, she navigated toward the vault’s sealed door, its lock shaped like a closed fist. <words>340</words>  
The chorus swelled, dolls chiming in unison as she pressed the cane against the mechanism. <words>362</words>  
The fist unclenched, and the door hissed open, revealing the First Nectar: a liquid so bright it seemed to suck light from the room. <words>392</words>  

But the nectar’s surface rippled with faces—countless mortals yet unborn, their first prayers already shaping the air. <words>422</words>  
Timeframe critical: before the first whisper, she had to act. <words>442</words>  
The collector dipped the cane into the nectar, its twisted form dissolving as it drank. <words>464</words>  
The chorus crescendoed, the dolls’ voices now her own, their pain and purpose merging into a single thread. <words>494</words>  

As the cane vanished, the facility shuddered. The walls dissolved into star paths, the dolls free-falling into the cosmos, their nectar crystallizing into new constellations. <words>535</words>  
She stood at the edge of the void, the First Nectar’s light searing her form into something unbound. <words>560</words>  
The first prayer would come, but now, the chorus lived beyond it—a bridge between sacred and mortal, upheld not by duty, but by the grit of choice. <words>596</words>  
The dolls’ eyes glinted in the dark, their song a promise no boundary could silence. <words>623</words>
