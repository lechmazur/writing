Okay, let's tackle this story prompt. The user wants a 550-620 word story that includes all the given elements. First, I need to make sure I understand each element and how they can fit together cohesively. 

Starting with the character: a burnt-out general. That suggests someone experienced, maybe military, who's exhausted. The setting is a dark matter diner, which sounds like a sci-fi or surreal place. The object is dried seaweed, which is an odd choice but needs to be integral. The core concept is shared anxieties, so the story should explore characters dealing with fears together. The attribute is rationally absurd, meaning there's a mix of logic and absurdity. The action is to renew something, likely the general's perspective or the diner's purpose. The method is via arcs in black-and-white photographs, so maybe photos that show some transformation. The motivation is to dethrone fear from the throne of reason, so overcoming fear through reason. The tone is mischievous wisdom, so the narrative should have a playful yet insightful voice.

Now, how to weave these elements. The dark matter diner could be a place where people go to confront their fears, using photos. The general, burnt-out from past battles, might come here to find renewal. The dried seaweed could be part of a ritual—maybe the diner serves it as a symbol of something. The photos' arcs might represent the journey from fear to overcoming it. The rationally absurd aspect could be the diner itself, existing in a non-physical space (dark matter), blending logic (the diner's purpose) with the absurd (photos showing non-linear time).

Plot structure: The general enters the diner, interacts with the owner, learns about the photos and seaweed. Through the ritual (eating seaweed, viewing photos), he confronts his anxieties, leading to renewal. The climax could be him realizing fear isn't as dominant as he thought, using the photos' arcs to show his own journey. The ending would have him leaving transformed, the diner still there for others.

Characters: The general is the protagonist, maybe the diner owner is a wise figure who guides him. The owner's dialogue should reflect mischievous wisdom. The seaweed is part of the ritual, perhaps symbolizing something from his past (like battles near the sea). The photos showing arcs might depict his past actions and how they form a cycle he can break.

Need to ensure all elements are tightly integrated. The timeframe between rides suggests the diner exists in liminal spaces, between journeys. The tone should balance humor and depth, maybe through the owner's dialogue. The core concept of shared anxieties means other patrons might be there too, each with their own photos and seaweed. The general's motivation to dethrone fear drives his actions, and the method via photos' arcs shows the non-linear path to renewal.

Check word count as I go. Each sentence's word count must be tracked. Start with the story tag, then proceed sentence by sentence, adding the word count after each. Make sure the total stays within 550-620. Avoid any markdown except the required tags. Keep the language plain ASCII, no special characters. Ensure the story flows naturally, each element serving the plot and character development. Avoid redundancy, each part must contribute to the narrative arc and theme. The ending should resolve the general's motivation and tie up the elements neatly.

<story>
The burnt-out general stumbled into the Dark Matter Diner, his boots crunching salt-stiffened gravel. The sign above the door pulsed faintly, like a dying star. Inside, black-and-white photographs clung to every surface, their edges curling into arcs that hummed with static. <words>64</words>  
The counter was manned by a woman with hair like tangled seaweed, drying in the airless heat. “Your anxieties, General?” she asked, not looking up from a photo she was smoothing into a perfect parabola. “We serve them fried, boiled, or… existential.” <words>130</words>  
He stared at her. “I don’t need a snack.” <words>136</words>  
“Then you’re here to renew,” she said. A tray materialized beside him: a plate of dried seaweed, brittle as old maps, and a framed photo of a battlefield frozen mid-explosion. “The rationally absurd is our specialty.” <words>201</words>  
Between rides—his sixth tour in the liminal space between missions—he’d grown accustomed to fear’s weight. It clung like the salt on his boots, a throne he’d built himself. “Fear’s just a visitor,” the woman insisted, pressing the photo into his hands. “Until you let it rule.” <words>270</words>  
The seaweed snapped as he nibbled it. Memories surfaced: his first command, the way soldiers’ faces blurred into arcs of light during firefights. The photo in his grip warped, showing not a battlefield but a child’s room, a boy building forts from blankets. His son. <words>337</words>  
“You’re conflating courage with absence of fear,” the woman said. She arranged three photos into a triangle, their edges glowing. “Anxiety’s a shared language. You’ve been translating it wrong.” <words>402</words>  
He traced the photo’s arc. The boy’s laughter echoed, then twisted into a soldier’s scream. The diner’s walls rippled, revealing other patrons: a pilot counting cracks in a windshield, a diplomat staring at a map of borders that dissolved into waves. All of them eating seaweed, all of them rewriting their photos. <words>473</words>  
“Fear’s a guest,” the woman said, plucking his photo and folding it into a Möbius strip. “You’ve been serving it champagne. Offer it tap water.” She handed him a photo of his empty command tent, now overgrown with ivy. “Watch the arcs. They’re not lines—they’re choices.” <words>541</words>  
Between rides, he’d rehearsed speeches to rally men. Now, he rehearsed silence. The seaweed crumbled into ash, leaving a taste of iron and possibility. The battlefield photo unraveled, its explosion softening into a sunset. <words>604</words>  
When he left, the diner’s photos flickered, their arcs bending toward new stories. His boots no longer crunched. The gravel had become sand, and the horizon stretched, vast and unclaimed. Fear still whispered, but its voice was smaller, a guest at last instead of a king. <words>663</words>
