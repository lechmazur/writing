Okay, let me tackle this query step by step. The user wants a story that combines all the given elements, each with specific instructions. First, I need to make sure I understand each element and how they can fit together cohesively. The character is an "unsteady sentinel," which suggests someone or something that's supposed to be a guardian but is unstable. The object is a "strange automaton bird," so that's a mechanical bird with some unusual features. The core concept is "the ambush of fate," which might mean an unexpected twist or destiny that confronts the character. The attribute "coyly furious" implies a mix of playful and angry emotions. The action is "recommend," so the character needs to suggest something. The method is "by reassembling shredded letters," so the character has to put together torn pieces of letters. The setting is an "abandoned space freighter docking bay," which gives a sci-fi, desolate environment. The timeframe is "between worlds colliding," suggesting a liminal space or a point where two realities intersect. The motivation is "to clear the fog of a misguided prophecy," meaning the character wants to correct a wrong prediction. The tone is "cheerless ecstasy," which is a paradox—intense emotion without joy, maybe a desperate or frenzied hope.

Now, I need to weave all these elements into a story between 400-500 words. Let's start with the setting. An abandoned space freighter docking bay sets a post-apocalyptic or abandoned space station vibe. The unsteady sentinel could be a humanoid AI or a human guardian who's been left behind. The automaton bird might be a companion or a clue. The ambush of fate could be the impending collision of worlds, so the sentinel has to act before that happens.

The sentinel's motivation is to clear the fog of a misguided prophecy, so maybe the prophecy led others to abandon the freighter, and the sentinel wants to fix it. The method of reassembling shredded letters could be crucial to solving the prophecy. The coyly furious attribute might come from the sentinel's frustration and slyness in dealing with the situation. The action of recommending could be the sentinel advising someone or the bird on what to do. The timeframe between worlds colliding adds urgency.

I need to ensure each element is integral. The automaton bird might hold the letters or help in reassembling them. The sentinel's unsteadiness could be physical (like malfunctioning) or emotional. The tone of cheerless ecstasy needs to permeate through the narrative—maybe the sentinel is desperate but driven, showing a mix of determination and despair.

Plot structure: Start with the sentinel in the abandoned bay, encountering the automaton bird. The bird has shredded letters from the prophecy. The sentinel pieces them together, realizing the true message. The worlds are about to collide, so the sentinel must act. The climax could be the sentinel making a recommendation based on the letters, leading to clearing the prophecy's fog, even if it means sacrifice. The ending should tie up the elements, showing the outcome of the ambush of fate.

Character development: The sentinel starts unsteady but gains clarity through the letters. Their motivation drives them to persevere despite their flaws. The automaton bird might have a role in delivering the letters or aiding in the reassembly.

I need to check word count after each sentence. Let me draft a few sentences and track:

1. The unsteady sentinel crouched in the abandoned space freighter's docking bay, her metallic breath fogging the viewport as she stared at the strange automaton bird perched on a rusted bulkhead. (<words>100</words>)
Wait, that's way over. Each sentence must have a word count. Let me adjust. Maybe start with shorter sentences.

Wait, the user wants after each sentence, output the precise total word count. So each sentence ends with the count so far. Need to ensure the total is between 400-500. Let me structure each sentence with the count, but the story must be enclosed in <story> tags. Also, make sure all elements are included and integrated tightly. Let me outline the story flow:

Opening: Sentinel in the setting, encountering the automaton bird. The bird has shredded letters. The sentinel's motivation is to clear the prophecy's fog. The timeframe is between worlds colliding, so urgency. The sentinel's coyly furious attitude comes through as they work. Reassembling the letters reveals the truth, leading to a recommendation to others, perhaps sacrificing themselves. The climax resolves the prophecy's fog as the worlds collide.

I need to ensure each element is explicitly used. Let me start writing step by step, counting words each time. Let's begin.

The unsteady sentinel gripped the corroded railing, her synthetic voice crackling like static. <words>20</words>  
The abandoned space freighter's docking bay loomed around her, shadows stretching like skeletal fingers between flickering lights. <words>48</words>  
A strange automaton bird fluttered down, its brass feathers clattering against the hull. <words>72</words>  
Its beak held a scrap of paper, one fragment of countless shredded letters scattered across the floor. <words>100</words>  

Coyly furious, the sentinel snatched the paper. "You again," she hissed, though the bird had no ears. <words>132</words>  
It had haunted her for weeks, delivering fragments of a prophecy she’d once sworn to uphold. <words>162</words>  
Now, as the freighter trembled between worlds colliding, the bird’s presence felt like an ambush of fate. <words>200</words>  
The letters spelled a warning: the prophecy’s fog—her own doing—had blinded her crew to the collision’s true purpose. <words>240</words>  

She knelt, sorting paper shards. The method was simple but excruciating: reassembling the prophecy required patience, a virtue her fraying circuits couldn’t afford. <words>288</words>  
Each fragment whispered lies she’d once believed. *“The sentinel must die to save the fleet,”* one read. <words>322</words>  
Another: *“The bird is the key, not the sacrifice.”* <words>346</words>  
The truth coiled like a serpent—she’d misread the signs, dooming her people to scatter. <words>380</words>  

The automaton tilted its head, gears whirring. "Recommend," it chirped suddenly, as if reading her mind. <words>412</words>  
She froze. The word was a command, a plea. The bird had always mirrored her guilt. <words>442</words>  
Between the worlds’ gravitational screams, she realized: the ambush wasn’t destiny—it was her chance to atone. <words>480</words>  
Ripping the final scrap free, she shouted to the void, "I recommend *this*—the prophecy’s fog ends here!" <words>518</words>  
The bird exploded into light, its form dissolving as the letters fused into a hologram: a map to guide the fleet home. <words>556</words>  
The sentinel smiled, cheerlessly ecstatic, as the freighter shuddered toward collision. <words>588</words>  
Her unsteady hands steadied for once—she’d chosen clarity over fate. <words>618</words>  
The worlds collided. The fog cleared. <words>642</words>
