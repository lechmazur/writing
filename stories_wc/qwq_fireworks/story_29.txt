Okay, I need to create a story that includes all the given elements. Let me start by listing them again to make sure I don't miss anything. The character is a hopeful knight, so I should develop that character with the attribute of being cleverly naive. The object is a stray jigsaw edge, which probably plays a key role. The core concept is reclaiming the lost, so the story should revolve around that theme. The action is to neutralize something by syncing with cryptic frequencies. The setting is a mystic orchard garden hidden in a hedge maze. The timeframe is during the hush of a streetlamp flickering out. The motivation is to sabotage a machine that cycles regrets. The tone needs to be agonizing bliss. 

First, I need to set the scene in the mystic orchard garden within a hedge maze. The knight, being hopeful and cleverly naive, might be on a quest. The stray jigsaw edge could be a crucial piece needed to stop the machine. The machine cycles regrets, so perhaps it's causing people to relive their regrets, and the knight wants to stop that. The method of syncing with cryptic frequencies suggests some magical or technical process the knight uses. 

Starting the story: The knight enters the maze at night when the streetlamp flickers out, creating that hush moment. The orchard garden is hidden, so maybe the knight finds it unexpectedly. The stray jigsaw edge is found there, which is part of a larger puzzle needed to neutralize the machine. The knight's naivety makes him believe he can fix things, but his cleverness helps him figure out the frequencies. 

I need to ensure each element is tightly woven. The jigsaw edge is a physical object that's part of the solution. The machine's purpose ties into the core concept of reclaiming the lost, perhaps the regrets are lost parts of people's lives. The cryptic frequencies might be a magical frequency that the knight has to align with to sabotage the machine. 

The tone of agonizing bliss could come from the knight's internal struggle—knowing the cost of his actions but still proceeding. Maybe the orchard has some beautiful yet painful elements, like glowing fruit that represents regrets. 

Plot structure: The knight enters the maze, finds the garden and the jigsaw edge, figures out how to use it with frequencies, confronts the machine, and sabotages it. Along the way, his naivety helps him see solutions others might miss, but his hope keeps him going. 

Character development: The knight starts hopeful and naive, learns through the journey, perhaps gains some wisdom but stays true to his hopeful nature. The motivation is clear—to stop the machine, but his personal drive is to reclaim what's lost, maybe for someone he cares about. 

I need to make sure the word count is between 500-600. Each sentence should end with the word count in tags. Let me start drafting and track the words carefully. 

First sentence: "Sir Alden stepped into the hedge maze as the last streetlamp guttered out, plunging the alley into a velvet silence. <words>15</words>" 

That's 15 words. Next sentence introduces the orchard. "The air thickened with the scent of blooming nightshade, and before him, the hedges parted to reveal a mystic orchard garden, its trees heavy with luminous fruit that pulsed like trapped stars. <words>43</words>"

Now, the knight's attribute: "Cleverly naive, he dismissed the whispers of danger and reached for a stray jigsaw edge嵌在根部的裂缝中, its jagged puzzle piece etched with symbols that hummed faintly. <words>71</words>"

Wait, need to check the exact elements. The object is a stray jigsaw edge. Maybe describe finding it there. 

"His fingers closed around a stray jigsaw edge嵌入在根部的裂缝中, its jagged edge etched with symbols that hummed faintly. <words>... perhaps better phrased. 

Proceeding, the knight's goal: "The machine that cycles regrets, he thought, recalling the villagers’ hollow eyes. It must be here, feeding on sorrow to power its endless rotation. <words>... something like that. 

Then the method: syncing with cryptic frequencies. Maybe the jigsaw edge is a key that allows him to tune into those frequencies. 

When he uses the edge, the frequencies become clear. He has to neutralize the machine by syncing with them. 

Conflict arises when he confronts the machine, maybe it's guarded or has traps. His naivety makes him brave but he uses cleverness to outsmart it. 

Ending: He succeeds, the machine stops, the orchard fades, and he feels both triumph and loss (agonizing bliss). 

Need to ensure all elements are present and the word count stays within limits. Let me structure each paragraph with sentences and track the words as I go. Also, make sure each element is addressed and integrated smoothly. Avoid forcing elements in unnaturally. The jigsaw edge should be integral, not just a prop. The frequencies might require him to align the edge's symbols with something in the garden. The orchard's setting enhances the mystic and eerie atmosphere. The timeframe's flickering lamp sets the scene's transition. 

Okay, time to write the full story, keeping sentences concise and elements tightly woven, checking each word count incrementally.

<story>
Sir Alden stepped into the hedge maze as the last streetlamp guttered out, plunging the alley into a velvet silence. <words>15</words> The air thickened with the scent of blooming nightshade, and before him, the hedges parted to reveal a mystic orchard garden, its trees heavy with luminous fruit that pulsed like trapped stars. <words>43</words> Cleverly naive, he dismissed the whispers of danger and reached for a stray jigsaw edge嵌入在根部的裂缝中, its jagged edge etched with symbols that hummed faintly. <words>71</words> “A clue,” he murmured, pressing the fragment to his chest. The machine that cycles regrets, he thought, recalling the villagers’ hollow eyes. It must be here, feeding on sorrow to power its endless rotation. <words>108</words> 

The orchard’s ground shifted beneath his boots, revealing a path paved with shattered mirrors reflecting not his face, but fragments of memories—his sister’s laughter, a childhood friend’s goodbye. <words>145</words> Agonizing bliss: the beauty of lost moments mingled with the ache of their absence. He tightened his grip on the jigsaw edge, its symbols now glowing in sync with the fruit’s pulse. <words>179</words> 

A low thrum resonated through the garden. The machine loomed ahead, a jagged spire of rusted gears and weeping pipes, its core a vortex of swirling regrets—voices of “what if?” and “too late” wove into its structure. <words>224</words> Sir Alden realized the edge was a key to a frequency only the hopeful could hear. The cryptic symbols aligned with the orchard’s pulse, creating a discordant harmony that made the machine shudder. <words>263</words> 

He thrust the fragment into a crack at the spire’s base. The orchard’s lights dimmed as the machine howled, its gears grinding in reverse. Regrets unraveled: a mother’s tear became a smile, a lost lover’s whisper turned to a vow. <words>304</words> But with each reclaimed memory, the garden’s beauty faded, the fruit dimming as if starved. Sir Alden felt the weight of the machine’s hunger—the cost of neutralizing it was the orchard’s life. <words>346</words> 

“Worth it,” he whispered, though his throat tightened. The last regret dissolved, and the spire collapsed into ash. The hedge maze reformed, swallowing the garden whole. <words>383</words> In his hand, the jigsaw edge’s symbols dissolved, leaving only a smooth edge—a reminder that reclaiming the lost required sacrifice. <words>413</words> 

As dawn’s first light seeped through the maze walls, Sir Alden walked onward, the ache of beauty and loss humming in his bones. The villagers would never know how the machine stopped, but he carried its lesson: hope was a blade that cut both ways. <words>455</words> 

Years later, travelers spoke of a knight who wandered hedge mazes, leaving stray jigsaw edges at the roots of nightshade trees. Some claimed the orchard bloomed again, its fruit singing of redemption. <words>494</words> Sir Alden never confirmed it. He merely smiled, knowing the truest magic was in the seeking—not the finding. <words>527</words> The hush of a streetlamp flickering out remained his anthem, a moment suspended between light and dark, where the lost could still be saved. <words>561</words> And in that hush, he heard the orchard’s pulse, faint but persistent, syncing with his heartbeat. <words>593</words>
