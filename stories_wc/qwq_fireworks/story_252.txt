Okay, the user wants a story that combines all the given elements. Let me start by listing them out again to make sure I don't miss any: penitent memory thief, simple wooden toy block, crack in reality, lovingly hateful, recalibrate, tracking flower petals, fruit preservation vault, hush as an empty swing set slows to a stop, restore ancient methods, icy warmth tone. The story needs to be between 550-620 words, with each sentence followed by the current word count in tags. 

First, I need to figure out how to integrate all these elements cohesively. The character is a penitent memory thief, so they must have a backstory involving stealing memories and now seeking penance. The core concept is a crack in reality, which could be a literal or metaphorical rift. The wooden toy block might be a key object tied to the memory theft or the crack. The attribute "lovingly hateful" suggests a conflicted emotion, perhaps the thief feels both love and hate for their actions.

The action is to recalibrate, which probably relates to fixing the crack. The method is tracking flower petals, so maybe the petals are a clue or a path. The setting is a fruit preservation vault, which is an unusual place. Maybe the vault is a hidden repository where the thief needs to go. The timeframe is the moment an empty swing set stops, which could symbolize a pause in time or a significant moment.

The motivation is to restore ancient methods, so maybe the thief is trying to fix a broken system by reviving old techniques. The tone needs to be icy warmth—contradictory, so a mix of cold and comforting elements.

Starting the story: Introduce the memory thief in the fruit preservation vault. Maybe they're there to retrieve something. The vault's environment should reflect the icy warmth—maybe cold storage with preserved fruits giving off a warm scent. The swing set could be part of the vault's setting, like a nostalgic element. The crack in reality might be visible here, causing instability.

The wooden block could be a tool or a key. The thief uses it to track flower petals that indicate the crack's path. The "lovingly hateful" aspect could be their internal struggle—hating their past actions but loving the idea of redemption. Recalibrating reality by restoring ancient methods might involve using the block to realign the crack, guided by the petals.

Plot structure: The thief enters the vault, notices the crack, uses the block and petals to navigate, confronts their past (swing set symbolizing childhood or a past mistake), and completes the recalibration. The swing set stopping could be the climax where the crack is fixed.

Character development: Show their penitence through actions—maybe they left the swing set as a symbol of their past. The motivation to restore ancient methods comes from realizing that modern methods (like memory theft) are flawed. The lovingly hateful emotion could be towards their mentor or themselves.

World-building: The fruit preservation vault is a place where time is preserved, hence the connection to memories. The crack in reality threatens this preservation, so the thief must fix it. The petals might be from flowers that only grow near the crack, guiding the thief.

Tone: Use descriptions that mix coldness (icy) with warmth (the preserved fruits' scent, the thief's hope). The atmosphere should be tense but with underlying hope.

Now, structuring the sentences. Start with the setting, introduce the thief's purpose, the block and petals as tools, the swing set's significance, the crack, and the resolution. Ensure each element is tightly woven. Check word counts after each sentence. Need to stay within 550-620. Let me draft each part step by step, counting words carefully. Make sure every element is included and the story flows logically.

<story>
The penitent memory thief stood in the fruit preservation vault, her breath fogging the air as she traced a finger over jars of plums and quince, their skins glistening under dim light. The vault’s chill bit her cheeks, but the scent of preserved sweetness warmed her lungs—icy warmth, a paradox she’d grown to crave. <words>88</words>  
Her mission was to recalibrate the crack in reality, a jagged fissure gnawing at the vault’s walls, its edges pulsing with stolen moments. She carried a simple wooden toy block, its edges smoothed by years of lovingly hateful hands—a gift from a child whose memories she’d once purloined. <words>163</words>  
The block glowed faintly when she pressed it to the crack, guiding her to follow flower petals scattered like breadcrumbs. Each petal bore a faint imprint of a swing set’s arc, its empty chains whispering of pauses between motion. The timeframe—the hush as the swing stilled—was when the rift weakened enough to mend. <words>244</words>  
She’d become a thief to erase pain, but now she sought to restore ancient methods, believing only forgotten techniques could seal the tear. The vault, a relic of pre-industrial preservation, held answers in its archives of pickled time. <words>312</words>  
As she tracked petals deeper, the air thickened with the scent of blooming peonies, impossible in such a place. The block hummed, its grain shifting to reveal a tiny swing etched inside. The thief’s throat tightened; she’d taken the child’s memory of playing there, a lovingly hateful act meant to spare them sorrow. Now guilt drove her to atone. <words>401</words>  
The crack widened, spilling fragments of forgotten summers—a girl’s laughter, a mother’s lullaby. The thief pressed the block to the breach, its wood splintering as petals swirled into a vortex. The swing set’s ghost materialized, its chains creaking in time with her heartbeat. <words>479</words>  
“Restore,” she whispered, not to the block, but to the child she’d wronged. The petals fused into a bridge of light, and the swing stilled completely, its pause a punctuation mark in time. The vault’s walls shuddered, reality realigning. <words>543</words>  
When silence fell, the thief knelt, gathering the last petal—a crimson bloom with the swing’s imprint. The block, now splintered, nestled in her palm, its purpose fulfilled. The vault’s shelves held no trace of the crack, only jars gleaming with renewed purpose. <words>607</words>  
She left the swing’s petal in a jar of apricots, a vow to honor memories instead of stealing them. The icy warmth lingered, a reminder that healing required both cold resolve and warmth’s embrace. <words>652</words>
