Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a story that combines all the given elements. First, I need to make sure I understand each element and how they can fit together. The character is a weatherbeaten knight, so he's probably experienced, maybe a bit jaded. The object is a brass door knocker, which could be a key item in the plot. The core concept is impossible choices, so the knight must face decisions with no good options. The attribute is grudgingly sweet—so he has a hidden kindness despite being tough. The action is to appreciate, maybe he learns to value something. The method involves a set of random items forming a pattern, which could be clues he needs to solve. The setting is a lighthouse prison on jagged reefs, so isolated and dangerous. Timeframe within a mirrored reflection suggests a time loop or a vision. Motivation is to hush the final cry of regret, implying he's trying to undo a past mistake. The tone is joyful agony—mix of happiness and pain, like bittersweet.

Now, how to weave these together. The knight is trapped in a lighthouse prison. The brass door knocker might be part of an escape mechanism. The impossible choices could be between saving others or himself, each with dire consequences. The grudgingly sweet side could come out when he helps someone despite his rough exterior. The pattern of items might be objects in the lighthouse that he has to arrange to escape. The mirrored reflection timeframe could mean he's experiencing memories or a loop where he sees his past regrets. His motivation is to stop that regret, so maybe he's trying to save someone he failed before. The joyful agony tone would come from the mix of his determination and the pain of facing his past.

I need to structure the plot so each element is integral. Start with the knight in the lighthouse, describe the setting with jagged reefs and the prison. Introduce the door knocker as part of the escape. The items forming a pattern could be scattered around the lighthouse—maybe tools, symbols, or clues he has to find. The mirrored reflection could be a portal or a vision that shows his past choices. His grudging sweetness might show when he helps another prisoner or remembers a loved one. The impossible choice might be between staying to help others escape or leaving them to save himself. The climax would involve him making the choice that hushes his regret, leading to a bittersweet resolution where he finds peace despite the agony.

I need to ensure the word count is between 550-620. Each sentence must end with the current word count. Let me outline the story step by step. Start with setting the scene in the lighthouse, introduce the knight's situation. Then the door knocker appears as a clue. He finds the items, figures out the pattern, faces the reflection, makes the choice, and resolves his regret. Check that each element is included and logically placed. Avoid redundancy. The tone should be maintained throughout, balancing joy and pain. Character development must show his grudging sweetness and the impact of his choices. The ending should tie back to his motivation, making sure the regret is addressed. Now, start drafting sentences, counting words as I go, ensuring each element is tightly integrated without forcing them.

By the third day, the mirrors began to flicker.

A clue? He’d seen its design elsewhere—the vines matched the compass’s needle, the doll’s ribbon, the hair’s braid. <words>440</words>  

He arranged the items in the knocker’s shadow, their alignment casting a door-shaped silhouette on the far wall. <words>480</words> The knight hesitated.
