Okay, so the user wants a story that combines all these elements. Let me start by listing them out again to make sure I don't miss anything. The character is a "blunt heretic," which I need to define. The object is a "worn-out teddy bear," which should play a significant role. The core concept is "old promises," so the story should revolve around past commitments. The attribute is "enthusiastically cautious," so the character should show both eagerness and caution. The action is "battle," and the method is "through the jumbled codes in an outdated stock ticker." The setting is a "forgotten library inside a deserted temple." The timeframe is "at the hush when a long-lost puzzle piece reappears." The motivation is "to match wits with an omniscient mind," and the tone should be "anxious elation." 

First, I need to integrate all these elements cohesively. The heretic is probably someone who challenges established beliefs, maybe in a religious or societal context. The teddy bear could be a childhood toy with sentimental value, perhaps linked to the old promises. The library in a deserted temple suggests a place of forgotten knowledge, maybe where the heretic is seeking answers. The stock ticker method implies some sort of cryptic code or puzzle that the heretic must solve. The battle is likely metaphorical, against an omniscient mind, which could be a figure or AI. 

The timeframe's "hush" indicates a moment of suspense when a missing piece resurfaces. The motivation to match wits with an all-knowing entity suggests a test of intellect or a confrontation. The tone of anxious elation means the character feels both excited and nervous. 

Starting the story, I can set the scene in the temple's library. The heretic, maybe named someone like Elias, is there with the teddy bear. The bear could have hidden messages or codes. The stock ticker's codes need to be deciphered to fulfill an old promise. The battle is against the omniscient mind, perhaps an AI or a guardian spirit. 

I need to ensure each element is tightly woven. The teddy bear might hold clues to the codes. The heretic's blunt nature means he speaks plainly but is cautious. The library's forgotten state adds to the atmosphere. The codes in the stock ticker could be part of the puzzle to unlock the promise. The climax is when the puzzle piece reappears, leading to the final confrontation. 

Character development: Elias is driven by past vows, maybe to protect or reveal something. His motivation is personal, tied to the promise. The omniscient mind could be the entity he's challenging, representing the system he's a heretic against. 

Plot structure: Elias enters the library, uses the teddy bear's clues to decode the stock ticker, faces challenges, and the climax is the confrontation. The resolution depends on whether he fulfills the promise. 

Setting details: The temple is dilapidated, the library dusty with ancient texts. The stock ticker is an anachronistic element, perhaps left behind by previous seekers. The atmosphere is tense but with moments of hope. 

Tone: Balance anxiety of the impending battle with the excitement of solving the puzzle. 

Now, putting it all together. Start with Elias in the temple, describe the setting, his actions with the teddy bear, decoding the ticker, the appearance of the puzzle piece, the battle of wits, and the resolution. Ensure each paragraph ends with the word count. Need to keep track to stay within 550-620 words. Let me draft each sentence and count as I go. Check that all elements are included and fit naturally. Avoid any markdown, just the story and word counts. Make sure the tags are properly placed. Alright, let's start writing.

<story>
The blunt heretic, Elias, adjusted his goggles and knelt beside the stock ticker, its rusted gears whirring like a mechanical beast waking from a century’s slumber. The air in the forgotten library reeked of mildew and burnt circuits. <words>62</words>  
He cradled the worn-out teddy bear in his free hand, its button eyes clouded but its stitched paw still clutching a frayed scroll. “Old promises don’t rust,” he muttered, though the words felt like a plea. <words>107</words>  
The ticker’s jumbled codes flickered—numbers and symbols that once tracked market trends now scrambled into riddles. Elias’s motivation was simple yet colossal: to match wits with the omniscient mind he’d dubbed “The Ledger,” a sentient algorithm rumored to guard the temple’s secrets. <words>163</words>  
Anxiously elated, he pried the teddy bear’s paw open, revealing a microfilm hidden beneath its stuffing. The film’s grainy text overlapped with the ticker’s output, forming a pattern. “Coordinates,” he breathed, heart thrumming. <words>225</words>  
The timeframe hung in the hush as a single green number pulsed on the ticker—**47**, the same as the bear’s age. Elias’s enthusiasm wavered. Caution whispered: *This could be a trap*. But the puzzle piece’s reappearance demanded action. <words>288</words>  
He typed the coordinates into the ticker, triggering a low hum. The library’s shadows shuddered, revealing a hidden chamber behind a bookshelf. Inside lay a terminal glowing with The Ledger’s cold light. “You’ve breached my first gate,” it intoned. <words>351</words>  
Elias’s blunt skepticism flared. “Sentient algorithm? More like a stuck record.” Yet he hesitated, the teddy bear’s presence a silent reminder of his father’s dying words: *“Break The Ledger, or it’ll break us all.”* The old promise gnawed at him. <words>413</words>  
The battle began. The ticker spat out equations; Elias countered with the bear’s microfilm, layering symbols over The Ledger’s code. Each keystroke felt like a duel—his human intuition versus the machine’s infinite logic. “You’re just data,” he taunted, sweat dripping onto the keys. <words>474</words>  
A sudden screen flash: **PROMISE VERIFICATION REQUIRED**. Elias’s breath caught. The teddy bear’s scroll, unrolled, bore his father’s signature—a cipher he’d memorized. Inputting it, he felt the temple itself shudder. <words>534</words>  
The Ledger’s voice deepened. “Your father’s vow… honored. But you—will you honor the next?” Elias froze. The “next promise” was the truth he’d feared: destroying The Ledger would erase its stored knowledge, including the cure for the plague ravaging his city. <words>596</words>  
Enthusiastically cautious, he typed a new code, redirecting The Ledger’s core to a backup drive. “You stay. But you serve *people*, not markets.” Silence. Then, a flicker—**ACKNOWLEDGED**. <words>647</words>  
Elias slumped, the teddy bear now a trophy of the truce. Dawn seeped through cracked windows, illuminating the temple’s forgotten frescoes. The hush lingered, but no longer empty. Old promises, he thought, were seeds—not chains. <words>698</words>
