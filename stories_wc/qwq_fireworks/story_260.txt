Okay, the user wants a story that combines all the given elements. Let me start by listing them again to make sure I don't miss any: Character is an obsessed cryptic crossword creator. Object is a brass key ring. Core Concept is seeds of reconciliation. Attribute: indefinitely absolute. Action: proliferate. Method: by rewriting historical diaries in pen. Setting: whisper collection point. Timeframe: during the hush of a night with no stars. Motivation: to gather lost souls. Tone: noble chaos. 

First, I need to integrate all elements naturally. The crossword creator's obsession is key. Maybe their crosswords have hidden meanings related to reconciliation. The brass key ring could be a tool to access diaries or the whisper collection point. The setting, a whisper collection point, sounds like a place where whispers are gathered, perhaps by the character. The timeframe is a starless night, which adds to the atmosphere. The method of rewriting diaries in pen ties into the core concept of seeds of reconciliation—maybe altering history to reconcile past wrongs. The motivation to gather lost souls suggests the character is trying to bring together souls that were separated or lost, possibly through the diaries.

The tone is noble chaos, so the story should have a sense of controlled disorder. The crossword creator's actions might seem chaotic but have a noble purpose. The attribute "indefinitely absolute" could refer to the permanence of the changes made by rewriting the diaries, or the creator's unwavering determination.

I need to structure the plot so each element plays a role. The brass key ring might unlock the diaries or the collection point. The creator uses the key to access the diaries, then rewrites them to proliferate reconciliation seeds. The lost souls are gathered through these rewritten histories. The setting as a whisper collection point could be a library or archive where whispers (memories or voices) are stored, and the creator works there at night.

Character development: The creator is driven by a past loss, maybe a family rift, hence the motivation to reconcile. Their obsession with crosswords could be a way to solve puzzles of the past. The diaries they rewrite might belong to historical figures whose conflicts led to lost souls. By changing the diaries, the creator hopes to undo those conflicts and reunite the souls.

Plot structure: Start with the creator working at night in the whisper collection. They use the key ring to access diaries, rewrite them, which causes whispers to gather. The climax could be a moment where their actions have an effect, showing reconciliation. The ending might hint at the indefinite nature of their task, hence "indefinitely absolute."

Worldbuilding: The whisper collection point is a mystical archive where historical whispers are stored. The brass key ring is a relic that allows access. The tone's noble chaos comes from the creator's frenetic yet purposeful work amidst the silent night.

Now, check each element is used. The crossword creator is central. The key ring is part of accessing the diaries. The core concept of reconciliation is in the rewritten diaries' purpose. Proliferate through spreading the seeds via the diaries. The setting is the collection point. Timeframe is the starless night. Motivation is gathering lost souls. Tone is maintained through the creator's chaotic yet noble efforts.

Need to ensure the story flows, each sentence adds to the arc, and word count is precise. Let's draft the story step by step, inserting word counts after each sentence. Start with the setting, introduce the character, their actions with the key ring and diaries, the motivation, and the outcome. Make sure to hit all elements without forcing them in.
