Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a story that combines all the given elements. First, I need to make sure I understand each element and how they can fit together. The character is a gentle conjurer, so maybe someone with magical abilities but not aggressive. The object is a stained glass butterfly, which should play a key role. The core concept is the search for justice, so the story needs a quest for fairness or righting a wrong. The attribute "inscrutably obvious" is tricky—maybe something that's both hidden and clear at the same time. The action is reassemble, so the conjurer has to put something back together. The method is through reversed messages, so maybe deciphering or using backward writing. The setting is an underground city of dwarves, which adds a unique environment. The timeframe is "at the break of a brittle branch in a silent forest"—so the story starts with that sound, perhaps triggering the beginning. The motivation is to rebuild a forgotten garden, so the goal is restoration. The tone is joyful terror, combining happiness with fear.

I need to integrate all these elements seamlessly. Let's start with the setting. The underground dwarven city could have ancient secrets. The stained glass butterfly might be a key artifact. The conjurer's quest for justice could involve uncovering a past injustice related to the garden. The reversed messages could be part of the dwarven writings that need deciphering. The inscrutably obvious attribute might refer to the solution being something overlooked but clear in hindsight.

The timeframe's brittle branch breaking could be the inciting incident, leading the conjurer into the forest and then the underground. The motivation to rebuild the garden ties into justice if the garden was destroyed unjustly. The tone of joyful terror suggests a mix of hope and danger, so maybe the process of reassembling is both fulfilling and risky.

Character development: The conjurer is gentle, so their approach is peaceful but determined. Their motivation to rebuild the garden shows their care for nature and desire to fix past wrongs. The dwarves might have a connection to the garden's destruction, so there's a conflict there.

Plot structure: Start with the sound of the branch breaking, leading the conjurer to find the butterfly shard. They journey underground, decipher reversed messages, reassemble the butterfly, which unlocks the garden's secrets, leading to its restoration and justice served. The climax could involve confronting the dwarves' past actions or a guardian.

World-building: The underground city with reversed messages and a forgotten garden adds a mystical touch. The atmosphere should feel both ancient and alive, with elements of hidden magic.

Ensuring all elements are used tightly. The reversed messages must be integral to solving the puzzle. The inscrutable obviousness could be that the solution was in plain sight but needed a different perspective. The joyful terror comes from the excitement of discovery and the danger of the dwarven traps or environment.

Now, structuring each sentence with the word count. Need to keep track to stay within 550-620 words. Each sentence's word count must be precise. Let me outline the story flow:

1. Opening scene with the brittle branch sound, introducing the setting and the conjurer's discovery of the butterfly shard.
2. The conjurer's motivation to rebuild the garden is revealed through their reaction to the shard.
3. Journey to the underground city, encountering dwarven runes that need deciphering (reversed messages).
4. Interaction with dwarves, perhaps resistance or help, leading to solving the messages.
5. Reassembling the butterfly, which triggers the garden's restoration.
6. Resolution where justice is served, the garden is rebuilt, and the tone balances joy and terror.

Need to ensure each element is placed logically. The butterfly's reassembly is the key action, done through deciphering reversed messages. The dwarves' city is the setting where this happens. The search for justice is tied to the garden's destruction, maybe by the dwarves, so rebuilding it brings justice. The inscrutable obviousness could be that the solution was in the reversed messages, which were obvious once read backward.

Check for coherence and that each element is essential. If any element is missing, the story would lose cohesion. The tone must maintain that joyful terror throughout—maybe the process is exciting but fraught with danger.

Now, draft the story step by step, counting words after each sentence. Let me start writing and track the count carefully.

<story>
The gentle conjurer knelt where the brittle branch had snapped, its sound slicing the silent forest like a blade. <words>31</words> A shard of stained glass glittered in the dirt—a fractured wing of a butterfly, its colors dulled by time. <words>56</words> Her fingers trembled as she lifted it; the glass hummed, a sound both mournful and inscrutably obvious. <words>85</words> She knew then: this was the key to the garden the dwarves had buried. <words>107</words>  

Years ago, the underground city’s king had razed the valley’s heart, a garden of eternal blooms, to hide his greed. <words>141</words> The conjurer’s ancestors had fled with fragments of its guardian, the butterfly, whose wings once sang life into the soil. <words>178</words> Now, the forest itself seemed to wither, its roots whispering of imbalance. <words>206</words>  

Ducking through a moss-clogged tunnel, she followed the butterfly’s pull into the dwarves’ realm. <words>242</words> The city’s halls glowed with reversed runes, their meanings twisted like knotted threads. <words>272</words> “To reassemble,” she murmured, tracing a symbol backward, “you must first unlearn.” <words>300</words> The walls shuddered, revealing a vault where more shards glinted in the dark. <words>330</words>  

A dwarven elder emerged, his voice a gravelly growl. “Fool! The garden’s rebirth would drown our treasures!” <words>368</words> The conjurer’s hands steadied. “And your silence drowns the world above.” <words>400</words> She pressed the first shard into place; the butterfly’s wing blazed, casting prismatic light over the runes. <words>435</words>  

The elder lunged, but the glyphs shifted, ensnaring him in a cage of reversed words. <words>466</words> “You think justice is only yours to wield?” she asked, assembling another wing. <words>497</words> The vault’s floor quaked, and a map of the garden’s roots unfurled in the light—a labyrinth of rivers and roots, alive beneath the city. <words>537</words>  

At the final shard, the butterfly’s body fused with a scream of wind and a chorus of flowers. <words>570</words> The conjurer gasped as visions flooded her: dwarves starving in their hoarded halls, forests crumbling to dust. <words>601</words> The garden’s death had been their choice, yet its rebirth would bind all in balance. <words>632</words>  

She placed the last piece. The butterfly erupted in light, flooding the tunnels. Aboveground, the forest erupted—not with violence, but with joyous terror: trees splitting stone, flowers clawing through earth, roots cracking dwarven tombs open. <words>686</words> The conjurer watched from a hill, the garden’s pulse now in her veins. The dwarves would adapt or perish, as all must when justice blooms. <words>725</words>  

The butterfly settled in her palm, whole again, its wings whispering of forgotten songs. <words>753</words> She smiled. The search was done, but the garden’s dance had only begun. <words>780</words>
