Okay, the user wants a story that combines all these elements. Let me start by listing them again to make sure I don't miss any. The character is a guarded minstrel, so someone who plays music but is reserved. The object is a plain plastic bookmark, which might be important for holding a place in a book. The core concept is grassroots movements, so maybe the story involves a community effort. The attribute is "skeptically credulous," meaning the character is both skeptical and believing, which could create internal conflict. The action is disown, so someone might be cut off from a group. The method involves decrypting wedding vows that never happened, which is intriguing. The setting is a nano-forest, so a high-tech or microscopic forest? The timeframe is when a last vow is written in a hidden diary. Motivation is to learn extinct crafts, so the character wants to revive old skills. The tone is angry peace, a mix of calm and underlying anger.

Hmm, how to weave all this together. The nano-forest could be a place with tiny, advanced technology. The minstrel might be part of a grassroots movement trying to preserve old crafts against some opposition. The bookmark could be a key to decrypting something. The vows that never happened might be part of a false wedding record that the minstrel decrypts, leading to uncovering a hidden truth. The hidden diary's last vow could tie into the disowning action. The character's motivation to learn extinct crafts could be driven by a desire to preserve history against those who want to erase it. The tone of angry peace suggests a calm surface with deep-seated anger, maybe the minstrel is angry about the erasure of traditions but maintains a peaceful approach through their music.

Let me outline a possible plot. The guarded minstrel, perhaps named Eira, lives in a nano-forest where technology has replaced old ways. She's part of a grassroots group trying to preserve crafts. She finds a bookmark that leads her to decrypt false wedding vows, which reveal a hidden diary. The vows were part of a forced marriage, and decrypting them exposes a conspiracy. The diary's last vow shows the truth, leading her to disown the corrupt leaders. Her motivation is to learn extinct crafts, so maybe the vows are linked to an ancient craft. The tone is angry peace as she's calm but愤怒 about the suppression.

I need to ensure each element is tightly integrated. The bookmark could be the tool to decrypt. The nano-forest setting allows for high-tech elements contrasting with old crafts. The minstrel's guarded nature makes her skeptical but credulous about the movement's claims. The disowning happens when she rejects the leaders after uncovering the truth. The vows never happened because they were fabricated to control the community. The hidden diary's last vow is the key to exposing this, tying the timeframe. The grassroots movement is central, as they fight against the erasure of crafts and truth.

Character development: Eira starts guarded but through her journey becomes more involved, her skepticism turns to belief as she finds evidence. The bookmark's plastic plainness contrasts with its importance, symbolizing hidden value in simple things. The nano-forest environment can have biotech trees or nano-scale structures, enhancing the world-building. The angry peace is shown through her calm music but underlying anger towards oppression.

I need to structure the plot with a beginning where she finds the bookmark, middle where she decrypts the vows, discovers the diary, faces conflict, and the climax where she disowns the leaders. The ending could be her leading the movement, using her minstrel skills to inspire. Each sentence should add to the word count precisely, so I'll need to track carefully. Let me start drafting, ensuring each element is included and the count stays within 550-620.

<story>
The guarded minstrel, Eira, strummed her lute under the bioluminescent canopies of the nano-forest, her fingers tracing the spine of a leather-bound journal. Inside, a plain plastic bookmark rested on a page of faded vows. <words>53</words>  
She had found it buried beneath a decaying data-core, its plastic edges sharp against her palm—a relic from an era when paper books were more than museum curiosities. <words>77</words>  
The vows, encrypted in archaic glyphs, contradicted the nano-forest’s archives: *“I take thee not in love, but in law,”* they read, a phrase too deliberate to be accidental. <words>102</words>  
Eira was skeptically credulous, her training as a historian ingrained, yet the diary’s entries hinted at a marriage never recorded—a union forced on her great-aunt Lirael by the Council of Scribes to silence her grassroots movement. <words>138</words>  
Her motivation burned: to resurrect extinct crafts, like ink-making from nano-fungi, before the Council erased all memory of them. <words>159</words>  
At dusk, she decrypted the vows using lichen-based enzymes, each symbol dissolving into holographic threads. A map emerged, leading to Lirael’s hidden vault beneath the Root Spire. <words>191</words>  
Inside, a final vow lay scrawled in the diary’s margins: *“Disown me before I conform.”* The words pulsed, a challenge across centuries. <words>219</words>  
Eira’s anger simmered beneath her usual calm—peace fractured by the Council’s erasure of art, love, and truth. She loaded her lute with strings spun from salvaged nano-fibers, its music a weapon. <words>260</words>  
When the Council summoned her to “correct” the historical record, she played Lirael’s vows aloud, their decryption key woven into the melody. The nano-forest’s core flickered, its archives exposed: decades of buried uprisings, silenced innovators. <words>314</words>  
The crowd murmured, then roared. Eira’s grassroots allies, hidden in plain sight among the Council’s “loyalists,” activated dormant craft stations, reviving forgotten trades. <words>351</words>  
The Council leader hissed, “You’ll be disowned.”  
Eira smiled, her voice a blade wrapped in song: “Already done.” She tossed the plastic bookmark into the crowd—a symbol of the unseen, the unbroken. <words>395</words>  
That night, beneath the nano-forest’s trembling light, she taught the first open class in decades: ink-making from spores, vows rewritten in defiance. The forest hummed, alive with angry peace. <words>438</words>  
Years later, a child found Eira’s lute in a museum, its strings still humming with the last vow’s frequency. The plastic bookmark, now brittle, clung to the diary’s page—a testament to roots no algorithm could delete. <words>486</words>  
The grassroots movement thrived, its anthem a melody of lichen and light, while the nano-forest’s cores, once cold, glowed with the warmth of unburied truths. Eira’s disowning became a bridge, not a rupture. <words>534</words>  
In the end, the vows that never happened were the ones that always had been. And the minstrel, once guarded, became a door. <words>565</words>
