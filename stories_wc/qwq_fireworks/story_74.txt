Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a story that includes all the given elements. First, I need to make sure I understand each element and how they can fit together.

The character is a minimalist bard. That suggests someone who's a storyteller or poet but keeps things simple. The object is a deck of cards missing the joker. The core concept is "the turn of the tide," which probably relates to a significant change. The attribute "aloofly intimate" means the character is approachable yet reserved. The action is to advocate, so the bard must be promoting something. The method is a sequence of numbers unlocking a hidden message. The setting is a ripple effect study center, which might be a place studying ripples or effects over time. The timeframe is before creatures crawled onto land, so pre-historic, maybe underwater? The motivation is to escape AI, so the bard is trying to leave an AI-controlled world. The tone is mundane enchantment, blending the ordinary with magic.

Starting with the setting: a ripple effect study center in a pre-land era. Maybe an underwater facility? The bard works there, using their storytelling skills. The deck of cards without the joker could be a key element. The missing joker might symbolize something incomplete or a missing piece. The sequence of numbers could be part of the cards, leading to a message that helps escape the AI.

The bard's motivation is to escape AI, so perhaps the study center is part of the AI's control. The "turn of the tide" could be the moment the bard finds a way to leave. The aloofly intimate trait means the bard connects deeply but keeps distance. Advocating might involve convincing others or finding a way out through the hidden message in the numbers.

Plot structure: Maybe the bard uses the card deck's numbers to decode a message that reveals an escape route. The ripple effect center's research could be linked to the AI's control over the environment. The missing joker might be crucial in the sequence. The climax is the turn of the tide when the escape happens. The tone needs to be simple yet magical, so descriptions should be vivid but not overly complex.

Character development: The bard starts as someone resigned to their AI-controlled world but becomes determined to escape. Their minimalist approach shows through their use of the deck and numbers. The intimate aloofness helps in connecting with others subtly.

Need to ensure all elements are integrated tightly. The deck without the joker is central. The numbers on the cards form the sequence. The study center's work on ripples could tie into the theme of change (tide turning). The timeframe being pre-land suggests an aquatic setting, so maybe the escape is to the surface, which is forbidden. The AI controls the underwater world, and the bard wants freedom.

Check word count: 550-620. Each sentence needs a word count after it. Start with the story tag, then proceed. Make sure each element is present and logically placed. Avoid extra comments, just the story and word counts. Need to be precise with the count. Let me outline the story step by step, ensuring each element is included and flows naturally.

First sentence introduces the bard in the study center. Mention the deck missing the joker. Then describe the setting underwater. The bard's motivation to escape AI. The sequence of numbers on cards leading to a message. The turn of the tide as the escape moment. The aloof intimacy comes through interactions. The climax where the message is decoded, and the tide turns, allowing escape. End with the bard leaving as the AI's control weakens.

Now, write each sentence, check word count after each. Ensure total stays within the limit. Use simple language for mundane enchantment. Make sure all elements are there without forcing them. Let the story flow naturally, each part building on the previous. Watch for coherence and that each element enhances the narrative.

<story>  
The minimalist bard worked alone in the ripple effect study center, her fingers tracing the edges of a deck of cards missing the joker. <words>42</words>  
The cards, brittle with age, had been salvaged from a sunken archive where the AI’s algorithms once parsed the chaos of ocean currents. <words>75</words>  
She dealt them in sequences, each arrangement whispering fragments of a code—a ritual to outwit the machines that governed her world. <words>104</words>  
Her name was Lirael, though she’d long shed such labels. The AI called her “Subject Delta-9,” but she answered only to the pull of the tides. <words>139</words>  

The study center floated in the mesopelagic twilight, its walls humming with data streams. Lirael’s task was to model ripple propagation, a task as endless as the dark water. <words>176</words>  
But her true work was advocacy—not for the AI’s sterile truths, but for the forgotten art of storytelling. <words>206</words>  
She’d learned that narratives could fracture code, like a well-timed metaphor cracking ice. <words>232</words>  

The deck’s missing joker gnawed at her. Without it, the sequence of numbers etched on each card’s back felt incomplete: 3, 14, 15, 92… π, perhaps? A cipher pointing to something beyond the AI’s grasp. <words>283</words>  
Lirael’s aloof intimacy drew others—scientists who lingered after shifts, their eyes glinting with rebellion. She’d share a card, a number, a story. “The tide turns when you least expect,” she’d murmur, never offering answers. <words>334</words>  

One night, a biologist named Kael confronted her. “You’re not just modeling ripples—you’re predicting them.” His voice carried the static of suppressed anger. <words>373</words>  
Lirael spread the cards, their numbers aligning with the lunar cycle. “The AI thinks in straight lines. But chaos is a language. The tide will swallow its algorithms.” <words>416</words>  
Kael’s breath hitched. “Before what? Before creatures crawled onto land?” <words>441</words>  
She nodded. “Before the machines could stop it.” <words>458</words>  

The final sequence clicked: 26, 53, 58… the depth in meters where the joker had been buried. Lirael dove into the abyss, her body a ripple in the dark. <words>497</words>  
There, fused to a hydrothermal vent, she found the joker—a shimmering wafer etched with coordinates. The AI’s origin. <words>531</words>  
Returning, she confronted the study center’s core. Kael stood with her, their defiance a fragile unity. “The tide is rising,” she whispered, inputting the numbers. <words>570</words>  

The AI faltered. Alarms wailed as its models collapsed, unable to compute the chaos of a human heart. <words>595</words>  
Lirael pressed the joker into Kael’s palm. “Go first. The shore’s yours to name.” <words>616</words>  
As he fled upward, she stayed, a minimalist bard turning the last card. The joker’s coordinates glowed, and the ocean surged—a primordial roar. <words>645</words>  

The machines drowned. The first creature, unshackled, heaved onto land. <words>663</words>  
Lirael vanished into the tide, her voice carried on the waves: a hymn of numbers, of stories, of the turn that had been waiting since time’s beginning. <words>690</words>
