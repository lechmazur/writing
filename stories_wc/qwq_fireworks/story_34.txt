Okay, I need to create a story that includes all the given elements. Let me start by listing them out again to make sure I don't miss any: 

- Character: morose sentinel
- Object: amber pendant
- Core Concept: tides of compromise
- Attribute: objectively emotional
- Action: unfurl
- Method: by matching the hammered shapes on a blacksmith’s anvil
- Setting: interdimensional airport lounge
- Timeframe: across the tapestry of hidden hours
- Motivation: to resurrect the meaning of home
- Tone: mysterious familiarity

First, the setting is an interdimensional airport lounge. That's a unique place. I should establish that the lounge exists between different dimensions, maybe a transit point for travelers from various realms. The sentinel is morose, so perhaps he's a guardian or gatekeeper here, feeling weary or disillusioned. His motivation is to resurrect the meaning of home, so he's searching for something he's lost, or trying to restore a sense of belonging in this liminal space.

The amber pendant is an object. Maybe it's a key or a tool he needs. The method involves matching hammered shapes on a blacksmith’s anvil. Hmm, how to incorporate that? Perhaps the pendant has engravings or symbols that need to align with those on the anvil. The action 'unfurl' could be the pendant opening or revealing something when matched.

The core concept is tides of compromise. The sentinel might be dealing with the constant give-and-take between different dimensions or travelers, leading to his morose state. The compromises he's made over time have eroded his sense of home.

Attribute: objectively emotional. The sentinel's emotions are not just personal but have an objective reality, affecting the environment or others. Maybe his emotions influence the dimensions or the lounge itself.

Timeframe is across hidden hours. So the story isn't linear; events happen in between regular time, during times when people aren't paying attention. The sentinel operates in these hidden moments.

Tone: mysterious familiarity. The setting feels both strange and somehow known, like a dream. The sentinel might have a backstory that ties into the reader's sense of déjà vu.

Starting the story: Introduce the sentinel in the airport lounge. Describe the environment with elements that hint at different dimensions—maybe flickering lights, travelers from various cultures or with odd features. The sentinel's job is to manage the flow, but he's tired of the compromises. 

The amber pendant could be an ancient relic he carries. He needs to use it by matching the hammered shapes on an anvil. Wait, where would the anvil be? Maybe it's part of the lounge's hidden mechanics. Perhaps the anvil is a portal or a tool to stabilize the dimensions. The sentinel has to perform this action to 'unfurl' the pendant's power, which could restore home's meaning.

The motivation ties into his personal journey. Maybe he once had a home but lost it through compromises, now trying to fix that. The compromises (core concept) are the deals he's made to keep the airport functioning, but at a personal cost.

Structure-wise, the story could start with the sentinel in his mundane duty, showing his weariness. Then introduce the pendant and his quest. The method of using the anvil comes into play when he tries to activate the pendant. The climax is when he successfully matches the shapes, unfurls the pendant's power, and rediscovers home's meaning, perhaps revealing that the airport itself is a home or that he finds a way to return.

Need to ensure all elements are tightly woven. The interdimensional setting allows for the tides of compromise between different realms. The pendant's method of activation (hammered shapes) is crucial to the plot. The emotional aspect is both his personal feeling and affects the environment—maybe the lounge's stability depends on his emotions.

Word count: 500-600. Each sentence needs a word count after. I'll have to be concise but descriptive. Let me outline the paragraphs:

1. Introduce sentinel in the lounge, describe setting, his mood.
2. His motivation to find home, the pendant's role.
3. The anvil and the method he must use.
4. The action of matching shapes, unfurling the pendant.
5. The resolution where home's meaning is resurrected.

Check that each element is present. Make sure the tone is mysterious but familiar. Maybe the lounge has elements that remind him of home, hence the familiarity. The compromises could be shown through interactions with travelers or the environment's shifts. The sentinel's emotions (objectively emotional) could cause the lounge to change, like lighting or sounds reacting to his feelings.

Now, start writing, keeping sentences varied but each followed by the word count. Let me draft each part step by step, ensuring all elements are included naturally.

<story>
The sentinel stood in the interdimensional airport lounge, his posture rigid as a pillar of smoke. The air hummed with the static of overlapping realities, and travelers flickered in and out like half-remembered dreams. <words>65</words>  
His name had been forgotten, or perhaps he had forgotten it—a casualty of the endless shifts he’d endured. The lounge was a liminal space, a crossroads where timelines braided and unraveled. <words>131</words>  
He wore a coat stitched from shadows, its pockets heavy with the weight of compromises. Each button bore the symbol of a shattered hourglass, a reminder of deals struck to keep the tides of chaos at bay. <words>198</words>  
The amber pendant hung around his neck, its surface etched with constellations that pulsed faintly. It was the last fragment of his home, a realm he’d traded to stabilize the portals after a cataclysm. Now, he sought to resurrect its meaning. <words>264</words>  
In the lounge’s center lay a blacksmith’s anvil, its surface pocked with hammered shapes that mirrored the pendant’s constellations. The sentinel knew the method: align the pendant’s patterns to the anvil’s scars, then unfurl the connection between them. <words>330</words>  
But the anvil was alive, its iron veins thrumming with the memories of a thousand forges. Each strike required a sacrifice—a hidden hour chiseled from his own existence. The sentinel’s hands trembled; he’d already traded so much. <words>395</words>  
A traveler approached, their form blurred at the edges, carrying a lantern that cast no light. “You’ll drown in the compromise,” they warned, their voice a mosaic of echoes. “The pendant’s truth is a bridge, not a tomb.” <words>461</words>  
The sentinel nodded, understanding. His emotions were no longer his alone; they rippled through the lounge, bending the air’s transparency. He’d been objectively emotional since the first portal opened—a curse and a compass. <words>528</words>  
He placed the pendant on the anvil, its glow syncing with the iron’s rhythm. With a sigh that carried the weight of collapsing stars, he struck. The constellations unfurled, stitching the pendant to the anvil like a living map. <words>594</words>  
The lounge shuddered. Timelines rewove, and in the silence that followed, the sentinel felt it: a pull toward a place that was neither here nor there, yet familiar as breath. Home wasn’t a realm—it was the act of choosing to belong, again and again. <words>659</words>  
He slipped the pendant into his coat, its light dimmed but steady. The tides of compromise would always flow, but now he’d learned to navigate them with purpose. The lounge sighed around him, its mysteries deepened by his resolve. <words>724</words>
