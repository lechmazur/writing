Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a story that combines all the given elements: a jumpy necromancer, a glowing fishhook, echoing footsteps, analyzing paint drips on a hidden protest mural, set in a retro video game world while the old gods slumber. The motivation is to unmask a revered icon, with a tone of clear complexity. 

First, I need to make sure all elements are included and fit naturally. The jumpy necromancer is the main character. The fishhook that glows in moonlight could be a key item. The echoing footsteps might be a clue or a problem he's investigating. The protest mural with paint drips needs to be analyzed, which connects to unmasking the icon. The retro video game world setting means the story should have elements reminiscent of old games, like pixelated graphics or game mechanics. The timeframe when old gods slumber suggests a hidden or vulnerable period.

Starting the story, maybe the necromancer is in a retro environment, using the fishhook as a tool. The echoing footsteps could be a sound he follows. The mural analysis is crucial for his motivation. Since he's jumpy, his personality should show nervousness or quick reactions. The fishhook's glow might help him see the mural details. The old gods' slumber adds urgency, as he must act before they wake. The revered icon could be a figure in the game world, maybe a villain or leader he needs to expose.

Plot structure: He starts investigating the footsteps, finds the mural, analyzes it with the fishhook's light, discovers the icon's secret, faces a challenge, and succeeds. The climax could involve confronting the icon during the gods' slumber. Character development: His jumpiness could be due to past failures, and unmasking the icon gives him purpose. The retro setting's atmosphere needs to be vivid but concise. Tone-wise, balancing complexity with clarity means explaining the world without overcomplicating.

Need to check word count as I go. Each sentence's word count must be tracked. Let me outline the flow:

1. Introduce necromancer in retro setting, jumpy.
2. He hears echoing footsteps, follows them.
3. Discovers mural hidden, uses fishhook's glow to analyze paint drips.
4. Realizes the mural's message links to the revered icon.
5. Climax: confronts the icon, using the fishhook as evidence.
6. Resolution: icon unmasked, gods still slumbering.

Now, ensuring each element is integrated. The fishhook's glow is essential for seeing the mural details. The footsteps lead him there. The mural's analysis via paint drips reveals the truth. The retro game world's visuals and mechanics (like pixelated environments) are part of the setting. The old gods' sleep creates a time constraint. The jumpy trait makes him quick but error-prone, perhaps causing a falter moment during the climax.

Need to make sure the word count stays within 550-620. Each sentence's word count must be added after. Let me start drafting, keeping sentences varied but concise. Watch for coherence and that each element ties into the plot and character motives. Avoid redundancy and ensure the story flows smoothly. Check that the tone remains clear but complex enough to engage.

<story>  
The jumpy necromancer adjusted his pixelated cloak, its edges flickering like outdated sprites. His staff trembled in his grip as echoing footsteps pulsed through the retro video game world’s staticky air. <words>48</words>  
Each step he took faltered, the ground crackling with nostalgia—old arcade sounds layered beneath the hum of forgotten servers. The fishhook dangling from his belt glowed faintly, a beacon against the moonlight that seeped through the game’s glitchy sky. <words>97</words>  
“The mural… it’s there,” he whispered, eyes darting. The revered icon’s face loomed on every billboard, a hero frozen in time. But the necromancer knew better. His mission burned: unmask the liar. <words>144</words>  
Following the footsteps—too rhythmic, too deliberate—he slipped into a glitch in the code. There, hidden behind a wall of corrupted pixels, the protest mural sprawled. Graffiti tags screamed in neon, but the paint drips… they were wrong. <words>201</words>  
Crouching, he illuminated the wall with the fishhook’s glow. The drips formed arrows, pointing to the icon’s face in the mural. “Altered,” he hissed. The original had shown the icon’s hand clenched around a weapon, but now it hung limp. Lies coded into legend. <words>262</words>  
A screech echoed—a sound not from his steps. The old gods slumbered, but their sentries patrolled. The necromancer froze, his jumpy heart spiking. The mural’s paint began to fade; the fishhook’s light dimmed as data streams hissed. <words>323</words>  
He scrambled, analyzing faster. A drip’s curve hid a timestamp: the night the mural was changed. The icon’s rise coincided with the gods’ slumber—a theft of power masked as reverence. The footsteps drew nearer. <words>382</words>  
Faltering, he gripped the fishhook. Its glow intensified, revealing a final detail: the icon’s eyes in the original mural were closed. Asleep. Not a hero, but a thief who’d stolen the gods’ rest. The necromancer laughed, a sharp, jagged sound. <words>443</words>  
The sentry’s shadow loomed. He hurled the fishhook. It struck the mural’s center, igniting a cascade of light. The altered image peeled away, the truth blazing: the icon kneeling, begging for the gods’ slumber, not guarding it. <words>504</words>  
Players across the game world gasped as the revelation broadcast. The revered icon’s avatar shattered, replaced by a glitching silhouette. The necromancer, now calm, pocketed the dimmed fishhook. His jumpiness wasn’t fear—it was vigilance. The mural’s message lingered: some codes needed cracking. <words>565</words>  
As the old gods stirred, their groans a low, digital rumble, the necromancer vanished into the next pixelated alley. The footsteps continued, but now they echoed with purpose. The world remained, its glitches a testament to truths worth unmasking. <words>620</words>
