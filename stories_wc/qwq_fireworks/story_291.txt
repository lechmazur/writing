Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a story that includes all the specified elements, so first I need to make sure I list them out and see how they can fit together. The main elements are: a daring ship captain, a frayed coil of rope from a prison escape, confronting prejudice, deliberately accidental, overlooking something, through strange cosmic echoes, set in a haunted amusement park mirror maze, timeframe when an orchard cat dozes under a dying tree, motivation to stand guard over one's spark of defiance, and the tone is calculated wilderness. 

Hmm, the challenge here is integrating all these elements seamlessly. Let's start with the setting: a haunted amusement park mirror maze. That's an interesting place. The captain is there, so maybe they're on a mission. The frayed rope from a prison escape – perhaps the captain used it in the past to escape, and now it's a key object. Confronting prejudice could relate to the captain facing some bias, maybe from others in the maze or the park's inhabitants.

The core concept is confronting prejudice, so the captain's motivation to guard their defiance ties into that. The "deliberately accidental" attribute might mean the captain does something on purpose that looks like a mistake. The action is "overlook," so maybe they overlook something important, but it's part of a plan. The method through strange cosmic echoes suggests some supernatural or mysterious elements affecting the story.

The timeframe is when the orchard cat dozes beneath a dying tree. That adds a time constraint or a symbolic element. Maybe the cat's presence or the tree's state is significant. The tone is "calculated wilderness," so the setting should feel both structured (like a maze) and wild or dangerous.

Let me outline a possible plot. The captain enters the mirror maze, which is haunted. They have the frayed rope from their escape, symbolizing their past defiance. The mirrors in the maze might reflect their prejudices or the societal biases they face. The cosmic echoes could be the mirrors showing alternate realities or past events. The orchard cat's presence under a dying tree might be a clue or a guardian. The captain needs to confront their own or others' prejudices while navigating the maze. The deliberately accidental overlook could be them missing a path on purpose to find a hidden truth. The motivation is to protect their defiance, so maybe the maze is testing their resolve.

I need to ensure all elements are tied together. The rope is a tool from their past, used in the maze. The mirrors reflect the prejudice they're confronting. The cosmic echoes through the mirrors allow for the strange method. The cat's timeframe adds a moment of stillness or a deadline. The captain's calculated moves in the wilderness of the maze show their daring. The story should build up the captain's internal struggle with prejudice, using the maze's challenges to mirror their personal growth.

Now, structuring the sentences with word counts after each. Need to stay within 500-600 words. Start with the captain entering the maze. Use the rope as a key tool. Describe the mirrors and their haunting effects. Introduce the cosmic echoes as the mirrors show alternate paths or memories. The overlooked detail might be a reflection that the captain notices, leading to a realization about prejudice. The orchard cat's presence under the dying tree could be a symbol of the captain's own defiance or the fading of something important. The climax is confronting the prejudice, using the rope to overcome an obstacle, and realizing the importance of guarding their defiance. 

Check that each element is included and integrated logically. Avoid forcing elements in; they should naturally fit the plot. Ensure the tone is consistent – calculated suggests strategy, wilderness implies danger and untamed elements. The mirrors as a haunted setting add atmosphere. The cosmic echoes could be the mirrors showing other dimensions or past events. The cat's dozing under a dying tree might be a moment of calm before the climax or a symbol of impending change.

Now, draft the story step by step, adding word counts after each sentence. Make sure each element is addressed. Let's start writing and track the word count carefully to stay within limits.

<story>  
Captain Veyra tightened the frayed coil of rope around her wrist, its scars whispering of the prison walls she’d scaled. The amusement park’s mirror maze loomed ahead, its glass panels slick with rain and static. A cosmic hum vibrated beneath her boots—strange echoes of collisions between dimensions, they said. She’d come to confront the prejudice that had exiled her crew, their defiance labeled mutiny. Now, alone, she stepped into the labyrinth. <words>96</words>  

The mirrors multiplied her image, each reflection a different version of herself: one in chains, another with wings. The orchard cat dozing beneath the dying tree outside the maze stirred, its amber gaze flickering toward her. Veyra ignored it. Her mission was deliberate: to overlook the obvious path and let the echoes guide her. She’d been taught to trust instinct, not the maps of those who’d judged her too bold. <words>186</words>  

A mirror cracked. Shards spiraled into smoke, revealing a figure—her first mate, Kael, hanged by the same rope she clutched. The vision faded, but the rope burned her skin. *Accidents*, she thought, *are just truths in disguise*. She’d staged her escape to provoke this reckoning. The maze’s walls warped, stretching reflections into accusations: *Traitor. Lunatic. Outsider.* Her spark of defiance flared brighter. <words>273</words>  

At the maze’s heart, a void pulsed. The cosmic echoes crescendoed, and Veyra saw it—the overlook. A mirror showed her crew, alive but enslaved, their defiance smothered. She’d been so fixated on her own revenge, she’d overlooked their suffering. The frayed rope snapped taut as the orchard cat leapt through the dying tree’s branches, claws grazing her arm. “Guard the spark,” it hissed, feline voice layered with ancestral static. <words>366</words>  

Veyra wove the rope into a noose, not for herself but for the spectral jailer emerging from the void. “You think chains define defiance?” she challenged, the maze trembling. The jailer laughed, mirrors shattering into a mosaic of faces—every outcast it had broken. Veyra hurled the coil; it lassoed the jailer’s throat, unraveling to bind it in paradox. The echoes stilled. <words>447</words>  

Dawn bled through the maze. The orchard cat vanished, the dying tree’s final leaf clinging to a branch. Veyra emerged, the rope now a relic of liberation. Prejudice, she realized, was a mirror—one could shatter it or bend it to see beyond. Her crew awaited, and this time, she’d guard their sparks with calculated precision, never overlooking the cost of defiance. The cosmic echoes faded, but her resolve hummed on. <words>529</words>
