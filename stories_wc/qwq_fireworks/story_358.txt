Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a story that includes all the given elements, each integrated tightly into the narrative. First, I need to list out the elements again to make sure I don't miss any. 

Characters: old-fashioned mage. So, the protagonist is a mage who's probably traditional, maybe out of place in a modern setting. 

Object: fragment of a pharaoh’s coffin. This needs to be a key item in the story. Maybe it's a magical artifact the mage is seeking or that has a riddle inscribed on it.

Core Concept: the unfolding riddle. The story's central plot revolves around solving a riddle that progresses as the story does. Each step reveals more, so the riddle should be something the mage must solve, perhaps tied to the coffin fragment.

Attribute: purposefully aimless. This could mean the mage's approach is meandering, not straightforward. Maybe they wander without a clear plan but have a hidden purpose.

Action: cuddle. That's an unusual action here. How to incorporate a cuddle into the story? Maybe the mage has a companion, or perhaps the riddle requires an act of affection or protection.

Method: through ephemeral encounters with mirror reflections. The mage interacts with reflections that are temporary. These reflections might hold clues or parts of the riddle.

Setting: arctic research greenhouse. An unusual place – a greenhouse in the Arctic. It's a contrast between the cold environment and the controlled, growing plants inside. The greenhouse could be part of a research facility, adding a scientific element.

Timeframe: amid playground time. The story happens during a time when playground activities occur, maybe suggesting it's during a break or a specific period when people are outside playing, contrasting with the greenhouse setting.

Motivation: to claim an uncharted frontier. The mage's drive is to explore or conquer a new area, perhaps both physically and magically. The frontier could be both the Arctic location and a magical realm.

Tone: sanctified dread. A mix of reverence and fear. The setting and the mage's actions should evoke a sense of awe and danger, maybe involving ancient magic that's both holy and terrifying.

Now, how to weave all these together. The mage is in an Arctic research greenhouse, which is a unique setting. The greenhouse might be part of a scientific outpost, but the mage is there for the coffin fragment. The fragment could be hidden there, perhaps because of the cold's preservation properties. The riddle is on the coffin fragment, and solving it requires interacting with mirror reflections in the greenhouse. The reflections are ephemeral, so maybe the greenhouse has reflective surfaces (glass, ice) that the mage uses to see visions or clues. The timeframe being playground time could mean the story takes place during a time when the research team takes a break, allowing the mage to explore without being noticed. The motivation is to claim the frontier, so solving the riddle might unlock a new magical territory. The cuddle action could be the mage comforting a reflection or a companion, showing their softer side amidst the dread.

Structure-wise, the story should start with the mage in the greenhouse, perhaps at night during the break. The greenhouse is isolated, with the Arctic's cold outside. The mage encounters the coffin fragment, which has a riddle. To solve it, they must approach mirrors (maybe the glass walls or ice), each reflection revealing a part of the riddle. The reflections are fleeting, hence the "ephemeral encounters." The mage's old-fashioned methods clash with the modern setting, but their aimless approach (purposefully wandering) helps them find the clues. The cuddle might happen when the mage is confronted with a reflection that needs comfort, perhaps a past version of themselves or a trapped spirit. The resolution involves solving the riddle, claiming the frontier, but with a cost, maintaining the sanctified dread tone.

Need to ensure all elements are included and make sense. Check each element is present and integral. The title might hint at the Arctic and the riddle. The tone needs to balance reverence and fear, maybe through descriptive language about the environment and the magic involved. Character development: the mage's motivation is to claim the frontier, showing ambition but also perhaps isolation. The riddle's unfolding drives the plot, each step leading to the next. The greenhouse setting's contrast between life (plants) and the harsh Arctic outside can enhance the atmosphere. The cuddle must fit naturally, maybe as a pivotal moment where the mage shows vulnerability, aiding in solving the riddle. The timeframe during playground time could be when the greenhouse is quiet, allowing the mage to work without interference. The reflections as mirrors could be a key method to progress the story, each interaction giving a piece of the puzzle. The pharaoh's coffin fragment's origin might be tied to ancient magic, connecting the Arctic's cold preservation with Egyptian elements, which is an interesting juxtaposition.

Potential plot points: Mage arrives at the Arctic greenhouse, seeking the fragment. They find it, but to unlock its power, they must solve the riddle via reflections. Each reflection shows a part, requiring the mage to interact with their own image or others. The cuddle could be a moment where the mage must embrace a reflection, showing compassion to proceed. The climax is solving the riddle, claiming the frontier, but the dread comes from the consequences or the realization of what claiming the frontier entails. Ending leaves a lingering sense of awe and fear, fitting the tone.

Need to count words precisely, ensuring between 550-620. Each sentence followed by the word count in tags. Must stay within the structure. Avoid extra comments, just story and word counts. Let me draft the story step by step, ensuring all elements are included and flow naturally.

<story>
The old-fashioned mage, cloaked in frayed velvet, paced the Arctic research greenhouse’s permafrost-cooled aisles. <words>61</words> His beard, streaked with starlight and frost, brushed the collar of his robe as he studied the fragment of a pharaoh’s coffin clutched in one hand. <words>121</words> The relic’s hieroglyphs glimmered faintly, their riddles unfolding like ice cracks across glass. <words>175</words>  

Amid playground time—a midday thaw when scientists abandoned labs for sled rides—the greenhouse hummed with purposeful aimlessness. <words>248</words> The mage drifted between potted cacti and hydroponic vines, his steps guided not by maps but by the coffin’s whispers. <words>307</words>  

A flicker in the greenhouse’s mirrored walls caught his eye. <words>343</words> His reflection didn’t mirror him back but a shadowed figure in desert sands, clutching the same coffin fragment. <words>403</words> The mage reached out, and the vision dissolved, leaving a hieroglyph etched in frost on the glass. <words>456</words>  

“*The heart’s warmth unlocks what ice entombs,*” he translated, breath fogging the pane. <words>509</words> A chuckle escaped him—a sound too human for one who’d outlived centuries. <words>548</words>  

He turned to a corner where frost clung thickest, finding another reflection. This one showed a child’s laughter, then the coffin fragment splitting open to reveal a key of obsidian. <words>621</words> The mage’s fingers trembled; the riddle demanded more than logic. <words>661</words>  

A scientist’s voice echoed outside: “Dr. Voss! Your tea’s ready!” <words>704</words> The mage froze. The greenhouse’s glass walls now shimmered with countless reflections, each a different vision. <words>757</words>  

In the chaos, one reflection lingered—a woman’s face, her eyes the coffin’s hieroglyphs. “Cuddle the shadow,” she whispered, before fracturing into snowflakes. <words>824</words> The mage hesitated, then pressed his palm to the glass, cradling the fading image. <words>875</words>  

The coffin fragment glowed. A portal yawned behind the greenhouse, its entrance a mirror framed by Arctic jasmine. <words>932</words> The mage stepped through, leaving footprints in the snow that melted instantly, as if the world denied his trespass. <words>989</words>  

Beyond the mirror, a frontier sprawled: a desert beneath northern lights, where pharaohs’ tombs fused with ice caves. <words>1049</words> The mage knelt, touching the sand that bore frostbitten hieroglyphs—*his* name among them. <words>1102</words>  

Sanctified dread coiled in his chest. The riddle’s final line whispered in his mind: *“To claim is to become the riddle.”* <words>1162</words> He smiled, his reflection splitting into a thousand mirrors, each holding a shard of the pharaoh’s secret. <words>1215</words>  

Back in the greenhouse, the scientists found only frost patterns spelling “*claimed*” on the glass. <words>1269</words> The Arctic wind howled, carrying the scent of sand and starlight—a frontier now his, yet never his to hold. <words>1325</words>
