Okay, I need to create a story that includes all the given elements. Let me start by listing them out again to make sure I don't miss any:

- Character: small-town baker
- Object: pressed flowers
- Core Concept: seeds of contagion
- Attribute: cynically gentle
- Action: exceed
- Method: by tracking moon patterns
- Setting: emergency time machine garage
- Timeframe: when shadows learn to speak
- Motivation: to dethrone a tyrant
- Tone: mystical reality

Hmm, the tone is mystical reality, so the story should blend the magical with the real. The setting is an emergency time machine garage. The character is a small-town baker with the attribute of cynically gentle. The core concept is seeds of contagion, which probably relates to something spreading, maybe a virus or an idea. The action is to exceed, which might mean going beyond expectations or limits. The method is tracking moon patterns, so the moon phases play a role here. The timeframe is when shadows learn to speak, which adds a mystical element. The motivation is to dethrone a tyrant, so there's a conflict with an oppressive ruler.

Let me start by thinking about how the baker fits into this. Maybe she's in a town ruled by a tyrant, and she uses her baking skills to help? The pressed flowers could be part of her method. Since she tracks moon patterns, perhaps she uses them to activate the time machine. The garage setting suggests a hidden or makeshift lab. The shadows speaking could be a sign that something's wrong, maybe the contagion starting.

The core concept "seeds of contagion" might be literal seeds that spread a disease or a rebellion. The baker could be trying to plant these seeds to overthrow the tyrant. The time machine is an emergency, so maybe she needs to go back in time or to another place to stop the tyrant before they take power.

Her attribute is cynically gentle. That means she's kind but maybe a bit jaded. Maybe she's lost hope but still tries. The action "exceed" could be her exceeding expectations by successfully using the time machine or the moon patterns to achieve her goal.

Let me outline the plot. The baker works in a garage with a time machine. She uses pressed flowers (maybe from a specific moon phase) to power it. The shadows speaking indicate that the contagion is spreading. She wants to dethrone the tyrant, so she travels back in time to plant the seeds that will cause the tyrant's downfall. The moon patterns tell her when to act. The story needs to tie all these elements together smoothly.

Start with the setting: a small town under tyranny. The bakery is a cover for the garage where she works on the time machine. The pressed flowers are part of the machine's mechanism. She's cynical but gentle, so maybe she's been trying for a long time without success. The shadows speaking is a sign that the contagion is taking hold, which she needs to stop. She uses the moon's phases to time her journey. When she exceeds the limits of the time machine (maybe by going further back than before), she succeeds in planting the seeds that lead to the tyrant's defeat. The ending could be her returning, seeing the town free, and the shadows now speaking in a positive way, indicating the contagion of hope.

I need to ensure each element is integrated. The pressed flowers could be used as fuel or catalyst for the time machine. The moon patterns are tracked to determine when the machine can be used effectively. The timeframe when shadows speak is the critical moment when the contagion is active, so she must act then. The motivation is clear—overthrow the tyrant. The tone stays mystical with elements like talking shadows and time travel.

Now, structuring the sentences to hit the word count. Each sentence followed by word count. Let me draft the first few sentences and check the word count as I go. Make sure the story flows logically and all elements are included without forcing them. Also, the character's cynically gentle nature should come through in her actions and dialogue (if any). Since it's a short story, dialogue might be minimal, so show her traits through her thoughts or actions.

Wait, the user said to output the precise total word count after each sentence. So every time I write a sentence, I need to count the words so far and put it in <words></words> tags. I need to be careful with that. Also, the total must be between 500-600 words. Let me start writing and track the count.

First sentence: "Mara dusted flour from her apron, her fingers brushing a faded tattoo of pressed flowers on her wrist—a relic from her grandmother’s garden." Let's count the words here. The sentence has 24 words. Then <words>24</words>.

Second sentence: The emergency time machine garage hummed beneath the bakery, its gears synced to lunar phases. (18 words, total 42)

Third: Shadows pooled in the corners, whispering secrets she’d once dismissed as hallucinations. (14, total 56)

Fourth: Now they hissed coordinates, urging her to exceed the machine’s limits. (13, total 69)

Fifth: "To dethrone him, you must plant seeds where they’ll rot," the shadows croaked. (12, 81)

Continuing like this, making sure each element is included. The tyrant's dethroning is the motivation. The moon patterns are tracked to use the machine. The pressed flowers are part of her heritage. The garage is the setting. The shadows speaking are the timeframe indicator. The seeds of contagion are the means to overthrow. Her cynicism and gentleness—maybe she's skeptical but caring, so she hesitates but acts for the town.

I need to ensure that the seeds of contagion are part of her plan. Perhaps the seeds are planted in the past to cause a rebellion. The contagion could be a disease that weakens the tyrant's control, but she wants it to be a positive contagion of hope instead. The method of tracking the moon ensures the right time to activate the machine.

Let me outline the plot points:

1. Introduce Mara in her bakery/garage, working on the time machine.
2. Shadows start speaking, indicating the time is now.
3. She recalls her grandmother's advice with the pressed flowers.
4. She uses the moon's position to activate the machine.
5. She travels back, plants seeds (maybe in a key location).
6. The seeds grow into something that undermines the tyrant.
7. Returns to present, sees the town free, shadows now positive.

Each step needs to include the elements. The pressed flowers might be part of the machine's power source. The action of exceeding could be going further back in time than before. The motivation is clear throughout.

Now, writing the story step by step, ensuring each sentence adds to the plot and integrates elements. Let me proceed sentence by sentence, counting words each time.

She paused, the cynically gentle edge of her laugh softening the threat. “And what if I fail?” <words>97</words>  
The shadows coiled like serpents, forming her grandmother’s voice: “The tyrant’s power feeds on doubt. Burn it with truth.” <words>120</words>  
Mara’s hands trembled as she fed pressed petals into the machine’s core—the last of her grandmother’s garden. <words>140</words>  
The moon hung gibbous, its light a silver key. She tracked its arc, heart drumming to the rhythm of rebellion. <words>163</words>  

At the zenith, the garage door groaned open. The air tasted of ozone and impending storm. <words>181</words>  
She climbed into the cockpit, clutching a vial of seeds. Each held a memory: her brother’s laughter, the town square’s laughter, the tyrant’s first lie. <words>209</words>  
The machine whined, time fracturing like sugar glass. Mara punched in coordinates: the tyrant’s childhood home, the night he’d first clenched his fist around a weapon. <words>241</words>  
The shadows screamed, but she plunged forward, seeds clenched like a prayer. <words>259</words>  

She landed in a moonlit orchard, the tyrant a boy of ten, burying a dagger under an apple tree. Mara’s breath caught. This was the seedbed—the moment his soul turned to rot. <words>293</words>  
She scattered her vial’s contents, petals and seeds sinking into the soil. The earth shuddered, roots twisting like veins. <words>314</words>  
The boy flinched as the tree’s shadow reached toward him, whispering truths he couldn’t name. Mara smiled, gentle but unyielding. <words>340</words>

Mara’s hands, still flour-dusted, trembled not with fear but awe. The seeds had exceeded her hope. <words>428</words>  
She stepped into the dawn, the town’s laughter rising like bread from an oven. The tyrant’s name was a forgotten recipe. <words>455</words>  
Behind her, the garage faded, its gears silent. The moon watched, its patterns now a lullaby for the newly free. <words>481</words>  
Mara pressed a fresh flower to her wrist—a promise not to let roots grow bitter. The shadows, ever kind, hummed approval. <words>508</words>
