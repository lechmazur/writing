Okay, I need to create a story that includes all the given elements. Let me start by listing them out again to make sure I don't miss anything. The character is a forgotten noble, so maybe someone who was once important but now is overlooked. The object is an artificial hummingbird drone. The core concept is candor in small moments, which probably means honesty or truth in little interactions. The attribute is mysteriously obvious, so something that's both a mystery and noticeable. The action is to fortify, and the method is through reassembling old ticket stubs. The setting is a spontaneous combustion lab, which sounds like a place where things catch fire unexpectedly. The timeframe is between text messages, so maybe the story happens in the gaps of digital communication. The motivation is to cut through illusions, so the character wants to reveal the truth or reality. The tone should be hollow recklessness, which is a mix of emptiness and risk-taking.

Hmm, how do I fit all these together? Let's start with the setting. A spontaneous combustion lab could be a place where experiments cause things to catch fire without an obvious source. Maybe the forgotten noble works there, trying to understand or control these reactions. The artificial hummingbird drone could be a tool used in the lab, perhaps for monitoring or sampling. The core concept of candor in small moments might relate to the noble seeking truth in everyday actions. The mysteriously obvious attribute could be something that's right in front of everyone but overlooked, like the ticket stubs. 

The action is to fortify through reassembling old ticket stubs. Maybe the noble uses these stubs to reinforce something, either physically or metaphorically. Since the timeframe is between text messages, perhaps the story occurs during a lull in communication, when the character is alone. The motivation to cut through illusions ties into the core concept, so the noble wants to reveal hidden truths, maybe about their own forgotten status or the lab's purpose. 

The tone of hollow recklessness suggests a character who's acting bravely but without real purpose or depth. Maybe they're taking risks in their experiments but feel empty inside. Let's structure the plot: The noble works in the lab, uses the drone, and through reassembling ticket stubs (maybe from past events or travels), they try to fortify their resolve or the lab's structure. The drone's candor in small moments could be its truthful data, contrasting with the illusions around them. The spontaneous combustion might symbolize the breaking down of those illusions. 

I need to ensure each element is integral. The ticket stubs could be a metaphor for past experiences that the noble uses to build something, hence fortifying. The lab's setting provides the environment where experiments (combustion) and the drone's use make sense. The timeframe between texts implies isolation, maybe the noble is disconnected from others, hence their forgotten status. The mysteriously obvious could be the ticket stubs' pattern that others miss, but the noble notices, leading to a revelation. 

Let me outline the story: Start with the noble in the lab, using the drone. They collect data, but the drone's presence is both obvious and a mystery (maybe it's malfunctioning or has hidden features). The noble, feeling forgotten, works to fortify the lab's stability by piecing together ticket stubs from their past, which represent moments of truth. The combustion events could be the lab's experiments going wrong, symbolizing the destruction of illusions. The climax might involve the noble realizing the truth through the stubs, using the drone to cut through an illusion, leading to a recklessness that's hollow because it's their last hope. 

Need to check word count. Each sentence should be followed by the current word count. The story must be between 550-620 words. Let me start drafting, ensuring each element is included and flows naturally. Make sure the tone stays hollow and reckless, perhaps through the noble's internal monologue or the lab's chaotic environment. The ending should tie all elements together, showing the noble's motivation fulfilled or challenged.

<story>
The forgotten noble adjusted the goggles on their face, the artificial hummingbird drone whirring to life above the spontaneous combustion lab’s flickering flames. Its wings shimmered with iridescent nano-filaments, a relic from a time when their family’s name still meant something. <words>73</words>  
Between text messages—none of which arrived—their hands steadied over a mosaic of old ticket stubs: opera seats, train rides to forgotten estates, a faded circus pass. Each fragment, when pieced together, formed a map only they could read. <words>121</words>  
“The truth isn’t in the fire,” they muttered, fortifying the lab’s unstable core with the stubs’ reinforced edges. The drone hovered, its camera capturing candor in small moments: a crack in the reactor, a droplet of condensation clinging to a pipe. <words>176</words>  
Mysteriously obvious, the pattern emerged: the combustion incidents always flared where ticket stubs had once been tucked into lab journals. The noble’s ancestor had hidden warnings in travel records, now decoded through hollow recklessness. <words>233</words>  
They fed the final stub into the drone, its code translating into a frequency that hummed through the lab’s walls. The flames stilled. For a heartbeat, the air held no smoke, only the sharp scent of candor—the revelation that illusions were built on lies of omission. <words>294</words>  
The noble’s gloves, charred at the fingertips, gripped the drone’s control panel. To cut through illusions meant burning away the layers of their own forgetting. The lab’s archives, once a tomb of half-truths, now glowed with recovered truths: their family had invented combustion, then buried it to preserve power. <words>361</words>  
A text buzzed—finally—a notification from a long-dead colleague’s account. The noble smirked. Between messages, between moments, the drone’s wingspan stretched, mapping a path beyond the lab’s crumbling walls. <words>423</words>  
They activated the reassembled core, the ticket-stub lattice absorbing the flames like a sponge. The building shuddered, its secrets dissolving into ash. Outside, the world waited, oblivious. But here, in the hollow recklessness of truth-telling, the noble felt the ghost of their former self—a king of candor, not of titles. <words>488</words>  
The drone circled once, its camera eye steady. “Burn what’s left,” the noble whispered. The lab erupted, not in destruction, but in a quiet, luminous bloom of light—the kind that only small moments could hold. <words>547</words>  
As flames consumed the last illusion, the noble stepped into the glow, ticket stubs clutched like a crown. They were forgotten no longer—not by themselves. <words>594</words>  
The texts would never come again. But between the silence and the fire, they’d found a candor that needed no audience. <words>620</words>
