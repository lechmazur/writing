Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a story that combines all the given elements, with specific formatting. First, I need to make sure I understand each element and how they can fit together. 

The character is an overly curious mortician. Morticians deal with the dead, so maybe they have a fascination with death or the afterlife. The object is a tarnished silver bracelet, which could be a family heirloom or have some mystical properties. The core concept is "the rustle of revelation," suggesting uncovering a secret. The attribute "loudly serene" is a bit contradictory, so maybe the setting or a character has a calm demeanor but is surrounded by loud elements. The action is "imitate," so perhaps the mortician copies something or someone. The method is "through footprints that vanish after a single heartbeat," which sounds like a magical element where tracks disappear quickly. 

Setting is a mangrove labyrinth with singing spirits. That gives a mystical, swamp-like environment with spirits that sing. Timeframe is "when the night yields to golden embers," so dawn with a golden hue. Motivation is to collect dream journals, so the mortician wants these journals for some reason related to their curiosity. Tone is polite anarchy, which might mean a society that's orderly but with underlying chaos or rebelliousness in a respectful way.

Now, integrating all these. The mortician is collecting dream journals, so maybe the singing spirits' dreams are in these journals. The bracelet could be a key to accessing the spirits or the labyrinth. The footprints vanishing could be part of the labyrinth's magic, making it hard to navigate. The "rustle of revelation" might be the moment the mortician discovers something through the bracelet or the journals.

Character development: The mortician's curiosity drives them to enter the labyrinth, risking their life. Their motivation to collect journals could stem from a personal loss or desire to understand death better. The bracelet might have a connection to their family or past. 

Plot structure: Start with the mortician entering the labyrinth, using the bracelet. They follow vanishing footprints, encounter spirits, collect journals, face a revelation. The singing spirits could interact with the mortician, maybe testing them. The climax is the revelation, perhaps about their own mortality or the bracelet's origin.

Worldbuilding: The mangrove labyrinth is alive, with spirits that sing. The setting's atmosphere should feel both serene and chaotic, hence "polite anarchy." The spirits might have rules but also hidden rebellions. The timeframe at dawn with golden embers adds a mystical hour when the boundary between worlds is thin.

Tone: Polite anarchy means interactions are respectful but with underlying tension. The mortician's actions are methodical (collecting journals) but driven by curiosity, which is anarchic in its pursuit.

Need to ensure all elements are used. The bracelet is tarnished, so maybe it's old or has a history. The mortician imitates the spirits' songs or actions to navigate. The footprints vanish quickly, so they have to move swiftly or use the bracelet to follow.

Potential plot points: Mortician enters mangrove at dawn, follows footprints with bracelet, interacts with spirits who sing. They collect journals, but each step's footprint vanishes, adding urgency. The revelation comes when they realize the bracelet is linked to a spirit, or their own death is near. The end could be the mortician gaining insight but changing, or the bracelet's secret revealed.

Check word count. Need to be between 550-620. Each sentence must end with word count. Need to count accurately as I go. Start with the story tag, then each sentence followed by <words>count</words>. Make sure the story flows naturally, all elements are seamlessly integrated, and the tone matches.

The mortician adjusted his gloves, the tarnished silver bracelet clinking against his wrist as he stepped into the mangrove labyrinth. The air hummed with the spirits’ songs, a polite anarchy of harmonies that twisted through the gnarled roots. <words>77</words>  
He carried a satchel of dream journals, their pages fluttering like secrets. His motivation was simple: to collect every last one, for the rustle of revelation waited within. The bracelet, a family heirloom, grew warm in his grip. <words>133</words>  
“Lead me,” he whispered to the shadows, and the footprints began. They materialized in the mud, faint as whispers, but vanished after a single heartbeat. He imitated their rhythm, stepping precisely, though the labyrinth shifted with each breath. <words>190</words>  
A spirit emerged, its voice a chorus of tides. “Why seek what fades at dawn?” it asked, its form shimmering like brine. The mortician smiled, his curiosity sharpening. “To understand the silence after song.” <words>247</words>  
The path narrowed, roots clawing at his coat. The bracelet pulsed, guiding him deeper where the golden embers of night’s end painted the canopy. He passed a journal tucked beneath a fern, its cover etched with footprints. <words>304</words>  
“Careful,” warned another spirit, its laughter like wind through reeds. “Imitation is the mortician’s elegy.” He paused, the bracelet now cold. Had he misstepped? The footprints ahead flickered, uncertain. <words>361</words>  
In a clearing, he found a journal floating midair, its pages alive with the dreams of drowned sailors. As he reached for it, the ground rumbled. The labyrinth itself seemed to breathe, its mangroves swaying in a loudly serene crescendo. <words>418</words>  
The spirits’ song changed—a dirge now, urgent. The bracelet flared, images flooding his mind: a childhood memory of his mother pressing it into his hand, whispering, “Follow the vanishing steps.” He’d thought her mad then. <words>475</words>  
The final journal lay at the labyrinth’s heart, its封印 a map of footprints. As he touched it, the ground split, revealing a mirror of water. His reflection wore the bracelet, but its silver was unmarred, glowing. The rustle of revelation struck—this was his future self, or a ghost. <words>532</words>  
“Imitate me,” the reflection urged. The mortician copied the stance, and the bracelet fused with his skin. The labyrinth stilled; the spirits’ song softened into gratitude. He now held all the journals, but his own story unfolded before him. <words>589</words>  
Dawn’s golden embers faded as he emerged, the bracelet now a scar on his wrist. The dream journals burned in his satchel, their secrets finally his. Yet the labyrinth’s polite anarchy lingered in his pulse, a reminder: some truths vanish like footprints, yet reshape the earth. <words>646</words>
