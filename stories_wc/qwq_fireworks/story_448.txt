Okay, let me tackle this story request. The user wants a story that includes all the given elements, so first, I need to make sure I understand each one and how they can fit together. 

The character is a distrustful mage. That suggests someone who's cautious, maybe paranoid, but also has magical abilities. The object is a brass candlestick—maybe an ordinary item with a hidden magical property? The core concept is unknown histories, so the story should involve uncovering past events or secrets. The attribute "rebelliously docile" is a bit tricky. It might mean someone who appears compliant but has a rebellious streak underneath. 

The action is "jettison," which means to discard or throw out. The method is "via the texture of a seashell," so maybe the seashell's texture is a key to performing the action. The setting is the chimney sweep guild hall, so the story should take place there. The timeframe is when the old sewing machine stops mid-stitch. That seems like a specific moment, maybe a signal or a trigger for an event. The motivation is to build a legacy of innovation, so the character wants to leave a lasting impact through new ideas. The tone is nostalgic innovation—combining a longing for the past with forward-thinking progress.

Alright, putting this together. The distrustful mage is part of the chimney sweep guild. The brass candlestick could be an heirloom or a tool in the guild. The unknown histories might relate to the guild's past or the candlestick's origin. The rebelliously docile attribute could mean the mage follows guild rules but secretly works against them. The action of jettisoning something via a seashell's texture might involve using the seashell to cast a spell that removes (jettisons) something from the past. The sewing machine stopping mid-stitch could be a magical event that triggers the main action. The legacy of innovation would be the mage's goal to change the guild's traditions. The tone needs to balance nostalgia for the guild's history with the innovation they want to introduce.

Starting the story, maybe the mage is in the guild hall, using the candlestick. The sewing machine stopping could be a sign that something is wrong. The mage uses the seashell's texture to perform a spell, which allows them to jettison an old tradition, thus building their legacy. The distrust comes from past betrayals, making them cautious but determined. The seashell might have been a family heirloom, linking to unknown histories. The rebellious docility could be shown through the mage's actions—following guild duties but secretly undermining outdated practices.

I need to ensure all elements are seamlessly integrated. The setting (chimney sweep guild hall) should be described to establish the atmosphere. The timeframe (sewing machine stopping) is a pivotal moment. The brass candlestick is a key object, maybe used in the spell. The seashell's texture is part of the spell's method. The motivation drives the mage's actions, leading to the climax where they jettison something. The tone should have a sense of looking back while pushing forward.

Now, structuring the plot: maybe the mage discovers that the guild's traditions are holding them back. The candlestick has hidden magic from the past. When the sewing machine stops, it's a sign to act. Using the seashell, the mage performs a spell to remove (jettison) an old curse or restriction, allowing innovation. The legacy is built by breaking free from the past. The distrustful nature makes the mage cautious, but the rebellious side drives them to act.

Need to check word count. The story needs to be between 550-620 words. Each sentence should have a word count tag. Let me outline the story step by step, ensuring each element is included and the flow makes sense. Start with setting the scene in the guild hall, introduce the mage, the candlestick, the stopping sewing machine, the seashell's role, the spell, the climax of jettisoning, and the resolution showing the legacy. Make sure each part connects logically and the tone stays consistent.

<story>  
The chimney sweep guild hall hummed with the rhythmic clatter of brushes and the low murmur of apprentices, but the old sewing machine in the corner had gone silent. Its needle frozen mid-stitch, the machine’s abrupt halt sent a shiver through the room. <words>52</words>  

Elara adjusted her soot-stained apron, her fingers brushing the brass candlestick tucked into her belt. A relic from her grandmother, it had once belonged to a guild founder, though its true purpose remained a secret—like most things here. <words>100</words>  

“Another fault in the loom of time,” she muttered, distrust coiling in her chest. The guild elders claimed the machine’s quirks were blessings, but Elara saw only cracks in their brittle legacy. Her rebelliously docile nature kept her quiet during meetings, her magic masked beneath compliance, while her mind plotted revolutions. <words>168</words>  

The seashell in her pocket prickled against her palm. Found months ago in the ash of a chimney, its ridges spiraled in a pattern that matched the candlestick’s etchings. Today, the machine’s stillness felt like an invitation. <words>223</words>  

Elara slipped into the supply closet, the candlestick’s weight familiar yet alien. She traced the seashell’s texture over the brass, and warmth surged—a forgotten spell. The candlestick glowed, projecting a hologram of the guild’s founding: mages and sweeps uniting to clean chimneys with magic, not just brooms. But then the影像 darkened. A figure, cloaked in shadow, jettisoned a scroll into the flames—a forbidden history of innovation buried to preserve tradition. <words>302</words>  

Her grandmother’s face flickered in the light. “The past is a anchor,” she’d said. “Sometimes, you must throw it overboard.” Elara’s throat tightened. The elders had rewritten their story, stifling progress. Now the machine’s stoppage was a plea to reclaim what was lost. <words>369</words>  

She returned to the sewing machine, the candlestick’s glow illuminating its guts: gears fused with enchanted thread. The seashell’s spiral aligned with a rusted cog. With a breath, she pressed it into place. The machine shuddered, then whirred to life, stitching not cloth but light—a shimmering thread that arced toward the hearth. <words>442</words>  

“Legacy isn’t built on dust,” Elara whispered, channeling magic through the candlestick. The seashell’s pattern pulsed, severing the guild’s tether to stagnation. The hearth flared, and the scroll from the vision erupted from the flames, intact. Its pages detailed spells to clean entire cities in an hour, not decades. <words>511</words>  

The apprentices gathered, their whispers shifting from awe to resolve. Elara’s eyes stung—not from soot, but pride. She’d jettisoned the elders’ dogma, not with rebellion, but by resurrecting their own forgotten courage. The sewing machine’s thread now wove a new tapestry, its stitches glowing like constellations. <words>578</words>  

As dawn crept through the guild hall windows, Elara placed the candlestick beside the machine. Its brass gleamed, no longer a relic but a catalyst. The elders would rage, but the sweeps would remember: innovation thrived where distrust and docility collided, where the past was not a cage, but a compass. <words>620</words>
