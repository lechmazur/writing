Okay, I need to create a story that includes all the elements provided. Let me start by listing them out again to make sure I don't miss any.

Character: shaky mercenary. So the main character is a mercenary who is "shaky," maybe physically unsteady or mentally unstable. Their attribute is "carefully reckless," meaning they take risks but in a calculated way.

Object: a chunk of amber with a trapped spider. This needs to be central to the plot. Maybe the mercenary is searching for this amber, or it's a clue in their quest.

Core Concept: searching for the unknown. The story should revolve around seeking something not known, which ties into the mercenary's motivation.

Action: finalize. The mercenary needs to finalize something, perhaps their mission or a decision related to their past.

Method: through improbable rumor chains. The mercenary follows rumors that are unlikely but lead them to the amber.

Setting: collapsed cathedral turned street artist’s haven. The location is a ruined cathedral now used by artists, which adds an interesting contrast between decay and creativity.

Timeframe: during the slow fade of an echoing hour. This suggests a quiet, lingering moment, maybe dusk or a time when echoes linger, affecting the atmosphere.

Motivation: to make peace with the past. The mercenary's drive is internal, seeking closure.

Tone: improbable longing. The story should have a bittersweet or wistful feel, with a sense of seeking something unattainable or distant.

Now, how to integrate all these elements cohesively. Let's start with the setting. The collapsed cathedral as an art haven gives a vivid backdrop. The mercenary arrives there, perhaps drawn by rumors (method) about the amber. The amber with a spider could be a metaphor for being trapped in the past, linking to the motivation. 

The shaky aspect of the mercenary could be from past trauma, making their carefully reckless nature a way to cope. Their journey to find the amber is part of their quest to finalize something—maybe ending a past mission or resolving guilt.

The timeframe during the "slow fade of an echoing hour" can set a reflective mood, with echoes symbolizing memories. The improbable rumors lead them through the artists' haven, where they interact with locals who provide clues. The spider in amber might represent the frozen moment they're trying to escape from their past.

I need to ensure each element is tied into the narrative. The mercenary's careful recklessness drives their actions, like taking risks to follow rumors but being cautious. The setting's artists could have murals or art that reference the amber or past events. The climax might involve finding the amber, leading to a realization that allows them to make peace.

Word count is crucial. The story needs to be between 550-620 words. Each sentence must add to the word count, so I'll have to track that. Let me outline the structure:

1. Introduce the setting and the mercenary arriving at the cathedral.
2. Describe the cathedral's current state as an art haven.
3. Show the mercenary's shaky nature, maybe physical tremors or hesitation.
4. Introduce the rumor chain leading them there, perhaps through a street artist.
5. The mercenary's motivation to find the amber to confront past.
6. The search process, interactions with artists, following clues.
7. Climax: finding the amber, realization or emotional resolution.
8. Finalize their mission, making peace, and the echoing hour ends.

Now, ensuring each element is present. The amber must be central. Maybe the spider is a symbol of their trapped past. The finalization could be letting go of the past by leaving the amber, or keeping it as a reminder. The tone should have that longing, perhaps a mix of hope and melancholy.

I need to make sure every sentence adds to the story without redundancy. Let me start drafting, keeping track of the word count after each sentence.

<story>
The collapsed cathedral’s ribs clawed at the sky, its shattered arches draped in murals of neon saints and glitching dragons. A shaky mercenary named Kael leaned against a pillar, his hands trembling as he lit a cigarette. The slow fade of an echoing hour draped the ruins in violet shadows, each drag punctuating his resolve. He’d followed rumors like cobwebs across three cities—whispers of a chunk of amber, a spider frozen mid-kill, buried beneath the rubble. The relic was said to trap time itself, or maybe just those who sought it. Kael didn’t care. He needed to finalize what he’d started years ago.

The cathedral’s new inhabitants—street artists with spray cans and haunted eyes—watched him from scaffolds. One, a girl with bioluminescent tattoos, tossed him a granola bar. “You’re here for the amber, right?” she said, her voice echoing. “Old Vasko’s been muttering about it. Says it’s in the crypt, but you’ll need a key only rumors hold.” Kael nodded, the bar’s crunch loud in the silence. His recklessness was deliberate: trust the unstable, because stability was a lie.

He descended into the crypt, flashlight beam slicing the gloom. The air smelled of wet stone and regret. Vasko, a hunched figure with a face like cracked clay, emerged from a mural of a weeping city. “You reek of endings,” he croaked. “The amber’s a trap, not a treasure. That spider? It’s your kind’s totem—mercenaries who vanish like ghosts.” Kael’s pulse quickened. The old man gestured to a fissure in the wall, where a shard of amber glinted, the spider’s eight eyes reflecting centuries. “Take it, but know this: its time is yours to keep.”

Kael pried the amber free, its weight cold and alive. A memory surfaced—a mission gone wrong, a team lost, his own hands shaking then as now. The relic hummed, threading his past into the present. Finalize, he told himself. Make peace. But the spider seemed to scuttle under his skin, its web sticky with guilt. He pocketed the amber and climbed, the artists’ eyes following like searchlights.

At the cathedral’s edge, he met a boy sketching the ruins. “They say the amber shows your worst regret,” the boy murmured. Kael hesitated, then held it up. The spider’s body warped, revealing a flash: his squad’s last breath, his own voice screaming *run*. Tears streaked his face—not weakness, but reckoning. He hurled the amber into a mural of a fractured hourglass, watching it shatter. The spider dissolved, time’s echo fading with it.

The artists stared as Kael lit another cigarette, his hands still but his mind lighter. Finalized. Vasko’s laugh rumbled like a ghost: “You didn’t need the amber. You needed the choice.” The echoing hour ended, sunlight spilling through broken windows. Kael walked away, the cathedral’s art now glowing gold—a new story, not a tomb.
