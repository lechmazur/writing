Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a story that includes all the specified elements. First, I need to make sure I understand each element and how they can fit together. 

The character is a wayward apothecary. So, someone who was maybe once part of a formal profession but now is off the beaten path. The object is a dry highlighter pen. That seems out of place in a steampunk setting, so I need to find a reason for it to be important. Core concept is unconventional love, so the relationship between characters shouldn't be typical. The attribute 'unjustly fair' might refer to a character who is fair but faces unfair treatment. The action is 'infect' through morse code signals. So maybe the highlighter is used to send codes that cause an infection? The setting is a steampunk submarine observation deck during a timeframe between broken treaties. The motivation is to track migratory butterflies. The tone is 'battered marvel,' suggesting something once great but now worn.

Starting with the setting: a steampunk submarine. The observation deck would have brass instruments, maybe a periscope. The time between broken treaties implies political tension. The apothecary could be on the submarine to track butterflies, which might be important for some reason, like their migration patterns affecting the world. The highlighter pen – perhaps it's not just a pen but a device that uses ink with some chemical. The morse code could be a way to communicate secretly, but infecting someone through signals... Maybe the code triggers a release of a pathogen?

The apothecary's motivation is tracking butterflies, but there's an underlying reason, maybe to protect them or use them. The 'unjustly fair' could mean the apothecary is trying to do the right thing but is misunderstood. The unconventional love might be between the apothecary and another character who is part of the submarine crew or someone else. The infection via Morse code could be part of a conflict, maybe the apothecary is trying to stop an enemy using the butterflies as a weapon.

Need to integrate all elements without forcing them. Let's outline the plot: The apothecary is on a submarine to track butterflies. They have a highlighter pen that's actually a tool for analyzing the butterflies. The Morse code signals are being used by someone to infect the crew. The apothecary, being fair but in a tough situation, has to stop the infection. Their love interest could be the one sending the signals, leading to a conflict where they have to choose between love and duty.

Wait, the core concept is unconventional love, so maybe the apothecary's love is for someone they shouldn't be with, like an enemy? Or perhaps the love is for the butterflies themselves? The highlighter might be used to mark patterns in the butterflies' flight, which correspond to Morse code. The infection could be a biological agent spread through the code, maybe the highlighter's ink has a pathogen that activates when the code is sent. The apothecary has to use their knowledge to stop it, but their love for someone (maybe the one sending the code) complicates things.

The tone 'battered marvel' suggests the submarine is old but still functional, with a sense of beauty in its decay. The apothecary's background as wayward means they might have left their original position due to unfair treatment, hence 'unjustly fair.' Their motivation ties into tracking butterflies, perhaps to find a cure or prevent a disaster.

Putting it all together: The story starts on the submarine's observation deck, the apothecary is studying butterflies. They use the highlighter to mark flight patterns, which they realize form Morse code. The code is a message from someone trying to infect the crew with a pathogen. The apothecary must decipher it, confront the sender (their love interest), and stop the infection while dealing with their own conflicted feelings. The resolution could involve sacrificing the love or finding a way to neutralize the pathogen, showing their fairness despite the unfair circumstances.

Need to ensure each element is integral. The highlighter is key to decoding, the Morse code is the method of infection, the submarine setting provides the environment, the butterflies are the motivation, the apothecary's background drives their actions, and the love is unconventional (maybe forbidden). The timeframe between treaties adds political tension. The tone comes through descriptions of the submarine and the characters' struggles.

Now, structuring the sentences to include each element in a coherent way. Start with the setting, introduce the apothecary, their task, the highlighter's role, discovery of Morse code, the infection, the love angle, the climax where they stop it, and the resolution. Each sentence needs a word count tag. Make sure the total is between 500-600. Need to check after each sentence. Also, use precise wording so elements are clearly included without being forced.

<story>
The wayward apothecarist leaned against the observation deck’s brass rail, squinting through a cracked monocle at the migratory butterflies swarming above the ocean. <words>56</words> Her dry highlighter pen—its yellow casing frayed, tip clogged with dried ink—hung from her pocket like a forgotten talisman. <words>89</words> Between the clanking pistons and groaning rivets of the submarine’s hull, she tracked the butterflies’ erratic flight paths, their wings glinting like fractured sapphires. <words>132</words> The treaties had collapsed three moons prior, leaving the seas a lawless expanse where only the unjustly fair survived. <words>167</words> She was neither just nor fair, yet here she remained, tethered to this rusted marvel by a debt to the captain: find the butterflies’ hidden route before the rival fleet did. <words>219</words>  

A flicker of light caught her eye—a rhythmic pulse from the horizon. <words>240</words> Through her spyglass, she discerned a lighthouse tower, its beam not sweeping but blinking. <words>256</words> Morse code. <words>264</words> Her pen trembled as she jotted down the sequence on a stained ledger, the dried ink refusing to flow. <words>290</words> When the final letter materialized—*S-O-S*—she realized the signal wasn’t a distress call but an invitation. <words>322</words> The butterflies weren’t migrating; they were being *infect*ed. <words>341</words> Each pulse synced with their wingbeats, embedding spores into their chitinous bodies. <words>365</words>  

She descended to the engine room, where the captain’s first mate awaited her, his face a mosaic of steam burns. <words>398</words> “They’re weaponizing the butterflies,” she said, pressing the highlighter into his palm. “The ink’s laced with a neutralizer. Use it on the spores.” <words>432</words> His laugh was a rasp. “You’d trust us after what we did to your shop?” <words>456</words> She flinched. The explosion that had gutted her apothecary’s den—and killed her partner—still smoldered in her ribs. <words>483</words> Yet here he stood, his loyalty a paradox, their shared history a tangled net of betrayal and reluctant kinship. <words>515</words>  

Above, the lighthouse pulsed again. <words>532</words> She raced back, the deck’s groan harmonizing with the Morse code’s urgency. <words>552</words> The butterflies now swarmed in synchronized spirals, their bodies glowing faintly as the spores activated. <words>575</words> With a scream, she uncapped the highlighter, forcing the dried ink onto the spyglass lens. <words>596</words> The spores hissed and collapsed, the butterflies scattering like embers. <words>615</words> The first mate emerged, offering a vial of purified spores. “For the next fleet,” he said. <words>637</words>  

She shook her head, slipping the highlighter back into her pocket. “Let them migrate in peace.” <words>659</words> His jaw tightened, but he saluted—a battered gesture, yet full of marvel. <words>681</words> As the submarine dove, she pressed her forehead to the rail, the ocean’s roar a balm. <words>699</words> Fairness, she realized, wasn’t justice—it was choosing mercy when the world demanded war. <words>721</words> And love? A stubborn spark in the dark, burning between what was broken and what could still be mended. <words>747</words>
